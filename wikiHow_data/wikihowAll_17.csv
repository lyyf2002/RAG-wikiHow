Keep the lights on.,
Be prepared for slumps.,
Avoid doing activities that require heavy concentration.,
Get some recovery sleep.,
Maintain your strategic caffeine schedule.,
Keep your day clear.,
Stick to your regular schedule.",How to Stay Up For Three Days Straight," You'll want to bank a little bit of sleep beforehand, so don't be afraid to go to bed a little earlier or sleep in a bit in the days leading up to your time up., You'll be taking in plenty of caffeine as the days go by. If you use too much in the days leading up to your time, you'll build up a tolerance. You'll need to get even more to feel the effects., You probably already have a good reason for staying up three days, so that will help. In the meantime, look for other activities that can help fill the time. The more your brain is engaged with something, even something like reading or watching television, the more likely you will be able to stay awake.

, Regular food and drink can help keep you going during the day. Look for healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, along with caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea. You don't want to be caught running out of coffee during your three days.

, Sometimes it can be helpful to have someone there to talk and work with you. Alternatively, people will know you are trying to stay up, and hopefully will stay away and let you work., Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for a reason, and eating a good one can get you off to a strong start on your quest to stay up for 3 days. Make sure your breakfast has healthy foods like protein, whole grains, and maybe some fruit. Sugary cereals and large amounts of caffeine will only lead to a quick crash.


Do your best to keep to a regular schedule, which includes breakfast in the morning for each of your three days. This will help keep you on track for unavoidable regular parts of your day like going to work or class. Staying on schedule like this can also make it easier to get back to a regular schedule after finishing.

, You don't want to be mainlining espressos, but having regular caffeine breaks spaced throughout the day can keep you awake and alert. The recommended amount of caffeine for a single day is 400 milligrams, and one cup of coffee usually contains around 100 milligrams, so plan accordingly.


Wait for your first cup when you first wake up. You will be naturally groggy for the first 20 to 30 minutes after waking up, but some movement or a quick shower should be enough to move past it. Wait for your first cup until the middle of the day, or early afternoon, when you'll probably experience your first slump.
You may need to ramp up your intake as you get into the second and third day. By the end, you could be at a dose every 2-3 hours (which will get you well over 400 milligrams per day pretty quickly). That's fine, but make sure your portions remain at 100-150 milligrams. This will prevent you from overdosing on the caffeine, and avoiding the crash by taking too much.This only works if you have a fairly normal caffeine intake in your daily life. If you are already consuming a lot of caffeine, the effects will be diminished, which will make it harder for you to use it to stay awake.

, Heavy meals will make you sluggish, and more likely to nod off, or relax enough to fall asleep. Whole grains, lean protein, and vegetables will keep you awake and energetic for several hours. Just keep your portions small.

, Exercising and motion will help keep your brain moving and awake. Even if you are trying to finish an assignment for class or work, taking short breaks (maybe 10 minutes) to get up and walk around will help keep you on track to stay up. If you're looking for something a little more intense than a short walk, some sit-ups or pushups at your desk should do the trick as well. This doesn't need to be a full workout, just some movement to get the blood going and your energy back up.At first, you'll want to exercise when you start to feel tired. As the days go by, try forcing yourself to take 10 minute workout breaks every half hour.

, Your body is well tuned to respond to light, so keeping the lights on and your setting bright is a good way to trick your body into thinking it is daytime and you should be awake.Natural light is better, so keep curtains open during the day if you can, and maybe even go outside.

, Your body will not function at full capacity all day long, and there will be moments where your body will relax and you will want to go to sleep. If you start to feel these coming on, be prepared to combat them quickly with caffeine, cold air, or a shower to jolt you out of it. The effect won't last forever, but it can help if you start to slip, and get you back into a good working groove.Your body will probably give you periods of higher energy around mid-morning (about 10:00 am) and early evening (6:00-7:00 pm). Save your most important tasks for these times. That way, if you start to feel slumps in the rest of your time awake, you'll be more willing to take a break for a shower or to make more coffee.

, During your time awake, you will experience periods called microsleep. This basically involves you sleeping for several seconds at a time, best described as ""zoning out."" While you may be able to operate during that time, it can be very dangerous to do things like driving or operating machinery that could put you in physical harm. You can't really plan when this microsleep takes place, so avoid doing activities that are potentially dangerous if you are not paying full attention., Once you made it all the way to the end of your three days, you'll want to get some of that back. While there will definitely be some side effects to your having been awake for so long, a couple of days of regular sleep will get you back to normal.You can take a short (15-20 minute) nap or two during the day if you start to feel groggy. Just be careful not to let them last, or else you'll throw off your schedule.

, Binging on caffeine to stay awake through the day will only set you up for a crash, and ruin your regular schedule., While you may not be able to avoid doing other work, it's best to limit what is next. You'll be groggy, and not at your best, so you should try to avoid doing something important afterward., Depending on when your three days are over, try to push through to your normal sleep time. This will help get your body back into a regular rhythm."

Find a place to lie down or sit in a relaxed posture.,
Use a pillow.,
Cover up with a jacket as a blanket.,
Use a small piece of fabric or a hat to cover your eyes.,
Secure your belongings if you are in a public place.",How to Sleep Without Using a Bed1," It can be hard to get comfortable to sleep when you don't have a bed to lie down in (at the airport, for instance). Sometimes there is simply no feasible place to lie down, so you may have to opt for a chair or sitting against a wall. If possible recline at a 135-degree angle for the most comfort. Avoid sleeping sitting straight up or leaning forward because this may cause undue pressure on your back and neck and it may also contribute to pain in those areas., A pillow helps make any unusual sleeping situation better. A travel pillow is best if you have to sit up while sleeping, such as on an airplane. If you're in an airport without a pillow, it might be time to splurge on a pillow at one of the travel shops.If you don't have a pillow, you can make one out of any clothing you have., Often, on short trips, or during unexpected waits (such as in an emergency room), you may not have thought to bring a blanket. If you have a jacket or coat, you can put it over you to provide extra heat. This will help you stay warm while trying to sleep., Or better yet, use a sleep mask. However, if you are caught unexpectedly needing to sleep without a bed, the likelihood is that you won't have a sleep mask on you. Don't worry, any lightweight, opaque fabric big enough to cover the eyes can help. This method works best if you are lying down or reclining. However, if you must sit, you may need to find something to drape over your head and face, such as a towel, that won't slide down., If you really want to be able to sleep in a public place, you'll need to secure your belongings. Make sure small valuables are in pockets, or covered in your lap. For larger belongings, such as a duffle bag or suitcase, you may try keeping one foot down in the strap, or placing the luggage between your feet if it isn't too big. If you can plan ahead of time, you can put locks on the luggage. If you are lying down, you may want to use it as a pillow.Sometimes, airports have storage lockers you can use. If you are really worried about your belongings, consider this option when available.Never sleep in an area where you do not feel safe, especially if you are alone.

Sleep on a couch.,
Sleep in a recliner.,
Sleep on the floor.,
Make sure you have any necessary pillows or blankets.",How to Sleep Without Using a Bed2," If there is a couch available, this will often be the most comfortable option after a bed, as you will be able to stretch out. You'll want to make sure you have enough room to sleep comfortably, and you'll want to make sure your head isn't resting at an odd angle because of the couch's arm rests., Recline at a 135-degree angle. Anywhere from 135 to 150 is highly recommended for easing back pain. Reclining at 135 degrees is also great for work, as it reduces stress on your back.Reclining 135 degrees is halfway between 90 degrees (sitting straight up) and 180 degrees (lying flat). >

, If the floor is carpeted, this can already be a cushy solution, especially if the couch isn't comfortable and there are no recliners. If not, try layering blankets to make the floor as comfy as possible. If you know beforehand that you'll be sleeping on the floor, bring your sleeping bag. Also, if the couch isn't quite comfortable because of armrests, you can try taking the cushions off the couch to make a makeshift bed., Just because you’re sleeping in a recliner or on the couch doesn’t mean you can’t have your favorite pillow or blanket to keep you comfortable. Depending on the recliner you may need additional cushion for neck and back support. If you plan to sleep in the recliner all night, having a blanket can make it feel more restful.

Use a sleeping bag.,
Remove sticks and other debris from the campsite.,
Provide cushioning or a cot for your sleeping bag.,
Don't forget a pillow.",How to Sleep Without Using a Bed3," A sleeping bag is one of the best way to ensure you get the rest you need while camping. However there are some things to consider when choosing a sleeping bag, including the climate and forecast of the area where you're camping, whether you're hot- or cold-natured, and the amount of padding or waterproofing it provides. You don't want to be camping in a really cold or wet area without a sufficient sleeping bag.If you're planning a winter camping trip in a cold climate, make sure your sleeping bag is rated for the degree range you're going to be facing (-40 degrees, for instance). Some sleeping bags are rated for a lower temp than they'll actually stand up to, so it's best to choose a sleeping bag with a rating of at least 10 degrees below what you'll be facing.If you're camping in a really wet or rainy place, you'll want to make sure your sleeping bag and tent are waterproof, not just water-resistant. Water-resistant materials only keep out the water to a certain point. Waterproof materials should keep you dry.
A sleeping bag with hydrophobic down is the best at keeping you warm in wet conditions.The ""mummy-style"" sleeping bag, or a sleeping bag that tapers at the end, is the best choice for staying warm, as it isn't as spacious as a rectangular sleeping bag, and thus is easier to keep warm with body heat.

, Sticks and stones can make for a very unpleasant sleep when camping. You'll want to go over the area carefully, and remove all debris. Even the tiniest twig or pebble can disturb some people's sleep. You may want to choose an area that is layered in pine needles for extra cushion., Cushioning such as sleeping mats or a cot can help you get good rest, as it will keep you from having to lie directly on the cold, hard ground. Sleeping platforms such as inflatable pads or foam pads often provide the support you need., Using a pillow will help to keep your upper body in alignment when you are sleeping, and it may also help to prevent pain in your neck and back from undue pressure.A pillow will also help your sleeping bag feel closer to home and provide cushion and support for your neck and head while you sleep. With all the logistics that sometimes go into camping, it can be easy to forget your pillow, but if you want a good night's rest while camping, you'll have it on hand.If you do forget your pillow, try rolling up some clothing or other soft materials to use as a pillow."

Choose a hammock that does not have spreader bars.,
Avoid hammocks made of interlaced rope.,
Choose a hammock based on your weight and height.,
Hang the hammock from two points that are the same height.,
Let the hammock hang loosely.,
Inspect the hammock before you get into it.,
Lie in the middle of the hammock and shift your legs to one side until you are lying flat.",How to Sleep Without Using a Bed4," Spreader bars make a hammock less stable and more likely to flip. A good hammock shouldn’t flip with you inside it. There are plenty of sturdier and more comfortable options available including nylon hammocks., Although this is traditional idea of a hammock, it is not very comfortable. As with any rope, it can chafe the skin. The longer you stay in a rope hammock, the less comfortable it will be., You should choose a hammock that is four foot longer than your height. As for your weight, you should check the label to see what a hammock’s weight limits are. Using a hammock whose weight limit is less than your weight will make the hammock more likely to rip., You need two sturdy points from which to hang the hammock. This can be two trees, two sturdy posts (that are correctly anchored), or a hammock stand. Keeping the hammock hang points even will make the hammock more comfortable, and you won’t find yourself in an awkward position when you get in., Don’t pull it tight. When you pull the hammock tight, it can be confining and uncomfortable. Letting it hang loose will make it more comfortable for sleeping.If it is too loose, you’ll know, as it will hit the ground when you’re lying in it., Make sure that the hammock is securely attached to sturdy supports and that it is not frayed or damaged in any way. Try pressing down on the hammock a few times to see if it feels sturdy before you get into it.

, Once you are at this angle, you should be able to rest easy for hours. This move will help you lay across the curve of the hammock rather than in it. This is the opposite of what happens when you pull the hammock too tight."
"
Try sleeping on the floor a few days before making up your mind about it.,
Use a yoga mat or other thing cushion between you and floor.,
Sleep on your back.",How to Sleep Without Using a Bed5," If you want to sleep on the floor as a lifestyle choice, then you might want to try it out a few times first. It takes time for your body to adjust to the new position and the absence of a soft mattress. You may be uncomfortable for the first few days, but after that you should get used to it. You may even wake up feeling refreshed once you’re in the routine of sleeping on the floor.In some cases, sleeping on the floor might be a necessity, such as if you do not have a bed.

, In the beginning especially, you may want some type of cushion to help you transition from the bed to the floor. A yoga mat is great for this because it is already designed for you to lay down on at length and provides a slight cushion between you and the floor.You can also provide some cushioning for yourself by placing a few doubled up blankets on the floor.

, While you might have another preferred sleeping position when in bed, the best position for the floor is on your back. Otherwise, you won’t get the benefit of the back support the floor provides. Sleeping on your side while on the floor may cause back pain."
"
Start by sleeping against a surface at a slight angle.,
Use padding at first.,
Make sure you have lower back support.,
Use neck support.,
Avoid sleeping upright if you can’t get enough sleep doing it.,
Be careful of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT).",How to Sleep Without Using a Bed6," The angle should be slightly less than 90 degrees (70 is fine) to help you transition to sleeping fully upright. You can attain this angle by placing a board against the wall and stabilizing it or with a foam wedge (like those used in yoga or to raise the angle of your bed). The angle should be almost upright to get the closest to actually sleeping upright., When beginning to sleep upright, padding can ease the transition. This can be as simple as pillows and blankets. You can also use an extra-thick yoga mat and a pillow., You can use additional cushions or other back aids for this purpose. You need lower back support to sleep upright comfortably. It defeats the purpose of sleeping upright (to sleep with good posture) to avoid back support (until you can sleep upright without any support)., A J-pillow or a neck pillow will help your neck stay upright when you’re first learning to sleep upright. Without proper neck support you may find yourself dealing with severe neck pain when you wake up or a crick in your neck. Just make sure to keep your neck from slouching or leaning too much to one side., More important than trying out a new position is making sure you’re getting enough rest. There are severe long-term health risks associated with not getting enough quality sleep. If sleeping upright just doesn’t seem to work after a few days, go back to your previous method of sleeping., Although sleeping upright can be a rewarding experience for some, there are some risks involved, especially if you sleep for a long time with your legs bent. DVT is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. It is the formation of a blood clot in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually the legs. Sitting still for long periods of time is a risk factor for DVT. You can prevent a DVT by stretching legs and shifting positions every few hours."

Relax before bed.,
Don’t eat a meal just before bed.,
Drink something soothing, not stimulating.,
Avoid late night TV and video games.,
Create the right environment.","How to Sleep Peacefully, and Have Good Dreams at the Same Time1"," If you have a hard time getting to sleep, you should take some steps to help you relax and prepare for bed before you want to go to sleep. Spending some time relaxing and clearing your mind can help you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep peacefully through the night. There are lots of different techniques you can try to help you relax before bed, such as:


Practicing some gentle yoga stretching.Progressively tensing and then relaxing the muscles in your body.Doing some controlled breathing exercises.Reading a book, or taking a nice warm bath.;
, You should try to avoid things that might make it harder for you to fall asleep and stay asleep. If you eat a big meal before going to bed, your overfull stomach may make it more difficult to fall asleep. You should try to eat your evening meal at least three hours before you intend to go to bed.


A carbohydrate-rich snack, such as oatcakes or a bowl of cereal an hour before bed, might help you sleep.Going to bed when you are hungry or have an empty stomach will also make it harder to fall asleep.
Eating too much or too little before can cause you discomfort throughout the night, preventing the peaceful sleep you need., Avoid drinking stimulants such as alcohol and caffeine before going to bed. Alcohol might seem like something that can help you sleep, but you are more likely to experience poor quality sleep if you have been drinking. You may be dehydrated, and you may have to get to use the toilet in the night.Having a warm milky drink, or a herbal tea, can help you to prepare for sleep.A glass of warm milk will help produce more of the chemicals in your brain that induce sleep., You may find it harder to get to sleep and sleep peacefully if you have been watching TV, playing video games, or using your computer or phone soon before bed. Looking at a bright screen can make it harder for you to relax, and can disrupt the secretion of melatonin.It’s best to make sure that you have a break between looking at screens and getting into bed. Research has suggested that playing video games in the early evening has a connection to sleeping difficulties.
Similarly, those who use their phones in bed are often drowsier and less alert during the day., If you want to enjoy a peaceful sleep, making your bedroom into the perfect sleeping area can really help. Generally, you should try to keep your room dark, reasonably warm, and free of clutter and electronic devices which could irritate or distract you. You want to create a relaxing and comfortable place that you associate with sleeping more than anything else.


Keep your room dark. Consider using blackout curtains or an eye mask.
Try to keep the temperature between 60-65°F (16-18°C).
Avoid bright colours which can be overly stimulating when you want to relax.
Try not to have a TV or computer in your room."

Play soothing sounds in the background.,
Alter your sleeping position.,
Address other causative issues.,
Deal with traumatic experiences.,
Know when to talk to a doctor.","How to Sleep Peacefully, and Have Good Dreams at the Same Time2"," There is some evidence that soft and soothing sounds or music played quietly in the background can help you to get to sleep and ease you towards more peaceful dreams. Be sure that anything you play is quiet and calming, such as the sound of gentle ocean waves.If you find soft music helps you get to sleep more peacefully, you can set your music player to go off after around half an hour.Noises and sounds can disrupt your sleep too. Wear ear plugs if you are disturbed at night by sound., There is some evidence to suggest that the position you sleep in can have an impact on how you sleep and the kind of dreams you have. The most important thing is to be relaxed and comfortable, but try to be aware of the position you fall asleep and wake up in. You can try to alter this and see if it helps you have nice dreams and avoid nightmares.


Sleeping on your right side is associated with more pleasant and relaxing dreams.
Sleeping on your left side is thought to be connected with strange dreams and nightmares.
Sleeping on your stomach may promote more erotic dreams., Research has shown that there is a link between depression and frequently disturbed sleep and nightmares. Nightmares may be closely connected to how we fell about ourselves and our lives. One way to try to address them is to think more about your life and try to improve your mental and physical health.


A negative attitude towards yourself may increase your susceptibility to nightmares.Try to think more positively about yourself, especially just before you go to bed.Relaxation techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing may help.

, Nightmares are often thought to reflect stressful and fearful experiences in life. An emotionally difficult event, or a trauma of any kind, may return in a dream. If you have a recurring nightmare that you think is related to something you have experienced, you need to take steps to address the traumatic event in order to work through it.


You can talk to a therapist about the event to try and understand it more clearly.
If you have a recurring nightmare, spend some time trying to write a new and positive or neutral ending for the dream.
Each night before you go to bed try to re-imagine and visualise the dream in your head with this new positive ending., Occasionally everybody has difficulty sleeping and experiences nightmares that disrupt their sleep. If you often have difficulty sleeping, and it is having an impact on your life and what you can do during the day, you should make an appointment to talk to your doctor.The same applies for frequent disturbing nightmares. Talk to your doctor if:


You or your child have nightmares that recur often and persist over time.
The nightmares regularly disrupt sleep or cause a fear of going to sleep.
They cause daytime behaviour problems."

Get an over-the-counter antacid.,
Take H2 blockers.,
Try Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).,
Look for foam barrier tablets.",How to Sleep with Acid Reflux1," These OTC drugs can help to neutralize the acid in your stomach and reduce your acid reflux. You should expect the drugs to provide relief for up to two weeks. If you do not notice an improvement in your symptoms after two weeks, you may need to see a physician.Do not use antacids long-term as they can negatively affect your mineral balance and your kidneys. They can also cause diarrhea.;
, H2 blockers can help to decrease the secretion of acid in your stomach. You can find H2 blockers at your local pharmacy, including brands like Zantac, Pepcid, and Tagamet. Make sure you follow the instructions on the label. If the over-the-counter H2 blockers are not working, your doctor may be able to prescribe a higher dosage.Be aware of the side effects of H2 blockers, including constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, hives, nausea, and vomiting. You may also have difficulty urinating. If you experience serious side effects, stop taking the H2 blockers and see a doctor.
If you experience more serious side effects like difficulty breathing or swelling of the face, lips, throat, or tongue, you need medical attention immediately. You may be having an anaphylactic reaction; call 911 or go to the emergency room.

, PPIs block acid production in your stomach and can help to relieve your acid reflux symptoms. Look for PPIs at your local pharmacy, including esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) and omeprazole/ sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid). Always follow the instructions on the label.Be aware of the side effects of PPIs, including headache, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and rash.
Do not take PPIs long-term, as they are associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine.

, Form barriers are made by combining an antacid and a foaming agent. The tablet dissolves in your stomach and creates a foam that helps to prevent acid from entering your esophagus.Currently, Gaviscon is the only foam barrier on the market.

Identify any food triggers and avoid them.,
Eat smaller meals and chew your food slowly.,
Do not smoke two hours before bedtime or quit smoking.,
Chew gum after a heavy meal, especially at night.,
Raise the entire head of your bed.,
Do the “heel drop” 15–30 minutes before bed.",How to Sleep with Acid Reflux2," If you have chronic acid reflux, you may need to adjust your diet so you are not having any foods or beverages that could trigger acid reflux. Start a food diary (either on paper or on your smartphone), recording foods that you ate within one to two hours that then lead to symptoms of acid reflux. You can then remove those foods from your diet so your body is not triggered by them.


For example, maybe you eat breaded chicken, broccoli, and pasta in tomato sauce for dinner. Within an hour, you develop acid reflux. The trigger could be the chicken, the breading on the chicken, the broccoli, the pasta, or the tomato sauce. Start by eliminating tomato sauce from you next meal. If you do not develop acid reflux after eating the tomato sauce, the tomato sauce is likely the trigger. But if you still have acid reflux, the issue may be the other foods you ate. Eliminate each food until you no longer have acid reflux.

, Eating smaller meals puts less stress pressure on your stomach, allowing your digestive system to function properly and reducing the amount of stomach acid disruption in your stomach.


You should also eat slowly by chewing your food several times before swallowing. This will help you digest more easily and quickly, leaving less food in your stomach and putting less pressure on your digestive system.
Try to have your meals two to three hours before bedtime. Eating earlier in the night will allow your stomach to digest the food properly before you lie down in bed.

, Smoking can increase the acid in your stomach and increase your risk of acid reflux. If you are not able to quit smoking, try not to smoke at least two hours before your bedtime.

, Chewing sugar-free gum after meals can help to stimulate your salivary glands. This can then release bicarbonate into your saliva and help to neutralize the acid in your esophagus., This will allow gravity to help keep the acid in your stomach and prevent it from rising into your esophagus. You will need to actually raise your bed frame or the top section of your bed. Piling pillows on your bed and laying on them will not help as much as this will cause you to bend your neck and body in a way that will increase the pressure. This can then make the acid reflux worse., The “heel drop” is used to treat a hiatal hernia but it can also be used to relieve acid reflux. This method can help to realign your stomach and your diaphragm.Start by drinking 6 to 8 ounces of slightly warm water. Then, stand up and bring your arms straight out to your sides. Bend your arms at the elbows and bring both hands to meet your chest.
Stand on your toes so your heels are lifted. Then, drop your heels down to the ground. Repeat this 10 times. After the 10th drop, keep your arms up and pant in short, quick breaths for 15 seconds.

Have ½ cup organic aloe vera juice one to two hours before bed.,
Consume organic apple cider vinegar in water one to two hours before bed.,
Have an apple one hour before bed.,
Drink ginger tea, fennel tea, or chamomile tea one to two hours before bed.,
Dissolve mustard in water or have mustard on its own.,
Consume slippery elm one hour before bedtime.,
Have licorice root.,
Drink baking soda dissolved in water an hour or so before bedtime.",How to Sleep with Acid Reflux3," Aloe vera can help to reduce inflammation and help to neutralize the acid in your stomach.


You can also sip aloe vera throughout the day. Limit yourself to one to two cups a day total, as aloe vera can act as a laxative.

, This method uses your body’s own acid sensors to signal it is time to shut down acid production in your stomach. Have 1 tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar in six ounces of water.


You can also make your own lemonade or limeade and consume it before bed. Mix a few teaspoons of pure lemon or lime juice and add water to taste. You can also add honey to the drink. Consume the lemonade or limeade during and after meals. The acid in the lemon or lime will tell your body it’s time to shut down acid production through a process called “feedback inhibition”., The pectin in the skin of the apple is a natural antacid that can help to keep acid production in your stomach down., Ginger tea is a natural anti-inflammatory that can help to soothe your stomach and can also relieve any nausea. Use ginger tea bags or slice up one teaspoon of fresh ginger. Add the fresh ginger to boiling water and steep it for five minutes.Fennel tea can also be good for settling your stomach and decreasing the acid levels in your stomach. Crush one teaspoon of fennel and add it to a cup of boiled water.Chamomile tea can also help to soothe your stomach and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent., Mustard can be a good anti-inflammatory and acid neutralizer. Drink mustard in water one hour before bed or have a teaspoon on its own., You can drink slippery elm (about three to four ounces) or take two tablets of slippery elm before bed. Slippery elm can help to soothe irritated tissues.


Slippery elm is considered safe for pregnant women., You can get licorice root (DGL) in chewable tablets. It may take some getting used to the taste of licorice root but it can work well to heal your stomach and control acid in your stomach. Have two to three tablets before bedtime., Baking soda can be effective for neutralizing the acid in your stomach and relieving the symptoms of acid reflux. Make sure you use baking soda, not baking powder, as baking powder can be less effective. Dissolve a teaspoon of baking soda in six ounces of water and drink it one hour before bed.

Pick something that's right for your skin type, and use it before you go to sleep every night.Cleansers come in a variety of types, for everything from oily to dry skin. The bottle will say what type of skin it's appropriate for. If you have frequent breakouts, you may want to consider a cleanser that specifically targets acne.
As an added bonus, you'll be removing your makeup and the day's grime, helping to make your skin happier and healthier.;
, Of the three sisters, Kourtney tends to keep it the most basic. Try to strive for less makeup rather than more, keeping it fairly simple, especially for your day-to-day look.For instance, keep powder light by only putting it in the areas where you might be oily, such as your forehead, chin, and nose.She's also not afraid to use basic products. For example, she really likes Johnson and Johnson Baby Body Lotion.

, Kardashian likes to rub this around her eyes. She also puts it on her eyelashes. Add it to your routine to help capture that Kourtney beauty.


Kourtney has used vitamin E oil since she was a teen to help keep these areas moisturized and beautiful. However, she also sometimes uses eye creams instead, such as ones with retinol to help prevent wrinkles., Kardashian likes to draw attention to her eyes with dramatic eyelashes and eyeliner. For big events, she prefers fake lashes or even extensions.For a day-to-day look, try just curling your eyelashes, adding mascara, and lining your eyes., Use blush on the area of your cheek that is the most prominent. Add a highlighter on top in the form of a light shimmer. Make sure to go over your bone structure to outline it., Kardashian prefers a nude lip color for most days. Pick a color that matches your skin tone or one slightly darker for a day-to-day look.To test it out, try it on the back of your hand. That way, you can see how it looks on your skin.
Don't forget to line your lips first, as that will give your lips definition., Another option for your hair is to wear it long and straight. Kourtney often keeps her hair way past her shoulders, and she wears it full and straight.Most pictures of Kourtney out on the town show her in this look. If your hair won't cooperate, try a straightening iron to help get the long, straight locks.

, Sometimes, Kardashian likes the no-fuss easiness of an up-do. Pull it up into a high messy bun, for instance, and go on with your day.Alternatively, try a tight, low bun or ponytail at the base of your head or even a basic high ponytail., Kourtney isn't afraid to rock a baseball cap. Most often, she wears something plain, such as a basic, black baseball cap facing the front.Similarly, Kourtney isn't afraid to throw on a large pair of shades as she runs around town., Kourtney is often a fan of ripped jeans. However, she often pairs them with something more pulled-together on the top, such as a mock turtleneck and flowing jacket.She may also go for something as simple as white t-shirt on top with a embroidered black and white jacket., Whether pants or jackets, Kourtney often favors leather as a fabric. Pick something in black if you really want to follow Kourtney lead.Consider hitting the thrift store if you can't afford leather pieces brand new.

, Often, Kourtney enjoys being at the head of every trend, even the most outrageous ones. Don't be afraid to try something new and a bit over-the-top.One way to stay ahead of the trend is to pay attention to fashion magazines and what's ""in"" for the season.

, While Kourtney may wear a flowing or over-sized top, when it comes to pants, she tends to wear them fairly tightly. The same usually goes for the dresses she wears, especially when it comes to pencil dresses and other similar styles., It's impossible to just lose weight in your waist area. However, if you trim up overall, you'll also lose weight in that area.Eat healthier foods. Instead of foods with processed sugar, pick whole fruits and veggies. Instead of foods high in trans fat, choose healthy fats. Fish, avocado, and nuts all constitute healthy fats. Also, stick to whole grains instead of processed grains, and eat low-fat dairy and protein.Practice healthy habits, as they will help you stay healthier and lose weight. For instance, don't smoke, and make sure to get enough sleep.Use aerobic exercises to burn calories and stay healthy. Aim for 30 minutes a day, most days, of exercise such as running, swimming, or working out at the gym., Kourtney Kardashian sometimes uses a waist trainer to help slim her waist. Basically, it's a corset-like garment you wear to the gym that helps work on that area., Part of the hourglass figure is a toned bottom. You can tone your bottom by increasing exercises for this area. Aerobic exercises like running work this area. You can also try doing squats and lunges., Another part of the hourglass figure is a large bust. Of course, you can't increase your breast size. Nonetheless, you can increase the size of your chest muscles, which can push your breasts out more. The key is to focus exercise in this area as well.Try a twisting dumbbell press. On your back, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be bent at the elbow with the dumbbells above them. The elbow should be flush with your back when you're starting, and your palms should be towards your feet. Push the dumbbells up as if you're doing a standard press. As you push up, twist you arms so that your palms are towards your face. Fully extend your arms, and hold for a couple of seconds. Bring your arms back to the starting position, twisting back as you go. Try repetitions of 6 or 8, resting between sets.Do push-ups. Another way to work on these muscles is to do push-ups. Get down on the floor with your face down. Place your arms out to your sides, even with shoulders, with the elbows bent. Have the balls of your feet touching the floor. Lift your body off the floor with your arms, keeping it straight as you go. Go up and down, making sure you, at least, reach a 90-degree angle with your elbows as you come down."

Do workouts on your study break.,
Start biking or walking to and from school.,
Go to a workout class.,
Create a workout schedule and stick with it.",How to Stay Fit During Finals1," It can be a challenge to find the time to work out during finals, especially if you are cramming for a test or an exam and are short on free time. Use your study breaks as mini workout sessions, where you work out for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Working out during your study breaks can also help you stay focused on your studies and raise your energy levels, making it easier to dive back into the books.For example, you may do a 10 minute run up and down a flight of stairs or do a 15 minute run around campus. You could also do three sets of 10 pushups or sit ups during your study breaks. You may alternate between doing cardio, like jogging or walking, with doing strength exercises, like pushups or sit ups, for every study break you take.;
, You can also turn your daily commute to school into a workout by biking or walking instead of taking the bus or driving your car. Try to bike, walk, or jog to school, especially if you live close and have time in the morning for the commute.Even biking or walking to and from school a few days a week during finals can give you the cardio workout you need to stay fit.

, You can also get motivated to stay fit during finals by signing up for a workout class. You may enlist a friend to go with you so you both can hold each other accountable to the class and ensure you both show up to the class. Doing a workout class can be good motivation to take 30 minutes to 1 hour off and focus on getting fit, rather than stressing about your finals.You may try an energy boosting workout class like a spin class or an aerobics class. You may also try a more relaxing, destressing class like yoga.

, You can also motivate yourself to stay fit by creating a workout schedule ahead of finals. Try to plan out your study schedule for finals and put in time for working out as well so you can stick with your schedule when finals arrive.You may write out the schedule in your day planner or on a planning app on your phone. You could also write the schedule out on a whiteboard in your room so you can easily see it and remind yourself of the plan for the day.
You may set aside 30 minutes a day for a workout or do a one hour workout three to four times a week, depending on your finals schedule. Perhaps you plan a workout during the day when you know you may be low on energy and need a pick me up. Or maybe you schedule workouts early in the morning to get you ready for a long day of studying.
You may also find it helpful to work out after an exam to clear your head and get you ready for a study session for your other exams. You may try to plan your workouts for right after your exams during finals.

Plan out your meals.,
Go for the healthy option on your meal plan.,
Pack healthy snacks.,
Avoid mindless eating.,
Balance caffeine with water.",How to Stay Fit During Finals2," You can also stay fit by eating healthy. Do this by planning out your meals so you know what you are going to eat during finals. You should have three meals planned per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Do not skip any meals, as skipping meals can throw off your body and lead to unhealthy eating.You may write out the meal plan for the week of finals and choose meals that are healthy and easy to prepare. Then, go grocery shopping ahead of finals week for ingredients so they are on hand.
Put together meals high in fresh fruits and vegetables as well as healthy sources of protein like chicken, fish, and tofu. You should also stock up on beans and legumes, as they are good sources of protein and vitamins.

, If you are on a meal plan through your university or college, you should always try to have the healthy option during finals. Go out of your way to find a healthy option that is covered by your meal plan and try to always have healthy meals during finals so you stay fit and energized.


You may opt for the salad bar, if it is covered by your meal plan, and have salads full of leafy greens, protein, fruit, and a healthy dressing. You should also go for the healthier option for hot meals, such as the vegetarian option for a no-meat meal or a meal that has a good balance of steamed or boiled vegetables, chicken, and rice.

, Skip the bags of chips and vending machine candy. Instead, pack healthy snacks in your backpack so they are within reach when you feel hungry between meals. This will ensure you are not distracted by hunger when you are trying to study.You may pack simple, healthy snacks like apples, bananas, or oranges. You could also pack unsalted nuts like almonds or cashews as well as granola bars in your bag.

, Snacking while studying makes you less likely to pay attention to the food you are eating, which may lead to overeating and weight gain if you eat in excess.

Don’t study and eat at the same time. Take a break from studying to eat meals with friends.
Never eat snacks directly from the bag/box. Portion out snacks before you dig in to prevent overeating.

, Many students lean on caffeine to stay awake and alert for finals. But having too much caffeine on a constant basis can cause dehydration and low energy spirals, especially if you are up late studying. Do not exceed 400 mg of caffeine per day, and try to balance your caffeine intake with lots of water. Keep a water bottle with you and sip from it often. Try to chase caffeine with water so you are not at risk of dehydration.You may also try having sources of caffeine that are not as dehydrating, such as green tea, instead of coffee or energy drinks. Avoid energy drinks because they often lead to a sudden crash in your blood sugar and dehydration. Some energy drinks contain large amounts of caffeine, which can cause serious health problems.You should try to keep your alcohol consumption in check during finals. Avoid going out and drinking during finals to help you stay focused and prepared for your exams. If you do drink, then stay within the recommended limits for alcohol, which include now more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. One drink is defined as 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, 1.5 oz liquor,

Make sure you get enough sleep.,
Do self-care.,
Take advantage of activities on campus.",How to Stay Fit During Finals3," Though you may be tempted to pull all-night study sessions and skip out on sleep, not getting enough sleep can be detrimental to your health and to your ability to recall what you studied the night before. Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night, even during finals, to ensure your body does not become overworked and worn out.You should also try to plan out your study schedule so you can avoid pulling “all-nighters.” Staying up all night will likely only make you more distracted and unable to concentrate during your exam or test the next day.

, You should also take time to take care of yourself and have some “me” time during finals. Doing self-care can help you feel less stress and anxious and allow you to study with renewed focus. You should try to schedule in a little self-care at least two to three times a week during finals so you can take a second to breathe and relax.You may do a quick self-care session, such as applying a face mask and relaxing for 10-15 minutes or lighting your favorite candle and doing a quick meditation before an exam. You can also treat yourself to a bath, a relaxing shower, or a chill out session where you listen to music in your room.

, Your university or college will likely have events on campus for students during finals. There may be fun activities like a finals morning bike ride or a late night yoga session. You should take advantage of the activities on campus during finals and try to attend them. Doing something fun with other students on campus can help you stay fit and feel healthy. You can also bond over the stress of finals and have a few laughs before you get back to studying."

Gather bedding.,
Gather supplies that will help you sleep.,
Find a place to sleep.,
Recline yourself.,
Make your sleep site more comfortable.,
Use your blanket.,
Try to approximate your sleep routine.,
Shift as needed to stay comfortable.,
Give your head extra support if necessary.,
Get better rest as soon as you can.",How to Sleep While Sitting Up," If you have time to prepare before trying to sleep upright, gather bedding such as a blanket, pillows, towel, or a mat. This bedding will make you more comfortable, and reduce any soreness from sleeping upright.Wearing loose, comfortable clothes and light shoes will also make it easier to sleep while sitting up.A special travel pillow can provide support for your head and neck. These come in a variety of forms: some go around your neck, some over your shoulder, some attach to the side of a seat, and some can be used in multiple positions.Look for these types of pillows in luggage stores, airport shops, etc.;
, Some people find it easier to sleep while wearing earplugs or headphones to block outside noise and/or distractions.Likewise, many people find an eye mask useful for blocking out light. If you have other things that are part of your routine for going to sleep, such as a book to read or mug of tea, try to have them with you. Making your sleep routine as normal as possible will help you fall asleep sitting up.

, If you are sitting in a chair, such as on an airplane or train, you can make the best of it and sleep there. If you are free to move and find a place to sleep, however, look for a vertical surface such as a wall, fence, or post to lean against. If you have a board or some other flat surface, you can also lean that against something and rest against it.A surface that is sloped slightly backwards is best.
The cushioning of a chair, recliner, or couch can be more comfortable than a hard surface such as a wall when you are trying to sleep sitting up. If you only have a hard surface, however, you can make it more comfortable by using pillows and blankets for padding.
If you are traveling with a friend, or have one nearby, it can make things easier.You can lean against each other (or take turns) and try to sleep.

, Leaning yourself back at an angle of about forty degrees is recommended when trying to sleep upright.If you are in a seat on an airplane, train, bus, etc. it may lean back slightly. If you are elsewhere, a reclining armchair is a good choice if you can find one.Otherwise, just lean against a surface at a slight angle.

, If you are not sleeping in a chair or other surface that is cushioned, you will want to make things more comfortable using the bedding you gathered. Even if your site is already cushioned, you may find a blanket and pillow makes things more comfortable for you.


Put a blanket, pillow, or mat on the ground or floor underneath you.Put a blanket, pillow, cushion, or other padding behind you. This will provide support for your back.Roll up a blanket or towel and place it or a small pillow behind you at your lower back. This will provide extra support for your lumbar region and minimize soreness.
Place a thin pillow behind your neck. This will allow your head to fall slightly backwards, which can make it easier to fall asleep. Specialty neck pillows are made for this purpose, but you can use whatever you have available.

, Once you’ve prepared your sleep site and cushioned support, lean back and use your blanket to cover you. This can provide warmth and comfort, making it easier for you to fall asleep.If you don't have a blanket, try using a coat, sweater, or anything similar that's available.

, Read a book, listen to music, or whatever else helps you relax and go to sleep. Even though you are sitting up, this routine can help you fall asleep as you normally would.


Many people find that warm drinks or tea can help them become comfortable and sleepy (just stay away from caffeinated beverages). Chamomile tea is a good choice because it has a calming effect and is naturally caffeine-free.Meditation and/or breathing exercises are also recognized as calming techniques.A simple breathing exercise is to inhale for a count of 3 or 4, then exhale for a count of six or eight.A few repetitions of this can be very helpful when trying to calm down and go to sleep sitting up.
Avoid television, computers, tablets, smartphones and similar devices when you are trying to go sleep sitting up, as the blue light from electronic screens disrupts the body’s inclination to sleep.Don’t get discouraged if you don’t fall asleep immediately. Just try to relax and get the best rest you can.

, Altering your position periodically as you sleep sitting up helps to reduce soreness and encourages better sleep.If you wake up while trying to sleep, stretch your legs a bit and shift position slightly (for example, turn your head or shift your body slightly to one side).

, Keeping your head in a comfortable position is important for staying asleep. If your head slips to one side, move your support (pillow, blanket, etc.) to the side to give your head more support.


If you head keeps drooping, you can also wrap a scarf around it and the back of your support (chair, post, etc.), if possible.This helps to hold your head in place while you get more sleep.

, Sleeping sitting up can be fine for a short nap, or when you don’t have any other choice. However, it can be hard to get the “active,” REM sleep your body needs while sitting up.As soon as you are able, get deeper sleep in a more comfortable place, such as a bed, couch, or hammock.

Relax.",How to Sleep on the Ground," If you can select the gear you will be sleeping on, look into pads, mattresses, cots or hammocks to make it more comfortable. These items can provide cushion from the cold, hard ground and offer some protection from insects.


Your local sporting goods store often has camping gear you can check out. Talk to a store employee about what your options are and which items have been rated highly before making a selection.
You can also search online for retailers that sell sleeping gear. Websites often offer plenty of information on which camping gear is the best to get for your situation and which brands are worth the price.;
, Sleeping bags are popular and can be very useful when you need to sleep on the ground. Make sure to purchase a sleeping bag rated for the temperature range you will be sleeping in. Bags meant for camping usually offer more room but are less efficient for retaining heat, so if you will be in a very cold location you should consider a sleeping bag meant for backpacking instead.


If you’re camping with another person, consider a sleeping bag that can fit 2 people for extra insulation and warmth.
You can also use 2 sleeping bags for yourself or 2 people. Open your first sleeping bag and lay it flat. You can put a sheet over it if you want and then open the other sleeping bag to use as a blanket.
A removable sleeping bag liner can help keep your sleeping bag cleaner if you will be using it for several nights.
If it rains or snows, you will probably need to sleep in your sleeping bag inside a tent, vestibule or other makeshift cover for protection.

, A light, thin mat can ease back pain, lessen snoring and help you maintain a proper sleeping position flat on your back. Other positions, such as sleeping curled on your side can shorten your hip flexors, pectoral muscles and hamstrings, contributing to back pain., Foam is a durable and dense material that is nearly indestructible with a low weight and good insulation value. Foam pads are very useful if you will be sleeping on very cold, frozen or snowy ground as well as rough ground that could puncture other types of material. It is also an inexpensive option but can be bulky and may not provide enough cushion for some people.


You can get a compressed foam mattress covered with waterproof nylon that provides good insulation. The foam expands once the twist valve is opened. You can also blow into the valve to get the cushioning more to your liking.
If you are backpacking, consider a 1"" to 2"" thick pad so that it is lighter to carry and takes up less room. A thicker pad for better comfort can also be purchased if you prefer.
Fitted sheets might be available for some pads.
If your back gets sore lying flat on the ground on something like thin foam, then use a jacket folded in half lengthwise and rolled into a cylinder underneath your pad for the small of your back.

, If you’re looking for extra lightweight material that takes up very little space, consider cutting your thin pad to torso length. To determine which parts of you touch the ground and will need insulation, lay down. Usually, this is just your back and heels, so cut down your pad to fit your back.


You can use a hat, a backpack or some other material under your legs and feet for insulation.

, These sleeping pads use air as the cushion and can be quite comfortable. They can also be very light (under 1 pound) but usually require that you blow them up to fill them. They do not offer very much insulation and those that do are often a little heavier.


You can usually get an air foot pump or electric pump to blow air into your mattress if you don’t want to spend the time and energy blowing it up yourself.
Air mattresses tend to be bulky and can be heavy as well, depending on the brand you get.

, If you want to be up off the ground because the area is extra rocky or crawling with bugs, consider using a platform such as a cot or hammock. You can add a mat or pad to your cot to make it more comfortable and add insulation as well.


If you do decide to use a hammock, make sure you can find a spot that will accommodate it.

, Once you determine what environment and temperature range you will be sleeping in, gather up the blankets you will need. You will require thicker blankets for colder temperatures and lighter blankets for warm nights. If there will be a range of temperatures, then bring multiple blankets of various thickness to use as layers.


Camping on the beach can be uncomfortable with sand getting into everything. You can use flannel sheets instead of cotton here because the loose weave will allow sand to pass through the material.
It can be helpful to bring an old comforter from your house to use as a blanket because it’s familiar so might help you fall asleep.

, Though sleeping flat without a pillow may be the most natural position for the spine, many people can’t sleep without some type of cushion under their head. Pillows, however, can add extra space and weight to your pack or may not be available. The good news is that many things can be used as a pillow if you improvise.


You can use spare clothing or an insulated jacket as a pillow. If you can’t spare any clothing, you can roll up a backpack and stick it underneath a blanket.

, An area that is level and cleared of rocks and sticks might be a good place to lay your mat. However, if you don’t have a pad and just have blankets or are without those too, finding a place beside a tree, wall or on a slab of rock would work better. These places can give you somewhere to prop your head up.


Trees provide shade and possibly even fruit, so they can be a good place to sleep. Always check the branches above you and make sure none are dead or dying so they won’t fall on you while you sleep.
A pine tree is an ideal place to sleep under. The old needles and twigs that have fallen over the years can be soft and very insulating.
While grassy areas can seem inviting, they can encourage condensation to form overnight.
If you find a cave, it can be a good place to get out of the elements but always watch out for animals.

, Don’t wear bulky clothing before you slip into your bag. This can make the sleeping bag’s ability to trap body heat less effective. Long underwear and clean socks are warm and also prevent body oils from getting on your blankets and mats.


Sweaty or damp clothing always needs to be taken off as soon as possible.
You can put extra clothing outside of your sleeping bag to add more insulation if needed.
Wear a beanie or other type of hat. Your head and face can get very cold since heat escapes from exposed areas. Covering these areas will go a long way to keep you warm. You can also cinch your hood to keep heat in.

, If you don’t have any blankets or a sleeping bag, put leaves and twigs down where you will sleep. This will be softer than the ground and can slightly elevate you, keeping most bugs off of you. You can also use leaves, moss or pine needles to cover yourself, keep heat in and bugs out or as a pillow.


If you can, put a medium piece of cloth down over your bed before laying down on it. You can use a towel, sheet, sweatshirt or slip cover.
You can use a washcloth, paper towels or clothes as a pillow between the rock, tree or ground that your head is laying on.

, Sweating can chill you so only use the amount of insulation you need to stay warm. If it’s a warm night, don’t zip up your sleeping bag and just tuck your feet into the bag, if needed. You can also just use a sheet or light blanket to cover yourself.


Use dry clothing and extra blankets to fill the spaces in your bag around your body so that there is less area for your body to heat.
Use a water bottle full of warm water. Put it next to your body, preferably your torso. This can help generate more heat.

, When you choose an area, check for signs of ants and other pests before making your bed. Always shake out your bag and blankets before you go to sleep to make sure there aren’t any insects, scorpions, spiders or snakes hiding in there. If you can, elevate yourself above the ground on something to avoid being near where insects usually crawl.

, If you will be sleeping outside for a while, then you will want to keep your clothes and bedding clean and dry. You can rinse material in a river and leave it to dry on a branch. Every morning, allow your blankets and clothes to air out so that any moisture that collects overnight can dry out.

, Know that you will not be sleeping in your comfortable bed. Recognize that your situation is probably going to cause some inconveniences for you and will not be what you are used to. Be ok with it, though, and enjoy your new experience while it lasts.


Take this opportunity to look at the twinkling stars, smell the clean air and listen to the sounds of the wilderness.

, Temperatures can drop quickly after sunset and things can get very dark. Be prepared by keeping layers of clothing and other forms of insulation as well as flashlights or a headlamp in your car and on your person if you are hiking or camping. For safety, a whistle, knife or other tool can also be useful.


Be prepared for nighttime bathroom breaks. Put a flashlight or headlamp near you, along with your shoes.

, Secure all your food and anything scented outside your tent, if you have one, or away from your sleeping location. If you spill some of your food, collect it and put it in approved bins. Do not spit out toothpaste near where you will sleep either. If your clothes have collected the scent of food or food residue, do not wear them to sleep.

, Even though you will be sleeping on the ground, you can help your mind and body get ready for bed by doing the same things you would normally do before bed. If you usually brush your teeth before you get into bed, then do that before you lay down in your makeshift bed. It can give you a feeling of normalcy.

, A meal or snack before bed can help you go to sleep. If it’s a cold night, digesting the food can warm you up. Your body will then generate more heat to keep you warmer.


Eat foods that contain the sleep hormone melatonin, such as tart cherries or walnuts., Some light exercise can help make you tired. Stretching can be relaxing or you can do some sit-ups or pushups. Don’t exercise too intensely, though, or you could become more awake. You also don’t want to get sweaty.

, Always make sure you have adequate water access. Being thirsty is not conducive to sleep. You don’t want to drink so much that you have to pee all night, but you do want to be hydrated. This will aid blood circulation and help get rid of the possibility of headaches, like those that can happen at high altitudes.


A warm beverage can be soothing and help you keep warm. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages, though, if it is cold. They can actually increase heat loss because consuming alcohol tends to dilate blood vessels under the skin.

, Read or take deep breaths to calm your body and mind down. If the night sounds spook you, then try not to listen too much to them. Most animals are not dangerous and are probably more scared of people than you are of them.


Try sleeping near a river (keep a safe distance). The sound of rushing water can serve as white noise that drowns out unnerving night sounds.
Eventually, you will be tired enough to fall asleep. It can be rough at first but if you are sleeping on the ground for more than a night or 2, it will start to get very easy.
Being as comfortable as possible is the most helpful thing you can do to fall asleep on the ground."

Recreate your ordinary bedtime routine.",How to Sleep on a Couch," If you can, take out the bottom cushions and flip them. This will give you a firmer, cleaner surface on which to sleep. Brush out any crumbs you find. If the back cushions of the couch are detachable, remove them. This will give you more space to move comfortably in your sleep.


Line up the back cushions on the floor along the couch so that you have a soft surface to land on if you roll off.
If you are sleeping on a couch made of a slippery material, such as leather, make sure you pad the floor with something.;
, Couches are generally made of less breathable material than beds. They might be worn out and saggy in sections. Diminish uneven surfaces and build a friendlier sleep environment by laying down some blankets across the couch. Pick a thick, soft duvet if you have one.


If you are crashing somewhere and have nothing to pad your bed with, look to your own belongings. Sweatshirts and sweatpants might work, if you can lay them flat.

, Treat the couch as much like a bed as possible. Cover your lower cushions and padding with a sheet. A fitted sheet might not fit, so try tucking in a top sheet. Place pillows and clean pillowcases at the place you will lay your head. Don't rest your head on the arm of the couch, as the angle will be too abrupt.


Couch fabric tends to be cleaned less often than other surfaces, so try to keep something between it and your skin.
Use a couch cushion as a pillow if you must, but cover it with something. If you don’t have access to a pillowcase, dress it in a clean cotton t-shirt.
If you have no sheets, lay out any soft and clean fabrics you can find. Wear pajamas to avoid contact with the couch fabric.

, If you know ahead of time that you will be sleeping on the couch, give it a good clean. You can hire professional couch cleaners, or you can just dust it off yourself. Bring the cushions outside and give them a good whack to get the dust out. Vacuum and brush off any pet hair. Use water and detergent if the material of your couch can take it.Check the tag on your couch to see what kind of cleaning it can handle. The tag may be under the couch next to a leg. It will be marked with a letter that lets you know how to clean the couch.""W"" means you can clean your couch with a water-based detergent.
""S"" means it needs to be dry cleaned or cleaned with a water-free detergent.
""WS"" means it can be either dry cleaned, or cleaned with a water-based cleaner.
""X"" means it should be professionally dry cleaned, or vacuumed.
""O"" means it is made of natural fibers and should be washed in cold water

, Temperature affects your quality of sleep. Even if the room is hot, put a top sheet and a blanket nearby in case you get cold. Consider opening a window or adjusting the heat. A room that is slept in less often may be an uncomfortable temperature, or may be stuffy and airless.

, Draw the curtains. Wear a sleep mask if you have one, or block the light with a pillow. Living rooms are likely to have blinking screens and LED lights, so consider blocking them from your view with a pillow or cushion.

, If you are sleeping in a full house, there may be people coming in and out, or noise in the morning. If you own earplugs, wear them while you sleep on the couch.Do not improvise earplugs out of cotton or tissue, as these may become stuck in your ear.


Ask the other people sleeping in the house to keep it quiet if they can. Be kind, as you are either a guest or a host in this situation, and owe your guest or host courtesy and consideration.

, Do the best you can to do everything you normally do before bed. For example, if you normally watch TV, shower, drink a cup of herbal tea, snuggle with your stuffed animal and fall asleep at 10pm, try to do all those things in that order. Do whatever you normally do in your bed on the couch instead.

Go to sleep!",How to Sleep in a Bathtub," You won’t be comfortable if you have to sleep with your body contorted into a pretzel, so lay down in the bathtub and see how well you fit.


In order to be comfortable for an entire night of sleep, the bathtub must be long enough for you to stretch out in and wide enough that your shoulders won’t be cramped and you can keep your spine in alignment so your back won’t hurt in the morning.If the tub isn’t big enough, the floor may be a better option after all. Sleeping on the floor actually has some health benefits and can be good for an achy back! Make sure you have room to sleep on your back but can also roll over onto your side so you won’t be uncomfortable staying in one position all night.;
, Since people will also be using the bathtub for showers, you will need to make sure it is thoroughly dry before making your bed inside it.


Avoid using the bathtub for several hours before bedtime if possible.
If the tub is still wet from someone’s shower, dry it with a towel. You can also use a hairdryer to completely dry the tub.
Clean the tub so you won’t get any soap residue or hair on your blankets and pillows., You don’t want to knock a bottle of shampoo onto the floor or have a bar of soap fall on your face during the night.


Remove toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap, body wash, lotion, etc.) that are in the way or that you might accidentally knock onto the floor while you sleep.
Be courteous with other people’s belongings and make sure you replace everything in the morning.

, You will need to lay down several layers of padding in order to be comfortable enough to sleep on the tub’s hard surface.


Find as many comforters, blankets and pillows as you can.
A sleeping bag as the top layer is also a great option.

, With a little effort you can make yourself cozy.


Fold several blankets or comforters and place them along the bottom of the bathtub. This will create a mattress for you to sleep on.
Make sure your padding reaches up the sides of the tub as well if possible to cushion all parts of your body that will be in contact with the tub’s surface.
Place a pillow at the end of the tub where you will have your head. You may want to use one pillow under your head for proper support and spine alignment and place one standing up between the top of your head and the end of the tub so you don’t bump your head in your sleep., Save a blanket or two for putting over the top of you.


Since you don’t know whether the bathroom will be warmer or colder than you are accustomed to during the night, have several layers handy just in case.A sleeping bag can do double duty as a pad underneath you and a cover on top of you., You will want to make sure you have what you need for the night and morning close at hand.


Gather your clothes and toiletries for the next day and place them on a shelf or somewhere where they will stay dry.
Find an outlet for your phone. Make sure you will be able to reach your phone from the tub so you can see what time it is and use it as an alarm in the morning.
Bring in anything you will use to entertain yourself, like a tablet, laptop, or a book to read.

, If there is only one bathroom available, it’s best to be on the same page so everyone can agree on how to deal with the situation. You don’t want someone turning on the shower on you in the morning!


Decide what you will do if someone else needs to use the bathroom during the night.
Agree on what time will be reasonable for you to wake up and get out of the bathtub so others can use it for showers in the morning., It’s time to get in the tub and start snoozing, so get comfy.


Position yourself with your head on the opposite side of the tub from the tap. That way if you forget where you are and sit up you won’t bump your head or face on the faucet.
Use the fan for white noise if you need to block out background noise to sleep better.Turn out the lights. If you think you might wake up and be disoriented, use a nightlight. That will also help your roommates in case they forget you’re in there and you startle them.

You can find out if your state allows medical marijuana by doing an online search for your state’s legislation around medical marijuana.
There are about 25 states in the United States that allow medical marijuana use.In Canada, medical marijuana is legal nationwide, in every province.;
, Once you have confirmed your home state or area allows medical marijuana use, you should speak to your doctor about getting a medical marijuana card. Many states and provinces list seizure disorders as a condition that is eligible for access to medical marijuana. Your doctor should be able to tell you if your seizure disorder qualifies you for medical marijuana under state or provincial law.


Your doctor will then need to sign several forms to qualify you for a medical marijuana card to treat your seizure disorder. If your doctor does not support the use of medical marijuana, you may need to find another doctor who will be willing to approve you for a card.
Depending on your state or province, it may cost money for you to get a medical marijuana card. You may need to pay the fee yourself or see if it is covered under your health care insurance.

, Your doctor may submit the necessary forms for you to your state or province’s Department of Health Services. If your doctor does not do this for you, you may need to do it yourself. It may take one to two weeks for your application to go through. You will then receive a medical marijuana card in the mail.You may receive information on state-licensed marijuana dispensaries in your state or province when you get the medical marijuana card.
You can also ask your doctor for more information on dispensaries in your area or look up dispensaries in your area online.

, When you are looking for medical marijuana that will help treat your seizure disorder, go for a strain that is low in THC and high in CBD. There are several known strains, such as Charlotte's Web, that are considered ideal for individuals with seizure disorders. You can also ask your doctor to recommend certain strains of marijuana that can help treat the symptoms of your disorder.THC is a compound that produces the psychoactive effects in marijuana. A lower amount of THC will make the marijuana’s side effects feel more mild.
CBD is a compound that has been shown to help reduce seizures for individuals suffering from certain forms of epilepsy. A strain high in CBD may be beneficial for managing the symptoms of your seizure disorder.

, Many medical marijuana users prefer taking marijuana in liquid form, such as cannabis oil. Using marijuana in the form of an oil means it can be added to food or taken orally on a daily basis.Your doctor can show you how to take marijuana in oil form. They may suggest consuming the oil directly on your tongue or putting the oil on food or in food.

Try to stick to the prescribed dosage so you are not at risk of taking too much or experiencing intense side effects.Your doctor may start you on a low dosage at first to allow your body to get used to the effects of medical marijuana. You may take several low doses throughout the day, rather than one big dosage at once.
Your doctor may monitor your reaction to the dosage over a period of several weeks. You can then adjust the dosage based on your reaction so you are comfortable using medical marijuana for your disorder on a daily basis.

, Though more research is necessary, there have been several studies done on the benefits of medical marijuana for those with seizure disorders. Your doctor may discuss these studies with you as well as their own personal experiences with other patients who have seizure disorders and use medical marijuana with success. You should stay informed and be sure you are clear on how medical marijuana can benefit you.The more clinical trials and studies that are done on medical marijuana for seizure disorders, the more it becomes clear that it may be a viable treatment option in some cases. In one study, done with a pharmaceutical that contains 99% CBD oil, seizures decreased by an average of 54% in 137 people who completed 12 weeks on the medical marijuana product. Your doctor may discuss these studies to let you know of the positive effects of medical marijuana.

, You should be aware of the possible side effects of using medical marijuana, especially if you have never used marijuana before. You may experience increase appetite and sleepiness as a result of the marijuana. You may also have memory issues. In general, the side effects of medical marijuana are mild and tend to fade away with time.You may experience several side effects of medical marijuana at first and then they may gradually become less frequent the more often you use the product.

Start by sleeping in your underwear.,
Sleep naked under breathable fabrics.,
Adjust your sheets and covers by the season.,
Consider bathing before bed.,
Keep a robe right next to your bed.,
See if your partner wants to sleep naked, too.,
Keep your thermostat at 70 degrees (21°C) or below.,
Make sure the room is fully dark.,
Allow air to flow over your body.,
Take care of everything before going to bed.,
Bar the door if you feel it's safe.,
Set your alarm to rise early.,
Talk to your kids about privacy.",How to Sleep Naked," Are you used to sleeping in a full set of pajamas? Even if you normally wear a t-shirt to bed, you might need a night or two to adjust before sleeping fully nude. Going straight from fully clothed to naked might disrupt your sleep at first. Plan to wear just your underwear (no bra) at first to see how it feels.


Sleeping in just your underwear provides some of the benefits of sleeping naked. More of your skin is exposed to the air, and this circulation helps promote clearer skin.
However, having underwear on will still cause your body to rely on that extra layer to help regulate heat. The parts of your body covered by underwear won't receive healthy air circulation. That's why it's worth giving nude sleeping a chance.;
, Sleeping naked is healthy because it allows your skin to be free of constrictive clothing for a good seven to eight hours. Choose fabrics made from natural materials, preferably cotton, so that the air in your bedroom can circulate through to your body.


Using polyester and other synthetic materials isn't as healthy for your skin. The fabrics may keep you too warm or block the air, negating the positive effects of sleeping naked.
If you're really concerned about having the healthiest night's sleep possible, choose sheets made with organic fibers. That way your naked skin won't be exposed to any chemicals.

, Many people complain that it's too cold to sleep naked during the winter. This can easily be remedied by using the proper bedclothes for the season. If you have a good down comforter, your body will adjust to the environment and stay nice and warm without the need for pajamas. In the summer, a sheet and a thin cotton blanket might be all you need to stay comfortable.


It helps to have a good collection of quilts or thin cotton blankets you can keep in your bedroom. That way you can add or subtract layers depending on your needs.
Using a top sheet all year round is helpful. You can kick off your blanket if you need to and still have a sheet to keep you from feeling completely exposed.

, You may find sleeping naked more comfortable if you bathe just before bed. Your skin will feel fresh and clean, and your sheets will stay clean longer that way, too. Taking a warm bath before bed will also help you feel sleepy, so you'll get an even better night's rest.

, In the morning, you'll have something to slip on immediately so you won't be cold on your way to the bathroom. It's also good to have a robe nearby in case of an emergency. You'll be able to rest easier knowing your robe is right there in case there's some reason you have to quickly leave your bed in the night.

, Skin to skin contact throughout the night causes the body to release oxytocin, a hormone that makes you feel good and helps to alleviate stress and depression. It even reduces blood pressure.Take full advantage of the benefits of sleeping naked by having your partner do it with you.


As an added bonus, feeling your partner's bare skin next to yours can lead to more frequent sex. In this way, sleeping naked can increase intimacy with your partner and strengthen your relationship.To make sure you both stay comfortable, keep an extra blanket or two on both sides of the bed. That way each partner can layer according to his or her preference.

, Humans sleep more deeply in cooler temperatures. When your body overheats, often due to restrictive clothing, you don't get the deep, restorative rest you need to stay healthy.No matter what the season, keep the temperature in your bedroom low and sleep naked so your body can self-regulate its temperature. If you feel chilly in the night, just use an extra blanket; it's much better for you than wrapping your body in tight pajamas.


Sleeping in cooler temperatures also helps your body regulate melatonin and growth hormone. If you don't get the deep rest that comes with sleeping in a cool space, your body doesn't get the chance to properly produce these hormones, which are essential to repairing your cells.
Sleeping more deeply will also regulate your body's production of cortisol, a hormone produced when the body experiences stress that leads to weight gain and other health problems. Allow your body to rest completely will prevent it from getting flooded with damaging cortisol., Since you're already getting the benefits of sleeping naked in a cool room, you might as well go all out and get the very best sleep you can. Unplug your nightlights and electronics so you can sleep in a pitch-black room. Sleeping in total darkness allows your brain to be fully at rest, contributing to a great night's sleep.


Avoid checking your phone or laptop right before you close your eyes. The light from these devices can prevent you from sleeping well.
If light from the street keeps your room from being pitch-black, invest in blackout curtains for a better night's sleep.

, Cool, dry air improves your body's circulation. It also provides the right conditions for improving the health of sex organs for both men and women. For men, keeping the genitals at a cooler temperature helps with sexual function and keeps sperm healthy. For women, allowing cool, dry air to circulate can help prevent yeast infections., If you live in a house with other people aside from your partner, you probably want to take precautions to avoid awkward moments. Make sure the kids are tucked in and ready to sleep before you perform your own nightly routine and get undressed. This limits the prospect of a sleepy kid barging in on you while you're naked.


If you're particularly worried, don't get undressed until the moment before you hop into bed. Brush your teeth and turn off the light while you're still clothed.
Don't forget to keep a robe right next your bed, just in case.

, You may be in a position to lock or lightly bar the door so no one can walk right in. If you're living in a house with other adults, you might want to get a lock installed so you'll feel more comfortable being naked in your bedroom. If you have little kids and locking the door isn't feasible, try placing a thick towel under the door or putting a chair in front of it. That way you'll get at least a few moments' warning before your child makes his or her way in.

, That way you'll be up and clothed before the kids come knocking at your door. If you need more sleep, but you know other people in the house will be waking soon, you can put on a nightshirt and get back into bed to spend the last few moments of your morning sleeping clothed.

, You may want to have a conversation with your kids to tell them that your bedroom is your private space between certain hours. Have them get into the habit of knocking and waiting for your reply before they come inside. That will give you time to put on your robe before they see you naked.


There will probably be times when your kids do manage to see your bare shoulders peeking out from the covers, and that's OK. It's perfectly normal to sleep naked, and the fact that you do is not something you need to hide from your children.
Letting them know that you and your partner sleep naked, and that everyone deserves privacy before they put their clothes on, is a fine way to handle the situation and hopefully prevent awkward barge-ins.

Even if the person has wiped away traces from his or her body, you might spot a residue on the person's clothing or on household surfaces.


Check for items under the bed or under a chair that may have been used as a flat surface for snorting.
The person may explain that the residue is powdered sugar, flour or another harmless substance. If you see it more than once, especially in an unlikely place (like on a magazine under the bed), it's probably not powdered sugar.;
, Cocaine is hard on the sinuses, and can cause a perpetual runny nose. Heavy users often sniff as though they have a cold, even if they don't demonstrate other signs of being sick.


Touching or wiping the nose frequently is another sign that the person may be a cocaine user.
After a prolonged period of heavy use, a cocaine user can experience nosebleeds and internal nose damage., Since it's a powerful stimulant, cocaine causes a person's eyes to look red and bloodshot, just as well as marijuana. See if the person's eyes look red and watery at odd times of the day. Cocaine causes sleep loss, so the person's eyes will look especially red in the morning. , Cocaine causes the pupils to look wide and dilated. Notice the person's pupils to see if they look strangely dilated, even in a room that's well lit. Since having dilated pupils makes a person's eyes more sensitive to light, you may see the person wearing sunglasses to protect sensitive eyes.


Dilated pupils last only as long as the actual high, so this physical sign is easy to miss.
Many other types of drugs also cause dilated pupils. The presence of unnaturally dilated pupils does not necessarily indicate cocaine use., Serious users sometimes dissolve cocaine and inject it using a needle. Pay attention to the person's hands, forearms, feet and legs, and look for small puncture wounds that indicate a needle was inserted there. If you see tiny ""track marks,"" the person may be using cocaine.

, Cocaine can be snorted in powder form, smoked as crack cocaine, or directly injected. There are various items involved in its administration that you may find.


White powder on mirrors, CD cases or other surfaces.
Rolled up dollar bills, pipes, crack spoons, small plastic bags.
Lemon juice or vinegar can be mixed with cocaine to produce a more intense rush.
Sometimes heroin is taken at the same time as cocaine. This is known as 'speedballing.', Cocaine gives users a feeling of euphoria,the person may seem happy for no apparent reason. . Compare the person's behavior to his or her normal state to determine if cocaine or other drug use might be causing the person to act differently.


You may also notice the person laughing more often.
Sometimes people become abnormally aggressive or impulsive when they're high on cocaine. Hallucinations may also occur.
The hyperactivity lasts only as long as the person is high, which can be anywhere between twenty minutes and two hours.

, Since a cocaine high only lasts a short period of time, it's necessary to use it frequently to maintain a feeling of euphoria. Cocaine users excuse themselves frequently to use more. If the person keeps going to the bathroom every 20 or 30 minutes, this may be a sign he or she is using.


Of course, there are many other reasons someone might need to go to the bathroom frequently. Look for other signs that cocaine use might be the reason, such as a sense that the person has something to hide.
You may also see the person leave the room with someone else every so often. Watch for furtive glances exchanged between people who may both be using cocaine.

,, When someone is coming down from a high, especially the day after using a lot of cocaine, he or she may feel lethargic and depressed. See if the person has trouble getting out of bed or demonstrates extreme moodiness the day after you suspect he or she used cocaine. If you notice a pattern of lethargy, it's possible the person is using.


In many cases a cocaine user will stay isolated from others after using cocaine. If the person shuts the door to his or her room and won't come out, this could be a sign.
Some people use sedatives or alcohol to combat the effects of cocaine and help them fall asleep.

, Long-term drug users risk becoming increasingly dependent on cocaine. Seeking the next high becomes a priority and other obligations in life may suffer. Look for the following signs that someone is a long-term, heavy user:


Repeat users may develop tolerance to the drug and require increasing dosages to get the desired effect. They may be using as frequently as every ten minutes and indulge in week long binges.
They may become secretive, unreliable and dishonest. They may exhibit dramatic mood swings, depression, or psychotic behavior, due to the neurological effects of the drug.
They may neglect family or work responsibilities, and even personal hygiene. There may be a new group of friends and social contacts who also use cocaine.

, Cocaine is a very expensive drug. Heavy users will need a big income in order to keep up the habit. Since work life often suffers, the person's financial situation can quickly become a problem.


The person may ask to borrow money, without being explicit about what it will be used for.
In extreme cases, an individual may resort to stealing or selling personal possessions to fund a drug habit.

, It's much better to say something than to stay silent. Tell the person you've noticed he or she is using cocaine and that you're concerned about his or her health and well-being. Say you want to help the person overcome his or her habit or addiction.


Don't wait until the person has hit rock bottom. Cocaine is too dangerous for that. Don't allow it to ""run its course"" or go unchecked.
List specific examples to help you ""prove"" that you know the person has used cocaine. Be prepared for the person to deny using.

, If the person you're worried about is your child or a close family member, make an appointment with a drug counselor to get help right away. Dealing with a potential cocaine addiction is not something you'll be able to handle on your own.Find a counselor who is skilled in dealing with addictive behavior.
A family therapist or school counselor could also be helpful.

, Ultimately, the person in question will have to take the initiative to stop. Attempting to control the situation using threats, bribes, and extreme punishments probably won't work. Invading the person's privacy, taking away responsibilities, and arguing with the person while they are high will probably just make things worse.


Lay down enforceable consequences (like taking away his or her allowance or driving privileges) but don't make hollow threats you can't enforce.
Try to figure out what the underlying problem is. Work with a counselor to determine what's causing this behavior.

, Whether the person you're concerned about is your child or someone else, self-blame is unhelpful. The person's cocaine use is about him or her, not you. You can't control the person's decisions; all you can do is be supportive and encourage him or her to get help.Letting the person take responsibility for his or her behavior is essential when it comes to making a recovery.

When people turn toward drugs or other addictive substances — which can include alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, among other things — they focus on the presumed benefits of the changes they may provide, and not the potential harms.Some people try drugs because they are seeking to soothe or avoid physical or psychological pain. Others want to experience a sense of “escape” from their lives, for reasons ranging from trauma to boredom. They may use drugs in order to feel unique or “special,” or in order to feel “normal.”
A UK study conducted at the turn of the new millennium indicated that the top five reasons for drug use included relieving depression and to feel intoxicated. In such cases, people are clearly focusing on the short-term benefits of temporarily changing their perceptions.;
, Young people often have their first sip of alcohol, drag of a cigarette, or sexual experience based on the notion that “everyone else is doing it.” This same type of peer pressure is often a major reason why they try using drugs as well.People are more likely to try drugs when they are in settings where it is considered commonplace or normal to do so. After all, however independent they may be, everyone on some level wants to “fit in.”
The UK drug use study mentioned elsewhere also lists ""keep awake at night while socializing"" and ""enhance an activity"" among the top five reasons for drug use. Especially among young people, the pressure to be the ""life of the party"" may factor strongly in the choice to try using drugs.People who lack strong support networks — such as family, friends, organized activities, etc. — that discourage drug use tend to be more likely to try drugs.

, It cannot be denied that people of all backgrounds and socioeconomic levels try and abuse drugs. For instance, some 50% of young people in the UK age 16-24 have tried illegal drugs.That said, factors like poverty, unsettled home environments, and lack of access to educational or employment opportunities or social services can increase the likelihood of drug use by removing apparent alternatives.


The more reasons someone has to want to “escape,” and the fewer alternatives that are within reach, the more likely he or she is to try legal or illegal drugs. Stressful environments clearly influence drug use, as nearly 97% of respondents in the UK study listed a desire to ""relax"" as their main reason for using.However, an environment that produces a sense of boredom can also feed a desire to experiment or rebel by trying drugs. Plenty of young, well-to-do people try drugs for such reasons, for instance., Each and every one of us is wired differently, and some of us are more predisposed to trying drugs and/or becoming addicted to them. This does not mean we have no say in the matter, though — nobody must use drugs. It is simply easier for some people to get started than others.People who are more impulsive or prone to take risks are more likely to try drugs (or go hang-gliding, for that matter). Those of a more cautious or pensive nature are less likely, but of course not immune.
People with low self-esteem, high stress, or signs of depression are also more susceptible to drug use.

, Odds are, you are addicted to something — texting, chocolate, internet gambling, whatever it may be. How easy would it be for you to stop? Drug addiction is not simply a case of a lack of willpower or low moral fiber. A whole range of chemical and psychological processes take place that can make getting hooked much easier than getting free.No, you don’t have to give someone a “free pass” for being addicted to drugs. At some point, they made a choice and could have done otherwise. However, the better you understand the nature of addiction and the difficulty in breaking the cycle, the better prepared you will be to prevent and/or help deal with drug abuse.
Becoming addicted is a process, and so is ending addiction.

, The ""biopsychosocial model"" has been around for nearly forty years, and, as the long name indicates, deals with the range of biological, psychological, and social factors that combine to influence health and illness.The model also applies to drug abuse, as any one of these three factors can fuel addiction, while the combination of them can be especially difficult to overcome.Some people are more biologically disposed toward drug addiction, based on how the drug affects their bodies. No two people will experience a drug in the exact same way, and some will respond more strongly to the blocking or activating of neurotransmitter receptors (see the step below for more on this topic). This process can trigger a stronger need for more of the drug.
Many of the same psychological profiles — impulsiveness, lack of confidence, depressive tendencies, etc. — that can make people more likely to use drugs can also make them more likely to become addicted. People with difficulties in analyzing costs versus benefits are also more prone to addiction, as they cannot as effectively weigh the pros and cons.
The social / environmental factors that support trying drugs, such as peer pressure, lack of opportunity, or lack of adequate support networks, also increase the likelihood of addiction.

, All drugs (and addictive substances in general) affect the signals sent from and received by the brain; the unique properties of each drug varies the impact. Addiction is, in a sense, a process of “fooling” the brain and, over time, “teaching” it to need ever more of the substance. This is a major reason why stopping drug abuse is not simply a matter of motivation.Marijuana and heroin, for example, have structures similar to neurotransmitters, the “chemical messengers” that carry signals between the brain and the rest of the body. As such, they can trick both receptors in the brain and nerve centers in the body, creating responses to conditions that do not actually exist.
Meanwhile, drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine trigger a release of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine, which overstimulate regions of the brain responsible for movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. The sense of euphoria that comes from this overstimulation of the brain’s “reward system” can become a self-reinforcing pattern, where the brain needs ever more of the stimulation to recreate the euphoric response.

, Some people reject the notion of drug addiction as a disease, because they feel it absolves any guilt on the part of the person with the condition. However, a whole host of diseases are impacted at least in part by our choices, and drug abuse is no different. And, like many other diseases, it can be managed.Drug addiction can be categorized as a chronic brain disease because it turns something that was once voluntary into something essentially involuntary. Addiction begins with a choice, but that choice is, for all intents and purposes, removed from the equation. That’s why wanting to stop is not enough on its own to break the grip of addiction.
Diseases like diabetes or asthma, to name but a couple of examples, can often be effectively managed with the right combination of treatments, support, and desire. The same is true with drug addiction. Help is available to those who need it and want it.

, Drugs and alcohol mimic the essential need for a relationship with the Creator through a ”pseudospiritual” sense of connection and transcendence, and a false sense of “good” that in actuality leads to greater dissatisfaction, emptiness, despair and eventually death. Intimacy with G-d is the way to fill the existential loneliness felt by the addict, then followed with healthy relationships with the self and others. Although taking care of the body is important, the solution for addiction is primarily on the spiritual and altruistic plane. Self-centeredness is what fuels most problems and without a profound character change or spiritual awakening, the addict will continue to use drugs and alcohol in spite of all consequences, sincere desires to stop, or obvious necessity. They will often suffer a delusional belief or “insanity” that they can handle it “this time.”


One major problem the addict faces is he is overwhelmed with the thought that there is nothing to live for without the drugs, and he often can’t yet conceive of a life of happiness. So there is no way to fully replace and satisfy the sense of loss when the substances are removed without some meaningful form of pleasure that exceeds the quality of the pleasure experienced while under the influence. Spiritual pleasure through the transformation of character provides this unique “connection” sought which can correct the pursuit of all unhealthy pleasures."

Choose your seat or bunk carefully.,
Secure your belongings.,
Bring the necessary equipment to encourage sleep.,
Communicate to avoid being woken up.,
Set an alarm.",How to Sleep on an Airplane or Train1," Opt for the most comfortable one you can afford. Many airlines offer fully reclining seats that convert into flat beds in first class and sleeping berths with beds are often available in the first class compartments of trains. If first class travel is outside your budget, think about paying for extra leg room on a flight, especially if you are taller than average. Even if you’re stuck in coach however, you can still get a seat that works for sleeping.


Get a seat that reclines. If traveling by airplane, avoid the back row of the plane where the seats often don’t recline fully. On overnight train journeys, reclining seats with leg rests are usually available in coach class.
Pick somewhere quiet. On planes this is typically the middle rows where you are less likely to be distracted by the noise and movement of other passengers and flight attendants.
If you find that being near children can disturb your sleep, avoid bulkhead seats on a plane as this is often where the cribs are located.
Go for a window seat. Many passengers report that it is easier to drift off in a window seat where you can rest your head against the side of the plane or train. You are also less likely to be disturbed by another passengers getting out to the aisle.
Get a good bunk on the train. On longer European train journeys, shared couchette accommodation is popular and affordable. A couchette is a room with several bunks, which you will share with strangers. The rooms lock from the inside.The top bunk is generally more secure, but if you need to get up during the night to use the bathroom it can be difficult to do so in the dark.;
, This is more pertinent to train travel because although trains are generally very safe places, robberies do happen. When you're sleeping you are more vulnerable, so prepare for the worst by keeping valuables with you at all times. If you feel comfortable and safe it will be much easier to get some rest.


Consider using a money belt that straps to your waist or thigh.
If you are storing luggage in the overhead bins, make sure the opening is facing away from the aisle and consider using a lock., Packing these items in your hand luggage will help you create the right conditions for sleep.


An eye mask. Many airlines give these out for free when you board but they are not generally available on trains. Opt for an eye mask with a flap that comes down over the top of your nose to keep the light out as much as possible.
Earplugs. Airplanes and trains can be very loud places, with the sounds of other passengers, the meal and drink service and plane engine noise potentially disrupting your rest. Bring foam or silicone earplugs so that you can block out the noise and get some sleep.

, As you settle into your seat, tell your neighbor that you are planning on sleeping. On a plane, let the flight attendants know that you don’t need to be woken up for meals or drinks.

, Set it for an hour before you are scheduled to arrive at your destination. Remember that you may be crossing several time zones and be aware of the local time at your destination. Feeling prepared and ready for what's ahead will help you to relax and get some sleep without worrying about what will happen at your destination.

Follow your usual sleep routine as much as possible.,
Get as comfortable as possible.,
Use pillows and blankets.,
Watch what you eat and drink.,
Try some relaxation exercises.,
Do some breathing exercises.",How to Sleep on an Airplane or Train2," Imitating the normal night-time routine that you follow at home even though you are traveling can promote relaxation and rest, as your brain associates these activities with sleep.Do what you usually do at night - use the bathroom, brush your teeth, wash your face, change into sleep attire and read a book or watch a movie to help you drift off.
Turn off screens one hour before you want to fall asleep. The blue light they release affects our ability to fall asleep., Even in coach seats there are a few key things you can do to get comfortable.


Be aware of your body temperature. On planes, cabin temperature can vary considerably even during a single flight, so wear lighter layers that can be taken on and off easily.
Wear lose-fitting clothing in natural fibers that will allow your body to breathe and release heat. A hat or a hood may also be a good way of keeping light out of your eyes.
Get some comfy socks. Research suggests that wearing socks can promote sleep because heating cold feet causes the blood vessels in the feed to dilate (known as vasodilation). This signals to the brain that it can redistribute heat throughout the body and prepare for rest.Bring comfortable shoes for the train. Shoes are required to be worn at all times on Amtrak trains so pack some light plastic sandals or other comfortable footwear for the journey., If you have a sleeping bunk on a train, you can expect pillows and blankets be available. Some airlines also provide them.


A neck pillow is important if you are unable to fully recline because as we fall into a deep sleep the muscles in our body relax more and more. In a seated position, therefore, it is more difficult to fall into a deep sleep because the neck muscles have to keep working to support our heads.
Use the classic U-shaped travel pillow. Experts suggest using it the other way round, with the back of the pillow against the front of your neck. This will stop you jerking awake as your head falls downwards and could help with neck cramps.Bring blankets to keep you warm. On an airplane, buckle your seat belt over the blanket to avoid being woken up by cabin crew if the seatbelt sign goes on.

, Avoiding certain foods that inhibit good sleep and trying to eat at regular meal times can help you get some rest.


If you drink alcohol, limit it to one drink. Even though alcohol helps you fall asleep, it reduces REM (rapid eye movement) sleep which is the most restorative, so you will not sleep as deeply.Don’t consume caffeine before or during the flight as caffeine is a stimulant and inhibits sleep. Be aware that it can take up to 6 hours for caffeine to be eliminated from the body.Sip water to stay hydrated but not enough that you constantly need to use the bathroom.
Try to eat at regular times, as your internal body clock affects your digestion.It can be difficult to sleep after a heavy meal or if you are hungry.

, There are several you can do while in your seat. For example, deep muscle relaxation exercises where you flex or clench your muscles and then gradually focus on letting go and relaxing them can be very effective.Start with the muscles in your toes or fingers and then move carefully around the body, by the end you will feel a deep sense of relaxation.

, Deep breathing helps achieve a state of relaxation conducive to sleep. Focus on maintaining a steady inhale and exhale. If you find this difficult, try the 4-7-8 technique, where you inhale through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds and then exhale through your mouth for eight seconds.Repeat until you fall asleep.

Consider sleeping pills but know the risks.,
Consider supplements such as melatonin.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Use technology that will help you relax.,
Try your hardest to stay awake.,
Don’t stress if you can’t sleep.",How to Sleep on an Airplane or Train3," Many travelers use prescription or over-the-counter sleeping aids to help them get to sleep. However, prescription medications should only be taken if prescribed by a physician. Risks associated with sleeping pills include DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and feelings of drowsiness and disorientation upon awakening.Over-the-counter sleep aids have a more moderate effect but it is still recommended that you only take them if you can ensure that you have four uninterrupted hours to sleep.

, Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the body, it is also available as an over-the-counter supplement. Sleep researchers have found that melatonin levels are elevated after dark and remain elevated throughout the night, suggesting that it can promote sleep.Some studies also suggest that if you continue to take it when you arrive at your destination, it can ease the symptoms of jet lag as well., Essential oils such as lavender, chamomile and valerian have a relaxing effect and may help you drift off to sleep. When traveling, pack a small spray bottle with your desired essential oil mix and spray on your pillow or clothing.

, There are various apps and gadgets that you can use to help you settle down and get some rest.


Noise-cancelling headsets can reduce the noise of the plane engine quite effectively. This can help you to feel relaxed enough to sleep, especially if you are a nervous flyer.
Play white noise sounds. Research suggests that white noise, which you can download on your phone or music player, can also help promote sleep.Bring a music player with a relaxing playlist that will soothe you to sleep.

, Get comfortable, shut your eyes and then try to stay awake. Research suggests that this method, known as paradoxical intention, works and helps people fall asleep quicker. , Above all, don’t worry if you find you really can’t sleep. Traveling can be a stressful process, it may simply be difficult to relax and to drift off. Accept this for what it is and remember that it’s only a short-term problem. You can sleep once you get to your destination and it won't affect your whole trip.


Don’t compare yourself to other passengers who seem to be sleeping soundly, chances are that they aren’t sleeping as deeply as you think.
Even if you do sleep you may still be affected by jet lag, which is about how your body adjusts to the change in time zones and the disruption of its circadian rhythm.

Recognize evidence of intravenous drug use.",How to Spot Signs of Cocaine Use," Cocaine use causes the pupils in the eyes to dilate because of the drug's stimulant effects.Look for widened pupils (the dark inner circle of the eye), even in well-lit rooms.Dilated pupils may or may not be accompanied by red, bloodshot eyes.;
, Because many users administer cocaine by snorting it through the nose, one of the telltale signs of cocaine use is nasal stress. Look for signs of:


runny nosesnosebleedsdamage to the inside of nostrilsdifficulty swallowinga decreased sense of smelltraces of white powder around the nostrils, Because cocaine is a stimulant, one of the common physical symptoms of cocaine use is a rapid heart beat. In some cases, this may lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), hypertension, and cardiac death.A normal, healthy heart rate for most adults is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.Note that heart rate can be affected by other factors not associated with drug use, including physical activity, air temperature, body position, emotional states, and even certain legal medications.For this reason, heart rate alone should not necessarily be considered a definitive sign of drug use.

, Another common method of administering cocaine is by smoking the drug, typically in the form of a solid ""rock,"" called crack cocaine. Crack is formed by mixing powdered cocaine with water and baking soda.Signs of crack use include burned fingers or lips from lighting and smoking through a specialized device commonly called a crack pipe., Some users inject cocaine intravenously, using a syringe. This is done to experience immediate effects of the drug but comes with its own set of risks, including endocarditis (heart inflammation), cardiovascular disease, abscesses/infections, and an increased risk of overdose. Intravenous drug use also greatly increases the chances of transmitting a blood-borne disease like hepatitis and HIV.Signs of intravenous drug use include puncture marks (called ""track marks""), most commonly seen in the arm, and possible skin infections or allergic reactions caused by additives mixed with cocaine., One method of administering cocaine is by orally swallowing the drug. This produces fewer external signs of drug use than smoking, snorting, or injecting the drug, but it has been known to cause severe gangrene in the bowels and gastrointestinal tract due to reduced blood flow and GI sensitivity to the drug.In cases of oral ingestion, the most visible signs will probably be the symptoms typical of stimulant use, including:


agitationunusual excitementhyperactivitysuppressed appetiteparanoiadelusions, Cocaine and other stimulants often cause overly-energetic behavior.Common conversational clues of cocaine use include:


excessive talkativenessrapid speechconversations that jump around from one topic to another, Cocaine use frequently gives users a sense of invincibility.This can lead to high-risk behavior, including risky sexual activities, and violent tendencies, such as fighting, domestic violence, homicide, and suicide.Risky sexual activities may lead to pregnancy, illness, and/or sexually transmitted infections.High-risk behavior may lead to legal problems, serious injury, or death., Someone who consistently uses cocaine may end up spending large amounts of time and energy acquiring cocaine.Users of cocaine may also engage in:


shirking responsibilities or obligationsfrequently disappearing, going to the bathroom, or leaving the room, and returning in a different mood, Because cocaine is a stimulant, it can cause sudden changes in mood. This may mean irritability, but it could also cause sudden bursts of euphoria or a sense of carelessness, or a shift from one extreme to the other., A common behavioral characteristic of people who use drugs is withdrawing from social relationships, either to be alone or to be with others who use drugs.Though socially withdrawing from a group of friends may be caused by other factors, such as anxiety or depression, it may also be a sign of drug use.

, Many users of all kinds of drugs experience a loss of pleasure in activities or interests that had previously been enjoyable, but this is particularly problematic with cocaine use.That's because cocaine use harms the circuits in the human brain that are responsible for a sense of pleasure.Look for signs of depression and a seeming lack of pleasure in day-to-day activities as a symptom of long-term cocaine use.

, Depending on the method of administration, there may be a wide range of cocaine-related paraphernalia. Because snorting cocaine is the most common method of ingestion, common paraphernalia items include:


hollowed-out pensstrawsrolled up money or money that appears to have been rolled uprazor blades, credit cards, or ID cards, often with powdery residue on the edges, Smoking cocaine typically requires a pipe, which may be made from glass or constructed out of aluminum foil. Look for:


small glass pipesaluminum foillighters
empty plastic bags, including very small crack bags, Though less frequent than snorting or smoking the drug, intravenous injection of cocaine is still a common method of administration. Look for:


syringestourniquets, including belts and shoelacesspoons, which may have burn marks on the bottomlighters"

Determine if someone may be experiencing hallucinations.,
Listen for signs that the person is having blended sensory experiences.,
Notice if someone is experiencing distortions.,
Watch for intensified senses.,
Notice if someone is having trouble sleeping.,
Look out for a loss of appetite.,
Notice if someone has an inability to complete tasks.,
Watch for paranoia, distress, anxiety or disorientation.",How to Spot Signs of LSD Use1," Hallucinations are common for someone on acid.Someone who is using LSD may report seeing things that are not there, hearing things that are not producing sound, or smelling things that are not producing any odor. The person may also see things with his or her eyes closed.Watch the person to see if he or she seems to be interacting with things that are not there, such as staring at a wall, talking to him or herself, or grasping at the air.
These hallucinations can be frightening for the user and can become dangerous or deadly if the user is unaware of reality for too long.;
, Blended sensory experiences are common for users of hallucinogens such as LSD. This is when a person’s senses are swapped and the result can be quite scary. This shift in perception is also known as synesthesia, and it can cause a person to “hear” colors or “see” sounds.Pay attention to what the person says to determine if he or she might be having blended sensory experiences. For example, if the person says something like, ""That tree sounds beautiful,"" or ""I can see the music,"" then these are good indications that he or she may be on LSD.
Synesthesia alone is not a sign that someone is using LSD. A small percent of the population experiences synesthesia naturally, so don't get confused and think they are using LSD.

, Sometimes LSD users experience distortions of size, time, depth and speed, believing that an object is much larger than it actually is or that an object is moving much more quickly than it actually is. Someone who is using LSD can also experience an altered sense of time.Try asking the person questions, such as:


How far away is that tree?
How big is that house?
How long have we been sitting here?
What time is it?

, A person going through an LSD trip may experience heightened senses, causing them to see, smell, touch, hear, and taste things more powerfully. This is part of what is considered the psychedelic experience: the ability to see colors more vividly and feel things more deeply.A user will be unable to conceal their intense sensations and these signs should be easy to spot.


Try offering the person something to drink, or play some music, or put on a movie and see if he or she responds in a way that seems normal. If the person seems more impressed than usual or overwhelmed by the sensory experience, then it is possible that the person is using LSD.

, LSD can cause a person to develop insomnia, making it almost impossible for him or her to fall asleep or sleep for long periods of time. If you notice someone barely getting any sleep at all, this may be a sign that the person is a frequent LSD user., LSD can cause a reduction in appetite, making the person’s desire for food nonexistent. Watch out for a complete change in someone’s eating habits to spot this sign of LSD use.For example, if the person goes from eating regular meals to not eating at all, then this is a strong sign that he or she may be using LSD.

, Many times users of LSD are unable to complete simple tasks such as driving or operating machinery. Be aware of these signs as they may indicate that the person has taken acid.Other signs might include having trouble operating the remote control for the television, being confused by simple instructions, or struggling to find the right key to open his or her door.

, When on acid, some people may enter a totally dissociated state, often causing severe panic and fear. Some people experience delusions and can have terrifying thoughts and feelings.Pay attention to the person’s behavior. Some possible indicators that the person might be using LSD may include seeming agitated for no reason, sharing concerns that someone is after him or her, or seeming confused about his or her surroundings.
Someone who is on LSD may also ramble or make bizarre and unusual comments. This incoherent speech is often a sign that the person has used LSD."

Check to see if the person’s pupils are dilated.,
Watch for dry mouth or excess saliva.After taking LSD, some people experience dry mouth or excessive saliva production.,
Ask if someone’s toes or fingers feel tingly.,
Test for a rapid heart rate.,
Look out for sweating or chills.Oftentimes people who use LSD become very cold or very hot due to LSD’s effect on the body’s normal temperature.,
Watch for weakness.",How to Spot Signs of LSD Use2," Like many drugs, LSD causes a person’s pupils to dilate or become enlarged.This effect is known as mydriasis and occurs when your sympathetic nervous system is affected and this is a direct result of LSD use.Look into the person’s eyes to see if his or her pupils appear larger than normal.

, Pay attention to the sound and appearance of the person’s mouth to check for dry mouth or excess saliva.


For example, you may hear dry smacking sounds when the person speaks, or notice a little drool running down the corner of his or her mouth.

, Tingling fingers and toes are also common in people who use LSD. Ask the person who you believe is a user if he or she is experiencing any unusual tingling sensations.You might also notice that the person is rubbing his or her toes or fingers. This might be due to the discomfort of the tingling sensations.

, People on acid may also experience an increased heart rate.You can determine if the person’s heart rate is normal by taking his or her pulse. Try taking the person’s pulse if he or she will let you.


To check the person’s pulse, place your index and middle finger on the inside of the person’s wrist just below his or her thumb. Hold your fingers there until you can feel the pulse and then set a timer for 60 seconds. Count the person’s heartbeats until the timer beeps.
A normal pulse is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. If the person’s pulse is higher than this number, then he or she has a rapid heart rate., LSD changes your body’s ability to regulate internal temperature properly and as a result you may become sweaty or chilled.


Look for beads of sweat on the person’s forehead or see if the person is shivering.

, People on acid often have reduced strength and may report feeling weak.For example, the person might be unable to carry items that are not very heavy and have a difficult time standing for long periods of time because he or she suddenly feels tired and feeble.


Watch for changes in the person’s strength and listen to what he or she says as well. For example, the person might say that he or she is too tired to walk a short distance or that something he or she can usually lift with ease feels way too heavy to lift.

"
"
Watch for small colorful pieces of paper.,
Look for small dropper bottles.,
Check for sugar cubes.,
Monitor the person’s spending habits.",How to Spot Signs of LSD Use3," One of the most common ways that LSD is distributed is through small square pieces of paper.The sheets of paper often have colorful markings or cartoon characters on them. These papers are also known as blotters.


If you notice some small squares of colorful paper in the person’s room, then he or she may be using LSD.

, LSD drops are often stored in small dropper bottles, such as empty fresh breath drop bottles.The bottles are only about two inches tall. The liquid LSD may also be dyed to make it less obvious that the liquid inside is LSD.

, People who use LSD often apply drops of the drug to sugar cubes for consumption.If you notice any plastic bags containing sugar cubes in the person’s room, then this could be a sign that he or she is using LSD.

, Having a drug habit is expensive, so someone who uses LSD regularly may often be low on cash. Consider how often the person asks for money and how quickly he or she spends it.


For example, if the person asks to borrow money a few days after he or she has been paid, then this may indicate that he or she is spending money on drugs.

Work together to make a plan.",How to Know if Your Teenage Child Is Using Marijuana," Think about why you are concerned about your child. Do they seem to be feeling differently? Have they had unexplained changes in mood? Maybe it seems like your child is acting fearful for no clear reason. It is possible that it could be marijuana use. Marijuana is a psychoactive substance; it interacts with the user's brain, temporarily changing the way he or she thinks and feels., Smoking marijuana can cause cognitive impairment during a high which increases as more marijuana is consumed. If you think your child may be high, look for the following mental symptoms:Slowed reaction time
Impaired decision-making
Diminished memory
A tendency to ""space out"" or lose the thread of conversations
Paranoia or irrational beliefs that one is in danger. This symptom may be more common among users with existing psychiatric problems or a predisposition to them., It's normal to be concerned about your teenager, but it is also normal for teens to go through rapid mood changes. At times, trying to keep track of your child's moods can seem like you are on a roller coaster. It is important to remember that teenagers are going through a lot of changes, both physically and emotionally. Some changes in behavior and mood are typical. Try doing some research or asking a trusted friend for advice in order to help you better understand your teen's actions., Even though your teen might not always acknowledge it, you are one of the most important people in his life. Your relationship is sometimes a big factor in why your teen behaves the way he does. Try to step back and objectively think about your relationship. Has anything changed recently? Is it possible that your teen is acting differently as a reaction to something that is going on in your home life?, Although teens often behave in a confusing manner, not all of it can be chalked up to normal teenage angst. Pay close attention to all aspects of your child's life, while at the same time respecting their boundaries and growing independence. If the signs are all pointing to possible drug use, it might be time to be concerned. Also, check in with yourself. You know your child best. What does your gut tell you? Even if you think your child can do know wrong, make sure to realistically be aware of the signs., If you really think that your child is smoking pot, it is time to start actively looking for evidence. Red eyes are one of marijuana's most notorious side-effects.Marijuana sometimes gives a reddish or reddish-yellow cast to the whites of a user's eyes. This happens because marijuana may cause the capillaries in the eyes to dilate.It's also possible for marijuana smoke to irritate a user's eyes and cause redness, though marijuana doesn't have to be smoked to cause eye redness. Remember not to jump to conclusions. Did your child stay up too late last night studying (or playing video games)? That could easily cause red eyes.


Note that marijuana may also cause a user's pupils to dilate (open wide), although this is disputed and not as well understood as the red eye effect.A supply of anti-irritation eye drops (like Visine, etc.) can be an indirect sign of marijuana use, as these are often used to reduce redness of the eyes.

, Marijuana use can cause drowsiness, leading to reduced activity levels.If you're suspicious of your teenager, be wary of lots of time spent napping, vegetating on the couch, playing video games all day, and a general unwillingness to ""do anything.” Keep in mind, however, that this isn't the only reason a teenager may seem to need lots of sleep; many teens simply have a naturally higher sleep requirement than most adults.While the drowsy, relaxing effects of marijuana may seem amusing, they can also impair important cognitive functions like memory, reaction speed and critical thinking, making marijuana use dangerous in situations that require careful attention (like driving)., It's a common observation that people who are high on marijuana seem to act sillier than usual.Users may, for instance, have a tendency to giggle uncontrollably at things that aren't especially funny. Some may have a hard time acting serious in situations where it's required of them. If your teen can't seem to keep his or her goofiness under control, marijuana use may be the cause, though, as for many of the other common symptoms of marijuana use, it is far from the only possible cause.

, If your teen has started to embrace the pot culture, you may be able to pick up some clues based on their choice of entertainment. Movies that heavily feature drug use could potentially spark your child's interest in smoking pot. Some examples include Dazed and Confused, Friday, and The Big Lebowski. It's entirely possible that your teen enjoys these types of movies, but if you notice repeat viewings, you may want to pay attention to other signs of marijuana use., Look for changes in your child's patterns of coming and going. Habitual marijuana use can disrupt sleeping patterns, leading teenagers to oversleep during the day and stay up at night. If your teen is using marijuana you may notice other changes in behavioral patterns, such as hanging out with different friends, visiting different places, going out at unusual times, etc.


However, it's important not to make baseless accusations of marijuana use solely because your child has been keeping an odd schedule, or hanging out with friends you do not approve of. Behaviors like this can have many causes.

, Look for the drug itself. If you come across your child's hidden marijuana ""stash"" while doing laundry, for example, you have very strong evidence that he or she is using the drug. Because the drug is quite expensive by weight, it's likely that any single child's stash will be quite small, making it easy to hide in small crevices.


Marijuana usually comes in the form of green or greenish-brown clumps of plant material that resembles the herb oregano and has a strong, unmistakable odor.Marijuana is often stored in small plastic baggies, plastic pill containers, small jars, or other improvised containers.
Look for drug paraphernalia. Devices like pipes, grinders, bongs, rolling papers, roach clips, lighters, and other accessories are strong indicators of marijuana use and are usually some of the very strongest pieces of evidence a parent can find. Smell for the telltale marijuana odor. If you can smell marijuana or its smoke, you can be sure that it is nearby (or has been recently). Marijuana has a distinctive and often powerful smell. Fresh marijuana has a pungent odor sometimes described as being similar to the smell of a skunk, but less unpleasant. To some, marijuana can also smell sickly sweet or like yard waste.
Marijuana smoke has an ""herbal"" odor sometimes said to resemble that of fresh tomatoes and burnt tea leaves. Marijuana smoke is sometimes also described as smelling ""sweeter"" than tobacco smoke.The smell tends to linger in clothing, hair, and upholstery.

, Cases of ""the munchies,"" or increased appetite, have long been associated with marijuana use, but in recent years, research has actually definitively proven that marijuana use has a tendency to increase both the user's appetite and the palatability of food.Thus, if your child seems to have periods where he or she has an insatiable appetite for snacks, the cause may be marijuana intoxication.Note also that marijuana can sometimes make a user's mouth and throat feel dry or scratchy, which can lead the user to drink lots of water or other beverages.Keep in mind, however, that some increase in appetite during the teenage years is normal. The body undergoes rapid growth during adolescence, which can cause teens to eat more., Teenage marijuana use is illegal in the United States. If you discover that your teenager is using marijuana and has not been caught by authorities, then it is your responsibility to decide how to handle the situation. There's no single correct answer, but you can start by having a conversation about expectations. It's up to you to set rules for your children that you believe are reasonable.


Understand that your teenager may be curious about marijuana. During a child's teenage years, his or her friends or classmates may begin to use and talk about marijuana, so your child may eventually develop a natural desire to understand what the ""fuss"" is about.
Explain that regardless of one's feelings, marijuana possession and/or use is still a criminal offense in most states.Even in states where marijuana is legalized, teenagers are not allowed to possess or consume it, and adults are not allowed to provide it to minors. , Even if your child doesn't fully understand the effects of marijuana use, there's a very good chance that she or he will understand that using marijuana is something that many grown-ups deem to be bad. Thus, your child may be nervous, agitated, or defensive when you confront him or her about the evidence of their marijuana use. Your child may even initially lie in order to hide his or her marijuana use. Calmly discuss your views, while keeping an open mind to hear your child’s. Your goal is to come to a mutual understanding with your child, not to terrify him or her.

, Rather than forbidding marijuana use on the grounds of ""because I said so,"" it's a wiser idea to justify your decision by explaining the harmful effects of marijuana use to your child.This gives your decision much more legitimacy; a child is unlikely to respect or side with a parent who wants to take away his or her marijuana for no reason. You may, for instance, want to focus on some of the proven dangers correlated with heavy marijuana use at a young age, including:


Greater school dropout rate
Higher rates of anxiety and social disorders
Impaired memory and thinking skills
Increased rates of psychosis
Respiratory/lung problems (similar to those from tobacco use)
A greater likelihood of using other illicit drugs., Light, occasional usage of marijuana is unlikely to result in any personal issues or health problems. However, depending on where you live, as little as a single use of marijuana could conceivably land your child in trouble with the law. In addition, penalties associated with marijuana are almost always greater if the child is caught with lots of marijuana or has been selling it to others. Whether you personally plan on tolerating your child's marijuana use or not, make sure he or she clearly understands the law's stance on the matter.


In the U.S., recreational marijuana use is illegal for minors everywhere and illegal for adults in all but two states: Washington and Colorado. Marijuana intoxication while driving is treated similarly to alcohol intoxication.
Outside of Washington and Colorado, state laws regarding marijuana use vary greatly. For instance, in California, possessing marijuana for personal use is considered a misdemeanor punishable by fines and/or very short prison sentence.On the other hand, in neighboring Arizona, possessing marijuana for personal use is a felony with greater penalties, as is possessing marijuana paraphernalia., If this is the first time you've talked to your child about using marijuana, take the opportunity to clearly define your family's marijuana usage rules for the future. Emphasize that you're not upset about your child's initial curiosity but that you expect them to abide by your rules in the future. Make sure your child understands that she or he may still come to you with questions about marijuana in the future with no worries.Again, if your child knowingly broke your family's rules or lied to you, you can punish or chastise him or her. Explain to your child that you're not upset with his or her curiosity, but rather that he or she has disappointed you by breaking your clearly-defined rules.
Remember that although your teen is a child, they are quickly moving towards becoming an adult. Try to involve them in the decision making process, if your child seems receptive towards communicating with you. Sometimes, if given more responsibilities, your child might behave more responsibly."

Collect the necessary information.,
Contact local resources.,
Find national agencies.,
Stay anonymous.",How to Report Illegal Drug Activity1," If you suspect that there is illegal drug activity occurring in your area, you will want to make a report with the proper authorities. First, make sure that you have written down all of the information that you will need. You want to make sure that your report will be detailed and accurate, so that it will be useful to officials.Make sure that you are able to provide the exact address of the location where you suspect drug activity is happening. If you know the full names of the people who live there, provide that information, too.
If you see a car connected with the drug-related activity, take note of the license plate. You should also write down when the car arrives, how long it remains at the address, and how frequently it appears.
You should also tell the authorities if you see small packages being exchanged. These could be either drugs or money.
Note patterns, but also notice if those patterns change. Don't assume that the authorities are aware of any changes--you can always update your report as necessary.You will also want to point out anything else specific you know. Are there children living there? Are there dogs on the property? Is there a specific time of day where the activity most often occurs? Make notes of anything you think might be relevant.;
, Your first step should be to contact the police department nearest you. If you feel unsafe, or feel that something dangerous is presently happening, call 911 immediately. If you do not see immediate danger, you can call the non-emergency police phone number for your local precinct.Ask the person asking the phone who you can speak to about reporting drug-related activity. It is possible a clerk may take your report and pass it along to the appropriate department. If you would feel more comfortable, you can ask to be connected to an officer who handles drug related crimes.

, Often, a federal law enforcement agency will get involved if there is significant illegal drug activity. If you do not feel that your local agency is equipped to deal with the situation, you can reach out to a national agency. Two appropriate agencies to contact are the DOJ (Department of Justice) and the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration).Use a hotline or online form. Both the DEA and DOJ have phone numbers and websites you can use to report illegal drug activity.If you live in a large city, it is likely that a federal agency will have a local office near you. You can phone that office to report your information.

, Drug activity is often associated with violence and intimidation. It makes sense that you might want to stay anonymous when reporting a tip. Law enforcement agencies are perfectly happy to take your information about a possible crime without needing to know your name.When making a report, you might be asked to provide your personal information. However, this is completely voluntary. If you want to stay anonymous, you can.

Notice physical evidence.,
Be aware of suspicious behavior.,
Know which drugs are typically sold.,
Talk to your neighbors.",How to Report Illegal Drug Activity2," If you suspect illegal drug activity in your area, you will want to take note of certain signs. There are many indicators that can help you figure out if there is a possible crime occurring. Take note of specific things that you see happening near the address where you suspect there are drugs.Look for shoes with the shoelaces tied together and hung over telephone/power wires. This is a signal that a drug house is nearby.
Look for large amounts of plastic bags in the yard or on the porch of the house in questions.
A porch light that is on at odd hours of the day or night is another possible indicator of drug related activity.
If a house is occupied, but the blinds or shades are always drawn, this is another possible sign that something illegal is happening.
Make a note if you see people arriving at the house/building regularly for very short periods of time. It does not take long for drug deals to be completed.
Chemical odors are a sign that drugs are actually being manufactured on the premises. You should be aware of any strange strong smells that come from the suspected residence., You can keep an eye out for people acting in certain ways. For example, keep your eye out for large numbers of people visiting the house in question for brief periods of time. Another possible suspicious behavior is a person sitting in a car for extended periods of time while pedestrians approach him.


Also be on the lookout for people standing on corners and talking to others down the street on a two-way radio.

, When trying to determine whether there is drug related activity in your area, it is useful to know which drugs are most common in your city. This can help you know some more specific things to look for. For example, if methamphetamine is a big problem, you can learn how to spot a meth lab. Your local police department should be able to tell you which drugs are most commonly sold in your area.Meth is sold in small baggies. Many meth deals occur late at night. Users often suffer from lack of sleep, and this may be reflected in their appearance.
Crack is another common street drug, and is often found in areas with gang activity. Crack is often smoked from a small glass pipe, so make sure to pay attention if you see those lying around.

, If you have a neighborhood watch, you should voice your concerns to the organizers of that group. If you don't have a formal neighborhood patrol, you can ask neighbors that you know if they have noticed anything strange. Make sure not to make unfounded accusations.You do not have to use specifics when asking your neighbors if they have noticed any signs of drug related activity. You can ask vague questions and still receive some information.

"
"
Revitalize your neighborhood.,
Reduce crime.,
Do your civic duty.",How to Report Illegal Drug Activity3," When an area is known for a lot of drug-related activity, many residents choose to move out. Small businesses also tend to close, move, or have reduced hours. If you provide important information to law enforcement, you may be able to prevent this from happening in your neighborhood., Violence and robberies are often connected to drugs. If you are able to remove drug related activity from your neighborhood, chances are good that you will see a reduction in the overall crime rate. Your neighborhood will be a safer and happier place.Ask your local police department for information about the crime rate in your area and how it relates to drugs. It is good to be aware of what is happening in your area.

, In order to have a safe society, we all have to take responsibility for our areas. Part of fulfilling your responsibility is to report possible crimes. You are taking part in public safety, and helping to protect yourself and your neighbors.Remember to use caution when discussing your suspicions with others. You do not want to spread false information, nor do you want to draw unnecessary attention to yourself.

Job applicants are commonly drug tested as part of the hiring process, especially for low or entry-level jobs. In the United States, federal agencies that require drug testing adhere to testing procedures set by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).Private employers generally have more freedom in their drug testing procedure. However, laws vary from state to state.


In the United States, companies that hire commercial drivers are required to have a drug testing program in place.Certain employers might require you to be drug tested even after you are hired. Random drug-testing may be part of the terms of employment, or you may be required to undergo a test if you are involved in a workplace accident. Make sure you understand a company's drug testing policy before accepting a job offer.
Research your local laws if you are unsure whether certain activities or jobs require drug testing.;
, In the United States, employers that follow SAMHSA testing guidelines generally test for five specific classes of drugs. These drugs are:


Amphetamines (methamphetamine, amphetamines, ecstasy(MDMA))
Cocaine (Powder and ""crack"" forms)
THC (marijuana, hash, edible cannabis products)
Opiates (heroin, opium, codeine, morphine)
Phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust)
Alcohol is occasionally tested for in addition to the above drugs.

, Private employers are not required to perform the basic SAMHSA test. Many opt for an expanded test that screens for additional drugs. The most common additions are:


Barbiturates (phenobarbital, butalbital, secobarbital, downers)
Benzodiazepines (Valium, Librium, Xanax)
Methaqualone (Quaaludes)
Methadone (a drug used to treat heroin addiction)
Propoxyphene (Darvon compounds)
Nicotine (and nicotine by-product, cotinine)

, The following drugs are detectable in a hair test, but are only rarely tested for.Hallucinogens (LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, peyote)
Inhalants
Anabolic Steroids
Hydrocodone (Oxycodone, Vicodin)

, After you consume any drug, the active chemicals in the drug will circulate through your body. These chemicals, or certain other chemicals produced when your body processes the drug (called metabolites), can accumulate in your hair follicles. As a strand of hair grows, its follicle will deposit these chemicals in it. Hair tests look for these chemicals in a small sample of your hair.

, Hair tests cut a small sample of your hair (usually 1-3 clumps of about 50 strands each). Most cuts are taken from the back of the head so as not to ruin your haircut.


The standard detection window for the hair test is 90 days. Because hair grows about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in 90 days, hairs with a length of about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) are targeted for cutting. Longer hairs will give a longer window of detection.For instance, a 6-inch long strand of hair can potentially reveal drug use from a year ago. However, 90 days is the most common testing window, so, generally, long strands of hair are cut to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) before being tested.
Depending on the drug and the specifics of the testing process, a hair test may or may not be able to detect whether or not use has been discontinued. For instance, opiates bind tightly to the shaft of hair, while cocaine can migrate along the hair shaft. In this case, certain tests can detect the approximate date of the opiate use based upon its position in the hair shaft, while this is impossible for cocaine.If no hair is available on your head (you're bald or have a shaved head), hair from other parts of your body can be tested.Note: Because it can take up to a week for drug-affected hair to grow above the scalp, hair tests can miss very recent drug use. For this reason, some employers will also require a urine test, which can detect most drug use within the last few days. Know which tests you will have to take.

, As soon as you know you'll have to undergo a drug test, stop taking drugs. If possible, cease all drug use before you even begin looking for jobs. Hair tests can detect the use of some drugs, like cannabis, up to 90 days after it's occurred.Because of this, it may be best to stop drug use up to three months before you think you'll be in the job market.

, If you've used drugs often within the last 90 days and you have a hair test at the end of the week, you may consider using a commercially-available product or a DIY home-method to improve your chances of passing your test. These methods have not been proven to work in a scientific setting. They are supported only by individual, unverified stories of success.

, You will probably gag, but it's worth it! Work the vinegar through your hair slowly, over a 10 minute period to get maximum saturation.

, Refrain from rinsing. This gives the vinegar time to sink into the hair and scalp.

, Use a treatment with a 2% salicylic acid concentration. Again, pour slowly and allow liquid to soak into your hair. Leave the vinegar and acne treatment in your hair for about 30 minutes.

, Do not rinse the vinegar and acid out of your hair before doing this.

, Scrub this onto your scalp and hair. Let this mixture sit for about 20-30 minutes.


If possible, concentrate these products on more the back of your head. Samples are most commonly taken from this area.

, Do not wash or condition.

, Rinse well. Use the conditioner treatment that usually comes with the hair colour kit.

, Instructions for this remedy vary - some recommend repeating once a day in the four or five days leading up to your test, while some recommend only one treatment.

, A quick online search should reveal a variety of commercially-available shampoos and treatments that claim to thwart hair drug tests. These can be expensive, so search for a well-reviewed, reasonably affordable one.


Beware false reviews and testimonials. It's easy for unscrupulous companies to pay for positive reviews or even fabricate them entirely.

, Don't depend on testimonials on the site that's selling the product - seek out forum posts and other candid online discussions. Often, if a product doesn't work, you'll be able to find irate complaints or rants online.


Choose a product with a money-back guarantee. It seems obvious, but it bears mentioning. Because these products can be quite expensive, you'll want to protect your investment if you end up losing the job.

, Remember that, because these products aren't scientifically verified, you're not guaranteed success.

, It's unlikely you'll be hired if you took the test as part of an application process. However, if you took the test after an accident or for a probation program, you will probably be subject to criminal penalties. A lawyer can help you dispute the results of the test and advise you how to proceed.

, Popular conceptions of drug use can be subject to racial stereotypes. If you're a racial minority, you may have a chance, however small, of proving discrimination during the testing process. If you were tested and another applicant was not, for instance, you may be able to claim discrimination.


Dense, kinky hair is sometimes claimed as giving false positives on drug tests. Although scientific studies haven't been able to prove this,you may be able to trick an ignorant employer.

, Dispute the results any way you can in an attempt to get a second chance. One way to do this is to claim that a failed test is the result your consuming something innocent that gives a false positive. Some things that can give false positives are:


Poppy seeds. Because opiates are derived from the poppy plant, muffins or bagels with poppy seeds can give false positives.
Adderall/ADHD medication. Medicines prescribed in the treatment of ADHD are usually members of the amphetamine family of drugs.
Certain cold/flu medications. Over-the-counter cold drugs can contain the active ingredient pseudoephedrine, which is an amphetamine used in the manufacture of methamphetamine (meth.)
Nicotine replacement therapy products, such as gums like Nicorette, patches such as Nicoderm CQ, prescription nicotine inhalers, and other nicotine-based smoking cessation aids will cause a positive result for nicotine and cotinine.
Heavy exposure to second-hand smoke ('passive smoking') may also cause a positive nicotine/cotinine test, even if you yourself have not used nicotine or tobacco
More employers are testing employees and job applicants for nicotine/cotinine, and a positive result may result in loss of employment or a refusal to hire, even if you are in a medically prescribed smoking cessation program, and even if you are not a smoker but merely live in a smoking household.

, Occasionally, instead of firing an employee who fails a drug test, employers will require the employee to undergo a treatment program or recommend they seek help on their own. Treating an employee can be much less expensive for the employer than a hefty severance package. In this case, don't refuse treatment, even if you're a responsible user - you'll probably be fired and might lose your pension or benefits.

Look for the behaviors associated with inhalant abuse.,
Learn the delivery method.,
Notice the behavioral and physical effects.,
Recognize long-term behavioral effects.,
Understand long-term medical effects.",How to Spot Signs of Inhalant Abuse1," There are certain behaviors that may indicate inhalant abuse. These include odd smells of chemicals on your child's breath or in his room. You may also find stashed or hidden paint cans or cleaning materials around his room or around your house. He may also have stains or marks left on his hands, his clothes, or on his face from paint or markers used as inhalants., There are materials that are associated with the dispersal of inhalants. Inhalant abuse can be done using the inside of a paper or plastic bag, in balloons, or through a saturated cloth.


Look for these materials in your child's room or notice if he carries them around., Immediately after inhaling the product, the person experiences a sense of euphoria as well as dizziness or faintness. They will also have incoherent or slurred speaking and poor coordination.Following this initial feeling of being high, many who abuse inhalants will experience:


Sleepiness
Lack of inhibition
Irritation
Faintness
Hallucinations or delusionsNausea
Slurred speech
Changes in mood
Decreased appetite, If your child has been abusing inhalants for a long time, there are additional symptoms that might arise. Long-term inhalant abuse can produce apathy, depression, and poor judgment.Because inhalants affect the nervous system and increase levels of dopamine, causing great pleasure and reward, inhalant abuse can become habitual and addictive., Long-term inhalant abuse has been linked to a greater risk of STDs, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. There is a link between inhalant abuse and developing tumors as well as a decreased immune system.Additional dangers include bone marrow loss, hearing loss, and heart and lung damage.In some cases, inhalant abuse can cause death when the person uses very potent or highly concentrated substance, which causes suffocation or heart attack.This has been termed sudden sniffing death. Chemicals that are associated with sudden sniffing death included chemicals from air conditioning coolant, butane, electronic contact cleaners, some aerosols, and propane."

Abstain from drugs.,
Test yourself.,
Give yourself as much time as possible.,
Choose the test you're likely to pass.,
Learn about urine tests.,
Learn about blood tests.,
Learn about hair follicle drug testing.,
Don't count on excuses.,
Beware of trusting out-of-date tips.",How to Prepare for Drug Testing1," This might seem like the most obvious way to prepare for drug testing, but it can also be the most difficult. Whether you're a long-time user of drugs or someone who's just tried them for the first time, a drug test will pick up on these chemicals in your body. Legally, a drug test does not differentiate between someone who's just tried a drug once and someone who's a daily user.


Because tests can detect drug residue in your system, it will help to stop using drugs immediately if you're using this method to prepare for your drug test.
As drug tests have increased in accuracy, it's less and less likely that you'll have a false positive on your results. For example, ibuprofin used to create a false positive for marijuana. With improvements in testing, this is no longer the case.;
, Using a home detection kit won't be as accurate as the tests available by larger drug testing companies, but they can provide a baseline from which to find out the level of detectable drugs in your system. If you have a week or more before your drug test, invest in some home tests.Take a urine sample first thing in the morning, when your urine is most concentrated. If this sample comes back drug-free, you can feel more relaxed about your pending drug test. It's still advisable to refrain from taking drugs until the test date, however.
If this sample comes back positive, you'll be able to practice diluting your urine, or any of the other strategies mentioned below.

, While there are ways to Pass a Drug Test on Short Notice, ideally you'll have time to research the type of drug test you'll be given, and ensure that your chances of passing the drug test are high.You'll want to refrain from any drug use during the time you're preparing for your drug test. If you're more likely to use drugs when you're drinking, you may also want to avoid alcohol during this time, even though drug tests will not generally be designed to detect the presence of alcohol.
Ideally, you'll have a couple of weeks from the last time you used drugs until the date of the drug test. This time period won't eliminate all traces of drugs from your system, but it provides time to help you prepare for your test.

, You may not be given a choice about which drug test you'll receive, but if you do have a choice, you can better your chances of passing the test. A blood test is designed to measure current level of impairment, but is less likely to pick up on residual drug measurements. Blood tests are generally most reliable for drug use in the previous 4 hours, though chronic heavy smokers may have positive results for several days.If you're a regular smoker, you might want to take a urine test instead.
If you've just begun to use drugs and are brought in for a drug test, you might want to choose a hair follicle test.

, To provide a urine test, you'll have to prepare to remove your outer clothing and everything in your pockets. You'll leave your clothes outside the testing room. The testing company will secure all your personal possessions, so it's best to bring as little as possible to the drug test.You'll enter a testing room, which contains a toilet. The door to this toilet is monitored, but the toilet room itself allows you privacy.
You'll be expected to provide a urine sample into a small plastic cup.
Each urine sample will be examined for: temperature; color; odor; presence of foreign objects or material; tampering, adulteration, or substitution.
If you've smoked recently, you may do better with a urine test than a blood test.

, A blood test, or ""tox screen,"" can detect present illicit drugs, though not residual drugs in your system. A blood test is commonly used at the scene of an accident in order to assess current level of impairment. This is unlikely to be the type of drug test offered in random drug screening or as a condition for a job applicant.Make sure you have an updated list of all medications you're taking, whether prescription, over-the-counter (such as aspirin or ibuprofin), supplements and vitamins. The blood test will detect all current medications.
This may be offered to a victim of rape in order to learn whether they were given a date rape drug that affected their ability to consent.
Professional athletes are required to consent to blood tests in order to determine whether they're taking performance enhancement drugs.

, Hair testing uses a person's hair to detect trace amounts of illicit drugs present in the person's system. They are reported to be 5 times more effective than urine tests at detecting illicit drug use.The typical hair sample is taken from 1 1/2 inches from the person's scalp. As hair grows at roughly 1/2 inch per month, this would mean that the hair tests for the presence of drugs in the person's system for the previous 90 days.
It takes 5-10 days for drugs to become detectable though this method. If you've only just started to use drugs and are brought in for a drug test, this might be the best method to choose.
Hair colors and dyes are unlikely to affect any change in the hair follicle drug test. However, some shampoos or hair conditioners may alter the hair follicle test.

, For example, stating that your roommate likes to get high, and so your positive test comes from her drug use rather than your own is unlikely to help you. The standard cut-off rate of detection of THC as detected in urine samples is 50 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml). To achieve a rate of this level through second-hand, ""passive"" smoking, a person would literally have to be shut up for hours in a closet full of other people smoking marijuana.Your best way to avoid getting caught by a drug test is to be proactive in evaluating your own situation.
A potential employer is unlikely to provide the results to your drug test, and you won't be offered the opportunity to tell your side of the case. If your drug test comes back as failed, you won't be hired.

, As drug tests have become more sophisticated, strategies that might once have worked - such as sprinkling salt in a urine test, or substituting fake urine for your own sample - are likely to be detected. The punishment for tampering with a drug sample may be worse than failing a drug test, even resulting in criminal charges in some states.Poppy-seed bagels don't actually cause false positives.
Don't waste your money on miracle-cleanses, or counting on adding an adulterant to your drug test to game the results. Given the pressure companies face to comply with federal drug laws, these are unlikely to work.

"
Drink lots of fluids before the test.,
If you notice your pee becoming excessively watery — a clear tip-off for some analyses — try taking the vitamins B-2 or B-12.,
Try taking diuretics, like Midol.Diuretics help your body rid itself of water and sodium.Coffee, diet pills, and certain prescription drugs are also diuretics, but they're not as effective as Midol at ridding your body of the water that contains those telling metabolites.,
Try peeing into the cup mid- or end-stream, not immediately.,
Try taking aspirin a couple hours before the test.,
Don't waste your money on commercial products that disguise or clean urine.",How to Pass a Urine Drug Test1," Also called flushing, this method remains one of the easiest, cheapest, and most successful ways to get a false negative on a pee test. Pee tests do not measure the amount of drugs in urine; they measure the amount of metabolites in the urine. Drugs are ingested and then come out of the system as metabolites.Drinking more water will help your body produce metabolites that aren't tainted by drugs.


Urinalysis checks for 31 different metabolites caused by marijuana, 4 caused by cocaine, 3 caused by opiates, 1 caused by Phencyclidine, and 5 caused by amphetamines.
Be careful not to over-hydrate. Although rare, it is possible to drink too much water and damage your internal organs, enough so to become fatal.This is called water intoxication.;
, These can also be found in B-Complex multivitamins, and turn the color of your urine yellow. Take about 50 to 100 milligrams.

, It may sound weird to have Midol if you're a dude, but don't worry, you'll thank Midol after your drug test comes back negative.

, How you pee into the urinalysis cup matters. Try peeing a little bit into the toilet, and then direct your stream into the cup when you're nearing the end of your stream. Pee near the end of the stream is supposed to contain fewer metabolites than pee at the beginning.


Try also to pee several times in the morning before taking the drug test. Your pee will contain more metabolites if you haven't already gone to the bathroom before you take the test. Be smart and chug some water first thing when you wake up the day of the test.

, One study suggested that taking 4 aspirin 4 to 6 hours before the screening can mess with the test, EMIT.Don't worry, 4 aspirin in a single serving will leave you fine, albeit a little light-headed.

, There's no evidence that these products work. On top of this, they're expensive, and many of the ingredients are simple diuretics, which you can purchase or make for far less cash. It's pretty safe also to assume that drug testing companies are trying just as fast to come up with ways to detect these substances as manufacturers are coming up with ways to invent them. If you can, stay away.

In the US, certain government agencies are required by law to practice drug screening, while private companies have more freedom in whether they choose to test.Drug tests test for presence of the drug's active chemical or one of its metabolites (chemicals the body produces when processing the drug.) Most commonly, drug tests search for these chemicals in your urine, blood (or another bodily fluid, and/or hair.


A variety of tests are available to employers, who can choose how carefully they want to screen by opting for a more-or-less thorough test. In the US, the most basic drug test is the one mandated by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for certain federal agencies. This test screens for five common drugs:

Amphetamines (methamphetamine, amphetamines, ecstasy(MDMA))
Cocaine (Powder and ""crack"" forms)
THC (marijuana, hash, edible cannabis products)
Opiates (heroin, opium, codeine, morphine)
Phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust)


However, employers commonly screen for other drugs. Drug testing can be expensive for employers - the more drugs an employer screens for, the more expensive the test. A company that is hiring a lot of people and testing all potential hires may not opt for comprehensive tests, which can cost upwards of $100 each.
The best way to improve your chances for passing any drug test, of course, is to abstain from drugs for as long as possible before your test.;
, Ironically, the law offers drug and alcohol users several protections when applying for jobs. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has a couple provisions that could help you:


The ADA makes it illegal for any employer to test a prospective employee without first making a conditional offer of employment. That means no drug test can be required of you unless there's a genuine offer on the table. As not every applicant is offered a job, that lowers the chance that you'll be tested for a given position you've applied for. Additionally, the ADA prevents employers from withholding job offers based on the results of an alcohol test.The ADA also says you can't discriminate against prospective employees on the basis of past drug-related problems. The good news is that if you had a problem with drugs in the past, they can't use that against you. However, they can reject your application if they believe you're a current drug user.

, Several testing methods are available to employers. The most common are hair, blood, and urine tests. Each has a different window of time for which it can detect the presence of drugs. See the table below:

, Unless you're being ordered by the court, an ordinary employer cannot watch you give a urine sample. This gives you the opportunity to take advantage of the safest, most effective way of passing a drug test: use the urine of a drug-free friend.


Make sure it's relatively fresh. If you're not going to use it for a couple of days after collection, keep it in the fridge.
Be sure to bring it up to body temperature before giving the sample. The best way to this is to wear it against your skin for a few hours before you have to give the sample. Try taping a bag to your thigh for easy access when making your sample.
If you're a woman, you can try keeping a tied-up condom full of clean urine in your vagina, discretely puncturing it with a nail when you need to deposit your sample.

, For sale on the internet are a variety of synthetic urine substitutes, both powdered and liquid. These substitutes are manufactured in a laboratory. They are typically used by warming them up and keeping them in a small bottle, then depositing in place of your own urine.


These can be detectable if the lab decides to test for them, so use with caution.

, One commonly-reported home remedy is that drinking massive amounts of water a few days before—or on the day of their test—can expel traces of the drug from the urinary tract. This is unlikely - much more likely is that it will merely dilute the chemicals tested for in your urine. Since most tests have minimum concentrations needed to register a positive, this method may actually provide a small benefit.


Note that some tests now test for creatine metabolites in your urine. If the concentration of this naturally-ocurring metabolite isn't high enough, they'll suspect you're trying to dilute your urine. To counteract this, consume lots of red meat or creatine powder starting 3 days before the test. This will build up your creatine levels so that you're less likely to be caught diluting.Sometimes urine tests will even take into account the urine's color. A very light or clear urine signifies a possible attempt at dilution, while a more yellow urine is considered normal. An hour or two before your test, consider taking 50-100 mg of B2 or B12 complex vitamins to help give your urine a yellower color.
Don't go overboard. Drinking truly massive amounts of water can result in water poisoning, a potentially fatal condition. Trust your body - if you feel uncomfortable, stop drinking.

, If your drug of choice is marijuana and you're overweight, losing fat well in advance of your test can help your chances. The metabolites of THC, the active chemical in marijuana, are stored in your fat cells. For this reason, people with high body fat levels are have a longer detection period for marijuana. The higher your body fat, the longer marijuana will be detectable in your system. Lowering your body fat through diet and exercise can give marijuana users a long-term advantage when taking drug tests.


If a test is imminent, don't try to starve yourself to better your chances. Weight loss takes time - the amount of body fat you'll need to affect your chances of passing a drug test is virtually impossible to lose in a week or two. You're most likely to just make yourself miserable without improving your chances.

, Diuretics are substances that stimulate you to urinate. Some home remedy sources suggest that, by stimulating urination, diuretics help to ""flush"" a user's system of drug metabolites. However, this method isn't well-supported by scientific evidence. Claims that cranberry juice can ""flush your system"" are unfounded.


A slightly better use of a diuretic may be to use it in conjunction with the dilution method above to stimulate generous urine production.
Other common diuretics are coffee, herbal tea, beer, and iced teas.

, Many home remedies simply don't work, even if they're advertised as miraculous. These methods have no effect on your test results. Don't waste any time or money:


Taking niacin. There is no scientific evidence that niacin helps you beat a urine blood test.Additionally, high doses of niacin can result in itchy skin reactions (and, at very high doses, liver damage.)
Adding vinegar, ammonia, or bleach to your urine. These chemicals are acids and bases, so they'll change your urine's pH level, but aren't definitively known to eliminate drug metabolites. Additionally, your tester may be able to tell that you've tampered with your test from the smell, appearance, and/or chemical composition of your urine.

Never drink bleach. It's toxic and can kill you.


Adding Visine to your urine. In the presence of Visine, false-negative results were obtained only for THC metabolite 9-carboxy-THC for the EMIT-d.a.u. and TDX urine cannabinoid assays. Visine also decreased 9-carboxy-THC as measured by the Abuscreen assay. At low concentrations of Visine, false-negative cannabinoid results were attributable to the benzalkonium chloride ingredient of Visine. The added Visine was not detectable by routine urine analysis and had no effect on the activity of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-drug conjugate used in the EMIT-d.a.u. assays. Moreover, analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed no chemical modification or loss of 9-carboxy-THC in the Visine-adulterated urine specimens. However, Visine did increase the adhesion of 9-carboxy-THC to the borosilicate glass specimen containers. Results of ultra-filtration studies with Visine suggest that 9-carboxy-THC partitions between the aqueous solvent and the hydrophobic interior of benzalkonium chloride micelles, thereby reducing the availability of 9-carboxy-THC in antibody-based assays. Taking goldenseal. Goldenseal is an herb whose root is used to make herbal medicines. It won't effect the results of a urine test. This misconception comes from pharmacist John Uri Lloyd's novel Stringtown on the Pike , where the herb is used to thwart a test for the poison strychnine.
Taking pectin. Pectin is a naturally-occurring chemical found in plants often used in the production of jams and jellies. Anecdotal stories claim that pectin coats the walls of either the stomach or the bladder, preventing the passage of drug metabolites. Neither claim is supported by scientific evidence.
Add salt to your urine. Salt will have no effect on the levels of drug metabolites in your urine. This method also has glaring defects, such as the fact that, if undissolved, salt will sink to the bottom of your sample, where it's easily observed. Use common sense and don't blow your chances by sprinkling salt in your sample.

, Blood tests usually have very short detection windows, as blood tests usually search for the presence of the drug itself in your system rather than one of its metabolites. They're often administered right after an accident to determine whether you're under the influence of any substances.Blood tests administered after an accident will almost always screen for alcohol as well, which is usually only detectable by a blood test for a day or less.Because of this, the best, easiest way to pass a blood test is to refrain from drugs and alcohol for a day or two before your test. For many drugs, that's as long as it will take for traces of the drug to leave your system.
Blood tests are the most expensive form of drug testing. Because of this and the method's short detection period, you're unlikely to be required to pass one as part of a hiring process.

, The blood test is used to assess drug or alcohol use at the time of the test, while the urine test is used to search for drug use in the period leading up to the accident. See Method Two above for urine test remedies.

, Drugs sometimes can be taken in more than one way, which can affect the observable levels of the drug in the bloodstream. THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, for instance, peaks at very high levels within an hour after smoking marijuana. However, if you eat a marijuana ""edible,"" you'll have a much lower and more gradual curve for your blood THC levels, peaking about four hours after ingestion.Generally, ingestion methods that get you high faster, like snorting, smoking, and injection, have higher, earlier blood concentration peaks than ""slower"" methods, like oral ingestion.
Knowing this, you can plan your drug use so that you avoid longer-acting ingestion methods in the days before your test.

, A variety of herbal supplements are available for sale online which claim to ""detoxify"" your blood, improving your chances for passing a test. These claims are made on the basis of no scientific evidence. Pursue these pricey options with heavy skepticism.


Homemade combinations of herbs suffer from the same problems - none are supported by scientific evidence. Additionally, since they are made at home and are not subject to quality testing, they may be impure or improperly-dosed. Use great caution with so-called ""home remedies.""

, Of all the testing methods, hair tests generally have the longest detection period. For the most-commonly tested drugs, a hair test will be able to detect use up to 90 days in the past, depending on frequency of use.However, because hair tests search for the presence of drug metabolites in the part of the hair above the scalp, there is a several-day window after taking drugs in which metabolites are present in the base of the hair under the skin but not in the portion above the skin. Thus, hair tests can miss drug use if it's within the last 5-7 days/, Hair tests typically cut a small 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) sprig of your hair from the back or side of your head, as close to the root as possible.This hair length tests for use in about the last 90 days. If your hair is shorter than this, your sample will theoretically allow for a shorter period of detection.


However, this can backfire. If your head hair is too short, a tester may choose to look for a sample from a different location on your body (armpit, chest hair, etc.) Because body hair grows more slowly than head hair, a 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) sample of body hair can represent an even longer detection window than a sample from the head., Know that most testing agencies do not test for adulterants in hair tests because there are no adulterants that are known to affect a hair test's results. So, your home remedy isn't likely to be detected, but there's also very little (if any) evidence that it will work.


Buy a shampoo treatment. A wide variety of hair treatments advertised as improving your chances for beating a drug test are available online. These can be very expensive, and none have been scientifically proven to work. If you want to try one, choose one with a money-back guarantee.
Try an improvised hair wash. See our guide on passing a hair test for one common home recipe for your hair. All home remedies for beating a hair test are supported only by hearsay. None have been proven to work in a scientific setting.

Look for volatile solvents.,
Recognize gasses.,
Learn about aerosols.,
Notice nitrites.",How to Spot Signs of Inhalant Abuse2," Many inhalants that are abused can be found in the home or office. All inhalants can be grouped into larger categories based on their properties. The first category is volatile solvents, a group of chemicals that originate in a liquid state, but become a gas at room temperature.Products in this group include:


Paint thinner
Degreasing type cleaners
Gasoline
Glue
Correction liquid such as White Out
Markers with felt tips such as permanent markers or dry erase markers, Another category of inhalants is gases. This group includes products which contain gasses, which are typically under pressure. The hit taken off aerosol gases, such as those found in whip cream, are often referred to as whippets.Common types of gases are:


Butane tanks
Lighters
Whipped cream cans
Medical gasses such as chloroform, A third category of inhalants is aerosols. These chemicals are usually products that are sprayed and can then be inhaled from a bag or rag. These products are sprays such as:


Hair spray
Spray paint
Non-stick sprays such as vegetable oil from a spray can
Keyboard cleaners in a can, The last group of inhalants is known as nitrites. These are a special class of inhalant because they do not affect the nervous system like other inhalants. They work to dilate blood vessels and relax the muscles.Because of this, nitrites are used as sexual enhancers, whereas other inhalants are used to alter mood.


Nitrites are often called poppers or snappers and are sold in small bottles labeled for other uses, such as, leather cleaner, room deodorizer, or liquid aroma."

Diagnose inhalant abuse.,
Treat inhalant abuse.,
Seek immediate medical help.",How to Spot Signs of Inhalant Abuse3," Because inhalant abuse has many harmful effects on the body and brain, many researchers of inhalant abuse suggest that the condition should be treated as a substance use disorder as well as a possible mental health diagnosis. Experts recommend treatment that includes a medical exam to investigate the extent of damage to the nervous system, kidney, liver, heart, and lungs. The doctor will also look for signs of lead poisoning, malnutrition, and signs of reduced intellectual functioning. , Treatment facilities such as residential drug treatment are recommended, but it is noted that the typical stay of 28 days to a month is probably not sufficient for inhalant abuse. Researchers suggest that inhalant abuse be treated with a variety of modalities including art therapy, family therapy, activity therapy, and music therapy. If a person has become dependent on inhalants, he will need to seek detox treatment, which can usually take 14 to 28 days for inhalants. This is because the chemicals are often deposited into fat stores, meaning it takes longer for them to leave the body.
If inhalant abuse is less serious or has not yet become chronic, outpatient treatment and evaluation is beneficial to understand recommendations for therapy or inpatient treatment. Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselors are equipped to evaluate and treat a variety of substance abuse disorders.

, If a loved one is in crisis or shows signs of severe intoxication, such as non-responsiveness, slow or shallow breathing, or has become unconscious, call 911 immediately. He may be going into shock, suffering from a larger issue related to the inhalant abuse, or dropping into sudden sniffing death.

Drink more water.,
Take high doses of B-complex vitamins.,
Drink diuretics.,
Find out more information about the drug test.,
Speed your metabolism through exercise.,
Add fatty foods to your diet.",How to Prepare for Drug Testing2," It's recommended that you start drinking more water immediately, upon preparing for a drug test. Drink at least 78 ounces (about 10 cups) of water per day, up to one gallon (128 ounces).Other beverages are also good as diuretics, but water will help flush your system of everything that goes through your bladder, including THC metabolites.
Don't consume more than 128 ounces of water in a 24-hour period, or you can risk injury or even death from water intoxication., B vitamins will color your urine yellow, giving it the appearance of being less diluted than it really is. Despite reports to the contrary, there's no evidence that the same is true for Vitamin C.B-vitamins can be taken in tablet form, or ingested in nutritional yeast.
Don't take B-vitamin supplements if you're pregnant or breast-feeding.

, Diuretics promote urination, which flushes the system. Examples of diuretics include tea, coffee, and cranberry juice. Over-the-counter medications can also be used if your drug test will take place in less than one week.Be careful of taking diuretics if you're pregnant, or if you're diagnosed with diabetes, pancreatitis, lupus, gout, or kidney problems.Some medications may interact negatively with over-the-counter diuretics. Talk to your pharmacist for more information.

, Standard procedure is to first screen the samples with an immunoassay test (such as EMIT® or RIA®), then confirm positive results with the more accurate gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS). False positive results are increasingly rare if the lab follows professional guidelines.A variety of over-the-counter medicines can cause false positives for amphetamine and other illicit drugs on the EMIT test, but not on the GCMS.
If this is a random drug screening that occurs at your work place, talk to other people about what to expect. Ask your coworkers what the screening has been like in the past, and whether there are likely to be any changes. Is the testing company the same as it has been? Are they likely to use up-to-date screening techniques? All information can be helpful to you in preparing for your own drug test.
Try to avoid seeming overly anxious or nervous about the drug test. Be discreet about who you ask in order to avoid drawing attention.

, If you don't already include exercise in your daily routine, add it now. 30-45 minutes of light exercise every day will help increase the rate in which you burn fat cells and rid your body of THC and its metabolites.Good exercises include sit-ups, jumping rope, riding a bike, quick walking or light jogging. Anything that gets your heart rate up will speed your metabolism and help rid your body of drug residue.
Avoid exercise in the 48 hours prior to the drug test. At this point, you'll want your body to stop burning of excess THC. Instead, you'll try to get your body to reabsorb it.

, Starting 2 days before the test, start eating more fatty foods such as deep fried foods from any fast food chain. The goal of eating fatty foods at this point is to slow your metabolism. By slowing your metabolism, your body may reabsorb THC or other drug residue before it gets processed by the liver (and winds up in your urine).Further slow your metabolism by quitting exercise at the same time.
On the morning of the test, empty your bladder as completely as possible prior to taking your drug test. Eat a huge, fatty breakfast with plenty of liquids to wash it down. Some people suggest adding an Extra Strength 5-hour Energy Shot prior to taking the drug test. In addition to being a diuretic, this drink contains Vitamin B, which provides a good yellow color to your urine.

Gather supplies.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Take the vitamins as directed.,
Exercise every day.,
Eat healthy food.,
Pay attention to your body.",How to Pass a Urine Drug Test2," You'll need a full range of vitamins and healthy drinks to protect from hyperhydration.This method takes at least a week, but it's healthier than overloading your system with water, which can flush out important vitamins, nutrients, and electrolytes. To do a healthy flush, you'll need to constantly replace what is being flushed out. Stock up on the following:


Multi-vitamins
Sports drinks
Fresh fruits and veggies
Tea (green detox tea
Other diuretics (cranberry or apple juice, coffee, etc.)

, Drink 20 to 40 ounces of sports drink per day to restore your electrolytes and keep you hydrated. Drink roughly 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to flush your body of toxins. Drink the tea and other diuretics throughout the day as well. Do not drink more than 2 gallons (7.6 L) total of fluids per day.

, Replenish your body by taking a multivitamin either once or twice a day, as directed on the packaging.

, Build up as much of a sweat as possible, since sweating is a way to detox your body. The kidneys and the bladder can only filter so much in such a time. Sweating helps the body excrete waste through your pores, as well as your bladder.

, your body will need all the nutrients it can get. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and lean proteins the week before your drug test.

, If you feel sick, you could be taking in too much water in too short a time. Your health is more important than passing the drug test, so don't overdo it.

Drink cranberry juice or take cranberry supplements.,
Try experimenting with zinc.,
Be careful about niacin.,
When all else fails, spike it.",How to Pass a Urine Drug Test3," Cranberry is a natural diuretic, meaning it will help your body flush itself of water and sodium, though not at the rate that Midol might. Although there is some doubt about cranberry's effectiveness for regular drug users, it really can't hurt if you use it responsibly and in combination with other methods.

, Many drug users report successfully passing an EMIT test after taking zinc sulfate. The zinc is reputed to bond to the metabolites and guide them in to the fecal tract instead of the urinary tract.


Take about 250 mg of zinc sulfate the night before your test. Avoid eating too many solids. Then, the morning of your test, take the same dose of zinc sulfates. Do not take any more than this if you choose to use zinc. Over-medicating with zinc can lead to harmful mineral deficiencies and should be avoided.

, Some people choose to use Niacin, or vitamin B3, in the hopes that it will help them pass their drug test. Niacin has not been proven effective at masking drugs in the urinalysis.Moreover, it's possible to experience very adverse side-effects with over-medication.If you do choose to use Niacin to try to cover up drugs in your system, be careful. It's probably safer to try to use another product or method.

, This is a last resort, but if you can't try any of the above methods, you can try to spike the urinalysis. Bleach, detergent, or blood is rumored to be capable of throwing off the results of the test in order to buy you more time.


If you have longer fingernails, try hiding a small amount of bleached laundry detergent crystals underneath them. Then, when it comes time to take the test, add the detergent crystals to the pee sample and be sure to mix well. This may buy you enough time to take the test again at some later date when you're more prepared.

Give yourself as much time as possible.,
Find out what type of test you'll be taking.,

Ask for a second test if you get the opportunity.,
Consider challenging the test if you don't pass.",How to Pass a Drug Test on Short Notice," With every day that passes between the last time you used drugs and the date of the test, your chances of passing go up. If you have any time at all to prepare, use it wisely and stop using drugs until you're well in the clear. No matter what type of drug you've been using, you're better off stopping well in advance of the test rather than relying mostly-ineffective methods for faking the test.


If the drug test is to be administered by your employer, in most cases you should get fair warning in advance of the test. You might not know the exact day it'll be administered, but you might know what week to expect the test. Pay attention to your company's policies so you can prepare for the test instead of getting caught off-guard.
If you're being tested because you're on probation, your tests are likely to be on a set schedule. Don't let the test date sneak up on you; get your body ready in advance.
Of course, it's not always possible to prepare for a test. If you get pulled over and the police officers suspect drug intoxication, you might have to take a test on the spot. While a test with no notice is tough to pass, there are still things you can do to give yourself a better chance.;
, There are four types of drug tests: urine tests, blood tests, saliva tests and hair tests. The standard 5-panel test tests for amphetamines (speed, meth, crank, ecstasy), cannabinoids (marijuana, hash), cocaine (coke, crack), opiates (heroin, morphine, opium, codeine), and phencyclidine (PCP).Advancements in testing technology have made it difficult to fake tests, but knowing the differences between the tests can be helpful when it comes to your specific situation. Here's the breakdown:



Urine tests are the most common type of tests administered by employers. They're the easiest tests to tamper with, since you have a small window of privacy during which you're supposed to provide a urine sample (provided you aren't being watched).

Blood tests might be administered if you get pulled over and drug intoxication is suspected. This type of test is very difficult to pass if you recently used drugs, since it's effective at determining exactly how much is in your system. But if it's been several days since you've used, the test is more likely to come up negative than a urine test.Saliva tests are sometimes administered in place of either urine or blood tests since they're less invasive. They are a little less sensitive than blood tests.

Hair tests are extremely difficult to fake. Up to 120 strands of hair are evaluated in a laboratory to determine whether they contain traces of drugs. Since it takes up to 2 weeks for a section of hair long enough to test to grow in, a hair test can't tell whether you used drugs in the past 2 weeks. However, traces of drugs can stay in your hair for up to 90 days, so it's an effective way to determine if you're a regular user.

, The method you'll choose to pass a drug test depends in part on how much of the drug you think is still in your system. For instance, if you're just a casual user of marijuana, the drug might not be detectable after a few days. However, heavy use of marijuana, cocaine use, certain barbiturates, and other drugs are detectable even after 15 to 30 days.


If you're a heavy, or ""chronic"" user of marijuana, the test you take will almost definitely read as positive. However, if you've only used it a few times, you have a decent chance of being able to flush your system and get a test that reads negative.
Remember that if you're subjected to a hair test, anything you've used in the past 90 days (with the exception of the most recent two weeks) will show up.

, You won't always get to choose how you'll be tested for drugs, but sometimes you can decide whether you want to take a urine, blood, saliva or hair test. Instead of trying to tamper with a test, your better bet might be to choose the test that's least likely to show up as positive for you. Of course, there's no guarantee that the test will be negative, but it's worth knowing which one will give you the best chance of passing.



If you've only used the drug a few times, and it was at least a week ago, your best bet is probably going to be a blood or saliva test, since most drugs leave your bloodstream after just a few hours or days.If you're currently high when you take the test, you probably want to opt for a urine test, because it's less sensitive than a blood test to exact levels of drugs in your system. Urine tests don't measure THC levels, so if marijuana is the issue, even if you fail the test there won't be proof that you were impaired at the time you took it.

If you tried drugs for the first time in the last week or so, and you get the option to do a hair test instead of another one, that might be your best bet. Anything you did in the last few weeks won't show up, but drugs you used stretching back 90 days will.

If you're a heavy user, try not to take a hair test, since it's very hard to dispute.

, Urine analyzers have seen it all and know to test for commercially available test-masking chemicals. Most household substances, such as bleach, salt or vinegar, will radically alter the pH of your urine, which will make it obvious that you have tampered with the sample. Diluting the sample by adding water can also raise red flags by changing the color and/or temperature of your urine; a clear sample will probably be rejected offhand, as will a lukewarm one.


Ignore the rumor going around that drinking bleach will purify your urine. Drinking bleach can corrode your mouth, throat, and stomach, potentially killing you. What’s more, it won’t even mask your sample.
Don't fall for false advertising on products that say your test will come up negative if you add the substance to your urine. They don't work.

, By increasing your intake of liquids, you will be able to (somewhat) dilute the test sample. This won't work very well if you're a heavy user, but it could do the trick if you've only used a few times.


There's no special drink or ingredient that will help to ""flush"" your system or cleanse you any better than water does. There is no evidence that substances like goldenseal, vinegar, niacin, or vitamin C have any effect on your levels of drug metabolites.Take some vitamin B pills the day before your test to make your urine look yellow. If it's too clear, test evaluators will be suspicious.

, This will help pump drug metabolites from your body. Drink a lot of water the morning of the test and make an extra effort to pee a lot before you take it.


Boost your fluid output with some sort of diuretic. This will stimulate urination and will help flush your system. Diuretics include coffee, tea, and cranberry juice. Stronger diuretics, such as furosemide, are available by prescription only.
Drug metabolites build up in your body while you're sleeping, so your first stream of the day will have a higher concentration. Make sure you urinate before you have to take the sample, and drink plenty of water so your urine will be more diluted.
If you aren’t being watched, make sure to pee in the toilet first and then in the sample cup; your initial urine stream will contain more metabolites.

, This is a lot trickier than it sounds, so consider it a last-ditch attempt (and one for which you'll likely be penalized if you get caught). You can either buy fake urine or find a clean donor. The trick will be to maintain the sample at the proper temperature for the urinalysis (around 91 to 97 F) and smuggle it into the testing area. Kits containing both fake urine and the equipment needed to keep it at the right temperature can be purchased online or in smoke shops.


Synthetic urine passes most tests, but some states have started testing for uric acid. Make sure your sample has uric acid listed as an ingredient.
The synthetic urine should also have a smell. Scentless urine is suspicious to test evaluators.
It's essential to keep the sample at the right temperature. If the temperature is too cold or hot, it's a dead giveaway that the sample has been tampered with.
Using a donor is more risky than using fake urine, because you never know what else might show up in that person's test. You can test it yourself using a test strip available at smoke shops and most drugstores. Use the sample within 48 hours, after which it gets dark in color and the pH level begins to change.

, If there's any way you can delay taking the test, you'll have a much better shot at passing it. Most drugs are no longer traceable through a blood or saliva test after just a few hours, though some will remain in your bloodstream for up to 3 days or longer. Regardless of what type of drugs you took, your chances will be better if you can delay things for a day or more.


If you can't delay a saliva test, you might be able to increase your chances of passing. If you are self-administering the cheek swab for a saliva test, which is supposed to be rubbed between your lower cheek and gum, rub the swab against your teeth instead. Then, rather than hold it between your cheek and gums for two minutes as directed, bite it between your molars. This probably won't work, but it's worth a try if you're on the spot.
There's really no way to manipulate the sample for a blood test, since the test is not self-administered. Blood is drawn on the spot and immediately taken to be tested.

, Since your hair is cut on the spot during a hair test (rather than submitted by you), there's nothing you can really do to tamper with a hair test. However, if you don't have any hair to clip, you might be able to ask for a different type of test that will be easier to pass. If the people drug-testing you have never met you in person and you haven’t already agreed to submit a hair sample, shave your head and the rest of your body (especially areas with longer hair) and casually inform them that you don’t have any hair to submit. Then ask for a different test.


Be sure you have a good story ready as to why your head is shaved. You could say your hair is thinning, or you're experimenting with a new style. Avoid inventing a serious medical condition (eg. cancer) to explain away your hairdo: this might create a lot of long-term complications.
Since the hair sample only needs to be an inch long, be forewarned that they might ask for a sample from your leg, underarm, etc. This might be a good time to get an all-over wax and pretend to be a swimmer.

, Since blood, saliva and hair tests are so very difficult to cheat, you might want to push the issue and see if you can get out of taking it. Here are a few ways to do it:


Ask for a urine test. If you think you could pass a urine test because your urine is diluted, or you don't want a blood test because it will show exactly how high you are at the time of the test, see if you can get a urine test instead. Say you consider it less invasive than the other methods.
Exercise your rights. In some cases, the person administering the test might not have the right to test you. Get to know drug laws in your state and read up on your employer's drug testing policies. See if there's a loophole that can get you out of taking this test, or delay it to a later time.

, Each state has different policies when it comes to drug testing. There are laws dictating how both new applicants and current employees can be tested.In most cases, the employer is legally allowed to administer drug tests, but only if it gives proper notice and has the test administered by a state-run laboratory. Other common requirements include the following:


All employees or applicants must be tested the same way.
If an applicant is applying for a job, the fact that a drug test is part of the process must be clear from the start.
In many cases, an employer isn't allowed to conduct random drug tests or blanket drug tests.
In many cases, an employer can test an employee for drugs if the employer has reasonable suspicion that the employee is using (erratic behavior, inadequate work, etc.).

, None of the drug tests are 100 percent accurate all of the time. Urine tests are the least accurate tests, but all of them are fallible. Use this to your advantage if you end up failing a drug test. Once you've failed, there's no harm in asking for another test; say you disagree with the results and would like to take it again.

, While an employer who followed all of your state's laws regarding testing usually has the right to fire you if you fail a test or refuse to take one, you might be able to challenge the test if it wasn't administered properly.Review your company's policy and your state's laws to make sure they match up. If they don't you might be able to get the test thrown out, giving you an opportunity to take it again.


Check up on the lab administering and analyzing the test to make sure it's run by the state.
See if your employer gave you adequate notice in advance of the test.
Determine whether you experienced what you believe to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy, such as being asked to urinate in full view of someone watching.

A urine test may be done privately (in a bathroom stall at a laboratory) or it might be observed by a laboratory employee., False positive drug tests are very rare in licensed, reputable laboratories. However, certain prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal remedies can be mistaken for drugs of abuse in drug tests. For example, some decongestants might lead to a positive drug test for amphetamines.In order to ensure that your drug test does not provide a false positive, make a thorough list of all your medications and provide the list to your employer, along with any supporting documentation required.

, Urine tests can detect a variety of substances in your system. The particular drugs tested for are depend on a variety of factors: your personal or legal history, the requirements of your job, legal guidelines, or the occurrence of workplace accidents might all affect the specific drugs your employer chooses to test for. However, the most commonly administered drug test is the 5-panel urine test.Most 5-panel tests detect the following drugs:Marijuana
Cocaine
Opiates
Phencyclidine (PCP)
Amphetamines

, While the 5-panel test is the most common, some employers or legal personnel might choose to add other drugs to their screening. They might add testing for any or all of the following substances:Alcohol
MDMA (ecstasy)
Barbiturates
Propoxyphene
Benzodiazepines

, A urine test does not test your sobriety at the exact moment at which you provided the sample. Instead, it tests your past use of drugs over the past few days or even weeks. Habitual drug users often have higher concentrations of the drug in their systems than occasional drug users. For this reason, habitual drug users may test positively for drugs even after being sober for several days or weeks.Other factors might affect the concentration of drugs in your system, such as your metabolism, quality and amount of drugs taken, hydration levels, and overall health. In general, however, you can expect a urine test to detect drugs for the following times:Amphetamine: 2 days
Barbiturates: 2 days-3 weeks
Benzodiazepines: 3 days (therapeutic dose); 4-6 weeks (habitual use)
Cocaine: 4 days
Ecstasy: 2 days
Heroin: 2 days
Marijuana: 2-7 days (single use); 1-2+ months (habitual use)
Methamphetamine: 2 days
Morphine: 2 days
PCP: 8-14 days (single use); 30 days (chronic users)

, The only surefire way to pass a drug test is not to use drugs, especially when you are in the testing window. In some cases, you might know in advance when the test will take place. In other cases, however, you might not have any warning. In that case, consider whether your circumstances will make it likely for you to be tested for drugs in the near future. For example, discontinue drug use if you:


Are on the job market
Are on probation
Are in a profession that requires occasional random drug testing

, This is a method used to throw off testing equipment from seeing certain results. Commercial and over-the-counter chemicals containing nitrates were once used to mask THC (the active drug in the marijuana plant) but are now commonly tested for. These products are all detectable, and will result automatically in a failed drug screen., Dilution is the process of reducing the concentration of drug or drug metabolites in the sample. This is accomplished by adding fluid to the sample, and some sites online may recommend it. However, drug testing laboratories all routinely test samples to detect dilution.One method of diluting the sample involves adding liquid to urine. However, the temperature of the urine is measured by drug tests, and diluted urine is easily detected.Another method of diluting the sample is to flush your system by drinking excessive amounts of water. However, drinking excessive amounts of water can be dangerous (people have died from water intoxication) and risky because colorless urine arouses suspicion, possibly flagging the sample. You will likely be asked to provide another sample after a few hours, which will not be enough time for your body to rid itself of drug traces..

, While excessive flushing will likely lead to a failed urine test, you may be able to slightly lower the concentration of THC in your urine if you are well hydrated. For those who have not used marijuana for several days, this might make a significant difference in your drug test result. In order to provide an optimal urine sample, you can:Drink 3-4 glasses of water the morning of your test.
Pee at least twice before providing a urine sample. Your early morning urine will have the highest concentration of drugs in your system. Give your body some time to flush these chemicals out, and never use your first pee of the day in a drug test.
Drink a coffee or caffeinated soda. Caffeine is a mild diuretic, which can help your body flush out fluids more quickly.

, Substitution is a method that involves substituting your urine with that of another person's or a synthetic sample. There are many companies that sell devices for urine substitution over the internet, as well as companies that sell synthetic urine.


Be aware that defrauding the urine test might be a crime. In many states, it is illegal to substitute someone else's urine for your own. This could be considered an act of criminal fraud, and you might be putting your job, employment, or legal status at risk. Consider carefully whether it is worth the risk to attempt to defraud a urine test.Synthetic urine comes in two basic forms: the liquid type found in smoke shops that is similar to what is used to calibrate lab equipment; or vials of a powdered concentrate that can be added to a few ounces of warm water. Both are kept in a delivery device with a temperature meter.
One of the challenges of urine substitution is ensuring that the urine remains at a normal body temperature (91-97 degrees Fahrenheit).
Some labs are now testing for synthetic urine. For your legal protection, it is critical that you do not use this method for any government tests including military, civil service, and especially probation.
The liquid premixed urine has a couple of drawbacks as it doesn't have a head or small layer of bubbles on the surface and it has no smell. Powdered synthetic urine does. Many labs and collection sites will reject your specimen if they suspect it is synthetic and ask you to urinate under direct observation.
Substituting another person's urine might also be risky, since it is possible that they will not pass the drug test either. Urine also darkens over time, and bacteria can grow, contaminating the sample. If deterioration becomes noticeable the lab may suspect something.

, In some cases, an employer or parole officer might ask for a re-test of your urine. Do not celebrate a passed drug test by using drugs: you might simply fail the next one. Be patient, and make sure that your results were believed before taking any further action.

Understand how the hair testing process works.,
Recognize that hair drug tests are less effective measures of single drug use.,
Be aware that drugs take 5-7 days to enter your hair.,
Know the drugs that will be tested for in the 5-panel test.,
Know other drugs that can be tested for.,
Stop use of all drugs 90 days before the test.,
Be aware that hair tests are very difficult to fool.,
Be cautious about special shampoos and rinses.",How to Pass a Drug Test2," When drug metabolites are in the blood, they'll end up in the blood vessels, including those in the head. The traces of the drug then get filtered through the hair, leading to a failed drug test.Hair drug testing can show the drugs a person may have used over the past several months. It is a more accurate test of long-term drug use than a urine or blood test.
A hair drug test involves cutting 50-80 strands of hair from the back of the head, close to the crown. Note that even though the drug test is often referred to as a ""hair follicle"" test, your skin will not be broken in this test.
A minimum length of 1.5 inches of head hair is necessary for the test. If this length of hair is unavailable (such as when the person being tested has a crew cut), body hair such as face, chest, or arm hair can be used., A hair follicle test is a more effective test of long-term or heavy drug use. A single, minor use of a drug is much less likely to lead to a failed hair drug test, though it can happen. If you have only smoked a single joint in the past 3 months, you can be cautiously hopeful that you will pass the drug test. However, if you had a period of time where you smoked a joint every day for a week, you are much more likely to fail the drug test.

, While a hair drug test is highly effective for past drug use, very recent drug use is harder to detect in this way. It usually takes several days to a week for recent drug use to appear in your hair.


For this reason, some employers and agencies will require that you take both a hair test (for long-term drug use) and a urine test (for short-term drug use).

, One of the more common hair follicle tests is the 5-panel drug test. Like the urine 5-panel test, the hair follicle 5-panel test detects traces of the following drugs:Marijuana
Cocaine
Opiates
Amphetamines (including ecstasy, meth, and molly)
PCP

, Some employers or legal agencies choose to test for additional drugs outside of the traditional 5-panel test. These drugs include many categories of prescription medication in addition to common street drugs. These drugs include:Benzodiazepines
Methadone
Barbiturates
Propoxyphene
Oxycontin
Demerol
Tramadol

, In general, the portion of hair that is tested is the 1.5 inches of head hair closest to the crown of the head. This portion of hair is enough to test your use of drugs in the past 90 days. The only way to be sure to pass a hair test is not to have drugs in your system during this period.

, Many of the techniques used to fool a urine drug test are not suitable for a hair test. For example, your hair sample is often collected by a lab assistant directly since there are no privacy concerns (as there are for a urine sample). There are no chemical masking agents or dilution methods that can lower toxins in the hair. And a temporary stoppage of drug use is not sufficient to pass most hair drug tests. The very high success rate of the hair drug tests is precisely why many employers and legal agencies use them.It is particularly difficult for people with dark colored hair to fool a hair follicle test. For this reason, there are many claims that hair drug tests are ethnically biased and racist., There are a number of shampoos on the market that claim to help you pass a hair follicle drug test. However, none of these effects have been scientifically proven, and any evidence of their success is anecdotal and possibly suspect.A potential home remedy that has been rumored to be successful involves rinsing your hair with white vinegar, salicylic acid, and laundry detergent, followed by using a temporary hair dye. This treatment is unproven but is also relatively inexpensive and, as long as you keep these chemicals out of your eyes, has few side effects.
Some studies show that cosmetically treated hair is less likely to show traces of cocaine."
"
Know how the test works.,
Know the detection times.,
Refrain from drug use within 2-4 days of getting tested.,
Rinse your mouth with food, beverages, or mouthwash.",How to Pass a Drug Test3," Saliva/oral fluid-based drug tests can generally detect drug use during the previous few hours and days. They're becoming more prevalent because of their convenience, non-invasiveness, and low cost. Saliva tests can detect any drug that can also be found in the blood., Drug detection in saliva tests begins immediately upon use and can continue for up to 4 days. However, many light drug users might be able to pass a saliva test as soon as 26-33 hours after drug use.. For this reason, some people consider a saliva drug test to be a more useful diagnostic for impairment than general drug-related behavior.People in professions that are concerned about impairment (such as commercial trucking companies) might be more likely to take a saliva drug test for this reason. The drug detection times in general are as follows:


Marijuana and hashish (THC): An hour after ingestion, and up to 24 hours depending on use.
Cocaine (including crack): From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days.
Opiates: From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days.
Methamphetamine and ecstasy: From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days.
Benzodiazepines: From time of ingestion up to 2 to 3 days.

, Most saliva drug tests are taken directly at a laboratory, making it difficult to substitute samples or contaminate your saliva. Unlike a urine test, there are no privacy concerns with a saliva test, meaning that you might be watched throughout the duration of the test. The only guarantee of passing a drug test is refraining from drug use during the detection period, 1-4 days prior to the test., Studies show that eating, drinking, brushing your teeth, or using mouthwash might have a temporary effect on saliva drug test results. However, these effects disappear after 30 minutes or so. For this reason, many drug companies require that you do not eat or drink for 30 minutes prior to the test. During this period, you might be observed in the laboratory. However, if you are not observed, you might be able to get away with rinsing your mouth with a commercial mouthwash. It is possible that you might be asked to re-take the test if this contamination is detected."
"
Know when you might be observed during a drug test.,
Know the law.,
Recognize when you are likely to be tested.,
Know when drug testing is not permitted.,
Know what's true and what's not about drug testing.",How to Pass a Drug Test4," There are many situations that may require an observed test. If you hold a Commercial Driver's License and provide a specimen that is outside of the acceptable temperature range or shows signs of tempering or it requires an immediate, observed retest.. Some employers require an observed collection for professionals (doctors, nurses, etc) who have been a history of drug or alcohol abuse. You can of course always refuse to provide an observed specimen, but there may be repercussions including job loss.

, At least ten states (Arkansas, Illinois, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Texas) have outlawed the sale of synthetic urine or adulterants for the purpose of passing a drug test. Be aware of this as you consider your options.

, Employers are currently allowed by law to require that workers submit to urinalysis or saliva screening to be considered for employment and/or to retain their employment. States have laws which often limit how and when testing can be done, such as requiring that the company have a written policy or that 'random' testing not be used.However, some circumstances when you are most likely to be tested include:


During the hiring process. You do not have to submit to a blood test as a job applicant. However, a potential employer can make passing a drug test a requirement of a conditional job offer once it is extended to you.If you are a pregnant woman in the hospital. In the United States, some states have required pregnant women to be tested for illegal drug use as part of their prenatal care. The US Supreme Court ruled the secret testing of women unconstitutional in the case of Ferguson v City of Charleston, in March 2001. However, women who arrive to deliver in a hospital have their blood tested routinely. A delivering mother could face endangerment charges or even worse if traces are found in her blood.If you operate a vehicle or heavy machinery. Jobs where lives might be put in danger when an employee is impaired--such as construction or truck driving--often require routine tests for impairment.If you exhibit suspicious behavior. If you commit an accident in the workplace, have slurred speech, or behave erratically, your employer might require you to take a drug test as a condition of your employment., Laws vary from state to state and change frequently. You can find out the details of your state´s drug testing laws by contacting a trade organization, your state government or an employment lawyer. Your right to test workers for drug use depends on several factors. Drug testing also falls under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which includes several key features:


The ADA makes it illegal for any employer to test a prospective employee without first making a conditional offer of employment.
The ADA also says you can't discriminate against prospective employees on the basis of past drug-related problems. Then again, you may refuse to hire people if you have reason to believe they will return to substance abuse or endanger the safety and health of your workers. If you aren't sure how to proceed with an applicant who has a history of drug abuse, consult an attorney. The ADA doesn't prohibit asking a person with a history of substance abuse to enroll in a rehabilitation program before joining your firm., There are a number of false rumors and unsubstantiated claims about passing drug tests. There are also a number of commercial products that promise customers they will be able to pass a drug test without backing up these claims with evidence. Common myths include:


Secondhand smoke. Cut-off levels are set so as to keep one failing due to casual secondhand smoke.
Poppy Seeds. The current recommended cutoff level was raised from 300 ng/mL to 2,000 ng/mL in 1998 in order to avoid false positives from poppy seeds You would need to eat a whole loaf of poppy seed to register for even one day.Bleach. Adding bleach to nullify a urine sample will change the pH and flag the sample as being tampered and you will fail. Drinking bleach will blind you and maybe kill you. Aspirin. Aspirin has been claimed to create a false negative for THC. This only works under ideal circumstances and only for certain kinds of test. It is not a guarantee of passing.
Bleaching and redyeing your hair will not remove the metabolites from hair during the hair follicle test. However, natural blondes are more likely to pass a hair follicle test.

Locate some sort of an empty plastic bottle.,

Finished.

",How to Make a Quick Bong," A 20oz bottle works best, because it will be less cumbersome than a 2 liter (0.53 US gal) bottle. Anything like an empty water bottle or soda bottle will work.;
, You can find these at any hardware store. Ideally you want a 7/32, or 5.6mm, socket. Make sure the shape is roughly one inch long, skinnier on one end (smaller diameter), and fatter on the other (larger diameter). Also make sure that hole on the bottom of the skinny side is sort of small, so that product will not fall through while being smoked.

, For this project, you'll need a lighter, a pen that can be taken apart, duct tape, and, optionally, a needle or exact-o knife.

, Remove the bottle cap and toss it away. Empty out the bottle if it's not already empty. If it's a soda bottle, clean it out with warm water to remove some of the sugar residue inside the bottle. If you want, you can remove all the labels from the bottle now., Take your lighter and put a flame to the side of the bottle, about half of the way from the bottom.. Make sure that the flame is only barely touching the bottle, so as to slowly burn a small hole in it. Stop once the hole is a little smaller than the diameter of the pen.


Another method to make the hole is to punch it out with a sharp needle, or carve it out with an exact-o knife. Just make sure it's not larger than the pen.







, Now look at where the bowl hole is positioned on the bottle. You need to make another hole near the top of the bottle, on the opposite side from the first hole. Ideally, you should make this hole somewhere where it is natural to hold a finger over it with your non-dominant hand while holding the bottle. Hold the lighter flame to this spot until a hole is made, roughly double the size of the other hole. You can also make this hole with a needle or an exact-o knife.

, Remove all the pieces of the pen until it is just a hollow tube. This will be the stem that your bowl will be attached to. Ideally, your pen will be large enough in diameter that the skinny end of the socket can fit in it.

, Stick the socket bit in the pen, then use duct tape to secure them together. Use a couple layers of duct tape to ensure a stable connection.

, Slide the side of the pen without the socket into the hole near the bottom of the bottle. Angle it pointing downwards, toward the opposite side of the bottle, so the bowl can be loaded without the product falling out. Then use several layers of duct tape to secure the pen to the bottle and create an airtight seal. Fill the bottle with a couple of inches of water and your bong is now finished.You'll want to slide the pen in as far as possible, so the ideal angle is for the end of the pen to touch the bottom of the bottle on the opposite side of the hole.

Notice if they have friends who smoke.,
Pay attention if they start using mouthwash or gum more frequently.,
Check how they are spending their money.",How to Know if a Teen Is Smoking," Make sure that you talk to your child about smoking long before you think you need to. Kids need to know about the dangers of smoking so that they can internalize the information and already have a negative opinion about smoking before they encounter their first opportunity to smoke.;
, Be frank with your children and ask them openly if they smoke. Let them know that you love them no matter what and that you understand the lure of smoking, but you don't approve of it. Sometimes starting a dialogue is all you need to do to help your child through a rough time.


Note: If you have experience smoking, tell your children about how difficult it was for you to quit and that you wish you had never started in the first place.

, Ask your child when and why they started smoking, how often they smoke, if their friends smoke, etc. This will help you you figure out what appeal smoking has for your child, so you'll be better equipped to help them quit or to learn how to say no in the future.

, Kids often don't respond as well if you are visibly upset when you talk to them. Keep your cool and talk to your child about smoking. Answer any questions they might have and let them know they can always talk to you about these things.

, Even if it seems like they aren't listening to you, your child needs to hear you say that smoking is forbidden. If you don't put your foot down, they won't have any parental guidance telling them that it's not okay to smoke. They might disobey you and smoke anyway, but it is important that you encourage them not to smoke.

, The negative effects of smoking are very real and greatly outweigh any possible perceived benefits. Talk to your kids about the consequences of smoking, including the following things:


Health risks. There are many obvious, very scary health problems that come with smoking. Be frank with your children about the risk of heart disease, cancer, and the statistics about early death caused by smoking.
Vanity. Appeal to your child's vanity by telling them about the many unattractive qualities that accompany most smokers.Smoking makes your hair and clothes smell bad, yellows your teeth, causes premature wrinkles, stains your fingers yellow, etc.
Financial. Smoking is expensive. Even if your child has a part-time job, the financial strain of becoming a smoker will be much harder than they are probably expecting. Do the math with them. Figure out how much a pack of cigarettes costs, how much your child smokes (or use a one pack per day number for an average smoker), and calculate how much they'll be spending on average for a month of smoking. The financial cost will be a sobering reality even if they aren't concerned about the physical risks.

, One of the most common and immediate symptoms of smoking is the persistent smokers' cough. It can appear in as little as a few days after beginning smoking and can even be present with casual (not heavy) smoking.The cough is usually the worst in the morning and lessens throughout the day. It is usually accompanied by phlegm which can be clear, yellow, or even green.

, Smoking causes teeth to turn yellow over time, so be mindful of this if your child's teeth start to look more yellow.


Also take notice if your child suddenly becomes interested in teeth whitening products like special whitening toothpaste or whitening strips.

, While yellowing teeth may take some time to appear, smoking cigarettes can cause yellow stains on your teen's fingers and fingernails almost immediately., A wheezing sound can indicate several different physical conditions in your child, but one of them is damaged airways/lungs from smoking.

, Shortness of breath is a tell-tale sign of a smoker. If your child is suddenly not able to be active for long periods of time or takes longer to catch their breath after physical activity, you should consider the possibility that they might be smoking.

, Smokers are more prone to getting certain respiratory diseases like colds, bronchitis, and pneumonia.If your child is suddenly getting sick more frequently with diseases like this, you might need to be concerned that these illnesses are the side effects of a new smoking habit.

, The smell of cigarette smoke is a scent that lingers and is hard to get rid of. If your teenager has been smoking, it is almost guaranteed that you will be able to smell it on their clothes or in their hair (especially if they have longer hair).


Note: Sometimes teenagers try to cover up the smell of smoke by overcompensating with cologne or body spray. You will still be able to smell the smoke, but it might be partially masked by the perfume.

, Kids will often try to air out or vent their room by leaving the window open after smoking in their room. It might be normal for your child to want their window open, but pay special attention if they insist on doing it even when the weather is unpleasant (too hot, too cold, rainy, etc.).

, Teenage smokers are less experienced and have worse hand-eye coordination than adults. So, they are more prone to accidentally burning things if they start smoking. Watch out for burn marks on the carpet in their room or on their clothing. Also look for burn marks in their car, as many teens think they can mask the smell of the smoke more effectively in their car then in their room.

, It may be hard to notice these tiny objects, but if your teenager has recently started carrying around or purchasing lighters and/or matches, this may be a sign that they are smoking.They may claim that they only want it for lighting candles, but notice the frequency with which they use the matches or lighter to determine if you think they are smoking or not.

, Teenage smokers can be very persuasive, so other teenagers often succumb to existing peer pressure to smoke.Teens with friends who smoke are much more likely to start smoking than those without smoker friends., Smokers can be very conscious of the fact that smoking makes their breath smell distinctively like cigarettes. So they often try to counteract this effect by chewing gum or using mouthwash after smoking. If your child appears to be worrying to an extreme about how their breath smells, they might be trying to hide the fact that they are smoking from you.

, Smoking is an expensive habit. If you have access, check your teen's online bank account activity and see if they are making frequent purchases at convenience stores, grocery stores, or smoke shops. If they are buying cigarettes regularly, there will be a money trail for you to find.

You want as little outside wind as possible, so stay away from fans, close the windows, and choose a still, quiet room., The smoke will start to dissipate in your lungs, making it thinner and weaker. Take short breaths in, puffing your cheeks out slightly, and work on keeping the smoke in your mouth. Think of taking 3-4 partial inhales instead of one big, long drag on your hookah or cigarette.You should feel the smoke towards your throat, especially if you take several quick breaths.

, A long, slow exhalation keeps the smoke packed together, helping it appear as a thicker, more coherent cloud. Work on exhaling in a controlled, stream, almost letting the smoke eek out of you instead of forcing it., Rolled smoking devices, like joints, cigarettes, and blunts have thick smoke because the paper is burning along with the contents. E-pens, with their high vapor content, are also good to smoke for tricks. But the easiest way to do tricks is with a hookah because the glycerin in shisha is vital to thick plumes of smoke.Water bongs and pipes are usually the hardest to use for smoke tricks.

, This simple trick is just a good way to practice keeping the smoke in your mouth, not your lungs. To do it, simply take a big puff, then close your mouth. Open your mouth with a quick, percussive ""puh!"" sound to push a big ball of smoke out of your lips. It should clear your mouth completely. If the cloud is a big, solid white color you're doing well.

, This simple trick is a good way to practice using your nose and mouth together. It ends up shooting 4 small streams of smoke: 2 from your lips and two from your nose. To do it:


Take a big inhalation of smoke, keeping it in your mouth if possible.
Extend your bottom lip to the sides, pushing your top lip down in the center, so their are two openings on the corners of your mouth.
Breathe out of your nose and lips at the same time.

DO NOT smoke in your house (unless you live with smokers).,
When smoking outside, stay far, far away from the house.,
Keep friends that smoke.,
Keep your cigarettes and lighters hidden, but relatively easy to get to, and not easy to be spotted messing with them.,
Avoid colognes and body sprays.,
Stay upwind from the smoke.,
If you're going to smoke in the car, buy an air freshener, make sure your A/C isn't on cycle (as that will keep the smell of smoke in the air system for ages to come,) point your vents towards the windows, keep all of your windows down, and keep the cigarette out the window.

,
While it is the most desired method, taking a shower at random times of the day to remove the smell is a bit suspicious, so when you come in from smoking, change your shirt, wash your hands, and brush your teeth.,
Use common sense and heaping spoonfuls of caution.",How to Keep from Getting Caught Smoking by Your Parents," Even if you cut off your vents and put a towel under your door, and smoke while leaning out of your window, smoke has this miraculous ability to follow air currents. When the air in your house is on, the smoke will follow the pressure changes and find its merry way to the return vent, and even if it's just a little smoke, it will get to every single part of your house in a matter of seconds.;
, The heat pump (the big fan thingies that sit outside of your house that work with the air unit,) act as the intake of a house's A/C system, and just like the return vents in the house, they will spread the smoke all over in a matter of seconds.

They've lived longer than you, they've also probably done it, and they know all of the usual hiding spots like under beds, under mattresses, in pillow cases, dressers, clothes hanging in the closet, etc. Find somewhere really creative. Think of somewhere that they'd never look in a million years, but is in plain sight. For instance, inside an old, dusty clay vase on the book shelf. Behind the clock on the fireplace mantle. Inside the hollow of one of your mom's porcelain figurines that's been sitting in the same spot for 10 years.

If, every day, you go out to smoke wearing a green shirt, then go change into a blue shirt or something like that, you're gonna raise some eyebrows eventually unless your parents are just oblivious to everything you do (in which case don't bother finishing this article, because you don't need it.)

, If you're careless, you'll get caught. Expect the unexpected. Treat every time you smoke like your parents are waiting to catch you in the act.

Check the discussion page.,
Nominate the article for deletion, if you believe you should.,
Check your edit.,
Ask for help if you need it.",How to Identify wikiHow Articles Focused on Recreational Drug Use," Primarily you should think about its legality in all places around the world. If the article's focus is marijuana (in a medical capacity), caffeine, prescription drugs, or over-the-counter medication, the article is likely okay, but if the article discusses harder drugs like meth, LSD, cocaine, it's probably deletable (depending on the context).


Keep in mind that drug laws vary around the world, and so do the cultural norms and traditions related to the use of some drugs. Try to consider whether there are legitimate and legal uses for the drug in question; you may not approve of its use, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily a topic for deletion.;
, Note whether or not the article seems to be promoting drugs or drug-related activities. An article about looking for signs of cocaine use, for instance, is not the same as an article about manufacturing/selling/using cocaine. Here are some examples of contexts where drug references would be acceptable and unacceptable.



Acceptable

Keep the smoke in your mouth after a medium-sized drag.,
Open your mouth and exhale gently.,
Quickly inhale the smoke back.,
Adapt this into a ""Snap Inhale"" as you get more comfortable.",How to Learn Smoking Tricks2," Ghosting is when you exhale some of the smoke, then inhale the cloud back into your mouth.

, Open you mouth roughly halfway and slowly exhale the smoke from your mouth for a few seconds. Be gentle, keeping the smoke from getting too far from your face.


Think of letting the smoke escape, instead of forcing it out.

, Keep your lips together and lean forward, sucking up all the smoke like a vacuum or Ghostbuster., Let the smoke out of your mouth and then bring it back, but you can do it much faster with a snap inhale:


Curl your tongue up to the roof of your mouth with your lips still closed and mouth filled with smoke.
Snap your tongue down as your mouth opens to push the smoke out in a puff of air.
Suck back in the cloud of smoke like a normal ghost, but do it quickly, before it fades away."

Take a big, full drag.,
Push out your bottom lip, opening your mouth slightly.,
Inhale the smoke through your nostrils.,
Adapt the French Inhale by mixing it with other tricks.,
Try ghost-facing.",How to Learn Smoking Tricks3," Keep the smoke, like normal, in your mouth if possible. This trick works best with thick, white smoke.

, Hold your bottom lip out like have an an underbite. Let the smoke escape from your mouth, drifting up from your lower lip.

, As the smoke escapes, drifting up from your bottom lip, inhale gently from your nose. It will appear like an upside down waterfall of smoke, sneaking up from your bottom lip into your nose.

, Try blowing a smoke ring through your mouth and inhale it back through the nose. Can you adapt into a French Ghost, popping the smoke out from your mouth and pulling it back through the nostrils?

, This is just a patient, easier version of the French Inhale. To do it you must take a large, full drag. Open your mouth from the lower lip and slowly exhale, pushing the smoke out and up. Keep exhaling slowly, tilting your chin slightly down as you do, to cover your whole face in smoke."

Get a full mouth of smoke.,
Open your mouth to an O shape.,
Use quick bursts of air to push the smoke out.,
Change your mouth shape to change the ring shape.",How to Learn Smoking Tricks4," Take a full, long drag and keep the smoke in your mouth. Smoke rings only work with thick, fully formed smoke, so consider using a Hookah or cigar to practice.

, Some people have success pulling their lips back over their teeth, but the overall goal is simply as if you were saying ""oh."" Keep your mouth open and round and you'll be perfect., There are a lot of schools of thought about how to best accomplish this, as it is the hardest part of blowing rings:


Exhale with rapid, clipped breaths. A lot of groups call these ""reverse hiccups."" A hiccup is basically a quick, brief inhalation. It feels almost like a pop.Think of making a ""Huh, Huh, Huh,"" sound as you push air out.
Use your tongue to ""flick"" out bits of airs. Time your flick with a puff of air, almost like a heavily enunciated ""to.""
Tap out the rings. Contort your mouth so that your cheeks are concave (curving into your mouth). Tap the cheek with a finger, hitting it hard enough to force some air out of your mouth. You can tap rapidly as you get better and better.

, Rings are determined by the size of your mouth and the force you use to push the smoke out. Once you get the basic idea down, practice moving your lips and working your lungs to get different sized rings..You can make your rings into little hearts easily. After you blow it out, snap just above the ring, 1-2"" high. The resulting burst of air will dent the top of the ring, making a heart appear."

Start with 1/2 cup of water and a 2-second squirt of soap, then adjust accordingly., This is like using bubble mix as a kid. You want a thin film of soapy water over the end of the straw.


The wider the straw, the better the bubble will be.

, Inhale as much smoke as you can from your chosen device. The more smoke, the bigger your bubble. Leave the straw in the soap as you inhale.

, Exhale slowly, building the bubble so it doesn't pop due to a rapid push of air. When you're out of smoke, stop breathing and pull the straw off of your bubble.Avoid inhaling through the straw at all times if you don't want a big mouthful of soap.

Opt for low-odor varieties of marijuana.,
Try an odor neutralizer for small gardens.,
Skip products that mask the scent of marijuana.,
Opt out of air purifiers.,
Avoid ozone generators.",How to Hide the Smell of Marijuana Plants1," There are several kinds from which to choose, perfect for indoor gardens where odor control is a concern. Experiment with different types and see what works for you in terms of smell and effects. Take note, though, that using a low-odor variety is unlikely to fully resolve odor problems, so you'll probably need to apply one of the other methods listed here as well.


Blue Mystic
Northern Lights
Papaya
Durban Poison
Shark's Breath
Polar Express;
, Odor neutralizers are a simple and affordable way to reduce or eliminate odors from smaller enterprises of just a few plants.


Ona Pro Gel, which was developed for sewage treatment facilities, is one commonly recommended neutralizer.
Simply place an open jar in the space adjacent to the grow. That's all it takes to minimize the smells in your living area.
Replace the neutralizer regularly. One jar should last about four to six weeks, so mark your calendar and keep track of when you need a new one.
Do not use an odor neutralizer in the same space as your plants. Neutralizers have been known to alter or reduce the smell of the marijuana plants themselves, so keep them clear of the grow room.Neutralizers work for small gardens only. While they may be perfectly fine for a few plants, they are probably not up to the challenge of larger enterprises., These include candles, incense, and air fresheners. They may cover the smell temporarily, but they are not a good long-term choice.


If used in the vicinity of your garden, they could adversely affect the smell of the plants themselves.
What's worse, air fresheners often contain harmful chemicals. They're best avoided., While these products may remove some scents from the air, they are not nearly effective enough to eliminate odor from Cannabis., It is generally acknowledged that ozone in the air can be damaging to your health. Ozone is a lung irritant that can put you at risk of disease if inhaled regularly."

Learn the basic structure of a water pipe.,
Find the right chamber.,
Prepare your stem.,
Build a bowl for your pipe.,
Create a hole for the stem.,
Insert and seal the stem.,
Create the carburetor.,
Add water.,
Make an apple pipe.,
Create a gravity pipe.,
Build a waterfall pipe.",How to Make a Simple Bong," Although certain forms and functions of water pipes may vary from model to model, many share common characteristics. Learning these commonalities can you help you better understand the process as you work to build your own water pipe. Review the following three main features of a water pipe:Chamber
Carburetor
Stem and Bowl;
, Search for a suitable chamber for your water pipe. The chamber of the water pipe will hold the smoke and water within it and it is the central piece to your pipe. You can use a wide range of materials and objects that you might already have available to you. It is possible to use plastic soda or water bottles for an easy to find chamber.
Old glass bottles can be re-purposed to build a chamber for your water pipe.

, Finding materials to use for your stem may prove more difficult than finding materials for your main chamber. Buying a stem from a specialty shop is the easiest way to obtain this element. However, you may still be able to find or buy your own materials and create a stem for yourself.A length of copper pipe can be used to make the stem of your water pipe.
Brass fittings can be glued or otherwise affixed to the stem to create a bowl.
If you don't have a smoke shop nearby or any suitable items around your house, try visiting a hardware store.

, The bowl is the piece of your water pipe that will hold whatever legal substance you decide to smoke. Most store bought bowls will be made out of glass which can be difficult to make at home unless you've had previous experience. However, there are other methods and materials that you can make use of around your home to build your bowl.Aluminum foil can be used as a bowl, bending it into shape and poking many small holes into the bottom of it with a pin.
You can try making a stem and bowl combination out of certain metal doorstops as well. Remove the door stop from the wall and take off the rubber stopper to create your stem and bowl.

, Once you have selected your chamber you will need to create a hole for the stem. Pay careful attention to exactly where you place this hole and the angle of it, as this will affect how your stem fits. Depending on the material you have selected for your chamber the tool you will use to make this hole will vary.Make this hole on the side of your chamber, at about half the length of the chamber.
Create this hole at an angle that will allow the stem to reach the bottom of the chamber.
A plastic chamber can be punctured with a pair of scissors.
Metal and glass chambers may need a power drill to make the hole for the stem.

, After creating a hole for your stem you will now need to insert the stem through and into the chamber. The stem should pass through the side wall of your chamber, reaching down at an angle to touch the bottom of the chamber. Once inserted you will seal your stem in place to prevent any spots where air or smoke might leak through.Apply silicone around the area where the stem meets the chamber to create a seal.
You can also insert a rubber grommet into your stem hole before inserting your stem through it.

, A carburetor is usually a small hole on the side of a water pipe that can help you control the amount of smoke in the main chamber. Creating a small hole for your carburetor can help you get the most out of your homemade water pipe.The carburetor should be made on the opposite side of the stem.
Carburetors are usually found slightly below the point where the stem enters the chamber.
The size of your carburetor should be just big enough to cover it with your thumb.

, The purpose of water in a water pipe is to cool the temperate of smoke down before it is inhaled. The smoke is drawn in and down through the stem, passing through the water before going up the main chamber. Add water to your pipe to create a more comfortable temperature smoke when in use.


Water should go directly into the main body of the chamber.
Add enough water to cover most of the stem inside the chamber.
Don't overfill with water as it may spill out of the carburetor or rise up the stem.

, Apple pipes can be a quick and easy pipe to make if you find yourself without your usual smoking equipment. To build an apple pipe all you will need is an apple, a pen, aluminum foil and a knife.Core out the center of the apple to make an inner chamber.
Take apart the pen and use only the empty pen tube. Push the pen tube into the apple's side until it enters the cored out chamber you've made.
Make an aluminum bowl over the top hole you have created. Shape a piece of aluminum into the form you need and punch multiple holes into it with a pin to create the bowl.
Add your smoking material to the bowl, light it, and inhale through the pen.

, Gravity pipes work by using mechanical action to pull smoke from your combustible substance, instead of using your lungs. Once smoke has filled the chamber the bowl is removed, allowing you to inhale the smoke. All you will need is a plastic two liter soda bottle, scissors, and something to make a bowl such as aluminum foil.Cut the two liter bottle in half. Insert the lower section inside of the top section and push the top section down until it touches meets the bottom of the lower section.
Make sure the two halves fit tightly to create an air tight seal.
Create your aluminum bowl by molding the aluminum into a shape that fits the top opening of the soda bottle. Make sure to punch small holes into your bowl with a pin.
Add your smoking material to the bowl and light it. As it burns, pull the top half of the bottle upwards, drawing the smoke into the inner chamber.
Take away the bowl and inhale the smoke that has collected inside your gravity pipe.

, A waterfall pipe works similarly to a gravity pipe. However, instead of pulling the smoke into the chamber manually, the flow of water from the main chamber will create the smoke. All you need to get started is a plastic two liter soda bottle, something to make a hole in the bottle, and aluminum to create a bowl.Punch a hole near the bottom of your soda bottle. It should be big enough to cover with a finger and hold the water in the chamber until you are ready to let it flow out.
Build a bowl using your aluminum foil. Form the aluminum into a shape that fits the top spout of the bottle and punch holes into it with a pin.
Fill the bottle up with water, making sure the hole is plugged up completely.
Place your bowl on top of the waterfall pipe and light your smoking material.
Unplug the lower hole, allowing the water to flow out and draw in the smoke.
Remove your bowl and inhale the smoke that is now in the chamber.

Know that tobacco leaf will grow in almost every type of soil.,
For best results, grow tobacco in a climate that's dry and warm.,
Sprinkle tobacco seeds onto the surface of a sterile seed starting mix and lightly water.,
Water the soil frequently to keep it moist but not soggy.,
Transplant your seedlings into a larger pot after 3 weeks.,
Water your seedlings with plant starter fertilizer solution like miracle grow or seaweed/fish emulsion fertilizer.,
Prepare your garden plot for transplanting the larger plants.,
Transfer the tobacco plants to your garden when the shoots are 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) in length.,
Water the tobacco thoroughly each evening for a few days as the plants settle.,
Apply a low-chlorine fertilizer which only contains nitrogen in nitrate form.,
Top the tobacco plant as soon as it begins to flower.,
Hoe gently around your tobacco plants to keep them free of weeds.,
Spray your plants with tobacco-specific pesticides if you notice pests or rot.,
Cut your tobacco plants at the stalk while keeping the leaves attached.,
Hang your tobacco leaves in a well-ventilated, hot, and humid area.,
Age your tobacco in conditions similar to the curing process.",How to Grow Tobacco," Tobacco is an extremely hardy plant. It grows pretty much where any other agricultural crop will grow, although, as a rule of thumb, tobacco grows better in soils which drain well. The important thing to note is that tobacco will be extremely affected by the soil in which it is grown; lighter soils will generally produce lighter colored tobacco, while darker soils will generally produce darker colored tobacco.;
, Tobacco requires a frost-free period of 3 to 4 months between transplant and harvest.For best results, tobacco should be ripened without heavy rainfall; excess water causes tobacco plants to become thin and flaky. The ideal temperature for growing tobacco is 68° to 86° F (20° to 30° C).

, Be sure you place your starting mix in a small flower pot, preferably with holes in the bottom. These seeds should be grown indoors for 4-6 weeks.Seed starting mix consists of compost and other nutrients which promote healthy seed growth. They are available at most gardening and home improvement stores.
Tobacco seeds are extremely small (not much larger than a pin prick), so be sure not to sow them too thickly. Allow adequate spacing between seeds to avoid overcrowding.
Because tobacco seeds are so small, it's not advisable to begin them outdoors. Also, their nutrient requirements are different from many other plants, so adding a bit of gravel or special fertilizer designed for tobacco is a good idea.
Tobacco seeds require warm temperatures ranging from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit to properly germinate. If you aren't growing in a greenhouse, make sure your indoor area meets these temperature requirements.
Do not cover the seeds with soil since they need light for germination; covering can slow down and even prevent germination from taking place. Seeds should begin to germinate in 7-10 days., The soil should never be allowed to completely dry out.


Be extra careful when watering because the force of the water can uproot the freshly emerging tobacco seedlings and cause them to die.If possible, water the seedlings from the bottom. If you used a flower pot with holes in the bottom, set the pot on top of a tray of water. Leave it there for a few seconds so that the water is absorbed by the soil. This will water the seedling without wetting the leaves.

, Your seedlings should be large enough for transplantation if you watered and stored them correctly.


Transplanting seedlings to a larger container will allow them to grow a strong and healthy root system.
To see if your seedlings are the right size, try grasping them. If you can easily pinch them between your thumb and index finger, they are ready for transplanting. If they are still too small, allow the germination process to continue until they have reached the right size.
Transplanting tobacco plants bare-root (without soil) directly from the seedling pot to the garden is an easier method, as it only involves one transplantation. However, once planted, the bare-rooted plant can go into ""transplant shock"" where some or most of its largest leaves turn yellow and wilt. After a week, the tobacco plant will begin to flourish once more, but avoiding transplant shock altogether will save you a week of waiting as the potted plant will begin growing immediately once transplanted.

, This should be sufficient food for the plants until they are ready to be transferred to your garden in approximately 3-4 weeks.


If your plant begins to look yellow or look stunted, another dose of fertilizer may be needed. Do so sparingly, however, since over-fertilization while in pots may burn the plants roots or lead to overgrown, spindly plants., Be sure the area you plant the tobacco is constantly exposed to sun, well-drained, and tilled.


Lack of sun will result in spindly plants, poor growth, and thin leaves. This may not be problematic if you intend on planting tobacco for cigar wrapper use, since growing tobacco under shade can create desirable leaf characteristics.Also test the pH levels of your garden. Tobacco plants need to be planted in moderately acidic soil, otherwise they won't flourish. The soil itself should have a pH of 5.8. Poor growth and some growth disorders may occur if the soil pH is 6.5 or higher.Avoid preparing your garden on soil that is infested with diseases and nematodes. Nematodes are parasitic worms which feed on tobacco and are extremely difficult to exterminate once infestation occurs.

, Space the plants at least 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) apart in a row, and space rows 3 1/2 - 4 feet from each other.


Tobacco plants are ""heavy feeders,"" meaning they will deplete the nutrients in the soil in about 2 years. To counteract this, employ a 2 year rotation in your growing space by planting for 2 years in a different location and waiting 1 year before transferring it back to its original location.Rather than having an empty garden plot, you could rotate tobacco with plants that are not susceptible to common soil-borne pests, like corn or soybeans., Once they become better established, you can water less frequently to avoid over-watering.


Keep the plants well watered without making the soil soggy. If your garden area may experience drought, consider installing an irrigation system. This will prevent the soil from becoming excessively dry, which can then hinder tobacco growth.If you expect a few days of light drizzles or rain, you can water even less frequently. The structure of the tobacco plant's leaves enables the plant to collect and funnel the water down to the base of the plant., Fertilizers used for tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes are also suitable.Over-fertilizing is a serious concern, as it can cause damaging salt accumulation. The application amount will depend largely on the grade of the fertilizer, the natural fertility of the soil, losses of nutrients due to leaching, and other subjective factors. Consult your fertilizer's directions for the most optimal usage.
It is recommended that you apply the fertilizer several times. Once the tobacco begins to flower, there should be no need to fertilize further.

, Topping is the removal of the terminal (center) bud and allows the upper leaves to get larger and thicker than if they were untopped.The terminal bud is the most prominent and is typically located at the very top of the stem.The top can be removed by simply breaking or cutting it off, preferably before any flowers open.
Soon after the top is removed, axillary buds or suckers will develop at each leaf. Remove these by hand as well, otherwise they will reduce the tobacco's yield and quality.

, You can also pull up soil around the base of the plant to help strengthen it.Tobacco roots grow quickly and the root structure is quite large, with thousands of small hair-like feeder roots that grow close to the soil surface. Be careful when tilling or hoeing, as penetrating the soil too deep can damage the roots.
After 3-4 weeks from planting, heavy tilling should be stopped and only light scrapings to control weeds should be done.

, Common tobacco pests include budworms, hornworms, and pathogens.


Tobacco is subject to infestation by many different bugs and diseases. The rotation process should help reduce the likelihood of infestation, but it is no guarantee.
If you still find your tobacco to be infested, many gardening and home improvement stores sell tobacco-specific pesticides. Brand names include ""Nemacor,"" ""Prowl,"" and ""Admire."" Keep in mind that some pesticides are specifically geared towards insect control on young plants, while others just kill fungus. Find a pesticide which is most suitable to your situation.

, Alternatively, you can remove the leaves from the stalk in the field. Your plants should be ready for harvest about 3 months after planting.


Stalks should be cut about 3-4 weeks after topping. The lower leaves will be partially deteriorated at this time. If you remove the leaves in the field, there should be 4 or 5 harvests at intervals of 1-2 weeks, starting with the lower leaves. The first harvest should start soon after topping and when the leaves show a slight yellowing.
Flowers will inhibit the growth of your leaves and will compete for sunlight; removing them is important for obtaining the broadest tobacco leaves possible.
You will need to keep the leaves intact because they will be hanged during the curing process. Curing is necessary because it prepares the leaves for consumption; the process produces various compounds in the leaf which give cured tobacco its hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor. Curing also contributes to the tobacco's ""smoothness"" when consumed.

, The suggested temperature for curing ranges from 65 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, while the most optimal humidity ranges from 65-70 percent.Be sure to provide adequate space between the stalks to allow for satisfactory drying of the leaves.
Proper curing should take a few weeks in order to achieve good quality. Tobacco that cures too fast will be green and will likely not have good aroma or flavor. Leaves that cure too slow may develop mold or rot. Be sure to monitor your tobacco leaves closely for these signs and adjust your temperature/humidity accordingly.
If curing leaves on the stalk, remove the leaves from the stalk once curing has completed.
A building that can be opened and closed as needed to control the humidity and drying rate is ideal. Some producers of homegrown tobacco have built curing facilities and may offer them for sale.Air curing tobacco is primarily reserved for cigar use. Tobacco can also be cured using fire, the sun, or can be flue-cured. Fire-cured tobacco typically takes between 10-13 weeks and is used to make pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco. Sun-cured and flue-cured tobacco is used in cigarettes.

, Commercial tobacco is typically aged for a year or more, but aging your own tobacco can take up to 5-6 years.


Aging will not occur if the temperature and moisture content is perfect. If the tobacco is too dry, it will not age; if it is too moist, it will rot. Unfortunately, the proper temperature and humidity vary widely and will require some experimentation on your part.
Monitor your leaves closely during the aging process to ensure that they remain moist, yet rot free. Aging is not an exact science and will require impromptu adjustments when necessary.Aging your tobacco leaves is optional, but know that un-aged tobacco is often harsh and lacks good flavor.

Purchase a carbon filter, aka ""scrubber."",
Install the carbon filter in your exhaust system.,
Run your filter 24 hours a day.,
Keep humidity below 70 percent.,
Change the carbon filter regularly.",How to Hide the Smell of Marijuana Plants2," Carbon filters are highly recommended for indoor gardens of all sizes. The contain activated carbon, which neutralizes the odors in air as it passes through. The carbon filter is installed in the grow room's exhaust system, where an inline fan forces the air through the filter before passing outside.There are two types of carbon filter, granular and block. Block is generally more effective, with a larger carbon surface area and greater density for slower, more thorough filtration.Granular filters may be effective for small cultivation areas.Choose the filter size according to the amount of air you need to evacuate, measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). The intake fan in your exhaust system should have a CFM rating stamped on the body of the fan. Make sure the filter has a rating equal to or lesser than the fan's to ensure the fan is powerful enough to move the air through the filter. Likewise, both devices should have the same duct diameter (6 inches is standard, but check just in case).If you do not have a fan already, you may opt to purchase one separately, or as part of a fan-filter combination.

,


Connect the filter to the fan's intake side using an airtight clamp. Alternatively, you can use metallic duct tape for this step.
Wrap fixture hangers around the filter and fan, and hang them from the ceiling using two hooks. Raise the system by pulling on the cords.
Try to position the filter and fan in line with the ducting, which should be more or less parallel to the ceiling and pass into the wall.
Attach the fan's exhaust end to the duct.
Some people find it more effective to install the carbon filter at the opposite end of the exhaust system to the fan. In this case, attach the filter to ducting at the end or back of the system. Rig to the ceiling using the fixture hangers as described above., Plants produce odor around the clock, so you'll need to manage it constantly., Carbon filters are less effective in humid conditions.


To help regulate conditions in your grow room at all times, consider connecting the extraction fan to a fan-speed controller that also measures humidity and carbon dioxide levels., Over time, carbon's filtration power lessens, and odors will return. Depending on the filter, it may last between 9 to 12 months. Keep track of when you've last changed the filter and plan ahead to avoid odiferous interim periods.

Brush your teeth.,
Consider using a special smoker's toothpaste.,
Use anti-tar mouthwash for smokers.,
Floss your teeth.,
Go to the dentist regularly.,
Clean your teeth with baking soda.,
Use a combination of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.,
Use over-the-counter oral whitening products.,
Try products you have in your home for teeth whitening.,
Get a professional teeth whitening.,
Quit smoking.This is the most effective way of eliminating staining from smoking but it is by no means the easiest.",How to Keep Teeth White While Smoking," Although this is important for everyone's dental health, tooth brushing is especially important for keeping a smoker's teeth white. Brush your teeth twice to three times a day, being sure to brush for at least two minutes each time.Use a whitening toothpaste if you would like to get an extra level of whitening action.


Smokers tend to have poorer oral health and a higher risk of periodontal disease, so it's important to focus on keeping your mouth healthy.In addition to reducing the risk of problems in your mouth, like gum disease, brushing will whiten your smile.
Try brushing right after you smoke. This will remove the tar and other chemicals deposited on the teeth quickly instead of letting them set it.;
, There are special toothpastes for smokers. These toothpastes contain more abrasive ingredients, such as baking soda or alumina than normal toothpastes. This helps to get at the tar and nicotine embedded in the teeth.Because these toothpastes have additional abrasive, they can wear down your enamel faster. If you are concerned about your enamel wearing down, consider using smoker's toothpaste some of the time and regular toothpaste the rest of the time.

, There are specialty mouthwash products that are made to reduce the amount of tar and chemicals in your mouth after smoking. They are made to be used after each time you smoke.Using a normal mouthwash won't keep your teeth white but it will improve your overall oral health. Use a regular mouthwash even if you can't get your hands on an anti-tar mouthwash. Just be sure to pick a therapeutic mouthwash that actually fights gingivitis and freshens your breath at the same time, as opposed to a mouthwash that just freshens your breath. You should be able to tell the difference because therapeutic mouthwashes include fluoride and antimicrobial agents., It's important to floss your teeth before you sleep or after brushing. In addition to improving your general oral health, it will also help to remove nicotine and tar from your teeth. This will decrease the risk of staining in the areas between teeth.


Pick whatever type of floss you like. The type of floss matters less than how you use it to clean between your teeth.Floss your teeth once a day. It does not matter when you do it, just do it.

, If you are a smoker you should schedule dentist appointments more often than if you didn't smoke. Consult with your dentist about how often he or she thinks you should come in.Your dentist will give your teeth a thorough cleaning during your regular visit, which should take away any light staining and lessen any deep staining.
If you are interested, your dentist can also give you information about smoking cessation, including giving you information on the ill effects smoking has on oral health., It may sound or taste weird, but for the sake of white teeth, you should try it. Brushing with baking soda will make a visible difference in the whiteness of your teeth.


To clean your teeth with baking soda, sprinkle some baking soda on your toothbrush and brush as normal.
Don't leave the baking soda on your teeth for too long and also you shouldn't brush too hard. Baking soda left on too long or scrubbed on too hard can erode the enamel on your teeth, causing more harm than good., Just add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to baking soda until it creates a paste. Then use the paste as you would commercial toothpaste. The addition of hydrogen peroxide whitens your teeth even more than baking soda alone.Because this combination can be very abrasive, you should only use it for a few days and then discontinue use for a few months. This will assure that you don't damage your tooth enamel.

, The simplest to use is whitening toothpaste, as it can be used like normal toothpaste. However, there are a wide variety of other teeth whitening products. They usually come in the form of teeth whitening gels, strips, or bleaches that are applied with teeth trays.These products are very effective for getting rid of smoking stains.Use gels and bleaches sparingly. Stripes are okay to use on a regular basis.

, There are a variety of natural products that are said to whiten teeth. These include banana peels, strawberries, and apple cider vinegar.

Mask the smell with other odors.,
Try an air purifier.,
Grow a lot of plants.",How to Hide Smoke Smell Indoors1," If you're going to smoke indoors and you're worried about others smelling your smoke, the best thing you can do to reduce smoke odors is ventilate the room. It won't solve the problem completely, but it will drastically improve the situation over smoking in an unventilated room.Close the door to your room and open a window. You want to restrict smoke odors from traveling to other parts of the building while directing as much of the actual smoke as possible outside.Put a fan in the window. Have it facing outside rather than towards you. This will help pull smoke out of the room and funnel it outdoors.If you're still actively smoking, blow all of your smoke through the back of the fan so that it gets sucked outside.;
, Some air fresheners and scented candles are specifically designed to mask the smell of smoke. These products are usually available at smoke shops or online. Even if you don't have one of these specialized air fresheners or scented candles, any kind of odor-masking product may help cover up the smell of smoke.However, it's best to stick with just one odor-masking element. Otherwise the room might just smell like a lot of different things and cigarette smoke.


Air sanitizers like Ozium are believed to help neutralize odors like cigarette smoke.Febreze can hide bad smells, possibly including cigarette smoke, because it contains hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), an active agent that traps, binds, and retains malodorous molecules.Citrus is typically considered a good masking odor. If you have fresh oranges, even better: peel a few oranges in your room and leave the peels in strategic locations around your room while you wait for the odor to dissipate.Incense, such as cedar wood, may help cover the smell of smoke.However, burning incense may not be allowed in buildings with strict no-smoking policies.
Leave out a bowl of white vinegar or ammonia. These powerful odors will help mask most odors, including smoke.However, these products do not smell very good, and in the case of ammonia the fumes may be hazardous if left out for prolonged periods of time. You may also have some explaining to do if your roommate or building manager finds bowls of vinegar or ammonia lying around.
Douse a rag with vanilla extract and hide it under a bed or chair. It should emit a strong vanilla odor which may help mask the smell of smoke., Cigarette smoke particles are very small, and therefore most air purifiers do not effectively remove cigarette particles from the room. However, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and electronic air ionizers are designed to target small particles in the air.Even these types of air purifiers will not completely solve the problem, but they may help reduce lingering odors caused by smoke when used in conjunction with other preventative measures.

, Plants help neutralize odors by absorbing particles from smoke and removing carbon monoxide and other chemicals from the air.Having plants placed around your room can help freshen the air, and make the room look cheerier as well.


Some of the best plants for improved air quality include philodendron, spider plants, English ivy, peace lily, daisies, and chrysanthemums."

If you do not smoke yourself, you can use an air freshener if you notice a fresh scent in the air.You can buy gel-based air fresheners that come encased in a plastic case. To use, you would simply open the case to allow the smell to escape.
However, gel-based air fresheners may not provide as strong odor cover up. Many air fresheners plug into a wall and pump out a fresh scent all day. If the smell is strong, considering investing in a plug-in air freshener for an added effect.;
, Scented candles can also mask the unwanted smell of marijuana smoke. You can buy a variety of scented candles at most supermarkets. Many malls have stores dedicated to selling scented candles. Air freshener companies often sell separate candles specifically designed to neutralize and remove odor. Experiment with a variety of scented candles until you find one that works for you.


Consider choosing something with a natural scent, like pine. Using a strong scented candle can seem suspicious, as if you're trying to cover something up., Spray odor removers can be a great means to remove unwanted odor. In addition to spritzing the air with odor removers, you can spray them over your carpeting and furniture to remove set-in smells.


Look for products that advertise themselves as ""odor removers"" or ""odor neutralizers."" These products seek to remove unwanted smells rather than just masking them. Febreeze is a popular variety that can work well, particularly on carpeting and furniture.Always read the manufacturer's instructions before using any product. Some products may come with warnings or should not be used on a particular type of fabric or carpeting.
It's a good idea to spray a small corner of carpeting or fabric first to test out the product. Make sure the spray does not cause any discoloration or other problems before spritzing it all over your carpeting or furniture.

, After smoking, you may still have a faint scent of marijuana on your breath. You can get rid of this smell by chewing a mint-flavored gum.You can also try brushing your teeth and then rinsing with mouthwash. If you have any breath strips, consider using these to cover up the smell.

, Scented body spray or perfume can help cover the smell of marijuana on your clothes. After smoking, spritz a small amount of perfume or body spray over your outfit to try to cover the smell.Before spraying down an entire outfit, test out the product first. Spray a small amount on a tiny portion of your outfit. Let dry and make sure the perfume or body spray does not cause discoloration or damage to your clothing.
Do not use too much spray or perfume. A little bit goes a long way. If you smell strongly, the odor can irritate others and look suspicious. If possible, choose mild, natural scents like sandalwood., Ventilation is also a great way to remove marijuana smell after smoking. Open up a window and smoke nearby. If the wind is blowing the smoke back in, turn a fan towards the window and then switch it on. This will help blow the smoke outdoors.Be careful when blowing smoke outdoors. The scent can be irritating to your neighbors.
Marijuana is still illegal in most US states. Unless you're legally allowed to smoke pot in your home, avoid blowing the smoke out the window. You could get in legal trouble for doing so. You should not smoke marijuana at all if it's not legally permitted in your state.

, Cooking can actually cover the smell of marijuana if you use the right ingredients. If it's close to mealtime, consider cooking foods with onion, garlic, or other strong-smelling substances. This can help cover smell caused by marijuana.


Choose ingredients that produce a smell you do not mind. If you loathe the smell of garlic, you do not want to cover one bothersome odor with another.

Know the law.,
Know the difference between the strains.,
Get your mitts on some seeds.,
Choose a spot and/or method.",How to Grow Legal Cannabis1," Currently 28 states and DC have enacted laws to legalize medical marijuana.A handful of states have broader laws, allowing for recreational use as well. It's important to know the laws where you live. If you are getting into this business and live in the wrong place and/or do not have a doctor's recommendation for the use of medical marijuana, you are in violation of the law.


Check up on the policy for where you live. Though legalization seems to be the way of the future, plenty of places are lagging behind.;
, Marijuana can be categorized into two main strains: Cannabis Sativa and Cannabis Indica. The former gives the feeling of euphoria and content; the latter gives the classic, heavier, stoned feeling. However, most strains available today are hybrids, which means they have a mix of indica and sativa traits.


Indicas tend to be shorter and more compact in size; Sativas are longer and leggier.
There is also a ""ruderalis"" or ""auto-flowering"" strains of cannabis. These strains are hybrids that have been bred to have an ability to start making buds automatically after a few weeks. Auto-flowering strains are usually ready to harvest in about 3 months, and they are available in many popular or famous strains.

, Surprisingly, this isn't super hard. There are a number of companies that are ""reputable"" and can get the deed done swiftly and discreetly. The best seed sources offer a guarantee.

, There are advantages and disadvantages to choosing how and where to grow your plant. You can do it indoors, outdoors, or hydroponics style. It's all up to you.


Growing weed indoors has many advantages when compared to the risks associated with growing marijuana outdoors makes, what with threats from theft and possibly the law if it is illegal to grow where you live. By growing marijuana indoors you can control the ambient conditions just exactly as you want them and grow a nice healthy cannabis plant.
Growing your plant in the wild allows you to avoid any nosy neighbors and avoid being caught red-handed, but it does force you to relinquish an element of control: You can't control the weather, disease, thieves, or how they grow. However, outside also eliminates the need for an indoor growing room, saving you loads of money initially.
Hydroponics is the term for growing plants (any kind) without soil. Believe it or not, they don't actually need it. While soil is obviously a source for nutrients, they can be had in alternative ways.

Leave and come back to assess the smell.",How to Get Rid of Tobacco Smell Fast2," Take baking soda and sprinkle it over your furniture and floors that smell like tobacco. Try to cover each of the surfaces with a thin coating of baking soda.You can pour the baking soda through a colander if you are having a difficult time spreading it around.

, The baking soda will absorb some of the unpleasant tobacco odors from upholstered furniture and carpet as you let it sit. You can use a rag or towel to help push the baking soda into your furniture or carpet., Run a vacuum and try to suck up all of the baking soda. Use the vacuum's attachments for hard to reach places and to vacuum down upholstery. Once you've vacuumed up all the baking soda, make sure to empty the vacuum's bag outdoors.

, Leave the room or house for an hour or two and come back. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine if the tobacco smell is gone once you've been around it for a long time. If the room still smells strongly of tobacco, you can repeat these steps until all of the odors are gone."

Purchase an air purifier online or at a department store. Look for purifiers that have the Clean Air Delivery Rate on the packaging because these purifiers are the best for eliminating bad smells., Place a slice of white bread in a bowl and pour enough white vinegar so that the bread is totally saturated. The wet bread will absorb some of the smoke smell. Once a day has passed, throw away the bread., Carbon can help absorb some of the unpleasant odors left by tobacco products. Leaving a piece of charcoal in a bowl in your house can help absorb the smell of cigarettes. This method may take up to a week to be effective., Scrub down your blinds and wash your curtains to remove the smoke smell from them. The heat from light bulbs can disperse the tobacco smell throughout your house, so replace them if they smell like tobacco."

Wash your walls.,
Clean the rug or flooring.,
Deodorize furniture.,
Get rid of cigarette butts.",How to Hide Smoke Smell Indoors2," This may be a tedious chore if you are an everyday smoker, but one of the biggest odor traps in most household rooms is the walls.If your walls can be wet-washed, a good scrub can help remove a significant portion of lingering smoke odors. Be cautious about scrubbing walls that cannot get wet, such as wall-papered walls or walls with certain types of paint, as moisture may damage these walls and ruin the design.


Use a non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner to scrub the walls of your room. If you have an all-purpose cleaner with a strong odor, like lemon or citrus, that may be even more effective in hiding the smell of smoke.Vinegar can also be used to clean the walls, though again, you may have to explain the vinegar aroma clinging to your room. Mix one cup white vinegar with two cups of warm water, then add a generous scoop of baking soda. Use a mop, brush, or sponge to wash the walls and window moldings, and wipe it all down with a dry paper towel., In addition to walls, carpeting and flooring tend to absorb a considerable amount of smoke odors in an indoor environment. One easy way to help conceal some of the cigarette smells that may linger is by giving the floors in your room a thorough cleaning.You can mop hardwood or tile floors with a scented cleaner like Murphy's Oil or Pine-Sol, or use a dry, granulated carpet cleaner/deodorizer on carpeted floors.Sprinkle the carpet cleaner/deodorizer generously across the carpet throughout the room, and let it sit for a while to absorb any lingering smells.When it seems like the smell is fairly well-masked, use a vacuum to clean your entire room's carpeting.In a pinch, you can mask odors trapped in the carpet by mixing baking soda and a few drops of essential oil, such as lavender. Mix the liquid and powder together as much as you can, then sprinkle the carpet. Let it sit for about four hours (or as long as time permits), then vacuum up the powder., Furniture, especially soft-surfaced furniture like couches and bedding, tend to soak up odors in the environment. Spray-on products like Febreze are designed to help mask odors, though by some reports the odor-masking properties are only temporary, and may require repeat applications.Spraying odor-masking products on furniture and/or carpeting may help reduce noticeable smoke odors, but will not completely eliminate most odors.Rubbing baking soda into a piece of furniture can also help neutralize odors. Let the baking soda sit for as long as possible (ideally overnight, though time constraints may not allow for this), then vacuum up all of the baking soda.This method could even be done in conjunction with a spray-on odor-masking product.
You can clean and remove cigarette smells from hard-surface furniture, such as wood, the same way you do flooring; wipe down the piece of furniture with a scented cleaner.
Also try eliminating cigarette smells by wiping down your furniture with a cloth that is lightly dampened by all-purpose cleaner with bleach.

, This may sound like an obvious step, but it's important to remove any cigarette butts from your room if you want to avoid smoke odors.Not only will stray cigarette butts provide solid evidence that you've been smoking, they will also leave a tell-tale odor behind.


Keep your ashtray empty as often as possible.
Stray cigarette butts can emit a powerful odor long after the flame has been extinguished.If you are trying to hide your smoking from others who live in the same house as you, remember to dispose of cigarette butts in a place they won't be found or smelled.

Change your clothes.,
Cover your breath.,
Wash your hands.,
Take a shower.",How to Hide Smoke Smell Indoors3," Even if you've managed to thoroughly clean your room and mask the odors there, if you've been smoking, the smell will linger pretty noticeably on your clothes.The best thing to do is to change your clothes immediately after smoking, and conceal those clothes in a contained environment, like a tied-up plastic bag.


If you aren’t able to change out of your clothes immediately, try spraying them down thoroughly with Lysol.

, Much like clothing, a person's breath is a tell-tale sign of smoking. Anyone who has ever talked to or kissed a smoker will recall the prominent odor on the smoker's breath afterward. Fortunately, there are a number of options for covering the smell of cigarettes on your breath.


Eat something with a strong odor, like garlic or onions.This should effectively mask the odor from your breath, as garlic and onions tend to overpower most other smells.
Freshen your breath by brushing your teeth and using mouthwash.This will give you the freshest breath possible, and will leave your mouth feeling clean.
Chew a strong mint. Breath mints are designed to mask odors by leaving a strong minty aroma in your mouth. This can even be done after you've brushed your teeth or eaten something with a strong odor. , If you've been holding a burning cigarette for any length of time, there is a good chance that your hands will smell like cigarettes. Fortunately, if you're at home, you should be able to thoroughly wash your hands, ideally with a scented soap.Use a scented soap to work up a good lather between your hands.If you don't have scented soap, a scented shampoo or body wash will do.
Rinse your hands thoroughly, and repeat as necessary.Use hand sanitizer and/or moisturizing lotion to help further cover up the smell after you've washed your hands., Smoke tends to hang on people's hair and scalp due to the porous nature of our body's hair.If at all possible, wash your hair and take a full shower after smoking to adequately hide the smell of smoke on your person.


Use a coconut shampoo or other strongly-scented product to mask the odor on your hair and scalp.Use a scented styling product after you shower to further ensure that your hair does not smell."

Store in airtight containers.,
Seal in a Ziplock bag.,
Use a carbon filter if you're growing.,
Place air fresheners near your weed.",How to Get Rid of Weed Smell2," In storage, marijuana can sometimes leave a strong odor. In order to combat this odor, try storing your marijuana in an airtight, sealable container. A mason jar, a Tupperware container, or a vacuum-packed bag would work well. This will minimizes the odor present in the room where your marijuana is being stored., If you do not have a sealable, airtight container, consider storing your marijuana in a Ziplock bag. A simple sandwich bag can help mask odor caused by marijuana.If you use any device to smoke, such as a pipe, sealing it in a Ziploc bag afterwards can also help mask the odor. Make sure the pipe is cool before storing it in a Ziploc bag to avoid a potential fire hazard., If you're growing marijuana inside your home, the smell can become quite strong. You can purchase a device called a carbon filter to help remove odor from your home.


You can purchase a carbon filter online or at a local greenhouse. For most homegrown marijuana, you'll need a filter with a 6 inch exhaust filter. You can purchase the carbon filter and install it in your closet or in the room where you're growing your plants.You'll need a fan to accompany your filter. When choosing a fan, make sure your fan has a slightly lower ""CFM"" rating than your carbon filter. The CFM rating is a rating that measures airflow, and a fan will not work properly in conjunction with a filter if it has a higher CFM rating. For example, if your filter's box says it has a CFM of 300, make sure your fan has a CFM of 300 or slightly lower.Make sure you are legally allowed to grow marijuana on your property before doing so. In some states, it's legal to grow marijuana for personal use. In other states, you can grow marijuana for yourself or another person to use medicinally. Review your state's regulations before attempting to grow marijuana.

, Alongside other methods, it's not a bad idea to place some air fresheners around where you store your marijuana. A few plug-in or gel-based air fresheners can aid in removing the unwanted scent of pot lingering in the air. As always, go for air fresheners that have a natural scent to avoid suspicion."

Burn incense before smoking.,
Use a vaporizer.,
Try a one-hitter.,
Smoke outdoors, if legal.,
Consider edibles.,
Consider strains that produce less smell.,
Use a sploof.",How to Get Rid of Weed Smell3," It's a good idea to burn a little incense before smoking. You can purchase incense at many supermarkets and craft stores. Choose a mild, natural scent. Light the incense about 5 minutes before you start smoking. This will get the air thick with incense odor, preemptively masking the smell of pot when you begin smoking., A vaporizer is a small, portable device that vaporizes the active ingredients of marijuana. It allows you to inhale the plant without having to light anything, reducing the amount of odor caused by smoking. Investing in a quality vaporizer can greatly minimize odor when smoking.You can purchase a vaporizer online. If you live in a state where marijuana is legal for recreational or medicinal purposes, you may be able to purchase a vaporizer at a marijuana dispensary.You can use a vaporizer anywhere in your home and the smell of marijuana will be very much diluted. Air fresheners, odor removers, and other smell-removing techniques may be unnecessary when using a vaporizers.One downside is that vaporizers often need to charge before use, so make sure to plug in your vaporizer for a bit before you want to smoke.

, A one-hitter is another portable device you use to smoke marijuana. A one-hitter is a mechanical, reusable device designed to look something like a cigarette. You fill the device with a small amount of marijuana and then smoke it like a cigarette. One-hitters, like vaporizers, produce less smell than other methods of smoking.As with a vaporizer, you can purchase a one-hitter online. If you live in a state where marijuana is legal for recreational or medicinal purposes, you may be able to buy a one-hitter at a marijuana dispensary.

, Smoking outside creates less scent because odors disperse in the air. If you're legally able to do so, smoke outside when possible. This will result in less smells becoming trapped in your home., Marijuana can be cooked into butter and then made into a variety of baked goods. If you live in a state where marijuana is legal for medicinal or recreational purposes, you can buy a wide variety of edibles at a local dispensary. Edibles virtually eliminate odor, as no smell is produced via smoking or storage. If you want to eliminate odor, consider purchasing edibles over smoking., Marijuana comes in a variety of strains. Some strains produce a less pungent odor. If you are legally able to go to a dispensary, a worker there may be able to help you select less pungent strains of marijuana. Indica strains, like Northern Lights, Granddaddy Purple, and Rockstar, produce buds with less prominent odors., A sploof is a homemade device designed to mask the smell caused by marijuana. When taking a hit, exhale the smoke into a sploof to help prevent a smell from developing. These can be made with common household items.


To make a basic spoof, wrap a dryer sheet over one end of a toilet paper roll, securing it with a rubber band. Stuff the tube halfway with toilet paper. With repeated use, the dryer sheet with turn brown with residue, so it's handy to store a couple extra dryer sheets in your stash.
Another way to make a sploof is to place 10 to 15 dryer sheets inside your paper towel roll. Put some marijuana inside the sock and stuff this inside the roll.. Use the tube as a pipe to smoke. The smell will be muffled by the sock and the dryer sheets, lessening the odor of marijuana."
"
In early June, buy yourself some pre-fertilized potting soil.,
Fill a small paper cup with enough of the soil to fill to just below the rim.,
Fill a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with holes drilled in the bottom with the soil.,
Water your plant until the soil is completely saturated and water only when the soil becomes dry to the touch.,
Keep an eye on it.,
Be patient.,
Cut the plant at the bottom and place in a warm, dry, well-ventilated area.,
Making sure the buds are completely dry, store them in mason jars for storage and place in a cool dark area.",How to Grow Legal Cannabis2," Although this is not usually organic this will be the easiest route and considering that the grower will probably be suffering from a condition of some kind, this will be better. It must have:


Sufficient nutrients. If you pick up a bag and it says ""N-P-K = x%-y%-z%,"" it's a keeper. This is indicating the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium within the soil.
A pH between 5.9 and 6.5. You can change it yourself, of course. Even the organic fertilizers you buy in the store tend to have pHs that are too low., Moisten the soil and plant the seed about one centimeter deep (1/2""). Do this for each seed you wish to grow. Place the cups in a warm (approx. 70 degrees° F (21°C)) sunny area.


Water your plant and keep it warm. When your plant sprouts, keep the soil moist and let it grow until the seedling becomes root bound. The entire pot will be filled with roots and will hold the shape of the cup when removed.

, Gently remove the seedling from the original container by turning it upside down and gently shaking the container. Gently insert the roots into the soil by making a small hole in the center of the 5 gallon (18.9 L) container and cover the stem to about 2 centimeters (1"") from the first set of leaves.

, Fertilize after about one month with nitrogen fertilizer (follow the instructions for the fertilizer as if you were growing vegetables). Keep the plant in a sunny area at least 8 hours a day and use a natural pesticide if necessary.


You will hopefully have more than one seed to work with because this is the dicey part. If your plant starts to grow small pods that eventually split and release pollen, you have a male plant -- this contains less of the medicinal qualities and is mostly useful only for cooking. When a male appears, quickly separate it from the other (presumably female) plants and harvest it for cooking (simmering the dried plant material in butter is the most effective way).

, The arrival of the male plants (usually in August) will be your cue to fertilize for budding. Use a high Potassium plant food for this and discontinue adding nitrogen. Potassium accelerates the budding process and promotes bud production.

, When small clusters of white ""hairs"" appear you will know you have a viable female plant. Wait until the buds are completely mature, usually in mid October. The buds will have hairs that are all orange to a reddish-purple color and be covered in resin containing tiny tri-chromes. Use a magnifying glass and when these turn an amber color they are ready for harvest.

, The rafters of a barn or garage are usually good for this. By no means is any moisture good; mold will quickly grow and destroy the buds. Hang the plant upside down with newspaper underneath to catch any parts that fall off.

Cut off all the buds. After they have become ""crispy"" on the outside, put them into a large plastic bag. On the following day remove the buds and put them in a paper bag for another week or so.

But since you're working under a roof, you'll need to recreate the power of that big ball of fire. When they're young, the plants need blue light; when they're older and budding, they need yellow, amber and red light. You have a few different options in building your system:



High Intensity Discharge (HID) lights such as High Pressure Sodium (HPS) and Metal Halide (MH) lights. These lights produce a lot of heat and are quite powerful, but they use more energy than other types.

Fluorescent lighting. This type is great for young plants and doesn't use very much electricity. However, once your plants get older, you'll need to get them more light somehow.

Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs). These are easy to find and also don't use much electricity -- because of that, you'll need to stock up. These may be better used as a supplement to a different type of lighting. CFLs should be kept as close as possible to plant leaves without burning them.

LED lights. As far as types go, LEDs use less electricity and produce less heat than their competitors. Though when you go about purchasing some, know that certain brands well outrank others in efficacy and durability of product.The technology behind LEDs is getting more refined and the new trend is in broad-spectrum LED grow lights. They cover the 420 to 730 growing range and use 82% less electricity than the narrow-spectrum devices. They generally keep cool, don't emit a lot of heat, and last for up to 60,000 hours.



, There are number of methods to choose from and a plethora of devices that are out there just waiting to be bought. Do the research before you go about choosing anything. Wick system: This uses just one pump to keep the solution aerated and a grand total of zero to keep it moving -- super easy for beginners to maintain and use successfully. The plant actually takes in just the amount of solution (nutrients) it needs through the wick (a thick acrylic cord works well), giving it only what it needs.

Ebb and flow system: This system uses a timed pump and reservoir to give the plants their food about 4 times a day (at least to start). You simply place the plants in pots, then place those pots in a tray that holds about 6"" (15 cm) of the nutrient solution you're using. If you're using Rockwool, this system is ideal.

Top feed growth system: This system is one of the more complex, at least mechanically. Each plant is fed at its base and any run-off is drained back into the reservoir. If you do choose this method, a 15-minute feed 3 or 4 times a day is where you should start.

, As mentioned before, when you go about purchasing plant food and/or solutions, look for the N-P-K format on the label. Generally, your two options will be 15-15-15 and 20-10-5.


If you are buying hydroponic nutrients, get the powder kind that mixes with water. It is much cheaper over the long run when you compare it with already mixed solutions.

, The standard thing to do is use a Rockwool cube to start the seed on and surround it with whatever growing media you use. Keep the Rockwool cube so that the bottom 70% or so is submerged when the water is at its maximum, but keep the top part above the water so that the seed is never submerged.

You may also use Vermiculite, Perlite, or clay pellets (in addition to soil). Beginner growers are usually better off buying a medium from the store, whether that be brands like Pro-Mix or Sunshine. When you become more advanced you will want to save money by creating your own medium and generally they are created using the same bases such as sphagnum, peat moss or coco coir.That being said, the main advantages of soil are its natural buffering ability in keeping pH constant and it is very forgiving in the event of electrical or mechanical failure when feeding or watering.


After the seeds have germinated and the root is about a quarter of an inch long, place the seed, root down, on your grow cube or media in your hydroponic cups.

, The first phase of marijuana growth is called the vegetative phase. If you plan on using LED, MH or HPS right away, start with about 20 inches or more above the top of the plant (less for LEDs) and lower the light an inch or so daily until you think the height is right. Too close and the plants will dry and turn brown; too far and the plants grow too tall as they stretch to get closer to their light source.


Start high and lower the light an inch or two daily until you think the height is right and the light emitted is being caught well by the plants.
During the first stage of growth, keep the light on 18 to 24 hours a day minimum. The longer it is on, the faster the plants will grow (but the higher your electricity bill will be).

, This is when the THC, CBN, and CBD are produced -- the ingredients needed to reach a high. It's only produced on the females and the process is fairly evident; the growing process will slow as the plants devote more energy to creating the buds.


When the plants are at least 6"" (15 cm) high and have 4 sets of leaves, you're in the clear to start the flowering process. For most hydroponic plants, this takes 2-4 weeks, so be patient. When you think your greens are ready to flower, cut the light back to 12 hours a day.
If your plant has reached that 6"" mark and you start flowering anyway, it'll keep growing for up to a month. It should then stop, putting all its energy into producing flowers. If you wait for it to mature a bit more, the process should only take around 10 days., Though your first thought should be to mess with the area, not your actual plant. The easiest thing to do is to adjust the height of the light. You can experiment with growing stunted plants, but each method takes a lot of skill and expertise and therefore won't be outlined here.

, If you did go the hydroponic route, it'll take about 3 to 4 months for your plants to flower. However, there are two methods that speed up the process, though they're quite difficult and should only be left to the pros. But if you're curious:


Sea of Green, or SOG, is a way of growing cannabis that forces the plants into the flowering stage when young and small. By starting the flowering phase of your marijuana plants after about two weeks of vegetative growth you can harvest many weeks earlier than you would if you grew your plants to full size.Screen of Green, or SCROG, is one of the most productive systems for growing weed that there is. Cannabis plants are trained through a horizontal screen placed above them, spreading the tops of the plants along a horizontal plane and encouraging bud formation along the normally neglected branch stems., You want to get as close to simulating a patch in the woods as possible. During flowering, everything should be dark, dark, and darker still. That means no room light, sunlight, or any other light for half the day (that's 12 hours). The only light that's even remotely acceptable would be equivalent to that of the moon.


Light that is any stronger could delay flowering. Your plant could become stunted and stay in the vegetative phase, never flowering at all.
When you start seeing light white hairs near the buds, your plants have started to flower. This should happen just short of or up to 2 weeks into the flowering light cycle. When your plants hit this stage, remove the male plants. Unless you have all female clones, that is. Once alone, the pistils will become the red or white hairs that turn into beautiful buds.

, Do this once during the flowering phase and again after 6 weeks and then again just before harvesting. This will help remove any build up of fertilizers within the plants or growing medium, making for a cleaner smoke.

, It's absolutely imperative, once again, that you are patient. No one can tell you the exact time to harvest your plant -- it varies plant to plant and strain to strain. Normally, the process takes around 2 to 3 months. Once you've been to the rodeo a few times, you'll know.


As the female flowers grow they form heavy ""kolas"" or cones. You will notice each ovary swell and tiny crystals will be visible around the flowers. The flowers will become sticky to the touch and the aroma will become pungent. As the flowers swell the white pistils begin to darken, growing from white to a reddish brown. Most growers wish to harvest marijuana plants when THC production has reached its maximum. A rough guide is to wait until around 60% of the white pistils have darkened.During this time, you may notice some of the larger leaves yellowing and wilting. This is not cause for alarm and is perfectly natural. Remove these, if you'd like, to allow more light to the rest of the plant.



, Leave only the buds when you're ready to dry your weed. Attach them to a wire or string and hang them upside down in a cool, dark room. Get the fan circulating or turn on the air as plenty of air movement is necessary for adequate drying. However, know that buds that are forced to dry too quickly get a nasty ""green"" taste (this is due to the retained chlorophyll).


Allow your plants around 4 – 7 days to dry completely. Squeeze the buds between your forefinger and thumb -- is it dry? When they are, you should seal them in an airtight jar or bag. For the next few days let them breathe for 15 minutes, twice a day. This cures the buds, ensuring all water is removed and makes them better to smoke -- they get a smooth, sweet taste and have an even burn.

This will make it so that smoke won't escape from your room into the rest of the house. remember, non smokers will smell the smoke. ALSO- make sure the blanket isn't sticking out under the door into the hall. this makes it obvious you're trying to hide something. DON'T FORGET TO LOCK YOUR DOOR!

, This will allow the smoke to go outside and the room will be refreshed with new air. note that air doesn't escape immediately, so it will take anywhere from 15- an hour to air out depending on how much you open the window.

, This is where you take a spray/ air freshener and spray the room. This just makes it safer that the smoke will get masked in with the spray, and will make it harder to detect there is smoke in the room.

, Sit on the floor. Make sure the blanket is big enough to cover you, a lamp, and reach the floor. Before you do this, turn off the lights (This also makes it more fun)

The last thing you want them to be is detected by humans and the second to last thing you want them to be is detected by animals, so choose carefully. Look for tracks and choose an area that you can get to, but that isn't too obvious. Here's what to consider:


A good, reliable source of water is mandatory. A site situated by the side of a river or stream is ideal, but remember that flooding is a risk in spring or autumn. Look for high water marks, debris in trees or water marks on rocks.
Avoid areas with pine trees -- the soil is probably too acidic; go for the grassy knoll. Look at what else is already growing at the site. If there are plenty of grasses, weeds and nettles then chances are the location is already blessed with decent soil and water. Woodland sites may also be worth investigating, but think about how the sunlight will filter through the canopy. When inspecting the site, think about how it'll change over the course of the next few months. The sun will get higher (making it hotter) in the summer, getting your plants baked before you do.
Find a place where your plant can get at least 5 hours of direct sunlight a day. Where will it hit in the morning, the day, and into the evening? How about over the course of the seasons?

, It's easiest to start with a smaller number of plants -- each one should have about 10 feet (3.0 m) in diameter from the next. That sounds like a lot, but it's only 5 feet (1.5 m) on either side for the leaves to grow from. And keep in mind that they could grow up to 5' (1.5 m) tall!


Clear away any weeds in the immediate vicinity and dig some decent size holes; they should be at least 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and two feet wide. It is best to replace the original soil with your own ""clean"" soil from the garden supply shop which should include compost and fertilizer. The original woodland soil will usually harbor a number of pests and diseases and may not be of the best quality anyway. It is a good idea to add a thick layer of mulch to the top surface of the growing area to help keep moisture in the ground below.

, Planting should take place early in the season, around April or May, after the last frost. Obviously the exact timing will depend on where you live -– this is based on the Northern hemisphere (i.e. in time for spring and summer).


For the southern hemisphere (where spring begins on the 1st of September), watch for a warm spell after that date. Marijuana plants will not tolerate frost so it’s better to be safe than sorry.
Plant the seeds, sideways, around 1.25cm (1/2”) deep into your prepared soil. Make sure that they are well watered and will not dry out if there are some sunny days. In addition, make sure you keep them moist at all times. After approximately 48 hours you should start to see the first signs of the seed cracking open and the first shoots coming out.

, One of the best solutions is to have a stream, river, or lake nearby and hook up a small solar powered pump with a timer on it. That said ""best,"" not ""easiest."" Think about watering the plants in the early morning and then in the early evening.


Another solution is to devise your own sort of wick system, as discussed previously. Cut a small half pea size hole into the bottom of a 5 or 10 gallon (or more) bucket or plastic container. Place the bucket near the plant and use a cloth or cotton rope to form a wick that funnels the water (or nutrient solution) from the hole in the bucket to the soil near the plant.
You have to get the amount of water down pat. Too much and your plants drown (you'll know when the leaves turn yellow); too little and they just don't grow. You'll end up using around 20 to 40 gallons (75.7 to 151.4 L) each season. It all depends on the type of soil you use, the strain, and the amount of sun your plants get.

, Once established your seedlings will soon enter a vigorous vegetative growth stage. From such fragile beginnings plants quickly become full and robust. It is a good idea during this phase to feed your plants well with some quality, nitrogen rich, fertilizer.


Unlike growing marijuana indoors you have no control over the duration of the vegetative growth stage and over the course of a summer plants can become huge. But hey, at least there's no marijuana in your house.

, If your garden is out in the wilderness, unfriendly (and threatening) weeds will soon take over and overcrowd your loveable little seedlings. There’s no need to start a forest fire; just clear an area about 3 feet (1 m) around each plant.


Repeat this process again around 3 weeks later. It may be necessary to repeat it again after a further 3 weeks, depending on your site. Most plants, by this time, should be strong enough to make their own space and crowd out weed growth.
If the weather has taken an unfortunate turn of events, go check your plants for damage. Heavy winds, rains, and drought can all take their tolls on your efforts. However, don't jump the gun -- these plants can hold their own, so don't panic if you live in Seattle., Although generally considered one of the trickiest parts of growing your own marijuana, sexing is quite straightforward and will become easier as you gain more experience. The reason for sexing your plants is so that you can remove male plants before they have a chance to pollinate the females. If this occurs the females will start to develop seeds and this will divert their energy from THC production.


Towards the end of the summer, as the hours of daylight decrease, changing light levels will trigger your plants to produce flowers. The appearance of pre-flowers at branch junctions is what you are looking for.
Male pre-flowers should be clearly visible to the eye, although a magnifying glass will make your job easier. Male flowers form at the junctions of the branches and stem and the pollen sacs form little balls. Remove these., The female flowers will start to form kolas around the branch junctions with a main one at the growing tip of the plants. If you look closely you will see the seed pods and these will swell; either with seeds if your plant has been pollinated or with THC as false pods if you have removed the males.


As the flowers become ready for harvest the pistils will darken and the seed pods will be swollen and sticky with resin and THC trichomes. Once most of the pistils are dark, you're ready!

, Plan this one out (and plan it well) because, if everything goes according to plan, you will be venturing back home with a load of smelly, sticky bud in your trunk. If possible, a nighttime visit would be preferable (you probably figured). Ideally plants will be ready to harvest when the buds have darkened, swollen and are glistening with THC crystals.


However, guerrilla gardening isn’t always ideal, so keep an eye on the weather forecast. If extreme weather, or worse, an early frost is imminent and your plants are budding, but not fully ripe, it might be worth harvesting early. This is a judgement call and no guide can fully cover all eventualities.
Harvest the buds with a clean, sharp knife. The fan leaves are usually discarded although some growers like to use them for cooking.

, Don’t spoil it now (so close!) by being impatient. The best smoke will come from buds that are dried slowly. Hang the buds separately in a cool, dark, well ventilated area. Allow around 5 days for them to dry properly.


Some growers use microwaves to dry them out more quickly but this is detrimental to both the quality and the taste of the smoke. Don't do it. "

Talk broadly about your sexual desires and fantasies together.,
Slowly ramp up your sexual adventures if oral sex seems too far off.,
Check in about your sex lives regularly.",How to Talk to Your Wife or Girlfriend about Oral Sex1," This can be an awkward conversation to bring up, but it is also a light-hearted and fun conversation once you both agree not to judge each other. What fantasies or styles do you like? What silly but sexy ideas rev your engines? Do you share any? Remember, this isn't a deep, serious conversation, but it brings up the sort of conversational intimacy that can lead to discussion of oral sex:


Make lists of your top five dream places to have sex, even if some of them are unlikely or humorous.
Browse through a sex book or website like Kama Sutra, noting fun or adventurous positions to try.
Share any fantasies or secret desires together, asking hers as well. If you can find ways to make both of you happy, this conversation will get much easier.;
, If you feel like oral sex is something you want, but it is maybe moving things too quickly, start with smaller adventures. Make a bigger deal of foreplay, which is a safe way to take small risks and learn more about each other. Try some dirty talk. Kiss all over each other's bodies, getting comfortable with every inch of each other. As these thresholds are crossed, oral sex will become less of a big topic and more of a natural next step.

, If you're in a committed relationship you can't have one talk about sex and then never bring it up again. Why would you?! Whether the conversation is about oral sex or not, checking in with each other about your sex life is important to grow and build a relationship together. Moreover, it makes it far easier to broach the topic of oral sex when you have a history of open and honest sexual discussions.


Once you're comfortable together, are there new things you want to try (oral sex or otherwise)? Ask her the same question.

You need to be upfront if you expect her to be the same. Remember that your sex life is shared, not yours alone, and to make this about both of you, not just her.


""I'd like to find ways to bring more oral sex into our lives.""
""I think the two of us should start exploring oral sex, if we're both comfortable.""
""I really enjoy going down on each other, and I'd like to try and make it a more important part of our sex life.""

, Listen, even if it's not what you want to hear. Genuinely listen to you partner expressing her thoughts and concerns. She may or may not have much to say, and what she says might not be to your liking. You have addressed your desires, and even if she says no, she's aware of what you'd like. It will stay in her head, and if you're nothing but supportive, respectful, and understanding then she may feel more confident and trusting once she's had a chance to think about it on her own terms.


Remember, all you can do is say your desires -- be honest about your own desires and she will be about hers.

, Comments or ideas like ""I'll do the dishes for a week if you go down on me"" aren't going to build the trust and love needed for a happy sex life. The things that go on in the bedroom are communal, not services that she gives you for a job well done, no matter what that job is. If you want her to feel valued and comfortable (and thus more likely to find common ground), don't treat this like a transaction -- treat it like a conversation., Oral sex can be scary for some woman. Some women can easily feel as if their air supply is compromised and like they may gag and choke. She's putting herself in a vulnerable position and it's important that you understand this. Some women fear hurting their partner or just getting it wrong. Without complete sexual trust, these activities could result in her feeling a great deal of anxiety, helplessness, and discomfort. If you dismiss her concerns and only focus on your desires, you're not putting her at ease.


Ask her why she dislikes of feels uncomfortable about oral sex and be ready for the answer. Remember that there are likely sexual acts that you, too, are uncomfortable with.

, There are a lot of ways you can make things better for both of you. Maybe she'd like a little more grooming or manscaping or would prefer if you both showered together beforehand to clean up. Maybe she's wanted to talk about oral sex as well, and would like you to also consider going down on her. Whatever her reasons or ideas, you don't know until you ask.Do you like to initiate sex, then move on to something else? Oral sex is an intimate act, and is more likely if you value and set aside time for your sex life., Guys can go down on girls as well, and if you want to bring oral sex into your relationship, you need to be comfortable performing oral sex as well. This is a great way to not only put her at ease, but slowly incorporate new things into your shared sex life without making her initiate everything.


Never use oral sex as a passive aggressive bargaining chip -- ""I did it, now you should too."" Not only is this disrespectful it has no chance of putting her at ease and making oral sex a permanent part of your relationship.

Understand that your partner might never enjoy or want to engage in oral sex.",How to Talk to Your Wife or Girlfriend about Oral Sex3," Ignore the movies, which portray sex as a deeply serious act of soul-wrenching power. More often than not, especially in committed relationships, sex is a fluid, often-awkward, and always fun activity that only you two share. Having a light-hearted attitude may seem like useless advice, but people are way more willing to try something new when they can laugh off any initial issues or awkwardness


If you like something in the moment, let her know! This is the best way to build comfort, trust, and a great shared sex life.
If something goes ""wrong,"" simply smile! If something goofy happens, like your fall off the bed somehow, don't be afraid to laugh -- it won't kill the mood.
Successful sex lives are about feeling calm and comfortable, and no one is more at ease than smiling and laughing with significant other., Never make demands, get upset, force her to give you oral sex, or blatantly ask for it, especially as things are heating up. You've said your piece, and she's said hers, and there is no need to start pushing it now. When she's ready, she'll initiate things herself.


If you've discussed ways to bring oral sex into your relationship, and several weeks or months pass without any change, you should bring the conversation back up during a quiet, respectful moment.

, Not all oral sex has to be to completion. A good way to make her more comfortable is to bring oral sex into foreplay, then moving on to positions you're both more naturally comfortable with. This can help her start to find her comfort level and keep the conversation alive and find a level of compromise.

, She needs to feel completely safe. Make sure she knows, if you hold her head or her hair while engaging in such intimate relations, you'll always maintain enough control of yourself to be able to avoid restraining her head in the heat of passion. It's fine, and can even be desirable, to hold her hair out of the way, or place your hand on her head or shoulder, but it should be in a way that's very gentle and comforting to her.


If she becomes uncomfortable and wants to stop early, that's okay. Remember that, for a woman who may not enjoy oral sex, these first steps will help her become more comfortable over time.

, This isn't a debriefing, and you don't have to do it every single time you sleep together (it will get old, fast), but you should feel free to talk about your sex life together. After the act, as you're hanging out and cuddling, ask what she enjoyed. Figure out if there were some things she can do without, and be sure to keep it light and laugh-filled. You're a couple, and you likely discuss every meal you cook after eating it -- there is no reason you can't share this same openness after sex.


If she's just exploring oral sex, let her know how much you enjoyed it! Staying silent may make her feel like it was unappreciated or, worse, that she is no good at it and shouldn't keep exploring., If approached with love, trust, openness, and understanding, this can be a mutually shared, and mutually satisfying experience for both partners. You sex life is an ongoing, living part of your relationship, and will grow and evolve if you give it attention. Keep talking, keep being honest, and keep loving each other and you'll both be happy.


Know that, if you've talked honestly, you cannot take this personally. Her refusal or desire not to go down is not necessarily a sign she ""doesn't love you."" Trust her responses and find a way to work things together instead of freaking out.
Disliking oral sex isn't a great reason to break up with someone, but a lack of sexual compatibility may be. Make sure both parties are willing to listen, compromise, and work together., Different people are aroused by different sexual acts. Just because you talk to her and listen to her and do all of the above, does not entitle you after any amount of time to expect her to ""come around"" on the subject. The same is true for yourself. If she suggested an act that you simply don't enjoy, you would not want to engage in it, regardless of how nicely she asked you about it. Respect her decision. She does not owe you oral sex or have to take it because you want to give.

As a couple, you've both got a responsibility to help each other enjoy your sex life, meaning you should bring up your own questions about what to do and what she likes when talking about oral sex?


""Do you like when I go down on you?""
""Are there things we can do to make sex more enjoyable for us?""
""I'd like to bring more oral sex into the bedroom for us both -- what do you think?""

, This isn't the time to push your wants and desires, this is about her. Oral sex is frequently something one partner does for the other, letting them relax while you pleasure them exclusively. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't enjoy it and feel comfortable as well (you absolutely should!) but that you should place her pleasure first as long as it falls in your comfort zone.


If she is uncomfortable about oral sex, ask her why. Commonly, women are incorrectly led to believe their vaginas are ""dirty"" or ""shameful,"" and that no guy wants to be there. Assure her, for you, that this isn't the case.Are there things she knows she doesn't like? Things she knows she loves?

, If you want her to be honest about her feelings, you've got to do the same. Not all guys feel equally comfortable with oral sex, and that's okay -- this is why you're talking about it. In order to best help her oral sex, you'll need to be comfortable too. That means admitting if parts of oral sex make you uncomfortable or, on the flip side, if you'd really like to start going down on her more often than you do now.


What stuff is off limits to you?
What things would you like to add or try in the future?
How do you feel about performing oral sex?, The pressure of making completely pleasuring your partner through oral sex, especially if it is a relatively new act. Instead, use oral sex to ""warm up"" for things you're more comfortable with. You'll both be more willing to experiment, and you can slowly work up to longer or more intimate acts without the pressure of one person doing all of the work., She is the only one who can say if something feels good or isn't doing much, so listen to her! Assure her that you won't be offended she tells you to try something else, as this is the only way to learn what works for her body. Even more importantly, have her clue you in when you're doing something good, helping you focus in on the things she needs and loves.


Listen to her voice, moans, and body language as well. Remember to pay attention to her, not yourself, for the best experience.
If she's not comfortable talking during sex, or giving feedback, consider a simpler system -- perhaps she can tug your hair lightly if she likes something, or she'll tap your shoulder if what you're doing isn't quite working.
If she seems to enjoy something, keep doing it. Pleasuring your partner is not some complex game of chess -- stick to what works!, New positions, experiments, and tricks are an exciting part of your sex life, but that doesn't mean they should be surprising! Asking consent doesn't mean killing the mood or stopping sex in it's track -- you can easily make it a part of foreplay or light dirty talk (ex. ""I really want to ______, would you like that, baby?""). Consent is an ongoing process between lovers, not a single conversation, but this actually makes it easier to stay on the same page in bed. If you're trying to bring oral sex into your sex life with some spontaneity, first say:


""Would you like if we tried ________""
""Do you want me to continue?""
""I'm going to _______. Tell me if you don't like it!"", A good place to start might be things you thought you did well, suggesting ""did you like it when I tried __________"" or ""would you like if I kept doing __________ more often?"" Don't pressure her for an answer -- many times she will be too engrossed in the sex to stop and think about what she liked -- but just asking is a good way to show her that you her pleasure is a priority.

Store your unused dip in a cool place.",How to Dip Smokeless Tobacco," Determine the freshness of the tobacco by checking if it is moist and pleasantly aromatic.


Smokeless tobacco is also available in pouches or bags. The method for dipping is the same regardless. However, cans are the most common container for smokeless tobacco.
If you are a beginner, try to get long-cut chewing tobacco. It's easier to pinch and easier to keep in one spot in your mouth.;
, This optional step helps compact the dip so it's easier to grab and you can get more into the same size in your mouth.


The easy way to do this is just bang the can a few times on anything ranging from your leg to a table.
The more refined way is to hold the can with your thumb, middle and ring fingers, allowing the index finger to remain loose. Move your hand rapidly up and down, forcing the loose index finger to make a banging noise on the side of the tin. The impact of your finger will pack the dip.

, Taking the first dip from a fresh can is harder than any other time, but you must simply work your fingers deep into the tobacco and pull out a pinch. A pinch is usually about the amount you can pinch between your thumb and the tip of your pointer finger. If you are new to chew, smaller is better.

, Make sure the placement is packed in as you don't want loose tobacco floating around your mouth and getting swallowed by accident.


When you are starting, it is recommended to put it on the lower lip because an upper lip placement is harder to maintain. Experts may put dip on the upper lip, or do a horseshoe (all the way around the bottom lip). Pack the dip with your tongue, if needed, to make sure it is loaded into place.

, To get more juice, work the lip in and out. Don't chew it. The nicotine is absorbed through your lip without having to actually chew the tobacco.


For some cuts, you may have to work your saliva into the wad of dip. This is because some cuts will give you cotton-mouth, and you want to get your wad moist to begin producing saliva.
If you are new to tobacco, you may experience a pleasant buzz or nausea followed by vomiting. If you start to sweat, feel sick or unpleasantly lightheaded, immediately get rid of the dip because you may soon become sick.

, Wait until your mouth is filled substantially with the tobacco's juice.


You can use a used plastic bottle as a spitter. Make sure to close the cap of the water bottle after spitting into it, however, as it could spill.
You can also use a spittoon or MudJug. The MudJug is like a spittoon except it's designed so that it can't tip over, thereby spilling dip juice.

, A fridge or the freezer would be fine. This will help it from drying out.

Dry ice
Hammer
Dish soap or bubble liquid
Graduated cylinder or a similar container
Heavy rubber gloves;

Explain that you are well aware that cigarettes and the chemicals involved are in themselves addictive- but you also enjoy smoking to satisfy your addiction. You know the risks and have chosen to smoke, and to continue to smoke.

, In a calm manner tell the con-smoker that their opinion and feelings mean a lot to you and may be valid, but you disagree with it, and choose to smoke. Remind them that you respect their decision to not smoke, and that you would appreciate if they would respect your decision as well.

, You know them and still choose to smoke. Everyone dies, there is no escaping it, and despite the risks you choose to smoke.

, If you do not intend to quit, do not tell them you'll think about quitting. This fuels a con-smoker. They will feel they have made headway and it will bolster their confidence in the idea that whey will eventually get you to quit.

If you are condescending, or if your intention is not helpful, you may lose a good friend.;
, People have different sexual values, even when they have many other things in common. Sex is a moral issue in our culture, but it's also one with medical implications. Safer sex refers only to engaging in sexual interactions that are less likely to result in the transmission of disease.If you're disturbed by the moral values of your friend's sexual habits, consider finding another way of handling your discomfort.
Being clear on your own ""triggers"" or values on the topic of safe sex will help you better prepare for this conversation with your friend.

, You'll need to find a time when both you and your friend will have plenty of time to talk. You don't want to feel hurried or rushed. Find a private place for this conversation, one that's quiet and free of distractions.If you'll be talking with a group of friends, make sure that everyone feels included.

, If you're serious about having a conversation about safe sex, it's best to say exactly what you mean. Don't use euphemisms or figures of speech that others might not understand. If you talk with a clear and direct tone, you're more likely to get others to respond in this way.If you tend to get embarrassed when talking about sex, your friends might become embarrassed also. This will make your conversation more difficult.

Blow into the bubble.",How to Create a Smoke Filled Bubble2," You’ll need to either buy bubble liquid or create your own using dish detergent. Fill a glass or small jar with a 1:1 solution of water and dish detergent.


Mix the solution and be sure it is ready before lighting up.
It’s also helpful if you have a bubble wand handy. These typically come with bubble liquid., Light your cigarette with a match or lighter. Fill your mouth with smoke, but don't swallow or inhale it.


You may need to puff the cigarette a few times to ensure it is fully lit., Place a straw into the liquid bubble solution. Again, the bubble wand creates bubbles easier than a straw.

, Hold the straw between your lips and slowly blow. Do not release the smoke as one might normally because the smoke will come out too fast and ruin the bubble. A curved bubble should form."

Don't be judgmental.,
Use good listening skills.,
Talk only about what you've seen.,
Avoid overgeneralizations.,
Pay attention to your friend's reaction.,
Help your friend plan new behaviors.",How to Talk to Your Friends About Safe Sex2," Remember that not everyone shares the same perspective on sex. If you've never talked to your friends about safe sex before, you might find out that their perspective is quite different from your own. It's important to realize that the purpose of this conversation isn't to pass judgment on another person's perspective. Instead, listen with curiosity to what your friend shares.By participating in honest conversations about safe sex, you might learn new ideas.
If you're having this conversation because you're concerned about your friend's safety with sex, make sure you stick to that topic. For example, ""I'm worried that you might catch a sexually-transmitted disease,"" is better than, ""I hate it when you act like a slut.""

, Look at your friend while she's talking, and ask questions to clarify anything you don't understand. Repeat your friend's words in your own language so that your friend can confirm that you've understood what she said.Avoid giving advice that's not asked for, or making statements that dismiss your friend's experience.
Further the conversation by asking open-ended questions, like, ""How did you feel about what happened?""

, You should plan to stick to sharing your own observations about your friend's behavior when you're having this discussion. If you've noticed your friend engaging in risky behavior, provide specifics. It's possible that she hadn't realized her behavior was unsafe.If you've had experiences that are similar, it's okay to bring these up as well.
Avoid bringing other people's perspective into the conversation, because that will make your friend feel like others are ganging up on her. For example, saying things like, ""My other friend was saying how freaked out she was by your behavior last week,"" is unlikely to further your conversation.
If your friend gets defensive, don't argue with her by bringing up other people who support you. It's okay to say, ""I hear you, and I care about you.""

, Saying things like, ""You always..."" or ""You never..."" is likely to make your friend feel defensive. Instead, stick to situations that you can talk about in specific ways. For example, ""Last Thursday, when we were out together, I was worried when you decided to leave with someone you'd just met that night.""It will help to provide specific reasons why you're concerned, from your own perspective.
Remember to remind her that you're concerned about her health and safety. If you can, try to stay on topic without getting emotional.

, If she's genuinely surprised, you can help provide her with good information about safe sex. If she's defensive and angry, it might be because she's embarrassed. If she laughs it off, remind her that STDs and HIV are serious issues, but don't pressure her to talk more about it.Reassure her that you're not mad at her, and that you're only trying to be helpful.
Make sure you offer to help her access more information about safe sex, including where to get condoms.

, Be ready to help your friend consider safer sexual habits, if she seems open to your help. For example, if she's willing to go with you to the health clinic and get tested, be prepared to call and make an appointment. Or, better yet, take her to a clinic right away.If drinking or drugs are contributing to the issue of safe sex, have the phone numbers or locations of organizations that can help her learn to live sober.
Don't be too bossy. Instead, let her guide this part of the conversation. Your friend is the best decider of what she's ready to change.
Remember that she might not be ready for your help yet. Some people take longer to process information than others. Don't be surprised or put off if your friend doesn't ask for your help right away.

Be prepared for an honest conversation.,
Ask if he's ever been tested for STDs.,
Make sure you get tested for STDs.,
Be prepared.,
Be direct and straightforward.",How to Talk to Your Friends About Safe Sex3," If you have any sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) or are HIV-positive, this is a conversation you'll need to have before you engage in sexual activity. Make sure to set aside enough time that you don't feel rushed or pressured.


If this is the first time you've ever had this conversation, remember that he's probably nervous too.
Remember that this isn't a conversation about moral values, but about good health.

, If you're planning on having safe sex with a new partner, it's your right to know if you're putting yourself at risk for an STD. Keep your question direct and to the point:


""Have you been tested for STDs?"" or ""When were you last tested or STDs?""
""What were the results?""
You can also tell him what you need: ""Before we have sex, I need us both to be tested for STDs.""

, These tests can be done by most health clinics for a low price. Because many STDs don't have obvious symptoms, you might not know whether you have an STD or not unless you get tested.If you're under 18, you may need a parents' permission to be tested for STDs. Laws vary by state.
Any time you've had unprotected sex (sex without a barrier) with another person, you're putting yourself at risk for an STD.
To put your mind at ease, get tested for STDs after every unprotected sexual encounter.

, The only real way to prevent STDs is to use barriers to protect you from contact with another person's body fluid. Using male condoms or female condoms are essential for having safe sex. If you're going to talk about having safe sex with a potential sex partner, you'll want to be prepared with the equipment to practice safe sex.Condoms can be purchased at most drug stores, pharmacies, or grocery stores. Your medical provider or health clinic might have free samples that you can use.
If you're allergic to latex, try latex-free condoms. Both latex and non-latex have similar success rates, but non-latex are often more expensive.Remember that birth control doesn't prevent STDs.

, The simpler you can keep this conversation, the better it's likely to go. Remember that this is a conversation about health concerns, not value judgments.You can start a conversation about safe sex by saying things like:


""Getting tested for STDs before we have sex will help us both.""
""I don't think there's any sense in taking chances when we can know for sure.""
""I really care about you, and I want to make sure we're both healthy.""
""We can enjoy having sex much more if we both know that we're healthy.""
""Using condoms is totally sexy for me.""

Decide what you want to discuss.,
Gather external resources.,
Understand your child probably knows more than you think.,
Have occasional big discussions.,
Discuss menstruation with girls.,
Discuss wet dreams, ejaculation, and erections with boys.,
Do not shy away from hot button topics.,
Let your child know he can come to you with questions.,
Look for learning opportunities.,
Model a healthy attitude about sex and relationships for your child.",How to Talk About the Birds and the Bees," Over time, you should have a variety of discussions with your child about sex, sexuality, and reproduction. You should be prepared ahead of time in regards to what you feel most subject you feel most comfortable discussing with your child.


What are you the most comfortable talking about? Some parents feel fine discussing the technical aspects of reproduction, but others balk at the idea as they fear they don't know enough to explain it well. Some parents are okay discussing relationships, consent, and readiness for sex, but others are uncomfortable with being so casual with their kids. Know what you feel you can cover yourself, without outside material.You should strive to frankly discuss the topics you're most comfortable with upfront and lean on outside material for areas you're less confident.Take your child's age into consideration. You should always answer a child's question about their body, but depending on your personal parenting style you might prefer to hold off on discussing sex and reproduction itself until around 10 or 12. Some subjects too might not be an issue until your child is a teenager. It's fine to talk to your 10 year-old daughter about menstruation and what it means, but she might not understand safe sex and STDs until she's a few years older.;
, As stated, you might have to rely on certain outside sources for some areas of the sex talk.



What Makes A Baby by Cory Silverberg is a great children's book for parents looking to explain how babies are conceived and born to young children. If you're unsure how to word the discussion in a kid-friendly manner, this can be an excellent resource.The website BishUK provides a range of topics for parents and teens that covers not only the physical aspects of sex but its emotional impact. You could direct your child to these web pages as he reaches his teenage years.MTV, as part of their well known Teen Mom series, has a website known as mysexlife.org that helps teenagers understand sex and sexuality and how to make safe decisions regarding their bodies.Speakeasy, a Family Planning Association, has online guides to help parents talk to kids about sex and reproduction at a variety of ages., Many parents underestimate how much information children absorb, even at a young age, about sex and reproduction. Try to maintain a calm demeanor each time you have a discussion with your child and do not react with anger, shock, or surprise if your child reveals they already know some aspects of the topic.


If your child takes a sex ed course at school, try and figure out what is covered. You can look over the material your child brings home, but it might be better to speak to the teacher directly and ask him for a syllabus or lesson plan.Even young children have some understanding of sex and sexuality. Children pick up on things in television and other sources of media and talk amongst themselves. Older children might fill younger children in on certain topics, and a child might ask your for further information or verification about something they heard on the playground. Handle such lines of questions calmly.If your child claims they already know something you're trying to explain, remain calm. You want your child to leave the conversation feeling positive so he feels he can come back to you with questions. You do not want to react in a way that could provoke feelings of fear or shame in your child.

, While you should be prepared to answer questions about sex throughout your child's life, now and then you might need to have a sit down talk. This can be once your child reaches a certain age, before or after he begins sex ed at school, or at any point where changes have occurred that would result in him having a lot of questions about sex, sexuality, and reproduction.


Let your child know ahead of time you want to talk to them about sex and reproduction, but phrase it in a positive way. Say something like, ""As you're getting older, I feel like you're responsible enough to learn some things about the adult world you might be curious about.""It's best for your child to hear about sex from you for the first time, so aim to have the first sex talk young. As previously stated, you can use discretion in what topics you do and do not cover, but try to talk to your child about sex by the time he's 10., As girls can start menstruating as young as 10, you should make sure your daughter feels comfortable coming to you with any questions about periods.


Your child should know the basic physical properties that lead to menstruation. It is helpful to have a medical drawing of the female reproductive system on hand when having this discussion. As stated, if you do not feel comfortable in your own medical knowledge feel free to use outside sources while discussing the process.Your daughter should also know she can and should come to you the first time her period starts. You will be able to find her the proper sanitary napkins or tampons and help her through the emotional impact menstruation might have.Your daughter might already know what her period is, or at least know the word. You can start off by asking her, ""Do you know if any of the girls in your class have had their period yet?"" and see how she responds. Allow her to ask questions throughout the discussion., While a 10 year-old might not need to know about the logistics of safe sex, boys do start experiencing arousal and erections as young as age 9. Discuss these topics with your son early so he understands these things are a normal part of growing up.


Many boys have some idea of what erections are as they've noticed other boys experiencing them or heard crude ""boner"" jokes on the playground. Start by asking your child if he understands what an erection is and then fill him on the physical processes that drive arousal, erections, and ejaculation.Boys need to understand an erection is a hormonal response and a normal part of puberty and growing up. You should start this discussion sooner rather than later as boys may experience their first ejaculation during a wet dream and become confused and even scared about what is happening., Many parents feel controversial subjects are off the table when discussing sex and reproduction with their children. However, it's better your child learns about such topics from you than getting faulty information from an uninformed teenager.


Most of the more hot button topics about sexuality should be reserved for a later sex talk, when your child is starting high school. Around this time, many of his friends and classmates may begin experimenting with sex.The average age at which teenagers lose their virginity is 15, so make sure your teen feels he can talk to you about sex and sexuality. Subjects like safe sex, contraception, STDs, and oral sex should be things you talk to your child about when shortly after he begins high school.Make sure you talk about the emotional aspects of sex and sexuality as well. Your child should understand sex has an emotional impact, especially when he is young, and he should not make decisions about his body without making sure he's emotionally ready., Ongoing communication is important as it's impossible to fit all the basic questions into a few conversations. Make sure your child knows he's welcome to come to you with any questions that arise about sex, sexuality, and reproduction.


Staying calm during any sit down discussions can be helpful. Handling any questions in a calm, non-judgmental manner at the time makes your child more likely to feel comfortable if he has questions later on.
Make it clear that the sex talk is never a one time opportunity. Leave the conversation by saying, ""If you have any questions in the future, do not hesitate to ask.""
Give your child with some age-appropriate reading material. He can consult a booklet, pamphlet, or website if he's confused and come to you with other questions.

, Do not limit discussions of sex and reproduction to those moments when your child specifically asks or when you decide it's time to have a talk. Look for opportunities to teach your child about sex throughout your day-to-day life.


Highlight positive or negative examples of sex and relationships you see in movies or television shows or news stories. You can also learn about reproduction through nature documentaries.Things like marriage, divorce, pregnancy, and childbirth can trigger questions from a child. Always answer these questions honestly and frankly. Remind your child families come in a variety of forms and that this is a normal part of life.If you notice stains on sheets, possibly from wet dreams, masturbation, or periods, take this as an opportunity to discuss certain subjects with your child. Make sure you go into the conversation in non-judgmental way, however. You don't want your child to think he's being scolded., One of the best things you can do to make your child comfortable and informed about sex, sexuality, and reproduction is to model a healthy attitude for them.


If your'e co-parenting with a spouse or partner, make sure you and your significant other treat each other with respect, kindness, and affection in front of your children. Minimize fighting and, when it happens, try to let your children see how you make up. Make sure they understand small fights are a normal, healthy part of a romantic relationship.Some children's first introduction to sexuality is accidentally discovering a parent's pornography. While pornography can be a healthy aspect of a relationship for some couples, it is not appropriate for children. Try to keep adult material out a child's reach to avoid confusion.If you're a single parent, talk to your child about relationships and dating. Introduce them to partners only when you feel they are ready, and make sure your partner knows how to behave appropriately in a child's presence.

As it is only available via prescription, you should visit your gynecologist or fertility specialist to have a complete fertility workup. Infertility can result from numerous different causes. It is important to determine the cause of your infertility in order to ensure proper treatment.


Most likely, your doctor will recommend your partner have a fertility workup done as well.;
, If your doctor decides that your problem is anovulation and prescribes you Clomid, discuss the protocol she is using for your case. Your protocol may include different things such as a trigger medication for your ovulation. The protocol will also include the introduction of sperm, which can be through natural intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).IUI is when the doctor places the sperm into the uterus to help ensure that it is in the right place.The doctor will also schedule multiple appointments for blood work or ultrasounds to continue to check your health and the state of your reproductive organs.

, Before each of your treatments, you will need to check in with your doctor at the beginning of your period to ensure that you are still healthy. Usually, you can check in with your doctor via a phone consultation.


If you do not have a period of your own, your doctor may prescribe progesterone to induce it.
It is important to contact your doctor early because she may need a baseline ultrasound to check for cysts before starting your treatment cycle.
This process may continue throughout your treatment because cysts may have developed as a result of your last Clomid cycle., Once your doctor has checked to make sure everything is fine, she will start administering your treatments. You will generally be asked to take Clomid starting on day 3 to 5 of your cycle and continue to take it at the same time every day for 5 days.You will likely be started on a low dose of Clomid, such as 50 mg a day. This is to reduce the likelihood of developing cysts, side effects, and multiple pregnancies.


If you do not become pregnant, your doctor may increase the amount that you should take during the next cycle.Make sure you take your medication for the required 5 days without skipping a day. If you have a hard time remembering to take medications, leave yourself a note somewhere that you will see it or set a reminder in your phone to take it at the same time every day.
If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, call your doctor for directions. Do not take a double dose.

, There are a lot of actions that go into fertility treatments with Clomid. Since it can get overwhelming, you should make a schedule or calendar of the days you need to take your medication as well as all the different activities, tests, and cycles you need to keep up with. The doctor will give you all the information you need to put on your calendar. You should mark your cycle days, starting with day 1 as the first day of your period.


You should then add the days you will be taking Clomid, days you will have intercourse, day you need to take a trigger medication, any IUI date, and all dates you have blood work or ultrasounds scheduled., You will likely be closely monitored during your treatment cycle. Your doctor will check to make sure you are responding to Clomid appropriately. She will do this either by checking your estrogen levels or giving you an ultrasound to determine if you have egg growth.


Alternatively, your doctor may ask you to track your response to the medication by using home ovulation predictor kits. Keep your doctor informed of the results.

, After the first round of treatment, you may wonder what exactly the drug is doing for you. In response to hormonal changes brought on by Clomid, you should develop follicles in your ovaries that contain eggs. Typically, one of these follicles will become the dominant follicle and its egg will reach maturity, indicating it is ready to be released and you are ready for ovulation to occur.If you are not responding to the Clomid and your follicle is not developing properly, your treatment cycle may get cancelled. With your next cycle, your doctor may increase the dose of Clomid.

, Around 12 days into your cycle, you will need to start checking for ovulation, which is the time for you to get pregnant. Ovulation can occur at different times for each person, but most often it is on the 16th or 17th day of your cycle. To be more precise, however, your doctor will want to monitor your ovulation in a few different ways.


Your doctor may ask you to take your body temperature every morning at the same time. If your temperature rises about 0.5 degrees fahrenheit, it may indicate that your ovulation has occurred in the last 12 to 24 hours.
Your doctor may also recommend using an ovulation predictor. These are available over the counter in pharmacies. It looks similar to urine pregnancy test; however, it checks for a hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH). Your LH is highest about 24-48 hours before you ovulate and you are most fertile the day of your LH surge and the two days after.
Instead of an ovulation predictor, your doctor may use ultrasounds to check if your egg is mature or if you have ovulated.
Your doctor may also measure your progesterone levels about 14 to 18 days after starting Clomid. An increase in progesterone may indicate ovulation has occurred and indicate the viability of pregnancy., If you cannot get yourself to ovulate (or instead of waiting for ovulation to occur), the doctor may prescribe a trigger medication such as Ovidrel. This is a human chorionic gonadotropin that acts just like LH. This medication will cause your egg to release, which makes ovulation occur.


Once you take the injection, it is estimated that you will ovulate about 24-48 hours.
If your protocol includes IUI, it will generally be scheduled about 36 hours after taking your trigger shot., Once you start treatment with Clomid, you need to make sure you take advantage of as many opportunities to get pregnant as you can. This means you need to have intercourse whenever your doctor advises you to have it. These days will occur on certain days around your predicted ovulation day.


If your ovulation is triggered, your doctor will give you the days you need to have intercourse to give you the best chance at getting pregnant., Once you have completed a treatment of Clomid, you need to see if it worked. During ovulation when your egg is released, you hopefully were able to have it fertilized by the sperm. If this happened, the embryo will reach and implant into the uterus several days later.If you have not gotten your period about 15 days after your LH surge, your doctor will ask you to come in for a pregnancy test.
If you are pregnant, you will not need Clomid treatments anymore.

, If you were not successful the first month, don't lose hope. You can continue with Clomid the next month. If you do not get pregnant, you will usually start your period 14 to 17 days after ovulation.The first day you start will be day 1 of your next cycle and your doctor will proceed with the next treatment cycle.


She may increase your dose of Clomid or suggest another treatment altogether.
In general, it is not recommended that you take Clomid for more than 6 cycles.If you have still not become pregnant after 3 or 6 cycles, discuss further options with your physician.

, Clomid is classified as an ovulatory stimulant used by women with fertility problems. It works by binding to the estrogen receptors in your body, blocking them from producing, and causing your body to think you have low estrogen. This in turn causes your body to release the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This reproductive hormone causes the your body to produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which helps encourage egg production in the body.


FSH stimulates the development of the follicles, which are the elements that contain the eggs in your ovaries., A doctor may prescribe you Clomid for a few different reasons. Clomid is used when you have an infertility condition in which you cannot ovulate, which means you cannot produce or release a mature egg. Indications that you may have issues with ovulation include absence of your period or having irregular periods.


One common condition Clomid is used for is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS symptoms include irregular periods, excess facial and body hair, acne, and male pattern baldness. This condition can also cause cysts on your ovaries. There are different medications used to treat the symptoms of PCOS, but Clomid is used as first line treatment for infertility resulting from PCOS.Do not use if you are pregnant. Generally, your doctor will do a pregnancy test before prescribing Clomid.

, Your doctor should advise you about which concentrations of Clomid to use. However, in most cases, the starting dose is 50 mg by mouth daily for 5 days, starting on the 5th day of your cycle. If that does not induce ovulation, the dose may be increased to 100 mg by mouth daily for 5 days on the next cycle.


The treatment can change from one cycle to the next, especially if there is no increase in ovulation.
Do not increase or decrease dosage on your own. Make sure you always follow your doctor's instructions about dosage., There are a few common side effects of Clomid. It may cause some common mild side effects such as flushing or an overall feeling of warmth, upset stomach including nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, headache, dizziness, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and blurry vision.


This medication may cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can occur during or after treatment. OHSS, while serious, is rare. OHSS may cause serious and dangerous issues such as fluid build up in the abdomen and chest. Get medical help right away if you develop severe pain or swelling, rapid weight gain, nausea, or vomiting.If you have severe vision issues, swelling of your abdomen or shortness of breath contact your doctor right away., Although Clomid can help with ovulation, you have to be careful with the medication. Clomid should not be used for more than six cycles. If you have used Clomid for 6 cycles and have not become pregnant, your doctor may recommend other options such as hormone injections or in vitro fertilization (IVF).


Ovarian cysts may form from ovarian overstimulation. An ultrasound may be performed to look for ovarian cysts before beginning another Clomid treatment cycle.
Long-term use of clomiphene, the medicine in Clomid, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but there are some recent studies that do not support this."

Eat smaller meals more frequently during menopause.,
Get regular physical exercise to maintain optimal physical and emotional health during menopause.,
Practice stress management techniques.,
Practice good sleeping habits.",How to Take Care of Yourself During Menopause," Instead of three square meals a day, eat three small meals and three healthy snacks. Choose:


Lean chicken and turkey.
Fish that contain omega-3 fatty acids, including mackerel, tuna, sardines, salmon and shellfish.
Soy protein found in soy nuts, soy milk and tofu.
Low-fat yogurt, milk and cheese.
Whole-grain breads, pastas and cereals.
Fresh fruits and vegetables.;
, Although 30 minutes at least three times a week is best, even 10 minutes a day can improve a lot of menopause symptoms.

, Menopause often occurs during life's transition periods, as children leave the home or you take over the care of elderly parents. Hormonal changes make it even more difficult to deal with life's stress. Try:


Yoga, relaxation or meditation techniques.
Pursue a hobby or other activity you enjoy.
Spend time with friends, family or those people in your life who help you to feel good about yourself.
Allow yourself time to rest and relax without feeling guilty about taking a break.
Set realistic expectations and goals for yourself and accept the fact that you have limitations and can not do it all.

, Getting enough good, quality sleep is important for good health in all stages of life. Studies indicate that more than half of all women in menopause do not get enough sleep because of problems with hot flashes, depression, anxiety and insomnia.


Stick to your normal sleep schedule during menopause or establish one if you haven't already. Going to bed and getting up at the same time every day is the best way to get good healthy sleep. Do not stay up late and sleep in on the weekends, which can throw your schedule off.
Take a hot bath before going to bed. Soaking in a bath before going to bed is beneficial for several reasons. The hot bath relaxes your body and helps your mind to unwind before going to bed. After getting out of the hot water, your body temperature drops, which is helpful if you suffer from hot flashes and night sweats.
Keep your bedroom cooler than the rest of the house or lower the temperature in the room before going to bed. Not only do lower room temperatures make hot flashes more bearable, but they also signal to your body that it's time to sleep.
Buy t-shirts and gym shorts or pants made from a material designed to wick moisture away from your body, such as CoolMax . Wear them as pajamas to help keep you dry during night sweats.
Have sex before bed if the urge hits. Having an orgasm is one of the best ways to induce sleep.

Ask your doctor about Chinese medicine.,
Work with a physical therapist.,
Consider acupuncture.",How to Shrink Fibroids Naturally1," Doctors used to take a proactive approach to treating fibroids with unnecessary, invasive procedures. Now, however, most doctors advise ""watchful waiting"" when small fibroids don't cause significant problems such as abnormal bleeding, infertility, or painful periods. Over time, many fibroids start shrinking on their own.Fibroids tend to form at reproductive age, grow larger with pregnancy, and shrink after menopause. Waiting several years is often preferable to taking drugs which have bad side effects or having a surgical procedure done.
Most fibroids almost never become cancerous, so it's fine to leave them in the body as long as they aren't causing other issues. Even if you have a fibroid in your abdominal area that you can actually feel when you press it - or even see when you look closely - you might not want to have it removed unless it's absolutely necessary.
If you want to try the watch and wait method, see a doctor first and make sure that what you have is definitely fibroids. Other types of growths need immediate medical intervention.;
, In clinical trials, green tea extract (epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG) reduced the severity of fibroid symptoms. Women who took green tea extract experienced fewer severe symptoms, and fibroid size shrank by an average of 32.6%.It is important to note that these studies were quite small and there are no randomized trials studying the efficacy of the treatment.
Women who took green tea extract for fibroids did not experience any severe side effects. However, if you are sensitive to caffeine, monitor your green tea consumption. Green tea contains caffeine which can cause irritability, nervousness, and nausea.Studies have shown that green tea reduces the growth of fibroids in rats. Green tea may prevent the growth of new fibroids, although the research is still inconclusive., A few studies have suggested that Chinese herbal medicine may shrink fibroids and relieve fibroid symptoms. Because some herbs may interact with medication or other medical conditions, consult your doctor before taking any herbal remedies.Beware that Chinese medicinal approaches are not subjected to the randomized controlled trials that FDA-approved medications go through. There may also be inconsistency with dosing, which can alter efficacy and risks significantly.
One study found that the herbal remedy Kuei-chih-fu-ling-wan reduced fibroid size in about 60% of the study participants.Several clinical trials have shown that Tripterygium wilfordii extract, or léi gōng téng 雷公藤,can shrink fibroids as well as or better than the drug mifepristone.Guizhi Fuling formula 桂枝茯苓丸 (Ramulus Cinnamomi, Poria, Semen Persicae, Radix Paeoniae Rubra or Radix Paeoniae Alba, and Cortex Moutan) and mifepristone together are also effective at reducing fibroid size.Guizhi Fulin and mifepristone together are more effective than either separately., One study found that physical therapy may be effective at shrinking fibroids and relieving fibroid symptoms for some women. Speak with your physician to determine whether physical therapy may work for you.Be aware that physical therapy may address the pain or symptoms but not the underlying problem of the fibroids themselves.

, One study suggests that acupuncture may be effective in improving fibroid symptoms for some women. Because acupuncture usually has few side effects, it may be worth considering if you find other treatments have not worked.Make sure you work with a licensed acupuncturist. Ask your physician for a referral. Keep your primary doctor informed of any complementary treatments you’re using.

Check your medication.",How to Say No to Sex," Many people feel nervous or awkward telling someone they're not ready for sex or don't want to have sex at a certain moment. It might be helpful to practice saying ""No"" in front of a mirror or alone in your room. Try to sound confident in your decision and practice saying, ""No, I don't want to have sex right now"" or ""No, I'm not ready for sex yet."", If you have a longterm partner, sometimes it can be nice to let them know ahead of time that you're not in the mood for sex. If you're not feeling well or simply not in the mood, try to make that clear before you two are alone together.


If you're out on a date or spending a night in together, let your partner know if you're not in the mood. If things feel romantic and fun, your partner might think you're in the mood for sex when you're really not.Sometimes people feel rejected or hurt if sexual advances are turned down. Letting your partner know ahead of time you're not in the mood can save their feelings later. You won't have to turn down unwanted advances., Sometimes, you may not be in the mood at any given moment but this does not mean sex is off the table all day. Try asking your partner to see how you're feeling later. For example, say something like ""I'm feeling a little exhausted and want to relax for a minute, but see how I'm feeling after dinner."" If you're busy, tired, or stressed it's hard to predict when you will and won't be in the mood. Allow your partner the opportunity to try again later can on., You don't owe someone an explanation for not wanting to have sex. However, if you're in a relationship with someone it can be healthy to explain to them why you're not in the mood. This can help your partner better understand you and your sexual desires.


Sometimes, reasons are simple. You can say something like, ""As much as I love you and love having sex with you, I've had a really stressful day at work and I'm feeling kind of bad about myself. I'd rather we just do something low pressure like watch a movie and maybe try again tomorrow.""If there is a more difficult reason you don't want to have sex, this is even more important to discuss. Are you upset with your partner? Are you not feeling sexual due to negative feelings about your own body and looks? If there's a deeper issue at play, schedule a time to talk things over with your partner. Remember to remain calm and phrase things in a fair, non-judgmental manner., Sometimes people feel obligated to have sex, especially if they've already been engaging in activities that would typically lead to sex. Understand no one is entitled to your body and that making out or otherwise fooling around does mean you owe someone sex. Do not listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. If you feel things are headed towards sex, taper off physical content and then gently pull away. If your partner pushes you for more, calmly explain you do not wish to have sex now.

, It can help to understand your reasons for not wanting to have sex. The better you understand yourself and your desires, the better you can express yourself to others.


Some people practice abstinence. This means refraining from sexual activity altogether, either until marriage or for a set period of time. If you're practicing abstinence, consider your reasons for doing so. What are the benefits of abstaining from sex? Why is this important to you? Occasionally reviewing the reasons you became abstinent to begin with can help you feel more confident in your decision.Some people simply like to wait a bit to have sex. While the sex on the third date rule is common in pop culture, this might not be a sentiment you share. Maybe you like to get to know someone emotionally before engaging in sex. Maybe you simply aren't comfortable with intimacy early on. Explore your reasons for wanting to put off sex until later in the relationship. This can help you feel more secure explaining your motivations to others.There are obviously many reasons, based on your own personal history and comfort zone, that you might not want to have sex. Whatever your reason, it's valid. There is no reason to have sex if you do not want to.

, Some people identify as asexual. Asexual is a sexual orientation, similar to being straight or gay.


Asexual people are simply uninterested in sex. Sexual activity is not pleasurable to people who are asexual. Asexual people may crave romantic love, but usually have a very low or completely absent sex drive.If you think you might be asexual, you can learn more about asexuality online. LGTB websites, like GLAAD's website, have sections discussing asexuality. Asexuality.org is a website dedicating to exploring and explaining asexuality., Occasionally, people dislike engaging in sex because it does not feel good for them. If you're inexperienced, you may simply not know what does and does not work for you. Exploring your own sexuality can help.


Masturbation can help you get more comfortable with your body. You can masturbate with just your hands or use tools like dildos. See what does and does not feel good. This can help you understand how you like to be touched and what might work for you with a partner.
Many people explore their sexuality through watching pornography or reading erotica. This can help you get a sense of what tuns you on. You can find porn and erotica online and can also purchase them from sex shops and even some bookstores.
Join a club. If you're a college student, there are many sex positive and sex friendly clubs on campus. There, you can discuss sex, your body, sexuality, and more. Through talking and learning with others, you may figure out more about your own sexual desires.

, If sex is not as enjoyable for you as you want, try experimenting with your partner. Try different positions, different types of foreplay, role playing, and more. Many couples find watching porn together increases sexual desire and gives them ideas for new things to try in bed. Talk to your partner about wanting to experiment a little in the bedroom.

, If you find yourself frequently not in the mood, many medications can effect sex drive. Read the side effects of any prescription or over-the-counter meds you're on. If low sex drive is a side effect, talk to your doctor about finding an alternative medication or lowering the dosage.

Look into medications.,
Ask about contraceptives to reduce bleeding.,
Look into MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS).,
Ask your doctor about minimally-invasive procedures.,
Find out if surgery is the best option.",How to Shrink Fibroids Naturally2," Most medications for treating fibroids are designed to change your hormone levels. They work by affecting the hormones that cause fibroids to grow, helping the growths to shrink over time.


Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) agonists are the most commonly prescribed drugs for shrinking fibroids. The drug puts the body into a temporary post-menopausal state, blocking the production of estrogen. It has many short and long-term side effects.Letrozole is a medication that decreases estrogen levels. In one study, letrozole reduced fibroids by 46%.Other medications may be available.

, Hormonal contraceptives may reduce your menstrual bleeding, though they may not change the size of your fibroids. The more common contraceptives used to alleviate excessive bleeding are oral contraceptives or a progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD)., This is a non-invasive procedure that doesn't require an incision. Sound waves are used to locate, heat and destroy the fibroids while you are inside an MRI scanner.This approach is fairly new and may not be widely available. There is not much data on long term effectiveness because it is a new approach.
Because MRI focused ultrasound and selective embolization are newer methods, there are no longterm studies on the safety of these procedures for women who later become pregnant. Some case reports suggest that if pregnancy occurs after these treatments, complication rates are increased. For those women with symptomatic fibroids who wish to conceive in the future, surgery to remove the fibroids and spare the uterus (myomectomy) remains the ""gold standard.""

, These are outpatient procedures that may involve some type of bodily intervention, but they destroy the fibroids without needing to surgically remove them. These methods often work quite well and make major surgery unnecessary.


Fibroids can be treated or destroyed by uterine artery embolization (which injects small particles that cut off blood flow to the fibroids) or myolysis, which uses an electric current or laser to attack the fibroids.A laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy is a procedure in which fibroids are removed while the uterus is left intact.Uterine embolization uses substances injected into the uterine arteries to cut off the blood supply to the fibroids.

, In extreme cases, major surgery may be the best way to remove fibroids to improve the health of the body. Either an abdominal myomectomy or a hysterectomy can be performed to make sure the fibroids are permanently removed."

Understand what fibroids are.,
Recognize the symptoms of fibroids.,
Learn what causes fibroids.,
Understand the limitations of current research.",How to Shrink Fibroids Naturally3," Fibroids are rubbery growths that form on the walls of the uterus. They occur most frequently in women of reproductive age, especially after age 35. In most cases these benign growths remain small, and they almost never lead to cancer. However, for some women, fibroids can significantly affect their quality of life.Fibroids are usually categorized into three groups. Submucosal fibroids grow in the uterine cavity. Intramural fibroids grow in the wall of the uterus. Subserosal fibroids grow on the outside of the uterus., Many women may have fibroids and not even be aware of their condition. For many women, fibroids do not cause any symptoms, discomfort, or health issues. However, fibroids can cause some painful or even debilitating symptoms in some women. If you experience any of the following symptoms, see your doctor:Heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding. Fibroids cause the uterine wall to become thicker than normal during the menstruation cycle, causing much heavier bleeding than usual. In some cases, bleeding is severe enough to cause anemia.Significant change in menstruation patterns (e.g., sharply increased pain, much heavier bleeding).

Pelvic pain, or feelings of “heaviness” or “fullness” in the pelvic area. Fibroids can range in size from very small (smaller than a seed) to very large (grapefruit-sized). Large fibroids may even cause your abdomen to look distended as with pregnancy.
Pain during sexual intercourse.
Frequent and/or difficult urination.

Constipation. Fibroids may expand and cause the uterus to press against your bladder or bowels, causing constipation.
Backache

Infertility. This is very rare, but in some cases fibroids can reduce implantation rates, leading to infertility., While scientists are not definitely sure what causes fibroids, a few factors seem to be at play. Knowing more about these may help you determine what course of treatment is right for you.It is possible that abnormalities in a woman's uterine blood vessels may cause fibroids to occur.
Genes that cause uterine muscle cells to grow at an accelerated rate may be a cause.
Fibroids seem to be related to a woman's reproductive cycle, rarely occurring before the first menstrual period and often accelerating during pregnancy. Some scientists suggest that the hormones estrogen and progesterone may be involved.

, Unfortunately, there is very little scientific evidence to support natural treatment methods for fibroids.Even in cases where research seems promising, studies are often limited or at risk of clinical error. Not enough research has been conducted on any one method, whether it be dietary recommendations, homeopathic treatments, exercise, and so on.


This means that if you're in a situation in which living with fibroids has become uncomfortable or detrimental to your health, you should discuss standard treatment options with your doctor. However, if your fibroids are not causing you pain or interfering with your life in any major way, there's no harm in trying a few natural methods that are said by many to make a difference.
To be on the safe side, talk to your doctor about treatment methods you want to try to make sure they won't have any sort of adverse effects.

They may even happen when no stimulation to the genitals occurs. Your body produces semen and seminal fluid whether you like it or not, whether you're sexually active or not, whether you masturbate regularly or not. Your body does this regardless of religious or cultural considerations.


If you're not orgasming regularly, but still are becoming aroused, excess seminal fluid from the prostate can make your genitals sensitive and tender, which may make wet dreams more likely.;
, During puberty, hormones ramp up the production of sperm in the body, making wet dreams more likely during the early teenage years. Typically, a wet dream happens while you're asleep, but ejaculation sometimes may occur at other times you experience involuntary sexual stimulation. You might sleep through a wet dream, or you might wake up instantly. You may have an erection when you experience a wet dream, or you may not.


More than 80% of men experience at least one wet dream in their lifetime. Some men experience involuntary ejaculations in adolescence and then report that these wet dreams taper off into adulthood. Some men experience wet dreams regularly throughout their lives, regardless of frequent or infrequent sexual activity, while some men never experience them at all.

, Wet dreams are not a sign of any physiological or psychological abnormality or condition, and in fact is a perfectly natural sign that your reproductive system is functioning properly. In other words, wet dreams are not ""a problem,"" outside of the embarrassment and the mess.


200-300 years ago, it was common to diagnose men who experienced wet dreams with ""spermatorrhea"" or ""seminal weakness,"" with some cultures going so far as to ""treat"" these men with castration. This is something that has absolutely no grounding in empirical science and is now classified as an ""imaginary disease.""There is no such thing as seminal weakness.
It is also a myth, however, that males ""must ejaculate"" regularly to get rid of built-up sperm. It's true that ""unused"" semen is absorbed back into the body, and that you don't ""need"" to ejaculate regularly to live a healthy and fulfilling life. This doesn't mean that wet dreams won't be more likely if you're not regularly orgasming, as there has been no scientific study that's proven a correlation between sexual activity and wet dreams., Your body is doing what it was made to do. Wet dreams are nothing to feel guilty about, so don't beat yourself up over something that's a perfectly normal function of your body.


If you have a wet dream, don't panic or feel embarrassed. When you wake up, clean yourself up by washing your genitals with soap and water and change your sheets.
If you're struggling to control your sexual urges and thoughts, or practice a religion that forbids masturbation, you still don't need to feel guilty about the occasional wet dream. It's not a sign of impurity or some failure on your part. You were asleep, after all! Talk to a trusted friend or religious advisor about the issue and seek guidance.

, In some cases, big changes or stressful periods reportedly produce more wet dreams than at other more relaxed periods of leisure. Make sure you get enough sleep and exercise, take time off from your busy schedule to relax and do things that you enjoy. Pick up new hobbies to fill your free time with fun activities and relax when you get the chance to relax.

, Wearing loose fitting clothes or sleeping naked may reduce the risk of accidental stimulation while you're asleep.


Some monastics who abstain from sexual behavior change their sleep patterns by sleeping only a few hours at a time and waking up frequently throughout the night to meditate or pray briefly before returning to sleep, reducing the risk of involuntary ejaculation.

, Eating ""heating"" foods like green chiles and eggplant is considered a risky behavior in some cultures, as well as coffee and other substances that contain caffeine, especially late at night.


If you're struggling with wet dreams, try to eat smaller meals throughout the day, staying hydrated to keep your digestion functioning properly. Go to the bathroom frequently and get plenty of exercise to relieve tension.

, As much as possible, avoid situations that produce a sexual response in you. It'll be much easier to control your sexual urges if you avoid pornography, sexual programming on television, and other media. Fill your time with enriching, fulfilling activities and avoid dwelling on thoughts of sex.

, Becoming more familiar with your body's relationship to itself and it's functions will help you control your orgasms both as part of your sexual relationships and in unconscious situations, like when you're asleep. Doing yoga will help you learn about your body and be more conscious of its responses.


If you're sexually active, tantra or karezza are semi-spiritual yoga practices that involve semi-frequent sexual activity that does not involve orgasm, recasting sex as an intimacy-building exercise between two people, not a ""reproduction activity."" Dissociating sexual contact from orgasm might help control wet dreams., If you're sexually active, communicate with your partner to maintain a healthy and open sexual relationship that keeps you both fulfilled, and talk to them about your wet dreams if you feel comfortable.


If you're not sexually active (and even if you are) develop a healthy relationship with masturbation. If it helps keep your sexual thoughts and urges in check, it might be right for you.

, As part of an Ayurvedic diet, sometimes sage tea is used as a night-time drink that aids sleep and relaxation, often used among monastics and other lay persons to avoid sexual thoughts and wet dreams.

, Mixing some fenugreek powder--a common ingredient in Indian and other mid-Eastern cooking--with an equal amount of honey to mask the bitterness, is often used as a sleep aid and remedy for sexual afflictions like wet dreams.

, Aside from aiding your breathing and throat health, licorice root is commonly used in Eastern medicine for all sorts of ""root chakra"" cases. It tastes good and promotes general wellness and respiratory health.

, It's a common misconception that ""cold showers"" decrease sex drive. Contrarily, cold temperatures may actually increase sperm production in the testicles. Practicing aroma therapy by taking relaxing warm baths with a few drops of peppermint, lavender, sandalwood, or rose oil is thought to reduce the possibility of wet dreams., One common home remedy, but one without any basis in science, involves mixing equal parts of gourd extract and sesame oil and rubbing it into your scalp before bed to eliminate sexual desires. It can't hurt to try.

Take some time to examine your reasoning. Don't be a virgin because of your parent(s), your religious leaders, your partner, or a wikiHow article--be a virgin if it feels like what is best for you.Try listing your thoughts in a journal, so you can look at them whenever you feel like it. Potential reasons for abstaining include...Your religious, spiritual, or personal beliefs include waiting or abstinence.
You don't feel ready or interested.You're asexual (i.e., you don't feel sexual attraction, and are disinterested in or disgusted by sex).You want your first time to be with someone special.
You lack access to contraception, barriers, or sexual healthcare.
You are underage, or feel that you are too young.
You have fears about your safety: either you are scared of pregnancy, STIs, etc. or your family is strict and your emotional health or safety would be compromised if they caught you.;
, For how long do you want to be celibate? Most people do not live their entire lives as virgins, and it's good to set clear and reasonable goals for yourself. Think about how long you want to stay a virgin, and know that you can always modify the decision if it no longer works for you.Deciding to be celibate for years is too much pressure for some people. Try making a time-limited contract with yourself (e.g. ""I will be celibate this month""), and then reviewing and possibly renewing it at the end of each month.

, Sex is not evil, and abstinence will not make you ""pure"" or morally superior. Sex can be beautiful between consenting, emotionally prepared adults. It doesn't physically change your body,or change the fact that you're a good person.Don't let your celibacy be driven by fear, but instead by a healthy and informed choice to avoid sex.


Most people end up having sex at some point in their lives. If at some point you decide that you're ready, you shouldn't have to feel guilty about it.

, “Virginity” and “sex” are terms that various people define differently.Before you can assert your boundaries, you need to know how you define these terms for yourself.How do you define “sex”? What kind of intimate contact are you okay with, and what is too far for you? How do you define “virginity”? Is it a spiritual, mental, or physical state or some combination thereof?
You’ll need to have these parameters in place for yourself so you’ll know what’s okay for you and be able to communicate it clearly to others.
If you know your own boundaries, are confident in expressing them, and expect them to be respected, you’ll be more empowered to stand up for yourself and do what you feel is right., Instead of focusing on the drawbacks of sex, think about the good things you're going to do.If you aren't going to have a sexual partner now, what else could you spend your time on?
If you wanted to be a virgin until a certain period, work on that goal. For example, if you wanted to wait until you felt more confident and assertive, then try assertiveness training and build your confidence.

, You get to determine the terms of your own physical, emotional, and mental boundaries. No one else has a right to impinge on or disrespect your boundaries.Determine your emotional boundaries. What kind of emotional involvement are you comfortable and uncomfortable with? What kinds of behaviors make you emotionally uncomfortable? Be clear with yourself that other people’s feelings are not more important than your own.Consider your mental boundaries. How much are you comfortable letting others’ ideas and opinions influence your own? At what point do you feel someone isn’t respecting your thoughts or ideas? To what extent do you feel comfortable explaining or defending your personal beliefs to another person?Think about your physical boundaries. How and where and when are you comfortable being touched? What kind of physical contact crosses your personal boundaries? Clearly establish the terms of your boundaries, both for yourself and for others.
There are checklists online to help you figure out what you are and are not comfortable with., We’re often surrounded by insistent messages about how we should or shouldn’t look, feel, and act. And those messages can make difficult for us to feel justified and empowered in our own decisions. But if you’re confident in yourself and your decisions, you’ll be empowered to expect others to respect you and your choices on your own terms.Don’t sacrifice yourself or your body because of pressure from someone else. If someone doesn’t recognize the beauty and integrity of you or your body, decide to get them out of your life. Remember that your parents are likely to be a great support to you in your decision - they'll be very proud of you. Clearly draw the line between what’s acceptable and what isn’t and ask them to respect that., Unless you are asexual, you may feel instances of sexual desire. Take care of your needs and release your energy in ways that you feel comfortable with.


Exercise: take a walk, play sports, or run around with some family members.
Some virgins feel comfortable with masturbating.
Take a shower, or use a hot or cold compress, for vasocongestion.Find things to focus on beyond sex,whether it's art, writing, friends, family, volunteering, or schoolwork.

, For some, a sexless relationship is a deal breaker, and it isn’t fair to either of you to put off telling them your stance on sex.Let them know before things get too serious, so that no one's heart gets broken if you break up.


Though it may be tempting to put off telling a person you like that you plan to maintain your virginity, don’t. They’ll find out sooner or later, and if they find out later, the two of you are only going to experience pain and turmoil that could have been avoided.
If the person isn’t on the same page and can’t be in a relationship without sex, that’s okay—that’s their choice to make. But don’t feel pressured by their decisions; mutually respect one another’s decisions. If you aren’t on the same page, it’s okay to go your separate ways with no hard feelings., Tell them what you are and aren't comfortable with, and let them tell you what their boundaries are. If you want, you may take this time to explain to them why keeping your virginity (for now or forever) is important to you. They may be confused and have questions for you; you can take time to explain if you feel comfortable doing so.


If your partner tries to negotiate your boundaries with you, make it clear that these are serious boundaries. Your partner needs to respect them.
If you don't feel comfortable discussing why you want to stay a virgin, just say so. A phrase like ""I'm not comfortable talking about that"" works.

, Consent is important, and you need to know how to give it, withdraw it, and evaluate whether you have it.It's important to be honest about what you like and don't like. In a functional relationship, you and your partner must communicate clearly and listen to what the other person says.Say ""no"" or say you want to slow down as soon as you start feeling uncomfortable. A simple phrase like ""I don't like that,"" ""I don't feel ready for that,"" or ""Not now"" makes it clear to your partner.
Be clear about saying ""yes."" Your partner should always know what page you're on when you're doing things together. Verbally say yes, smile, make eye contact, and take an active role.
If you're uncertain, just say so. A basic ""I'm not sure"" works, or you can be flirty and say ""I don't know. Can you convince me?""
Ask questions to your partner: ""Do you like this?"" ""What if I...?"" ""Want to make out?""

, If at any point you feel uncomfortable or uncertain, say you want to stop or slow down. A good partner takes a ""no"" seriously and will immediately respect your feelings.


You are allowed to say no at any time: including when you said yes five minutes ago, when you were okay with doing something last week, or when everyone else is okay with doing it. You can say no at any time and any place.Use the broken record technique to combat pressure: keep saying something like ""No"" or ""I don't want to.""
If you are shy, then practice saying no. Try writing down the phrases in this article and practice saying them. Saying no is an important life skill.

, A respectful partner won't try to change your boundaries, but not all people are respectful. You have the right to set the terms for your own body; if the other person doesn’t respect those terms, they don’t respect you.A simple “no” should be enough. But if it isn’t, be prepared for some of the pushback you may receive.Some people are not mature enough to hear things they don't like.


Keep your response brief, honest and respectful (initially), and be prepared to repeat it if necessary.You can use the broken record technique, which means repeating the same thing in the face of pressure (e.g. ""No"" or ""I don't want to"").
For example, if someone says, “If you don’t let me do this, it means you don’t love me.” Respond by saying, “I love you and I don’t want you to touch me right now/in that way.”
If someone says, “But you let me do this before.” Respond with “I have the right to change my mind.”If someone says, “You’re just a prude (or frigid or repressed or whatever),” respond with “I’m comfortable with myself and my body and I’m asking you to respect that.”If someone doesn't respect your boundaries or makes you feel uneasy, this is a problem. It may be time to question whether you want to be in a relationship like that.

, If someone refuses to respect your boundaries, either emotional, mental, or physical, walk away. Learn to walk away calmly and confidently. The most important thing is that you get away from that person, but, if you can, try to leave the situation with calm and confidence to convey the message that they can’t manipulate you.


If you’re at a party or other social gathering, walk away from them and find a friend to talk to instead. If you’re alone or nearly alone with the person, walk away and go somewhere where other people are around or where you can get help if you need it (walk towards an emergency call box, towards a cab, etc.).
As you walk away, imagine crumpling up their words and throwing them away.
After discarding their words, say and embrace something positive about yourself., If you’re in a situation where someone won’t take the hint and drop the subject, there are a few responses you use to strongly encourage them to get lost.


If you’re at a party, a bar, or another situation where someone isn’t accepting that no, you’re not interested, you have every right to look them dead in the eye and say, “I said no. Please leave.”
If you want to get some amusement out of the situation and you don’t think this person is truly a threat (if you do feel threatened, get away from them and find help immediately), you can say something like, “I get really, really, really, really attached to someone if I have sex with them,” or “I’m not ready to tell you about my herpes status.”, It’s likely no surprise to you that teens face peer pressure, including pressure to have sex. In order to better resist peer pressure, it helps to be able to recognize it or what it is. When you recognize that someone’s using one of these tactics, you can better prepare yourself to resist. The major types of peer pressure are:Obvious peer pressure: This is the most overt form of pressure and it usually involves direct, unsubtle statements from others like, “I can’t believe you aren’t having sex. Everyone else is!”

Underhanded peer pressure: This is the kind of pressure that’s a bit more subtle and is usually used to make you feel like there’s something weird or wrong with you for not conforming. It might sound something like, “Never mind, you’re a virgin, so you don’t understand” or referring to you as “the virgin” or “the prude,” etc.

Controlling peer pressure: This kind of pressure is an overt attempt to coerce you to do something by threatening to exclude you or end the friendship if you don’t do what the other person wants. It might sound something like, “We can’t be friends if you’re a virgin” or “I don’t hang out with virgins.”

, The people around you may talk a big game, but it’s likely they’re exaggerating if not downright lying about what they get up to.Though they may seem convincing, train yourself to be skeptical of what other people claim they’ve done. You don’t have to call them on it necessarily, but you should file what they say under “probably not true.”

,


If someone tries to test your boundaries with negative comments or statements that you know aren’t true, stand your ground. Repeat the phrase “That’s not true!” either to yourself or to the other person until the message sinks in., Often a large part of peer pressure has to do with making it seem as though having sex means specific things, like if you have sex you become an adult or are somehow more independent of your parents.Don’t accept other people’s assessment of what your sexual status means about you. This may be particularly important if you’re in high school, where peer pressure about sex can be hard to shrug off. Don’t let people try to tell you things like, “if you haven’t had sex it’s because you’re not attractive” or “because you’re too scared,” etc. Choosing not to have sex means none of those things. It means you’re actively making your own choices about your beliefs and not allowing others to take that right away from you.

, A great way to lessen negative peer pressure is to stay away from the people who cause it.If you have friends who nag, make fun of you, or otherwise pressure you about sex, ask them calmly and confidently to stop. If they don’t, stop hanging out with them as much.
Find and hang out with friends who are accepting of your choice and respect your right to decide for yourself.

, As with dealing with a partner who isn’t respecting your boundaries, you can and should also walk away from a peer who isn’t respecting those boundaries.


Walk away calmly and confidently. The most important thing is that you get away from that person, but, if you can, try to leave the situation with calm and confidence. That way you’re communicating to them that they can’t manipulate you.
As you walk away, imagine crumpling up their words and throwing them away.
After discarding their words, say and embrace something positive about yourself., Don't sex shame or pressure people to be like you. Sexual activity is an intensely personal choice, and just as you respect others who enjoy an active sex life, they should respect you for abstaining from sex.

Don't wait too long.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Get a thorough gynecological exam.,
Consider alternatives to tubal ligation reversal.,
Get a referral to a reputable surgeon.,
Understand the cost.,
Book your procedure in the hospital or outpatient clinic.,
Understand the procedure.,
Prepare to recover after the surgery.,
Look out for an allergic reaction to anesthesia.,
Watch out for infection.,
Be alert to an ectopic pregnancy.",How to Reverse a Tubal Ligation," When life circumstances change and you're convinced you want to reverse a tubal ligation, then time is of the essence. In general, the less amount of time that's passed since your ""tubes were tied,"" the more likely the reversal surgery will be successful.Furthermore, the older you are, the less likely the reversal surgery will be successful.


Call your doctor and get the ball rolling on a reverse tubal ligation as soon as you and your partner decide that it's the right decision.
Women who get tubal ligations in their 20s are much more likely to regret it later in their lives and want reversal surgeries.
Women who get divorces and quickly remarry are more likely to want to reverse their tubal ligations.;
, Once you've made the decision for the reversal, consult your doctor on the pros and cons, and whether your particular situation is appropriate for such surgery. A tubal ligation reversal isn't appropriate for everyone, so your doctor will want to know your age, body mass index (BMI), overall health and your type of tubal ligation.If your doctor thinks your age and health is not only appropriate for having a reversal surgery, but also for getting pregnant, then they will likely refer you to your gynecologist for a more detailed examination.
The best candidates for tubal reversal surgery tend to be women who are younger than 40 years old and had a tubal ligation procedure immediately after childbirth — known as a postpartum tubal ligation.

, If your health and age are appropriate, your gynecologist will want to confirm the type of tubal ligation procedure you had, examine the extent of damage to your Fallopian tubes and check the remaining tubal length.And if you're keen on getting pregnant quickly, the doctor may also check other fertility factors, such as your egg quality.


There are many types of tubal ligation procedures, but methods that use clips and rings (Hulka clip, Filshie clip, Falope rings) are most successfully reversed.Conversely, electrocautery (burning methods) are least likely to be reversed.
Women who have only small sections of their Fallopian tubes removed are better candidates for successful reversal surgery — the more tube remaining the better.
Previous gynecological surgeries for endometriosis, fibroids or pelvic inflammatory disease can cause scar tissue and reduce the success rate of tubal reversal procedures.

, If your age, physical health and/or condition of your Fallopian tubes isn't ideal for a reverse tubal ligation procedure, then you should consider some alternatives, such as IVF, if you still want to get pregnant. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the combining of an egg from your ovary and sperm from your partner in a laboratory dish and then implantation into your uterus.Pregnancy via IVF doesn't require tubal ligation reversal or even healthy Fallopian tubes — just healthy eggs and uterus.
IVF tends to cost more than tubal ligation reversal surgery, usually between $12,000 – $17,000 USD.Adoption and having a surrogate carry your baby are other alternatives to having a child if your Fallopian tubes can't be restored to normal function.

, Your gynecologist may be the best person to operate on you if they're qualified, but you may have to (or want to) look for someone else. Research surgeons online who perform tubal reversal procedures and/or get a referral from your family doctor or gynecologist. Search for a surgeon's ratings, recommendations and legal history on state medical board websites. Get the surgeon's credentials and ask what kind of reversal procedures they specialize in.


You'll need anesthesia for the procedure, so ask who the anesthesiologist might be and the credentials of other staff members.
Surgeons often refuse to operate if they think there is little chance of a successful reversal — about 50% of women who request reversal surgeries are turned down., Make sure you clearly understand the cost. Reversal surgeries can cost more than $10,000 USD and most insurance policies and government programs (Medicaid or military coverage) don't pay for them, nor will they reimburse you.Realize that the total cost includes separate fees for the surgeon, the anesthesiologist and the hospital/private clinic. Everyone bills separately which sometimes makes getting the final cost very difficult.


Try asking for a discount if you are experiencing economic hardship. There's no harm in politely asking, just don't demand it.
Ask about a referral system. Some doctors pay fees (kickbacks) if you refer other patients to them. This can help to offset your costs if you're happy with the outcome of the surgery and want to recommend it to friends or family.

, Depending on what surgeon you choose and their affiliations, you might have your procedure in a local hospital or a private clinic. Regardless of where it's performed, reversal surgeries usually take several hours and most women need to stay in the hospital or clinic for at least two days to recover enough to go home.If your surgeon is able to perform the surgery on a Friday, try to book that time and then spend the weekend recovering. This can minimize the time lost from work.
Before your appointment, remember not to eat. Surgery with anesthesia should be performed on an empty stomach.

, Once the anesthesia takes effect, the surgeon will make a small incision in your lower abdomen (mini-laparotomy) to expose your uterus, Fallopian tubes and ovaries.Then they will remove any clips/rings used to block your Fallopian tubes and attempt to repair them with absorbable stitches.The surgeon may not be able to reattach one or both of your Fallopian tubes if too much was removed or damaged during the initial tubal ligation.
Usually a small ""bikini cut"" is made near your pubic hair area so the scar can be covered up with panties and bathing suits.
The surgery usually takes between two to three hours and can be performed as an inpatient or outpatient procedure. Micro-surgical techniques often allow the woman to go home on the same day.

, Once you get home from the hospital/clinic, you'll probably still need at least a few days (perhaps a week) to heal more before going back to work — depending on what you do for employment. Don't use aspirin for pain relief after the surgery, since it may promote internal bleeding.You may shower starting 48 hours after the surgery, but don't strain or rub the incision for one week. Don't take a bath or soak the incision site.
Carefully dry your incision area after bathing by gently patting it with a soft, clean towel. The stitches will dissolve and won't need to be removed.
Avoid strenuous lifting, lots of turning or twisting and sexual relations for about two weeks to be on the safe side.
Resume your normal daily activities slowly and only as you begin to feel better.

, As with any major surgery that involves anesthesia, there's always a risk of an allergic and potentially life-threatening reaction.Allergic reactions can be mild and involve just a skin rash and itching, or severe and involve difficulty breathing from a closed air passage. Your anesthesiologist will try to screen you for it and watch you closely on the table, but if you've never had it before, it's impossible to anticipate your reaction.


If you're allergic you'll likely react right away while you're being operated on with uneven breathing or shortness of breath. Your anesthesiologist can reduce the dosage or change to a different mixture to help.
This most severe type of allergic reaction is known as anaphylaxis, which can restrict breathing and lead to death — it occurs in about 1 in 5,000 surgeries.If you notice a skin rash, itchiness, general numbness or nausea that lasts for a few days, then you might be allergic to anesthesia and should tell your doctor for future considerations.

, Another risk factor for any invasive surgery, but especially one as major as a tubal ligation reversal, is infection.Modern sterile surgical methods with small incisions rarely lead to internal infections, but it's important to keep your incision clean so it doesn't get infected. Once you get home from the hospital, apply antibacterial cream to your incision two to three times daily to help prevent infection.


Signs of an external infection include localized swelling, tenderness, skin redness and leaking of puss mixed with some blood.
Signs of an internal infection that's spread to your blood include a high fever, general abdominal/pelvic pain, nausea, fatigue and confusion.
Make a follow-up appointment with your doctor about a week after your procedure to make sure your incision is healing and there's no signs of infection or other complications

, Women who have tubal reversal procedures have an increased risk of an ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening condition that entails a fertilized egg implanting and growing outside your uterus — usually in a Fallopian tube.An ectopic pregnancy requires immediate medical attention and removal of the egg from the Fallopian tube.


Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy are similar to a normal pregnancy — missed period, breast tenderness, nausea, positive pregnancy test.Abnormal symptoms that indicate there's a problem include: vaginal bleeding, abdominal / pelvic pain, lightheadedness and fainting.
If symptoms persist or quickly get worse, see your doctor immediately.

The more you drink while pregnant, especially during the first trimester, the greater the risk of your unborn fetus developing FAS.Being aware of your child’s risk for this disease can help you recognize it and get a diagnosis and treatment in a timely manner.


Alcohol reaches the developing fetus through the placenta and causes higher blood alcohol concentration levels in a fetus than in you. A fetus metabolizes alcohol at a much slower rate.Alcohol interferes with oxygenation and nutrition delivery to your unborn baby. This can severely impact the fetus’s developing tissues and organs, including the brain.You may have consumed a lot of alcohol before you realized you were pregnant, putting your unborn baby at risk for FAS.Keep this in mind during and after your pregnancy.;
, There are many different physical symptoms of FAS that may be mild or severe. From distinctive facial features to slow growth patterns, identifying these common markers may help get your child a diagnosis and medical treatment.


Symptoms can appear while the baby is still developing in utero or at birth. They may also only present later, such as behavior issues.Facial features such as wide-set eyes; an extremely thin upper lip; a short, upturned nose; and lack of lip folds between the nose and upper lip may indicate FAS.A child with FAS may also have narrow and small eyes.Deformed joint and limbs may indicate FAS.Slow growth patterns both before and after birth may indicate FAS.Vision and hearing issues may indicate FAS.Small head circumference and underdeveloped brain may indicate FAS.Heart defects and issues with kidneys may also indicate FAS.Many symptoms of FAS resemble those of other diseases and conditions. If you suspect your child or another might have FAS, it’s important to see a doctor and/ or get a second medical opinion.

These tests can help confirm a diagnosis and help your doctor formulate a comprehensive treatment plan.


Your doctor may order brain imaging studies such as an MRI or CT scan.
Blood and urine tests may be ordered to help rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms.
If you are still pregnant, your doctor may order blood tests or a pregnancy ultrasound., Your doctor may want to confirm a diagnosis of FAS with more in depth tests. She may order that your child get an MRI or CT to assess physical and neurological issues.CT scans and MRIs make images of your child’s brain and can make it easier for your doctor to identify damage to the brain. This can help her better formulate a treatment plan.Your doctor may order a CT scan, which will require your child to lie still while a technician makes images of her brain. This form of X-ray imaging can help better see the brain and may show growth or developmental issues. Your doctor may order an MRI, which will also require your child to lie inside of a large scanner for a few minutes.

See your doctor if you suspect you may have BV.,
Prevent BV from recurring.",How to Recognize Bacterial Vaginosis Symptoms," BV is often accompanied by a thin grey or white colored discharge.;
, The discharge is often accompanied by an unpleasant odor, which can be described as ""fish-like"". The odor usually becomes worse after intercourse., Though BV does not normally cause pain, some women experience a burning sensation during urination.

, The outside of the vagina may become itchy, though the itchiness is normally mild. It can become worse if soap is use around the area.

, Some women with BV experience no obvious signs or symptoms at all. This is unfortunate as, if left untreated, BV can lead to more serious health issues down the line., Although bacterial vaginosis is usually pretty harmless, in some cases it can lead to serious complications, if left untreated. These complications include:


An increased susceptibility to HIV infection if exposed to the HIV virus, and an increased susceptibility to other sexually-transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Increased risk of infection following surgical procedures such as hysterectomies and abortions.
Increased risk of complications during pregnancy, such as premature delivery and low birth weight.
An increased risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, which is an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes and can lead to infertility., Although BV will sometimes (in about 1/3 of cases) clear up on its own, it's still important to see your doctor and receive antibiotic treatment, in order to avoid potentially serious complications.


Your doctor will usually prescribe an antibiotic such as metronidazole or clindamycin. These antibiotics can be taken orally as a pill, or applied topically as a vaginal gel or cream.
It is particularly important to receive treatment for BV if you are pregnant, in order to avoid complications.
In fact, the CDC recommends that all pregnant women who have ever had a premature delivery or low birth weight baby should undergo a BV examination and, if necessary, receive treatment., Unfortunately, BV is still not fully understood by scientists, so there is no surefire way to prevent it from recurring. However, there are several things you can do to maintain the balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the vagina, which can help you to avoid BV:



Limit your number of sexual partners: Having sex with multiple partners can upset the natural balance of the vagina, therefore try to abstain from sex or limit the number of people you have sex with. When you do have sex, make sure to use a male latex condom to avoid picking up an STD.Do not douche: Douching disrupts the normal balance of your vagina and makes you more susceptible to developing BV. Douching will not clear a vaginal infection and is strongly discouraged by the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Avoid vaginal irritation: Things like washing your vaginal area with soap, using scented tampons or sanitary pads and frequently using hot tubs can irritate your vagina and increase the risk of developing BV. The use of IUDs has also been linked with an increased risk of BV.

Alter your diet: Some research has suggested that following a diet rich in folate, calcium and vitamin E can help to decrease the risk of developing BV. It can also be helpful to quit smoking."

Take out a medical credit card.,
Use your existing credit card.,
Familiarize yourself with risks.",How to Pay for Plastic Surgery1," Medical credit cards are frequently offered as an option for people looking into plastic surgery. A relatively new trend, medical credit cards function much like regular credit cards but can only be used to for medicinal purposes.


Medical credit cards are mainly appealing because they are easy to obtain and come with a 0% promotions and fairly low interest rates. As you can only use medical credit cards for medical purposes, the money you're able to spend is somewhat limited. This can act to prevent overspending.
Make sure you pay for procedures as you go along if you're using a medical credit card. You might be tempted, given the freedom the card provides, to pay for a series of surgeries upfront. However, there's no guarantee you'll want to continue having work done if you're happy with an initial procedure. Only pay for what you can reasonably afford to eventually pay off and only pay for procedures as they are scheduled.;
, If you do not want to apply for another credit card, you can simply use an existing card to pay for the procedure. This can be simpler than undergoing the application process for a medical credit card.


The main pro to using your existing credit card is that it's a quick, uncomplicated way to pay for a procedure and can help build your credit. However, make sure your card comes with a low interest rate as plastic surgery is expensive. It might take you a few months to pay off what you owe.
If you do use your credit card to pay for the procedure, do not add more charges to the card. Do not use a card that carries more than a 10% interest rate. Make sure your credit line is large enough to cover the procedure.

, Using credit cards to pay for plastic surgery comes with certain risks. Make sure you're familiar with drawbacks before making a decision to charge your plastic surgery to a card.


Be very careful you're working with a reputable company when taking out a medical credit card. There are predatory lenders in the medical world and oftentimes an interest rate not initially agreed upon is applied retroactively. Also, medical credit cards can be very strict about payments. If you miss a payment, the APR can rise to as much as 30%.
If you put a major purchase on your existing credit card, you can easily max it out. This could potentially hurt your credit rating if you're unable to make payments in a timely fashion. You should also be sure to account for follow up procedures. Face lifts, for example, often require multiple surgeries before the procedure is considered complete. You do not want to be in a position where you need a second facelift before you've paid off the cost for the first one.

Talk to your doctor about group B strep.",How to Prevent Infections During Pregnancy," Often you won't even feel symptoms. If you believe you may have an infection, see your doctor.;
, This is exceptionally important if you have done any of the following:


Used the bathroom.
Touched raw meat, raw eggs, or unwashed vegetables.
Prepared food for consumption.
Touched dirt or soil.
Handled pets. Especially hamsters or guinea pigs.
Been in contact with someone who is ill.
If you have gotten saliva on your hands
Changed a diaper.
Played with children.

, A child's saliva could contain a virus. The virus could be harmless to them, but it could be hazardous to you and the fetus.

, If cooked properly, the juices will be clear and there will be no pink inside. Do not eat hot dogs, lunch meats, or deli meats, unless they are steaming hot.

, Avoid soft cheeses unless they have labels that tell you they are pasteurized.

, If you must change the litter, wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly when finished. Cat litter can contain a harmful parasite that causes the infection toxoplasmosis. This infection can cause blindness or intellectual disability later in your child's life.

, Hire a professional to get rid of rats or mice in your house. If you own a pet rodent, like a hamster or guinea pig, have someone else take care of it.

,,,, If you already have an STD, talk to your doctor about what you can do to reduce the risks to your child.

, Speak to your doctor about vaccines that are recommended before you become pregnant, during your pregnancy, or after the birth of your baby. The correct vaccinations at the appropriate time can keep you well, keep your baby from getting ill, or prevent health problems that may last them a lifetime.

, If you know someone who has chickenpox or rubella, stay away from them. This is very important if you have not had the infection yourself, or have not been vaccinated before getting pregnant.

, Nearly 1 in 4 women carry this type bacteria and have no symptoms. A swab test nearing the end of pregnancy will reveal if you the bacteria. If you have group B strep, discuss steps with your doctor concerning how to safeguard your baby.

Visit your doctor on a regular basis.",How to Prevent Birth Defects," Do not drink any beer, wine, liquor or any other form of alcohol during conception or pregnancy. There is no safe amount of alcohol that you can drink during pregnancy, and when a woman drinks, the alcohol passes from her bloodstream into the fetus.


Prenatal exposure to alcohol can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). One of the most severe of these disorders is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is the major known preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States.
Drinking during pregnancy can also lead to a miscarriage and stillbirth. ;
, There is no safe amount of smoke that a pregnant woman and baby can be exposed to, so always avoid smoking cigarettes and secondhand smoke during conception and pregnancy.


Tobacco intake increases the risk of a premature birth, low birth weight, birth defects such as cleft lip or cleft palate, and death. Women who smoke while pregnant are more likely to have a miscarriage. Smoking has also been linked to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)., Particular over-the-counter and prescription drugs, referred to as ""teratogens,"" carry a high risk of causing birth defects. If you are taking medication, speak with your physician before conceiving.


Teratogenic drugs are most dangerous between the first and eighth week of pregnancy, a period when many women may not realize they are pregnant. Thus, it is very important to consult with your doctor if you are taking medication and wish to conceive.
There are a number of drugs that fall under the teratogenic category, including some antibiotics, lithium, thyroid and cancer medications, blood-thinners, acne medications, male hormones, anti-epileptic drugs, antidepressants and more. A helpful list and description of high-risk medications can be found here., The consumption of drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin can lead to serious complications during and after pregnancy. These and other illicit drugs should be avoided at all costs during conception and pregnancy.


Cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs can cause premature birth, low birth weight, defects in the heart, and other complications for a newborn. In addition, a baby born to a mother who uses cocaine or heroin during pregnancy may enter the world addicted to these drugs and experience painful withdrawal symptoms.
The use of cocaine while pregnant can produce babies with defects of the limbs, intestines, kidneys, urinary system, and heart. It can also cause microcephaly, a condition that leads to the development of an abnormally small brain. Cocaine also often causes placenta abruption, which can be fatal to both mother and fetus.
Heroin use can cause respiratory problems, hypoglycemia, intracranial hemorrhaging (bleeding in the brain), and other defects. Heroin and other opiates also cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate which is very hard to treat.

, There are many everyday solvents, insecticides, and toxic fumes that may cause birth defects, and you should avoid situations in which you may be exposed to such agents.


The list of potentially dangerous toxins is long, and exposure can occur in a number of different ways: refinishing furniture or painting, agricultural work, ingesting polluted water, living near a hazardous waste site, and so on.
The most common toxins a mother might come into contact with are pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides), solvents (gasoline, paint thinner, nail polish remover), and colorants (metallic dyes, furniture paint, fabric dye). For a longer list of harmful toxins, see here.
For a more thorough description of the potential harm caused by environmental toxins, and the situations in which exposure can occur, see here. , Because the largest number of birth defects occur during the first 3 months of gestation, it is very important to know if you are pregnant. Indeed, it is recommended that you speak with your doctor before you become pregnant in order to discuss your family and medical history.


Planning for pregnancy with the advice of a doctor is particularly important for women who already have a child with a birth defect.
Planning your pregnancy allows you time to break bad habits like smoking and drinking, and to prepare your body for the big event.
You may also request a pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy screening test in order to spot potential or real birth defects. The types of tests include a carrier test to see if you or your partner carry potentially harmful genes, as well as screening and diagnostic tests that can determine risks for and detect genetic disorders. , This B vitamin is crucial to preventing neural tube defects in a baby’s brain and spine, including anencephaly and spina bifida, respectively. It is recommended that expectant women take at least 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. You should begin taking folic acid a minimum of 3 months before you become pregnant.The safest approach is to make sure you are taking 400 mcg of folic acid daily before you become pregnant, and continue taking this amount at least through the first three months of the pregnancy.
Good sources of folic acid are cereal, spinach, beans, asparagus, oranges and peanuts. However, the easiest way to obtain the recommended amount of folic acid is by taking a multivitamin. Make sure to speak with your doctor about the use and benefits of folic acid. , Particular foods may contain toxins dangerous to both you and your unborn child, including mercury, salmonella, listeria, shigella, and E. coli, and thus should be avoided before conception and during a pregnancy.


Avoid eating fish such as swordfish, shark, tilefish and king mackerel, as they may contain high levels of mercury, which can lead to hearing and vision problems, as well as brain damage.
Do not eat raw fish or shellfish during pregnancy. Avoid eating sushi and sashimi, oysters, clams and scallops.
Food poisoning can also be very dangerous to an unborn child. Make sure to fully cook poultry, meats and eggs, and avoid luncheon meats, hotdogs, and foods that contain raw or partially cooked eggs (hollandaise sauce, Caesar salad dressing, eggnog, and more)., The healthier your body is, the lower the chances are that your newborn will have a birth defect. It is thus important to eat a balanced diet, engage in regular exercise, and control your bodyweight.


A balanced diet will include the following: 5 portions of fruits and vegetables a day; 2-3 portions of (low-fat) dairy products a day; protein-rich foods every day; and 2 portions of fish a week. Be careful to check each food for potentially high levels of mercury or other toxins. For more information on maintaining a healthy diet during pregnancy see here.
Speak with your doctor before beginning or continuing an exercise regime, particularly if you have any medical conditions (heart disease, high blood pressure, etc.) that may pose a risk to you and your baby.
30 minutes of low-impact exercise each day is recommended for pregnant women. Healthy activities include riding a stationary bike, swimming, low-impact aerobics and, particularly, walking. Be careful to stay hydrated and avoid overheating.
Obesity increases the chances a newborn will have birth defects, including heart complications and spina bifida. Thus, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and keep your weight under control before a pregnancy. An ideal body mass index (BMI) is between 20 and 25, while a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese., If you have a physical condition that may put added strain on your body during pregnancy, or create a risk for your baby, speak with a doctor about ways you can get it under control.


Uncontrolled Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes put women at greater risk of miscarriage, and can cause several different birth defects in a newborn’s brain, spine, heart, kidneys, and other areas of the body.
Gestational diabetes can affect all women, but women who are over the age of 25, obese, have a family history of diabetes, or are of a non-caucasian background have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. This can cause excessive birth weight, preterm birth, low blood sugar and potentially type 2 diabetes in your baby.Pay particular attention to epilepsy, obesity, and high blood pressure when you are planning a pregnancy, and speak to your physician about the risks these conditions pose to a pregnancy., Particular infections can cause birth defects, and thus you should carefully avoid situations that may cause infections, and make sure your vaccinations are up to date.


Rubella (German measles) is a particularly dangerous cause of birth defects in children. Make sure to speak with your doctor before you become pregnant in order to have your blood tested for immunity against this infection.
Toxoplasmosis can cause hearing and vision problems, as well as intellectual disabilities. The parasite spreads through the eating of unwashed vegetables and raw or undercooked meat, as well as through contact with animal (particularly cat) feces. Make sure to wash and cook vegetables and meat, use gloves when gardening, and (if you can) avoid emptying litter boxes.
Cytomegalovirus can cause hearing and vision problems, as well as intellectual disabilities, and spreads through children's urine and other bodily fluids. If you are around children on a regular basis, it is recommended that you use gloves when changing diapers and wash your hands regularly., Consulting your physician before and during your pregnancy is crucial to preventing birth defects in your baby. Visit your physician before you become pregnant to discuss your family and medical history, and begin prenatal care as soon as you know that you are pregnant."

Take out a bank loan.,
Look into unsecured medical loans.,
Use your 401K.,
Take out a home equity loan.",How to Pay for Plastic Surgery2," The lowest risk option for taking out loans for plastic surgery is a simple bank loan. If you're wary about using a credit card, consider taking out a personal loan from your bank.


Bank loans have a fixed interest rate and a fixed amount of time where you have to pay. This prevents you from accruing large amounts of interest over time. A bank loan can also help your credit rating, especially if you've never taken out a loan before.
Even with low interest, keep in mind interest rates on loans can still add quite a bit to the final cost. Try to ask for a secured loan if you know you can make payments on time.

, Depending on your financial situation and credit score, a bank might not approve a loan for cosmetic surgery. If this is the case, you can look into alternative types of loans. One such type is an unsecured medical loan.


Unsecured medical loans are usually brokered through third parties. Your doctor may offer to act as a third party to help you get an unsecured medical loan. This is a good option if you have a low credit score and are having trouble securing money through other means.Interest rates on these types of loans can be quite high. You also might need a co-signer and if you fail to make payments your negligence will affect the co-signer's credit rating. Always read fine print when taking out a loan of this type. If you have any questions, consult an attorney., If you have a 401K you can withdraw up to 50% of the balance. Repayments are automatically deducted from your paycheck. While this allows you to avoid interest rates and prevents you from missing payments, this can affect your taxes. You might lose certain tax benefits or have to pay double taxes for some costs. Talk to an accountant before taking money out of your 401K.

, If you're a home owner, a home equity loan can help pay for cosmetic surgery. These loans use your house as leverage and the amounts are based on your current mortgage payments.


As mortgage rates are at historic lows, this can be very affordable for homeowners. It is also a fairly quick way to get the needed money together. The housing market, however, is extremely volatile. If anything should happen and you need to sell your home, having taken out a home equity loan puts you in an extremely vulnerable financial position.Home equity loans are easy to obtain but as they carry a somewhat high risk they should be a last resort.

"

Save.,
Borrow from family and friends.,
Ask about payment plans.",How to Pay for Plastic Surgery3," Simply saving is probably the best option. Putting away small amounts of money over time assure that you'll have enough for the procedure and will not have to take out loans or use a credit card. It's best to have the money upfront for most cosmetic surgeries. The main drawback, however, is that you might have to wait months or even years to secure the necessary funds.

, If you're unable to secure a loan or use a card, try to borrow money from family and friends. Expectations of repayment are more flexible and there will likely not be an interest rate.


If you make a late payment, your loved ones should understand. If you have anything in writing, you can agree to flexible terms and low to no interest. It can be a quick, hassle-free way to secure the money.
The main drawback of borrowing from friends and family is that it jeopardizes your relationships. People frequently have falling outs over money. If you're unable to make a payment or default on the agreement you could end up estranged from a loved one.

, Doctors may be able to work out a payment plan with you. This way, you would not have to pay the total cost upfront.


For a doctor's payment plan, missed or late payments do not show up on a credit card. There is generally no interest. Doctors are usually flexible enough that they can create a plan that works for your specific needs.
The main drawback is unpaid loans can still go to collections. This can seriously damage your credit score. It can also damage your relationship with your doctor. He or she might not be willing to help you if you're in need of future procedures.

Monitor any abdominal pain.,
Note any changes in appetite.,
Make note of flu-like symptoms.,
Monitor any vaginal fluids.,
Watch for painful intercourse.,
Seek emergency assistance.,
Go in for regular check-ups.",How to Recognize Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)1," This is usually the main symptom for women suffering from PID. The cramping and tenderness might start out as mild and build up over time or go directly into severe pains. You may feel as if you cannot move your midsection or flex it enough to stand up straight., Along with cramps, your stomach may be upset constantly or during odd periods. This may result in you vomiting up any food that is consumed. Or, you might find yourself facing nausea at the very sight of food or immediately after eating., Coinciding with nausea, PID can trigger a high fever (over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) or off-an-on bouts of chills. Your fever may hold over time or come and go at random., Keep an eye on your undergarments to see if you notice any increased vaginal discharge. It might also be unusual in texture or have an unpleasant odor. Seeing heavy spotting or bleeding in between periods is another possible symptom of PID., If you begin to experience a sharp pain during sex or a continual dull ache afterwards, this could be a sign of PID. The pain could come on suddenly or it could slowly develop and increase in severity over time., It may be a good idea to head to an emergency clinic if your temperature spikes to 104 degrees Fahrenheit or over. Or, if you can’t keep any food down for days. If the pain in your abdomen turns severe, then seek out emergency treatment, too. If nothing else, they may be able to provide you with fluids and pain meds until you can be seen by your regular doctor., It is very possible to have PID and show no physical symptoms at all, also called being asymptomatic. Or, your symptoms may be so subtle or the pain so mild that you really don’t pay attention to them until they turn severe. Pay close attention to your body and go to regular yearly checkups with your OBGYN as a preventative measure.If PID continues to develop unchecked, you can face some really serious medical consequences. The scarring can result in permanent infertility. It can also cause an egg to stay in the fallopian tubes (not heading over to the uterus as usual), creating a potentially dangerous ectopic pregnancy. You might also suffer from lifelong severe pelvic pain."
"
See your doctor.,
Consent to an ultrasound.,
Consent to laparoscopic surgery.,
Take all medications as directed.,
Notify your sexual partners.",How to Recognize Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)2," As soon as you suspect PID, make an appointment to talk with your OBGYN. They will ask you about your medical and sexual history and then will do a general pelvic exam. If they find that you are tender in your abdomen and around your cervix, then they will likely order additional testing. If your OBGYN is booked up, try contacting your primary care physician. You could also go to a clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.They may order a blood test to see if your cells appear to be fighting off an infection. They may also send off a cervical fluid sample to be tested for STDs.There is no one clear way to diagnose PID. That means that, unfortunately, it is often misdiagnosed as another problem with similar symptoms, such as appendicitis.
Your doctor may also recommend hospitalization as part of your treatment if you: are very ill, won’t respond to antibiotics, have an abscess, or are pregnant.

, If your doctor believes that a PID diagnosis is possible, but needs more evidence they may request permission to complete an ultrasound, or in-depth image of your body’s interior. For example, an ultrasound can show whether or not an abscess is blocking or stretching out part of your fallopian tubes, something that is not only painful but very dangerous to your overall health., This is a procedure where your doctor will make a small incision in your abdominal area and then insert a small, lighted camera. This will allow them to view your internal organs up close and personal. They can also take tissue samples, if needed, to conduct additional testing.Even though it is only minimally invasive, a laparoscopic procedure is still surgery. So, you’ll want to be very clear on the possible risks and benefits before agreeing to go forward.

, The most common treatment for PID is antibiotics. Because PID infections are usually quite severe and may involve a number of different harmful organisms, you’ll probably have to take at least two different types of antibiotics at once. They will come in either pill form or an in-office shot.If you get pills, make sure to read the directions carefully and finish the entire run of the drugs, even if you start to feel better before they are finished.
Most doctors will want you to make a follow-up appointment about three days in so they can check your progress.

, While PID is not contagious, the STDs that it often develops from, chlamydia and gonorrhea, are easily passed between sexual partners. This makes it possible for you to be cured of PID only to be infected once more. Once you’ve been diagnosed with PID, talk with your sexual partner(s) and suggest that they seek out treatment. Remember that they may show no symptoms, but still have PID and be capable of spreading it."
"
Get tested for STDs.,
Be on guard after previous PID episodes.,
Pay particular attention in your teens and 20s.,
Practice safe sex.,
Stop douching.,
Be watchful in the immediate period after IUD insertion.",How to Recognize Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)3," If you are sexually active, visit with your OBGYN each year and request STD testing. PID is very often linked with two widespread bacterial STDs, gonorrhea and chlamydia. A quick pelvic exam and a few labs can let you know whether or not you have these infections, which can make it possible to treat them before they develop into PID., Having PID once makes it far more likely that you will contract it again. Basically, it means that your body is vulnerable to some of the types of bacteria which cause PID. So, if you’ve gotten it before, make sure to keep a close eye on any possible symptoms, using your past experiences as your guide., Younger, sexually active women have an increased odds of getting PID. Their internal reproductive organs are not fully developed, which makes them easier targets for bacteria and STDs. They are also more likely to “skip” regular OBGYN appointments., With every additional sex partner, your risk of getting PID or an STD grows. This is especially the case if you have sex without using a condom, as birth control will not protect you against STD and other infections. By reducing your number of partners, and having them all go for regular STD tests, you can improve your own health., This is when you shoot water or another cleansing solution into your vaginal area in the hopes of making it cleaner. The problem here is that you can push nasty bacteria up into your reproductive organs, including your cervix, where they can take hold and give you PID. Douching also kills off natural, good oils and chemicals living in the outer vaginal area., Most doctors will send you home with antibiotics following an IUD procedure, to minimize the possibility of infection. However, it is important to keep a close eye on your body for the first month or so following getting your new IUD, as this is the time when PID is most likely to develop."

Make meaningful eye contact.,

Explore touch in new ways.,
Kiss.,
Talk about sex.,
Attend therapy.,
Join a support group.,
Try online dating.",How to Pursue Romance if You Suffer from a Sexual Disorder," A sexual disorder occurs when a problem arises during any part of the sexual response cycle (excitement, plateau, orgasm, resolution).Some sexual disorders include having a lack of desire for sex, problems becoming aroused, delays or absence of orgasm, and sexual pain disorders.


For men, sexual disorders can include erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation or delayed ejaculation.
For women, sexual disorder can include the inability to achieve orgasm, inadequate lubrication, and inability to relax the vaginal muscles to welcome intercourse.;
, Don’t fall into the trap of feeling like nobody will love you because you have a sexual disorder. Sex is different from love. You deserve to feel loved for who you are, not for your sexual performance. Having sex does not mean that you love each other, and likewise, not having sex doesn’t mean you do not love each other.


If you struggle with sexual activity, remind yourself that you are worthy of love, even if that love includes a different version of sexuality.

, Many sexual problems result from feeling anxious, tense, or nervous.While this is not the case for all sexual disorders, it can help to relax your mind and your body. However, if at any point you feel uncomfortable in any sexual activity, don’t be afraid to say, “No” or “This is not comfortable for me.”


If you feel nervous about engaging in sexual contact, relax your mind and body. Tense all of your muscles and hold for three seconds, then release.
To clear your mind, challenge all of the critical thoughts and replace them with more positive thoughts. Instead of saying, “This is going to be terrible” say, “I can enjoy myself with this person.”

, If you choose to have sex, let your partner know of any challenges you face and how they may affect your sexual relationship. Find ways to be physically intimate that honor your body. Don’t feel pressured to have sex. If you feel pain or discomfort, tell your partner, “I need a break” or, “I need to stop.” Always respect your sensations, feelings, and needs.


Sex should be fun and enjoyable for both partners. If it’s not pleasurable for you, speak up.
You may also consider other ways that you can be intimate with your partner. If sex is not possible for you, then you might consider doing something to satisfy your partner in another way. This may be enough to create the same intimacy between you that sex provides., In both dating and relationships, eye contact plays an important role. Gazing into another’s eyes can increase feelings of affection, passion, and love.When the other person speaks, look them in the eyes. If your partner is sharing something important, stop and make eye contact to show that you care and are listening.


Eye contact is a great way to build trust, empathy, and connection., Be affectionate with your partner. Hold hands, put your arms around each other, and snuggle together. Caress your partner, give and receive a backrub, and give meaningful hugs. Affection arouses feelings of love and intimacy.Show love and affection and let them know you are interested.

, Touch doesn’t have to imply sex. Touch your partner and be touched in ways that feel good but that do not imply having sex. Enjoy being close with your partner engaging in sensual touch. Take turns touching each other in new ways.For example, use an object such as a feather to touch your partner. Explore non-sexual parts first (such as arms and legs) and move into more arousing areas. Ask your partner what they enjoy and make sure to tell your partner what you enjoy.


For more information, check out How to Get More Intimate Without Having Sex.

, Kissing shows love, affection, connection, and sensuality. You can convey a lot in a kiss: from saying hello or goodbye to passionately kissing. Engage in playful, fun, and intimate kissing. Kissing can be exciting, pleasurable, and erotic. Kissing can build feeling of trust, intimacy, and connection.In short-term relationships, kisses tend to be more sexual in nature, whereas in long-term relationships they tend to communicate closeness and intimacy.

, It can help to be able to communicate openly about sex, pleasure, and your body.While you may feel uncomfortable talking to your partner about sex, do it anyway and remind yourself that it’s an important topic to be honest about with your partner. Don’t focus so much on what you cannot do, but what you can and want to do.


Say, “I feel really nervous about being touched or having sex. It would help me to talk about it together.” Be sure to let them know your wants and desires.
For example, you can say, “I don’t like being touched this way. However, I like it when you touch me here.”
You can also say, “While sex is painful for me, these are the things I enjoy.”

, If you struggle with feeling shame or guilt about your sexual disorder, you may benefit from therapy. Here you can talk confidentially with a therapist about your frustrations and difficulties. A therapist can help you accept your disorder and move on with your life in a productive and healthy way. You can learn ways to feel pleasure, and in some cases, work through disorders to achieve sexual desire or intimacy.While some disorders have a medical or physical cause, others have a psychological cause.

Contact your surgeon immediately if you experience any post-operative complications.",How to Minimize the Risks of Cosmetic Surgery," Sometimes the fact that cosmetic surgery is elective affects how you perceive it. If you undergo surgery for cosmetic reasons, you may tend to think of it as something like going to the beauty salon and having a haircut. It is important to realize that the body doesn’t differentiate the trauma from cosmetic surgery from any other surgery. Just like any other surgical procedure, complications are possible and to minimize risks, it is important to approach cosmetic surgery as a serious medical procedure.;
, The degree of plastic surgery complications and risks is largely dependent on the type of surgical procedure/s performed and one way of minimizing risks is to arm yourself with knowledge about the procedure. Minor complications and unmet expectations can be minimized by fully understanding the risks and benefits associated with the procedure you are considering.

, Innovative technologies and new surgical techniques are continually being introduced through the media and at times the complications for these procedures have not been fully documented or evaluated. For example, the issue of hyperpigmentation due to laser treatments only surfaced after more than a year of its introduction. Thus it’s advisable to wait at least eighteen months once a new technology is released before trying it out. New equipment requires a big investment and unfortunately, some doctors want to make a return for their investment quickly.

, The benefit of elective surgery is you have the time to do research, get second opinions and choose your surgeon well. The best way to minimize risk is to choose a reliable plastic surgeon who is board certified and has the experience and skill necessary for a successful surgery.

, He should be certified by the organization that is recognized by the country’s Board of Surgery. In the Philippines, the Philippine Board of Plastic Surgery (PBPS) is the only organization recognized by the Philippine College of Surgeons to grant board certification in the field of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. This certification ensures that the surgeon has undergone has completed an accredited training program in plastic surgery and has reached a certain standard of skills and competence.

, Before a hospital grants privileges to physicians, they usually require certain standards of training and competence to be met.

, The level of experience that the plastic surgeon has is also important. How long has the surgeon been performing the procedure? Oftentimes, the experience of a surgeon determines his ability to visualize the end result and his ability to deal with any complications. The more cases he has done, the better his judgement, and the less the risks. A deceptively simple procedure such as a rhinoplasty can have results that are extremely diverse, depending on the surgeon who is performing the procedure.

, Although prices for cosmetic surgery procedures vary widely, you want to make sure that you don’t sacrifice safety and quality for a lower price. Verify the products or implants that the surgeon will use for your procedure. Make sure he doesn’t use substandard products or variations of well known, FDA approved brands of products used in order to lower costs.

, Although many cosmetic surgery procedures may be safely done in outpatient clinics, others should only be done in a hospital setting. Check that the operating facility is properly equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and meets standards for operating room safety, personnel and surgeon credentials. Check the credentials of the support staff, especially the anesthesiologist.

, The most common risks for cosmetic surgery are unsatisfactory results and/or unmet expectations. Good communication is important to minimize the risk of unmet expectations. A responsible surgeon will evaluate if your expectations are realistic and explain to you what he can do to help you. He will clearly and thoroughly explain potential side effects and risks and the possibility of secondary procedures. Although your plastic surgeon can and should do several things to minimize your chances of unsatisfactory results, even the most skilled plastic surgeons deal with factors which are not under their control, such as how tissues heal.

, Patient evaluation is an important prerequisite to surgery. Your plastic surgeon should screen you carefully and to minimize risks, he needs to make sure you are, physically and emotionally, a good candidate for cosmetic surgery. The degree of complications and risks in plastic surgery is largely determined by the patient's own health condition and physiology. If you have diabetes, heart conditions and allergies, if you smoke, or are elderly, you will have a greater risk for complications than if you are young and healthy. In some cases, your surgeon will require you to obtain medical clearance from your primary care physician to make certain that it is safe to proceed. Try to get as physically fit as possible, stop smoking, have blood tests and a physical examination done before you undergo surgery.

, Complications can be minimized by disclosing your entire medical history to your surgeon. You should also tell him about all prescribed or over-the-counter medicines and herbal supplements you take on a regular basis.

, At times, patients disregard the surgeon’s pre-operative instructions, thinking that it doesn’t matter that much. It is important to realize that to minimize risks, you need to prepare your body for surgery by obeying the advice of your surgeon. For example, before surgery, you'll be asked to stop taking medications that can promote bleeding. If you smoke, your surgeon will advise you to stop at least two weeks prior to surgery.

, Always follow your surgeon’s instructions for postoperative care. These are carefully designed to minimize your risk of complications. Your specific instructions will vary depending on the surgery performed but in general, your surgeon will instruct you to avoid activities that could hinder the healing process. If you smoke, you will be advised to stop at least two weeks following surgery to aid in wound healing. You will also be instructed to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages and from taking any drugs containing aspirin, as they will increase bruising and may even cause internal bleeding. You will be given instructions in proper wound care. The proper care of your incision affects the scar that you will eventually have. For some procedures you will be instructed to wear support garments to help your body adjust. You can also help minimize complications such as swelling by walking around. By following your surgeon’s instructions, you will ensure that the surgery will have the best results possible.

, During the initial postoperative period, take at least a week away from your daily routine, allowing yourself time to rest and recuperate. Excessive physical activity can result in unnecessary swelling or bleeding. Thus your surgeon will advise you to limit physical exercise for a certain period.

, Even if your surgeon will schedule a follow up appointment with you, don’t wait for the scheduled date to consult about any unusual symptoms such as such as excessive pain or bleeding, fever or abnormal swelling.

You should make sure you have this person lined up before you go into surgery.After bariatric surgery you will not be able to care for yourself. You will need someone to help you remember to take medication, assist you in getting up and down, and generally take care of you.
If you don't want to ask one person to do all this work for you, consider asking friends or loved ones to take shifts. You could have one person pick you up from the hospital, one person stay with you at night, and another person to care for you during the day.;
, Once you wake up after surgery you should be kept there until you can walk at least a few steps on your own. This may take between 24 and 48 hours. This time allows the medical staff to know that you are medically stable and that your pain is under control enough to allow you to get home without too much distress.


Leaving the hospital too early can be dangerous to your health. If you have negative side effects from the surgery, such as internal bleeding, it is important that they are caught before you leave the hospital. Overall, it is important that you become medically stable before you leave the care of your doctor and nurses., When you have the surgery, you will be given a local anesthetic to numb the area of the incision or you will be given general anesthesia. After you are released from the hospital, this anesthetic on the incision area will gradually wear off. Your doctor may prescribe pain medication for you to take after the surgery.When taking pain medications you should avoid operating heavy machinery, such as driving a car. You should also be careful to use the medication as prescribed and let your doctor know if you are taking any other medications or have any allergies to other medications., It is important that you do not exert yourself too much while you are recovering from surgery. Too much physical exertion could open up the incision or damage the changes made inside your body.Most people that undergo bariatric surgery can drive a car within two weeks.
Wait four to six weeks to return to all normal activities, such as lifting heavy objects or doing high-impact exercise.

, Your surgeon should schedule a checkup exam within a week or two of your surgery. The doctor will ask you how you are doing and they will also inspect your incision site to make sure it is healing correctly.


When you go to your checkup exam, ask your surgeon any questions you have about the surgical recovery or the procedure.

, For several months after surgery, it's important not to overtax your digestive system. At each stage of the diet, divide your food into several small meals a day. Eat or drink slowly, taking at least half an hour for each meal. Eating too quickly after bariatric surgery can cause too much food to enter your intestine, causing vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea.Foods high in fat and sugar are more likely to cause these symptoms.
You can try different strategies to help you eat slower, such as waiting two or three minutes between bites. Chewing food extremely thoroughly is recommended during recovery, and will also slow your eating., The hospital should have you consult with a registered dietitian after your surgery. Typically, the first day or so of recovery involves a clear liquid diet to allow your digestive system to ease back into digestion. Sip the liquid slowly and drink no more than 3 ounces (90 mL) at a time.Clear liquids include clear stock, water, and herbal tea., Your doctor or dietitian will likely recommend vitamin and/or calcium supplements, since you may have trouble getting enough of these on your new diet (even after recovery). Take these as directed.If you had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, one type of bariatric surgery, it's especially important to get extra B vitamins, iron, and calcium. This is less of an issue for gastric banding patients., If everything is going well after a day or so, you can start drinking more liquid (still sipping slowly), and opaque liquids such as low-fat milk, broth, and strained cream soup. After several days, you can eat solid foods pureed with liquid to make a smooth paste. Lean ground meat, beans, and cooked vegetables are examples of foods that puree well.Consult your dietitian regularly and let them know if you have any trouble digesting food.
High protein foods can help you recover faster. Nutrition shakes and pureed meats or beans are good sources of protein.
Remember to eat small meals throughout the day. Try starting with six meals, each comprised of ½ to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) of food and liquid.

, After a few weeks, with doctor's approval, add small pieces of easily chewed food to your diet. Finely diced meat, soft fruit, or soft cooked vegetables are all good options. Chew each bite thoroughly to a pureed consistency before swallowing, to avoid blocking your now narrower digestive tract.Remove the skin and seeds from fruits and vegetables before eating.

, Your stomach capacity may not be large enough to handle a drink as well as a nutritious meal. Wait 30 to 45 minutes after each solid food meal, then slowly sip liquids. It should take you about 30 to 60 minutes to drink one cup (240 mL)., You can typically introduce firmer foods eight weeks after surgery, starting with small amounts of finely diced food. You can then slowly ramp up to larger pieces and harder foods, achieving your new permanent diet within four months. Consult with your doctor and registered dietitian regularly to make sure your digestive system can handle the changes, since this schedule can vary.Introduce each ""new"" food one at a time to see how you respond.

At this stage, avoid nuts and seeds; stringy or fibrous foods such as corn and tough meat; carbonated drinks; dried fruit; bread; and fried food. Use caution with spicy food and crunchy food. You can try these foods later on, with professional guidance.
Treat alcohol with extreme caution. You will likely absorb it (and become drunk) much faster than you did before the surgery. You are also now at higher risk for alcohol-related disorders and health problems, such as ulcers., Even after full recover, your diet and eating habits will likely be drastically different than they were before. Your doctor and dietitian can give you specific advice based on the type of surgery you had. The general rules you followed during recovery may help you adapt to your permanent diet as well. Because you are not eating much food overall, a significant portion of it should be protein sources to meet your needs. Continue to minimize fat and sugar, take vitamin supplements, and avoid fluids at mealtimes., Five or six small meals per day work well for many people, with each meal no large than ½ to 1 cup (4-8 oz / 120–240 mL). The size of your digestive tract has been permanently decreased, so you will always need to restrict yourself to small quantities of food to avoid nausea, diarrhea, and other unpleasant symptoms.You will also need to chew your food thoroughly before swallowing. Also consider grinding all meat that you eat before you cook it. This will allow you to better digest it.

, Exercise is essential to keeping healthy and maintaining a healthy weight. Find exercise routines that your find fun and entertaining, as well as exercises that make your sweat and work hard. With a combination of fun and challenging exercises, you are more likely to keep doing it on a regular basis.Consider hiring a personal trainer to keep you motivated and on task when you are exercising.
Explore new activities that give you new ways to get exercise. For example, start hiking and see if exploring nature on foot will motivate you to exercise more.

, Right after bariatric surgery, you are likely to experience a significant weight loss period. However, after that period of extreme weight loss, you will need to find a way to maintain your new weight. This can be best accomplished by maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes moderation in eating and regular exercise. To help you maintain this new lifestyle, seek out nutritional counseling and psychological support.Getting support from professionals and following your doctor's instructions about diet and exercise has been shown to drastically increase your chances of maintaining your weight loss.

, Hopefully everything with your surgery and recovery will go smoothly. However, you should be aware of the things to look for that could signal a problem. Problems with your bariatric surgery could occur right after surgery or long afterwards.As you recover from surgery, look for signs of infection at the incision site. This can include pus or discharge coming from the wound or excessive tenderness and redness.
Pay attention to your digestion after surgery. It will take a few weeks for your digestion to normalize but it should eventually. If you continue to have indigestion, nausea, or vomiting, you should let your doctor know.
If you have a gastric balloon, the balloon is filled with dye that will turn your urine blue or green if it is leaking. If you have this happen, contact your doctor right away.

Use protection when having sexual intercourse.,
Get tested often for STIs.,
See your doctor for regular check ups.",How to Protect Your Fertility1," Both men and women should always use condoms or a form of protection when having sex to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Practice safe sex by always using protection, even if you are in a monogamous relationship. This will prevent unplanned pregnancy and allow you and your partner to plan ahead for a family.;
, STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhoea can be contracted by men and women. These diseases are the leading causes of infertility, and have limited symptoms so they can be difficult to detect. Ensure you are STI free by getting tested at least yearly especially if you are not married, not in a monogamous relationship or have many sexual partners.


If left untreated, chlamydia and gonorrhoea can damage a woman’s fallopian tubes, which can make it more difficult to conceive.

, Regular visits to your doctor will help you detect and treat any conditions that may affect your fertility. Women should visit their ob-gyn annually for fertility tests and other health tests. Men should also discuss any fertility issues with their doctor, especially if they have an undescended testicle or experience a loss of testicular size.If you have been trying to conceive for a year or more by having regular, unprotected sex, and are still not pregnant, you should talk to your doctor. As well, if you are a woman over the age of 35 who has been trying to conceive for six months, you should speak to your doctor about fertility testing. Both men and women should be tested for fertility issues in the event of difficulty conceiving to determine the possible cause or causes.Be aware of your family history. If your mother went through early menopause (before the age of 40), you may not want to wait until age 35 to start trying for pregnancy.

Know what to expect in terms of recovery.Some plastic surgery procedures only take days to recover from (the more minor ones), while others take weeks or even months.,
Adhere to your plastic surgeon's recovery plan.It is key that you follow the specific instructions for recovery, which may include any of the following:


Medication use to control the pain and swelling, and to promote healing.,
Consult your doctor about medication use.It is key to let your doctor know any regular medications or supplements that you generally take.,
Be cautious and allow your body time to recover.,
Plan your healing process in advance of your procedure by eating properly and getting plenty of rest.,
Manage your expectations.Plastic surgery is generally done in hopes of altering one's appearance.,
Seek out the support of family and friends.",How to Heal After Plastic Surgery," It is important to speak to your plastic surgeon prior to the procedure to know what to expect in terms of your recovery. It will likely impact many other spheres of your life, such as your work life and ability to go out with friends, so it is important to be able to plan for this.,
Icing the affected area as needed.
Elevating the affected area as needed, to diminish swelling.
Avoiding direct exposure to sunlight during the healing period.
Effective use of ""drains"" (tubes), which are sometimes inserted to help drain excess fluid in the initial healing phases, such as after cosmetic surgery to the breasts.

Follow your doctor's directions for how to use the drain effectively, which should include how often to empty the drain, and if the fluid coming out should be measured.


Attending follow-up appointments in a timely fashion.

In order to ensure optimum wound healing, and to make sure there are no complications or infections developing, it is important for your doctor to check on things and to receive his or her professional opinion. That way, if there are any issues with healing, they can be dealt with and resolved so that they do not become a problem later.



, Some medications, like blood thinners or aspirin, can be detrimental to healing and actually increase bleeding and swelling. There are also some natural remedies and supplements that can be concerning.


As long as you disclose everything you are taking to your doctor, she can evaluate the safety of your medication regimen and make sure that nothing conflicts with wound healing or worsens bleeding.
The doctor will tell you what medications need to be stopped prior to the surgery, when they should be stopped, and when to restart. Also, other medications may need to be continued straight through the surgery.

, For instance, do not try to get back to your usual routine or be too active too soon following plastic surgery. Over-exerting yourself can lead to complications and slow down the healing process.


Do not exercise until your doctor tells you it is okay to get back to your normal level of physical activity. Exercising too soon can prolong healing by causing swelling or bleeding, or an incision to break down.
When learning how to heal after plastic surgery, do not get upset if you are bruised or swollen for a week or longer following your procedure. Plastic surgery healing times vary for each procedure and each patient.

, Taking care of yourself weeks and even months prior to plastic surgery with good nutrition will help you to heal faster.


Also be sure to drink plenty of fluids and eat a balanced diet after surgery to help your body get the nutrients it needs to mend quickly.Quit smoking to help speed up the healing process.

, However, it is important to note that a perceived ""improvement"" in appearance will not equate to perfection. There is only so much that can be done surgically to change one's appearance, so if you are expecting perfection you will be setting yourself up for disappointment.


Be careful that you do not have unrealistic hopes for plastic surgery or for the anticipated change.Some people inadvertently seek out plastic surgery in hopes that it will ""solve problems"" in other areas of their life — for instance, in hopes that it may save a bad relationship, help their career prospects, cause them to be more popular in their circle of friends, or cause them to be more appealing on the dating scene.
It is important to get honest with yourself about your expectations for the surgery, as well as the reasons you are doing it so as not to have your hopes too high and be disappointed.

, Your family and friends can be an important moral support, especially during the initial stages of healing. You may have pain, trouble completing ordinary tasks around the house, and/or potential feelings of disappointment as the positive results of your surgery will often not be seen fully until some healing has taken place, potentially months down the line. (In other words, plastic surgery tends to look worse before it looks better, as your body needs to heal the wounds and get rid of the swelling, so support during this time is key).


Depending upon how major of a surgery you underwent, you may have activity restrictions for the first while as you are recovering. If this is the case, your family and friends can help you with the tasks of day-to-day life that you are unable to do.They can also pamper you by cooking meals or otherwise tending to your needs and helping you to feel morally supported during what may be a challenging time.

Look in the mirror.,
Find out how much, on average, the procedure will set you back.,
Start hunting for plastic surgeons in your area and visit their websites.,
Read about the procedure you think you need.",How to Have Plastic Surgery1," What about your appearance are you unhappy with? Is your nose too big? Is your chin too small? Does your face look flat? Is your hairline receding? Choose which procedure you are interested in and start researching on the internet.;
, Get a general idea of the expected costs, procedure details, what type of anesthesia you will need, and how much downtime to expect after you have the surgery. Look up before and after photos on the internet.

, If you don't know where to begin, go to Google maps and type in ""plastic surgeons in my area"". This will list nearly every single plastic surgeon near you with a map and directions.

Understand how age factors into your fertility.,
Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.,
Stop smoking or cut down on smoking.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Limit your exposure to harmful toxins.,
Avoid taking steroids.,
Minimize your exposure to heat.",How to Protect Your Fertility2," For women, there is a decrease in fertility as they advance in age. While you and your partner are the ones who should decide the best time, if any, to have children, you are more likely to conceive in your twenties and early thirties. An older woman’s eggs are not fertilized as easily as a younger woman’s eggs, and may not develop normally even after fertilization occurs. As well, men are most fertile in their early twenties.Fertility in men declines gradually at around 40 years old. However, most men can father children into their 50s and beyond.
Women are more likely to have fertility issues when they are over 35. Women over 35 are also less likely to get pregnant as a result of fertility treatments, and are more like to have a miscarriage if they do become pregnant., If you are trying to conceive or are considering pregnancy in the near future, you should try to maintain a healthy weight for your age and height. Being underweight or overweight can lower your fertility.


This is especially important for women, as being overweight or obese can increase your risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause infertility.
To determine if you are at the ideal weight for your age and height, use a Body Mass Index calculator.If you are overweight, you should work on losing weight in a healthy and sustainable way.

, There are many health risks related to smoking, one of which is negative affects on your fertility. Women who smoke are more likely to get menopause earlier than women who do not smoke, and are more likely to experience ovarian failure.As well, men who smoke risk affecting their virility by damaging their sperm, decreasing their sperm’s motility, and decreasing their sperm production., If you are trying to get pregnant, avoid drinking any alcohol to prevent harming a developing baby. If you are planning on getting pregnant in the near future, avoid drinking excessively and drink no more than one or two units of alcohol once or twice a week.Men should also be wary of drinking excessively. You may damage your sperm if you exceed three to four units of alcohol (or two standard drinks) a day.

, If you are in a profession that exposes you to high levels of potentially harmful toxins or chemicals, you may be at risk of developing fertility issues. Dental assistants, industrial workers, agricultural workers, and hair stylists are all at risk of reduced fertility due to the chemicals involved in their day to day work.You should also avoid exposure to radiation and glycol ester, a chemical found in some paints. These substances can both negatively affect your fertility., Men can protect their fertility by avoiding drugs such as steroids or marijuana. These can lead to negative impacts on your virility and lessen your chances of producing viable sperm., A man’s testicles should always be one to two degrees cooler than the rest of his body to prevent slow sperm production. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct heat, such as sitting in a hot tub or a hot bath. If your occupation requires long hours of sitting, or you wear clothing that retain heat, including tight underwear, this can raise the temperature of your testicles and affect your sperm count.Opt for short soaks in a hot bath or a hot tub, try to go for walks throughout the day if your job requires a lot of sitting down, and wear loose underwear.

Injection rhinoplasty is not a viable option for those with a more pronounced bend in their nose.;
, Not all plastic surgeons conduct injection rhinoplasties, so you may need to do some internet research to find one near you that suits your needs.

Consider seeing more than one surgeon if you would like multiple opinions on the options you have for your nose.

, The plastic surgeon will inject dermal filler into specific areas of your nose in order to alter the shape of it and create a straighter overall appearance.Once the injections have been made, the doctor will massage the material into exactly the right shape to fit your nose.
You are completely awake during the procedure and can oversee each action the doctor makes.

, After your nose heals, the changes made to its appearance will last for six to twelve months, at which point you may choose to undergo the procedure once again.Do not touch your nose for a few days immediately after the procedure as the dermal filling sets and the injection sites heal.
Because the results are temporary, adjustments can be made throughout your treatment to achieve a lasting, natural looking nose.

Research the difference between silicone and saline breast implants.,
Assess the potential health risks if an implant breaks or ruptures.,
Decide how you want your breasts to look.,
Take your age into consideration.,
Debate how much you want to spend.",How to Choose Between Silicone and Saline Breast Implants,"


Realize that saline breast implants are filled entirely of saline. Saline is a mixture of salt and water placed inside a silicone shell at the time of surgery. A saline implant requires a small incision because the shell is inserted into the breast area and then filled with saline once inside.






Understand that silicone breast implants are made with synthetic polymers. These polymers are thick and sticky, and placed in a silicone shell that closely resembles the feel of human fat. The incision for a silicone implant is larger than the incision for a saline implant because the silicone implant is filled before insertion into the body.





;
, Saline is absorbed into your body with no health risks. Silicone is also absorbed into your body and won't cause long-term health risks like breast cancer or connective tissue diseases, but could cause short-term pain to the breast area. In either instance, if there is a leak, the implant will need to be removed and can be replaced with a new implant during surgery.

, Silicone implants have the look and feel of real breasts, and have a lower chance of creating ripples and/or wrinkles on the skin. Saline implants tend to look more stiff and unnatural than silicone implants, and have an increased tendency to create ripples and/or wrinkles on the skin.

, Saline breast implants are available to women over the age of 18, while silicone breast implants are available to women over the age of 22. The reason for this difference in age is women who choose breast augmentation should be ready both physically and emotionally. While there are 18-year-old women that are as informed as those who are older, the ruling is that from your 18th birthday until your 22nd birthday, you are only able to choose saline implants. Both saline and silicone are available for women of any age seeking breast reconstructive surgery.

, Silicone breast implants typically cost around $1,000 more than saline-filled implants.

Make sure the surgeon is board certified.,
Ask about their experience.,
Check the doctor's record.,
Research reviews from previous patients.,
Find out if they have hospital privileges.,
Don't pick the lowest bidder.,
Use your instincts.,
Avoid combining multiple procedures.,
Check if the surgery facility is accredited.,
Follow all recommendations clearly.",How to Choose a Cosmetic Surgeon," In addition to ensuring that your doctor has actually graduated from an accredited medical school, make sure they are board certified by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).By law, any medical doctor can perform virtually any medical procedure, so make sure they are a trained specialist in the surgery you need.


The ABPS is recognized and overseen by the American Board of Medical Specialties and sets very high educational and training standards.
In Canada, the equivalent organization is The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.;
, Once you've established they are a board certified surgeon in the specialty you require (such as breast augmentation or face lift), ask about their experience.Find out how many times they've done your type of surgery and when the most recent time was. Some doctor who focuses on breast implants, may occasionally do face lifts to augment their income, for example — avoid this situation.


In general, pick the most experienced surgeon you can who is established in the community you're in.
Newly graduated doctors shouldn't always be avoided because sometimes they are the most up-to-date on new surgical advances.
If you know the name of the surgical technique you want, ask if the doctor has experience in that specific technique.

, Thanks to the internet, it's easier now than ever to do research online from your home, so use this to your advantage by checking your doctor's record.The status of your doctor's license can be found through their state licensing boards. Pick surgeons with clean records and no history of serious discipline or malpractice.


Go to the Federation of State Medical Boards' website, fsmb.org, to find information on a doctor you're considering for surgery.
For a fee, the FSMB will provide the doctor's full profile, including disciplinary actions in other states.
Litigation is becoming more and more common, so malpractice suits against doctors are not unusual and not always a sign of incompetence or negligence. Ask you doctor about a particular case if you're concerned.

, Another advantage of the internet is that there's a number of sites and organizations that rank doctors and encourage reviews and discussion from previous patients. Find these sites and read what other patients are saying about doctors you're considering for your surgical procedure.Keep in mind that people often take the time to write a review online when they're not happy, much more so than when they're satisfied. As such, you'll read a disproportionate number of negative reviews usually.
Read reviews of people who had the same procedure as you. Put more weight into their review if they have similar proportions — going from A cups to C cups in breast augmentation, for example.

, Most hospitals do background checks on their doctors, so if they don't have hospital privileges, consider it a potential red flag.The vast majority of reputable plastic surgeons maintain hospital privileges for the safety and convenience of their patients.


Hospitals have credentialing committees who screen other physicians to make sure they are safe and up-to-date on procedures.
If there's a complication during your surgery in an out-patient clinic, you can be taken to a hospital if your surgeon has privileges there.
Some successful surgeons have clinics that are much like small hospitals, so privileges isn't always critical in all cases.

, In most cases, you'll be paying out of pocket for plastic or cosmetic surgery, but don't always gravitate to the surgeon who charges the least. Lower than average costs are often a reflection of an inexperienced surgeon or one who cuts corners, which isn't usually in your best interests.Shop around for pricing, but balance that against the surgeon's experience and good record. Get quotes from at least three different doctors.
Cheaper fees due to lower overhead costs is ideally what you want to find.

, If you've narrowed it down to a couple of potential surgeons who seem to be equally qualified and offer similar prices, then use your instincts to make your final decision. Ask yourself if you like spending time with him or her and if they inspire confidence in you.Do they seem like a compassionate person whom you can trust?


Your decision process shouldn't start with a personality competition, but it can come down to that after you've narrowed it down to a couple of highly qualified candidates.
Look to see how the doctor gets along with their staff. If the staff seems happy and praises the doctor, then you're likely in good hands.

, Many people who are drawn to cosmetic / plastic surgery don't stop at a single procedure. Doctor's know this and try to combine procedures sometimes for convenience and some cost savings to you — although the overall price is higher, of course. However, bundling surgical procedures, especially at different areas of the body (breast implant with liposuction, for example), significantly increases the risks of life threatening complication.Motivation to make money is strong in some doctors, but don't let their packaged deals convince you. Get another procedure once you're properly healed from the first.
Ask for a ""returning patient discount"" on subsequent procedures instead of trying to get them all done at once.
Another way of saving or recouping your money is through referral fees. As such, refer a friend or family member for a similar procedure if you're happy and get a referral fee from the doctor.

, Wherever your surgeon plans on operating on you (their own clinic, an independent out-patient clinic or a hospital), make sure the facility is accredited.Your safety during surgery also depends on the anesthetist and support staff working along side your surgeon, so accreditation is some more piece of mind.


Accredited operating rooms and surgical units have key life support systems just in case something goes wrong during your procedure.
For accreditation, look for AAAASF, AAAHC or JCAHO operating facility certification.Don't forget about your anesthetist’s qualifications. They should be either a Board Certified Anesthesiologist (BCA) or a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA).

, To reduce your risks during your surgical procedure, make sure to follow all the advice and recommendations from your doctor, particularly what you're supposed to do the day before and the day of surgery.As such, choose a surgeon who is communicative with you and easily understood.


If English is your native tongue, make sure the doctor can speak English or has a translator.
Ask the doctor if they have any brochures or pamphlets that you can take home and read in order to get better informed.
See if the doctor's office is open extended hours or has methods of communicating and answering questions after hours.

Recover from the surgery.",How to Fix a Crooked Nose2," Rhinoplasties are fairly common medical procedures in the United States and you are likely to find a number of qualified surgeons in your area that can conduct the surgery.Meet with the surgeon to discuss your medical history and whether or not you are a good candidate to undergo the rhinoplasty procedure.
You may have a medical reason to pursue surgery, such as obstruction of the nasal passages.
Signs of obstruction include a feeling of fullness, stuffiness, congestion, or complete blockage. Straightening your nose may correct impaired breathing and structural deficits of the nose, and may even improve your sleep.
Septoplasty is the definitive treatment for those with deviated nasal septum.

, Before you can undergo the procedure, your doctor will conduct a complete physical examination to ensure that you are healthy enough to undergo surgery and that the procedure will actually benefit you.The doctor will likely run a series of blood tests to ensure you are healthy enough for the procedure.
The doctor will look at the thickness of your skin and the strength of the cartilage in your nose in order to determine what affect they may have on your results.

, As is the case with any surgery, rhinoplasty procedures are not without risk. You should be well aware of what could possibly happen and make sure you understand the likelihood of such complications. Ask your doctor to discuss the following possibilities with you:Recurring nosebleeds
Difficulty breathing through your nose
Pain, discoloration or numbness in your nose

, Before agreeing to a surgical procedure, ensure you and your doctor are on the same page regarding what the procedure entails and what you can expect as a result. Your doctor may inform you of limitations in the procedure or other elements that may play a role in the appearance of your nose.In some situations, the doctor may bring up the possibility of making a change to your chin as well, as smaller chins can draw attention to the nose.
It is important that you are open with your surgeon in order to make sure you aren’t disappointed by the results.

, Your surgeon may choose to use local anesthesia with sedation to conduct the surgery or he or she may choose to use general sedation to put you under throughout the procedure. You should discuss the benefits and risks of each with your surgeon in order to choose what is best for you.Local anesthesia and sedation usually involves numbing just the area around your nose and sedating you using a medication provided through an IV.
General anesthesia is generally received via a mask that you breath gas through until you are unconscious. General anesthesia requires a breathing tube to be inserted into your lungs through your mouth.

, You will wake up in a recovery room after the surgery and will need to lie with your head elevated for some time. You may experience congestion due to swelling in the hours you spend in the recovery room. Once you are released, you can return to normal life with a few limitations for the first few weeks:Avoid strenuous activity that elicits heavy breathing.
Take baths instead of showers to avoid wetting the bandages.
Avoid extreme facial expressions until the surgery site heals.

Determine if your crooked nose is a medical or an aesthetic issue.,
If your crooked nose is an aesthetic issue, consider leaving it alone.,
Gather the appropriate contouring shades of makeup.,
Draw straight lines down the sides of your nose.,
Use the lightest shade on the bridge of your nose.",How to Fix a Crooked Nose3," If your crooked nose is causing you problems with your breathing, you may have a deviated septum. If your crooked nose is a symptom of a medical condition that requires treatment, you should see a doctor about having it repaired.If you experience pain from time to time while breathing deeply, you may have a deviated septum that can be repaired surgically. Nasal obstruction is a reason for surgical intervention and can help with breathing better and sleeping better during the day and night.
Experiencing frequent nose bleeds is also a symptom of a deviated septum that requires treatment.
If you prefer to sleep on one side or have been told you make significant breathing noises as you sleep, you may have a deviated septum as well.

, If your crooked nose is only an aesthetic issue, you should consider leaving it alone. Using makeup to reduce the conspicuousness of your crooked nose may be enough.


Injections and surgery are both expensive and pose medical risks that may not be necessary if your nose issue is only a visual one.
Do not feel pressured to alter the way you look because of what others may think.
Consider that you may get the surgery and find that you prefer your old nose to the new one.

, Using makeup to make your nose look straighter will require the use of three different shades of contouring makeup. These shades are used to create the illusion of a straighter nose without actually changing your nose at all. You will need:One contouring shade that is two shades darker than your natural skin tone.
One the is only slightly darker than your natural skin tone.
One contouring shade that is two shades lighter than your skin tone.

, Using two shades of contouring makeup you can establish a straighter look to your nose by drawing straight lines down your nose that do not bend where your nose does.Draw two straight lines down the sides of your nose with the darkest shade of contouring makeup.
Draw lines outside those dark lines with the medium shade of contouring makeup.

, The bridge of your nose often serves as an extended base to the nose and can help establish a straight appearance by creating a relation between the bridge of your nose and the tip.Apply the highlight makeup to the center of the bridge of your nose to draw it toward the straightened lined you established with the dark shades.
The combination of these shades will create the illusion of a straighter nose.

Manage your expectations.",How to Get Liposuction," Even though liposuction is a relatively minor procedure, there are still some risks involved – so candidates need to be in relatively good health. They should not have a compromised immune system, circulation problems, heart issues, lung disease, or chronic ailments like diabetes.Candidates should not be taking blood thinners (or must be able to stop taking them several weeks before the procedure), and they should not be allergic to lidocaine.;
, Liposuction is not a magic procedure that will turn an overweight body into a perfect body. It is a tool that can help you reach specific goals, with the aid of diet and exercise. If you don’t plan to also use diet and exercise to achieve your overall health and fitness goals, then liposuction may not be an effective choice for you.Typically, people get liposuction to target specific areas of fat deposits that do not respond well to diet and exercise.
Candidates should usually be within 25 pounds of their goal weight, and looking to contour their body a bit – not drastically change their overall appearance.

, Liposuction can be expensive, and insurance companies typically don’t cover any of the cost because they consider it an elective procedure. Liposuction normally costs between $3,000 and $10,000, depending on the location on the body, the doctor chosen, and the extent of the procedure.Make sure you can afford this type of expense before you commit to getting liposuction.

, Start looking for a plastic surgeon by doing some online research. You can find reviews and summaries online that outline other people’s experiences with similar procedures. Find a doctor in your area who has a lot of experience with the specific kind of procedure you’re interested in.Be sure to check the doctor’s website and follow up with an in-person consultation to make sure you are a good match before you take the process any further.
Don’t be afraid to shop around with several different doctors. It’s important to compare price, experience, and bedside manner to find the doctor that you are most comfortable with.

, In the United States, the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) is the governing body that qualifies any cosmetic or plastic surgeon to practice this specific field of medicine. You need to find a surgeon who is ABPS certified.Your doctor’s credentials should be clearly listed on their professional website.
Additionally, you can look for the distinction of holding a Certificate of Advanced Education in Cosmetic Surgery given by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS).
In Canada, the equivalent of an ABPS certification is approval by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.
Other countries should have similar board certifications that you should look for.

, A great resource for you to find the best plastic surgeon is often your family, friends, and acquaintances. If you know someone who has had liposuction (or another cosmetic procedure), ask them what they thought about their experience and whether they recommend their doctor.If you have friends who are doctors, you can also ask them for a recommendation.
Or ask your general practitioner doctor for a referral to a plastic surgeon they know of and trust.

, Make sure that you take your doctor’s orders seriously and follow all pre-op instructions to the letter. Your doctor may ask you to refrain from eating or drinking for a certain period before the procedure.This may also include taking any prescribed medications that your doctor recommends, or adjusting any doses of medication you may currently take.
You should also avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs, or herbal supplements as they can increase bleeding during the procedure.

, If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking as soon as you can before the procedure. Smoking can cause additional complications during the surgery – like problems with blood circulation. Smokers are also at a higher risk of chest infection after receiving anesthesia.At the very least, try not to smoke for several days before the procedure.

, After your procedure, you may feel a little bit groggy from the anesthetic. It’s important that you don’t try to drive yourself home in this condition, so ask a friend or family member to pick you up and take you home.Make sure you ask someone you trust to take care of you since you may be feeling a bit under the weather and foggy-headed.

, Remember that not all of the results of the procedure will be immediately visible post-op. It can take 3-6 months for the full effect to show. Even though some fat has been removed, it is often replaced by fluids and swelling. It takes time to heal from the procedure and see the finished product.Try not to get disappointed if your body doesn’t look exactly how you imagined immediately after the procedure.

Remain patient with yourself.",How to Use Self Hypnosis to Quit Smoking," Unlike the myths in popular culture, hypnosis doesn’t render you unconscious, and you cannot be forced to do anything against your will while under hypnosis.


Hypnosis first encourages you to relax. Relaxation is often achieved by deep breathing and visualization exercises. If a trained hypnotherapist is helping you, they may speak very softly and slowly to you. If you are on your own, you may find a hypnosis CD or soundtrack with relaxing noises helpful.Once relaxed, hypnosis provides statements and suggestions to help you change your behavior. It is thought that the hypnotic state makes you more receptive to embracing suggestions.Hypnosis helps you achieve focus. While in a hypnotic state, ideally you will focus only on the goal that you want to accomplish. This enhanced focus can help you accept the suggestions and prepare you to work for your goal.;
, Hypnosis can’t make you do something you don’t want to do. It cannot give you a “secret password” that makes you never want to smoke again. It can, however, help you focus, concentrate, and change your behaviors.


Hypnosis works best for people who are suggestible. If your personality is very resistant to new ideas or changes, or if you find it difficult to suspend disbelief, hypnosis may not be a good fit for you.
Hypnosis relies on your own belief that the treatment will work. Hypnosis will only help you make changes that you actually want to make.For self-hypnosis to help you, you must be committed to quitting smoking.

, Ideally, it should be free of all distractions: no TV, no cell-phones, no other people. You should feel comfortable and relaxed in this location.


If you can, avoid lying on a bed, as you may end up falling asleep instead of entering a hypnotic state. A comfortable chair or recliner may be more helpful to keep you relaxed but awake.

, Hypnosis may be more effective if the suggestions you use are direct statements, rather than abstract questions. Rather than asking yourself something like “Why do I smoke?” consider using statements such as “Smoking harms me. I do not want to harm myself.”Write them down and keep them.


Try to keep your affirmations reasonable. A statement such as “It will be easy to quit smoking” or “I will never want to smoke again” may not be very effective. Instead, consider something like “I respect my body and will not damage it by smoking.”Affirmations that are phrased in the present tense, such as “I do not want to smoke,” may be more helpful to you as they keep your attention on what is happening at the present moment.

, Most people are not immediately skilled at self-hypnosis. Even if the technique does work for you, it may take quite some time for you to become fully comfortable practicing self-hypnosis. Stay patient with yourself and keep trying.

, While some people can stop smoking after only one session with a clinical hypnotist, for most people it may take several sessions for the technique to work.This is doubly true if you are practicing self-hypnosis, as you may need to experiment and practice before you are able to effectively use it.

, While many people have found self-hypnosis useful for helping them quit smoking, it may not work for everyone. Sometimes, seeing a trained clinical hypnotherapist can help even if self-hypnosis has not worked for you.


The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis maintains a database of certified professional hypnotherapists. It is highly recommended that you visit a professional, as clinical hypnosis requires training to be administered safely and effectively.

, Go to the private, quiet space you previously identified. Sit and make yourself comfortable.


Eliminate as many distractions as possible. Wear comfortable clothing, don’t eat a heavy meal just beforehand, and schedule your self-hypnosis at a time when you know you’re unlikely to be interrupted.If you live with others, ask them not to disturb you for a little while.

, This should preferably be a wall or a ceiling that does not have distracting details. Take long, deep, slow breaths, breathing in through your nostrils and breathing out through your mouth.

, Silently repeat to yourself that your eyes want to close, and that you want to relax. Close your eyes. Keep breathing deeply.

, We often hold a lot of tension in our bodies that we’re not even aware of. Allow your body to completely relax, becoming loose and heavy in the chair.


Continue to breathe deeply, allowing your attention to focus on the movement of your chest, lungs, and diaphragm.
If you have trouble relaxing, simply continue your deep breathing and try not to focus too much on the fact that you’re having trouble. The more you focus on not relaxing, the more stressed you may become.

, Use a soothing, soft tone of voice as you repeat your affirmations. Don’t be harsh or angry toward yourself. Hypnosis is more likely to work if you are positive about the process.

, This image should be positive and represent you achieving your objective. Perhaps you could visualize yourself running a marathon without running out of breath, or perhaps you could picture yourself surrounded by your friends and family who are proud of your achievement.


While focusing on this visualization, repeat your affirmations to yourself. Continue this for about 30 seconds.

, Once you have completed your affirmations, tell yourself that you are coming out of your relaxed state. You are becoming light and energetic, and returning to your surroundings. Count from 1 to 5, then open your eyes. Stretch and take a few deep breaths.

, Ideally, you will be able to practice self-hypnosis every day. Even if that isn’t possible, try to be consistent with your sessions and practice at least a few times a week.

, You may experience some difficulty with self-hypnosis techniques at first. You may even find that self-hypnosis is not effective for you to stop smoking. Be accepting and kind toward yourself, and don’t focus on the negative.

Try the nudge method.,
Mobilize your support network.,
Think before checking in.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Point out small victories.,
Focus on the whole person.",How to Stop Your Boyfriend from Smoking1," Your boyfriend knows that smoking is bad for him, and he probably wants to quit already. Thus, it won’t really be helpful to recite facts about diseases, life expectancy, etc. In fact, telling someone to stop smoking just makes them do it more.Instead, you may want to focus on trends in people's behavior and the role of addiction in smoking.
Point out that smoking rates have steadily been going down over the past several decades, and that many people have successfully quit.
Since many people start smoking to feel like they are part of a group, knowing that their behavior is increasingly uncommon may encourage them to quit.
Pointing out that smoking is an addiction may help your boyfriend realize that he does not have control over his life. This probably does not appeal to him, so he may try to quit in order to be more autonomous.;
, This means that the same strategies won’t work for everyone, but it also means that different people will want different levels and kinds of support. Talk to your boyfriend to find out what kind of help he needs.


Your boyfriend may have an indirect way of indicating that he wants to talk about quitting. Pay attention to the topics he brings up—advice from a doctor, a family member who is pregnant, someone else who quit—to find an opening., Maybe smoking laws or cigarette taxes are changing in your area. Ask your boyfriend how he feels about these, and use this as a transition to ask about his own habits.You: I read in an article today that the city is banning smoking in restaurants.
Him: That's good. I hate eating when my food tastes smoky.
You: I'm surprised to hear you say that. Will it be difficult for you to go that long without smoking?
Him: No, I've actually been trying to cut down.
You: Really? How can I help you do that?

, It can be difficult to find the right balance between encouraging your boyfriend to quit and behaving in a way that he may perceive as taking away his choices. Lawyers and economists say the nudge method can incentivize change while still letting people decide for themselves.The nudge method works like this: tell your boyfriend to open a savings account into which he'll deposit the money he would otherwise spend on cigarettes. (A jar on the kitchen counter works, too.)
At the end of a predetermined period, ask him if he has smoked. If he hasn't, he gets the money. If he has, the money has to be deposited to charity.
Some versions of this method include the requirement that the charity be for a cause your boyfriend does not support!
If he has a friend who is also trying to quit (or if you are), they can make it into a competition. Whoever goes longer without smoking gets to keep the money, and whoever gives in first has to donate to a charity of the winner's choice.

, If it is OK with your boyfriend, talk to your friends and family members about his plans, and encourage them to be supportive. Remind your boyfriend that doctors are part of your support network as well, and ask if he has considered making an appointment to talk about smoking cessation medication., Some smokers will want you to ask about their progress every day to hold them accountable, while others will find this habit invasive and counterproductive. Ask your boyfriend whether regular check-ins will be helpful or harmful for him., Get your boyfriend talking about his experiences—why he started smoking, how it makes him feel, why he wants to quit, what makes quitting difficult, etc. These will give you a better sense of his relationship to cigarettes, and it might even help him make some connections he hadn’t made before.You: Why did you start smoking?
Him: Because the older kids at school did.
You: What about now? There aren't any older kids around.
Him: I guess it just became a habit.
You: Did you think you would smoke forever?
Him: No, but quitting always seemed too hard.
You: You can do it! Do you want me to help you come up with a plan?

, For a smoker, even going a day without cigarettes is an accomplishment. Recognize it as such, and use it as evidence that your boyfriend is capable of going without cigarettes. These small victories can increase confidence.

, Don’t let the quitting process become the entirety of your relationship. Even if he does want you to check in about his progress, ask him about his day and how he is more generally. It shouldn’t be just about whether or not he smoked today.

Buy an e-cigarette kit.,
Charge the battery for the e-cigarette.,
Screw in the liquid cartridge.,
Be aware of the difference between smoking a cigarette and smoking an e-cigarette.,
Do a “primer puff”.,
Draw slowly and steadily on the e-cigarette.,
Hold the vapor for three to five seconds.,
Wait at least 30 seconds to feel the effects of the nicotine.",How to Smoke an E–Cigarette," If you are new to e-cigarettes, you may want to start with an e-cigarette kit, which can be purchased online. Many light to medium smokers go for a rechargeable starter kit, instead of a disposable one, as the e-cigarette can be used many times and is more cost-effective.An e-cigarette starter kit will contain a rechargeable battery, a charger, and a nicotine liquid cartridge. The nicotine liquid can come in a variety of flavors and different levels of nicotine. If you are a smoker who is trying to quit, you may go for a low level of nicotine and a flavor you enjoy tasting in your mouth to limit your nicotine intake. You can get a starter kit with several different flavor cartridges so you can try different flavors and find the ones you enjoy.
Most e-cigarette starter kits cost about $40-$100. Consider investing a kit with a higher price point if you plan to smoke every day or at least several times a week. Going for a cheap kit may mean lower quality and poor flavor choices.;
, Because your e-cigarette runs on lithium batteries, it is important that you fully charge the battery before using it. Many e-cigarettes will come with the battery partly or fully charged. Make sure the battery is ready to go by placing it in the charger and waiting for the charged signal or light to come on.Most batteries for e-cigarettes are rechargeable and can last up to 250-300 uses. Batteries often last longer when they are recharged and used regularly.
Avoid placing the batteries in direct sunlight and heat. Do not get them wet or drop them often against a hard surface, as this will significantly reduce their lifespan.
Try to charge the battery before it is completely drained and always store your batteries fully charged. Storing the batteries with less than 50% charge left can drain their use in the long term.

, Once the battery is fully charge for the e-cigarette, take it off of the charger. Then, take the liquid cartridge and screw it into the slot on the e-cigarette. Your e-cigarette may come with pre-filled liquid cartridges or you may buy e-liquid that you can then drop into the liquid cartridge.Pay attention to the liquid in the cartridge so you can note when the liquid cartridge is close to running out and requires changing. If you are planning on being a regular e-cigarette user, you may want to keep several extra liquid cartridges on hand for easy replacement.

, If you usually smoke traditional cigarettes, you may be used to taking quick, short drags and smoking several cigarettes at a time or chain smoking. When smoking an e-cigarette, it is important that you learn how to take long and slow draws until the vapor fills your mouth. You should also avoid chain smoking an e-cigarette. Only take about three to seven draws at a time and take a break. This will allow a few minutes for the e-cigarette to cool and to give your throat a rest.Smoking too much of the e-cigarette at a time or smoking the e-cigarette for too long can lead to throat irritation and soreness as well as taste bud burnout, also known as “vaper’s tongue”. Give your throat and mouth a rest between e-cigarette sessions so you do not develop any irritation or numbness after smoking.

, To warm up the e-cigarette, you can start by doing a primer puff. This is a quick inhale into the mouth of the e-cigarette to heat up the coil. You should not pull any vapor out of the e-cigarette, just get the e-cigarette primed for your first draw., When you inhale, take a slow and steady draw until the vapor fills your mouth. Do not draw the vapor into your lungs, or swallow the vapor until the vapor has first filled your mouth.

, Once you have held the vapor in your mouth for three to five seconds, you can then inhale it into your lungs. Then, exhale it slowly out of your nose or mouth.Unlike traditional cigarettes, you can absorb the nicotine from the e-cigarette into your body through the mucus membranes in your mouth, as well as your lungs and nose.

, When smoking traditional cigarettes, you usually wait about eight seconds for the “hit” of nicotine. With e-cigarettes, nicotine absorption occurs more slowly through your mucus membranes and can take up to 30 seconds to “hit” you. Though you may need to get used to waiting a bit longer for your nicotine fix, it is easy to get used to after using the e-cigarette a few times.Some smokers crave a distinct hit of nicotine to the back of their throat and may feel that e-cigarettes do not provide a strong enough throat hit. Often the longer you drag on the e-cigarette, and the more vapor produced in your mouth, the stronger the throat hit will be.
The flavoring in the e-liquid can also affect the amount of vapor produced. You may want to switch to a more tobacco-based flavor if you are seeking a stronger throat hit with your e-cigarette. As well, you may want to try an e-liquid with higher nicotine level for a more distinct throat hit. Keep in mind a higher nicotine level can lead to prolonged smoking and health issues like cancer and respiratory disease."

If he wants to set a date, make sure he knows that he has not failed if he hasn’t fully quit by this time., Many people will experience things like insomnia, inability to concentrate, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and depression. These usually go away in a week or two. By reminding your boyfriend that they are temporary, you’ll help him believe that he can get through them., Many people take several attempts to quite smoking. If your boyfriend has a relapse, encourage him to learn from the experience so that next time he can avoid whatever caused him to smoke next time. Smoking is a learned behavior, and so is quitting., Relapses can be frustrating, so demonstrate to your boyfriend that it is only a matter of time before he tries again—and before he succeeds. In fact, most people who quit smoking and then have a relapse try again soon."

Exercise.",How to Stop Your Boyfriend from Smoking3," People smoke for many reasons, one of which is alleviating boredom. Your boyfriend will need some sort of substitute for this behavior. Consider keeping the following around:Hard candy to suck on
Straws to chew on
Cut up fruits and veggies

, Use quitting as an excuse to engage in more activities together. Make dinner together, go to the movies, or check out a museum—anything to help take your boyfriend’s mind off of quitting., One of the activities that you engage in together should definitely be something physical. Exercise can alleviate many aspects of the quitting process, including the following:Anxiety
Depression
Irritability
Weight gain

"
"
Don’t take it personally.,
Make your home and car smoke-free spaces.,
Avoid places where there will be smoking.,
Know your limits.",How to Stop Your Boyfriend from Smoking4," People who are trying to quit smoking will often be irritable. Know that your boyfriend’s behavior is not about you. However, you certainly have the right to call him out on rude or unkind behavior and to get away from him entirely if this irritability becomes full-fledged abuse.

, This is especially important if you live together. If your boyfriend’s behavior exposes you to second-hand smoke, both of you are at risk for serious health problems. Moreover, people who don’t smoke at home are likelier to quit.Don’t keep lighters or ash trays in your home, either—this will just remind your boyfriend of what he’s avoiding., This will not only further protect your own health, but also—by eliminating potentially triggering settings—help your boyfriend avoid the behavior.

, How important is it to you that your boyfriend quit smoking? While there are steps you can take to help him quit, you will need to think about how you will proceed if he has no interest in doing so.


Think about whether his smoking outweighs all of his other good qualities. Most people have serious flaws, and some experts suggest that having dealbreakers is not really conducive to happiness.The exception here is a serious moral or ethical shortcoming. Smoking does not really fall into this category, but it can prevent a long and healthy life. If losing your boyfriend to health problems down the road sounds too painful, smoking might just be too much for your relationship to overcome.
If his smoking is a dealbreaker, he needs to be aware of it. It's not fair giving him an ultimatum he doesn't know about. Tell him that you cannot be with a smoker, but that you are confident he can quit and want to help him do so.

If you do not know where to start, both the American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Society for Plastic Surgery have directories on their website., You probably wouldn't let a surgeon who specializes in knee surgery operate on your shoulder. The same goes for cosmetic surgery. Dr. X may be the greatest at performing a tummy tuck, but if they are inexperienced with face lifts, choose someone else.

, Any licensed doctor can call themselves plastic surgeons. To be certain that your surgeon is qualified, choose one who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) or the equivalent organization in your country. Some plastic surgeons also belong to professional associations, which ensure that they are qualified plastic surgeons and follow the highest standards. These organizations allow you to search for certified doctors on their websites. You can also check through the American Board of Medical Specialties’ website.Reputable boards and societies include:


The American Board of Plastic Surgery. ABPS certifications issued after 1995 must be renewed every 10 years so make sure you’re your doctor’s certification isn’t out of date.The American Society of Plastic SurgeonsThe American Society for Dermatologic Surgery
The American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists
American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery

, Don't just assume that the doctor has a clean record because they are currently practicing. The licensing board in your state should list any malpractice judgments against the doctor, plus any disciplinary actions taken against them.Find a link to your state's medical board here.

, Your general physician has plenty of contacts in the medical field and will likely be able to steer you towards qualified physicians while cautioning you away from those with shady credentials.

, This is a non-committal meeting that allows you to talk to a surgeon. You can address any concerns you have about the surgery, ask questions about the procedure, and receive personalized recommendations. It will also let you understand if a particular surgeon is better suited for you.


The doctor may charge you for the consultation. Some doctors charge a fee but waive it once you choose to have surgery with them. Ask when making the initial appointment.

, You want to make sure that you understand what kind of procedure you’re about to have so that you understand what to look for in a surgeon. You should search for:


How the procedure is performed
What you will need to do to prepare for the surgery
Risks and side effects of the surgery
Postoperative treatment and medication
Recovery time
Different variations of the procedure

, Once you have met with your potential surgeon, be sure to ask many questions. Do not take their word at face value. Hesitance or inability to answer your questions is a sign that they are not qualified. Some questions you can ask include:


Are you board certified? Which board? When were you certified?
How often do you do this particular procedure?
What type of anesthesia will I receive?
What is recovery like? How long does it take to recover?
What are the risks and complications? How do I handle these complications?What are your facilities like? Do you have hospital admitting privileges? Do you operate in a licensed facility?

Only have surgery done in a licensed facility or hospital. Hospital admitting privileges will ensure that you will get proper care if something goes wrong during surgery. Make sure the doctor has hospital privileges for the desired procedure. Even if the procedure is going to be performed in-office, verify they have operating privileges in an accredited hospital for that same procedure., If possible, ask them if you can see where they will be doing surgery. They may be able to show you the room or suite where you will have it done. You can see the equipment they are using as well as the state of cleanliness. Ask to see the accreditation for the facility.


If the operation room looks dirty, poorly lit, or disorganized, it may be a sign that your doctor is not legitimate.

, The best way to get to know a surgeon’s work is to see it in action. Most surgeons will keep a book of photographs taken before and after surgery. Take your time to flip through the whole book to see if the work is close to what you want for yourself., Meet with several qualified plastic surgeons. You want to be sure you're comfortable with the surgeon who performs your cosmetic surgery. Furthermore, you want to receive multiple consultations to make sure that the medical advice you are receiving is valid.

, If you are still uncertain which doctors to choose, you should make a list for each doctor. Record what you liked, what you didn’t like, and what you are uncertain about for each doctor. It is fine to call the doctor’s office to ask additional questions if there is something you are confused about.

, You want to be relaxed with your choice of doctor. Do not choose a doctor that scares you or makes you feel uncomfortable. While you should not make this decision based solely on your emotions, don’t discount your intuition.

, There are various websites that allow people to rate and post comments about their experiences with certain doctors. Check out the ratings for the doctors you are considering. Look for overall satisfaction, and don’t trust only a single review. Instead, see what people are consistently saying about the doctor.Try to use a site that verifies its ratings to make sure that the reviews are real., Make sure that you know where your money is going. Plastic surgery can be expensive. Track your expenses carefully to make sure that you are not getting swindled. There are many different costs associated with plastic surgery, so be sure to get an accurate breakdown of what you will have to pay. Costs vary widely based on the type of procedure, your risk level, the facility, and your location.



The surgeon’s fee: This is the cost of the surgery. More experienced surgeons may charge more.

The hospital or facility fee: This covers the cost of the operating suite. This may also include any overnight stays in a facility.

The anesthesia fee: Often, anesthesia is charged separately from the rest of the procedure. You may have to pay the anesthesia fee separately.Medication: You may have to take special medication after the surgery. Be sure to ask about the costs beforehand.
If your surgeon asks for cash only, especially up front, it is a big red flag. Your doctor may not be legitimate., There are certain aggressive tactics a surgeon can use to try to coerce you into a bad decision. Don't let anyone — including your surgeon, friends, family, and significant others — decide if you should have the plastic surgery procedure.


Be wary if doctors are hesitant to show qualifications. You should see your doctor’s degrees and certifications on the wall of their office. If you don’t see them, ask the doctor to show you.
Most doctors have a specific specialty or type of operation that they excel at. If a doctor tries to convince you that they specialize in all types of plastic surgery, be suspicious. They may be trying to scam you.
Don't be swayed by coupons or discounts. Plastic surgery is expensive. Surgeons who offer frequent specials may be cutting costs in ways that can hurt you.
You should speak to a doctor at the consultation, not a nurse or an assistant. If your doctor doesn’t appear, politely ask if you can wait to see them. If they don’t show up at all, it’s a red flag., While you may be open to the idea of more plastic surgery, your appointments should be about the specific procedure you want now. If a plastic surgeon tries to convince you that you need more surgery or that you should have multiple procedures at once, they may just be trying to squeeze money out of you.

Anticipate stress.",How to Stop Smoking Instantly," This is the most common, and seemingly the easiest, method for quitting smoking because it requires no outside aid. You simply stop smoking and commit yourself to being smoke-free. While those who quit abruptly are more successful than those who quit gradually,quitting without the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is rarely successful — only three to five percent of people who quit cold turkey stick with it.If you choose to go without NRT, the success of going cold turkey will depend entirely on your willpower.


Those who are able to quit cold turkey may have a genetic advantage — 20 percent of people may have a genetic mutation that reduces the pleasurable effects of nicotine.To increase your chances of success when quitting cold turkey, try to take up new activities to replace smoking (particularly something that will occupy your hands or mouth, like knitting or chewing sugarless gum); avoid situations and people that you associate with smoking; call a friend or a quitting hotline (such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW); set goals and reward yourself.Consider having a backup strategy in case you are unable to go cold turkey.
This is the easiest strategy to implement, but the most difficult to carry out successfully.;
, NRT is one of the most successful tools for treating smoking addiction, with a 20% success rate. By chewing gums, eating lozenges, or wearing patches, you get the nicotine their bodies crave while gradually lowering the dosage, eventually weaning them off nicotine. In the process, you will move away from addictive behavior and towards healthy activities.You will be more likely to quit if you stop smoking at once and then begin using NRTs as opposed to gradually smoking fewer cigarettes and using NRTs. In one study, 22% of abrupt smokers remained abstinent after six months and only 15.5% of smokers who gradually cut back over two weeks remained abstinent after six months.Nicotine gum, patches, lozenges are often available over-the-counter and can be found at your local drug store.
This strategy requires some financial investment for the purchasing of gum, patches, or lozenges.
Nicotine replacement therapy is less successful for people whose metabolisms quickly process nicotine. Chat with your physician about your metabolism and the nicotine replacement therapy., Your doctor can prescribe medications such as bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) and varenicline (Chantix) that are designed to help curb your cravings. Talk with your physician about the side effects of these medications and whether they will work for you.Bupropion has been shown to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of smoking cessation programs for individuals who metabolize nicotine quickly.
Check with your insurance company to make sure that these medications are covered by your prescription plan.

, Work with a counselor or therapist to address the underlying emotional issues that drive your smoking. This will help you figure out the emotional or situational triggers that push you to smoke. A mental health professional can also help you develop a long-term plan for addressing your addiction.Check with your insurance provider to see whether counseling is covered by your health plan.

, There are a number of different alternative practices that can help you quit smoking. These range from herbal and mineral supplements to hypnosis and practices like meditation. Although some smokers have found success using these methods, there is limited scientific evidence supporting them.Many smokers ingest Vitamin C candies and lozenges which they believe help curb their cravings.Meditation can be a useful practice to help distract your mind for the desire to smoke.

, Although you may find that one strategy on its own helps you quit, you may need to employ multiple strategies to remain smoke-free. Your initial strategy may be untenable and require you to utilize a backup, or you might find that it is easier to manage your cravings using two methods simultaneously.Consult your physician to make sure that you are not combining medications in a way that may be unhealthy.
Consider using an alternative method with a more established strategy.

, Remove anything from your work or home that is associated with smoking. This includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, or any other smoking device. It is important to not have temptations in your personal space that may undermine your goal of not smoking.Avoid smoking triggers like bars or other places where smoking is permitted.
Hang out with non-smokers.

, Do things to distract you from smoking and take your mind off of your cravings. Start a new hobby or spend more time with your friends. Being physically active will reduce stress and restrain your cravings.Keep your hands busy by playing with small objects like coins or paperclips, and keep your mouth busy by blowing through straws, chewing gum, or eating a healthy snack like carrot sticks.
Find activities to do with non-smokers.
Avoid activities that are triggers or where smoking will occur.

, Incentivize your good behavior by treating yourself with something you enjoy. It is likely that quitting smoking will make you feel sad, increasing your craving to smoke. Instead, try activating the pleasure centers of brain with a something that you enjoy. Eat one of your favorite foods or enjoy a hobby.Be careful not to replace one addictive behavior with another.
Take the money you save by not smoking and use it to reward yourself, buying something nice, treating yourself to a movie or a nice dinner, or even saving long-term for a trip.

, Remember that quitting smoking is a difficult process and that it takes time. Take it one day at time and do not be overly harsh on yourself for giving in to your cravings. You are going to have setbacks in efforts to quit and it is important to remember that you are a part of the process.Concentrate on staying smoke-free for short periods like a day or even a few hours. Thinking long-term about quitting (such as ""I can never smoke again"") can be overwhelming and lead to anxiety that may trigger cravings.
Practice mindfulness techniques, such as meditation, that help you focus your mind on right now and the success you are having in the moment.

, Quitting with the support of friends and family is a much easier task than doing it entirely on your own. Talk to others when you are struggling with your cravings and let them know how they can help you stay smoke-free. Quitting smoking does not have to be your burden alone.Talk with your friends and family when you are putting together your plan for quitting. Their input my help you develop your strategy.

, If your efforts to quickly quit smoking fail, you might want to try a long term approach that requires some planning and patience. Planning ahead can help you understand the obstacles associated with quitting and better form strategies that will overcome them.


Consult your doctor about creating a plan to quit smoking.
There are many websites and “quitlines” that can help you develop a plan.

, Think about why you want to quit and what that means for you. Weigh the pros and cons of quitting and ask yourself if you are ready for the commitment. Talk with your friends and family about your decision.What are the potential health risks of continued smoking?
What is the financial impact of your dependence on smoking?
What is the impact on your family and friends?
Write down a list of the reasons you want to quit so that you can reference it later when want to smoke.

, Choose a date to quit and stick with it. Make it far enough in the future that you have to prepare but not so far that you lose interest — try giving yourself two weeks. A firm deadline for stopping will help you mentally prepare and give you a concrete timeline. Adhering to a strict regimen is essential to sticking with your plan and overcoming your dependence.Avoid moving back your quit date. This will set a bad precedent and make it harder to adhere to future start dates.

, Research different strategies for quitting and consult with your doctor about the methods that might work best for you. Weigh the pros and cons of different strategies and how they might impact your life. Consider which methods you are realistically capable of adhering to.


Consider whether you want to quit cold turkey, use medication, or try a therapy. Each has its own pros and cons.

, Throw away any smoking paraphernalia that might trigger your addiction. Keep a log of your smoking activity leading up to your quit day, as this may help you identify the times you tend to smoke (such as right after a meal) and you can make sure you have NRTs, medications, or other strategies prepared for those times.Get plenty of rest and avoid stressful situations if you can.
Although it may seem like a good idea to try starting other new healthy habits at the same time, they might cause you extra stress and undermine your efforts to quit smoking. Do one thing at a time.

, Smoking cessation is a significant lifestyle change. With it comes anger, anxiety, depression, and frustration. Plan strategies to help you cope with these undesirable, yet expected, difficulties. Get supplies ready for yourself (medication, NRTs, phone numbers, etc.). See your doctor if these feelings last longer than a month."

Your doctor knows you as well as the surgeons and clinics operating in your area so will be to give you a good idea of what is available. You should always talk to a doctor if you are considering any cosmetic surgery so you can get a clear picture of the potential risks as well as benefits.


Your doctor may be able to advise you on alternatives to surgery, depending on your situation.
Your doctor will know the reputation of surgeons and clinics locally.;
, Your doctor may give you some leads and recommendations to follow-up, but you can broaden your search by looking through the online database of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS). This is the professional body that all reputable surgeons should be signed up with.The Association’s website has a useful tool which you can use to search for surgeons by region: http://baaps.org.uk/?Itemid=200

You can also search for specific surgeons by name.

, Once you have drawn up a list of potential surgeons, you should arrange to visit some clinics and hospitals to have a look around and talk to some people there. The purpose of your visits should be to find out as much information as you can about the place, the procedure, and the surgeons who will carry it out. Ask lots of questions, as a reputable clinic or hospital should be happy to give you full and frank answers. Some questions you should ask include:


What qualifications and experience does the surgeon have?
How often has the surgeon carried out the procedure you want?
What care can you expect to receive after the operation?
How much will everything cost?, You will probably have already checked to see if the clinic and surgeon are registered, but when you go in to talk to staff at the clinic and hospital you should make sure that whoever you talk to is registered too. You might talk to a doctor or nurse, but whoever it is they should be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) or the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).It’s important that you know the person who gives you information and advises you about the surgery is a fully qualified and registered professional.

, When you are considering different clinics and hospitals, it’s recommended that you find out about the variety of surgeries that are performed there. The BAAPS suggests choosing a place that houses a variety of different surgeries, not just cosmetic surgery.


A hospital or clinic that performs a variety of surgeries will have more extensive and comprehensive facilities than one that only does cosmetic surgery., You should carefully consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of choosing a clinic or hospital that is local to you. You may have preferred a clinic that was quite a distance away, but think about how you will feel after the operation. Generally you won’t want to travel far to get home after the operation., When you have narrowed down your shortlist of clinics and hospitals you should check that the centres are registered with the Care Quality Commission. The CQC is the independent regulator of health services in England. You can ask the clinic or hospital to show you their registration certificate, or look them up on the CQC website’s database of providers.


Access the CQC directory here: http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/how-get-and-re-use-cqc-information-and-data#directory

If a clinic cannot provide proof of its registered status, the CQC advises you not to use them.
Once you have found the clinic or hospital on the CQC directory you can check the inspection reports., Before making a decision you should always hold a full consultation with the actual surgeon who would perform the surgery. The clinic or hospital should offer this to you so be sure to take them up on the offer. Go to the consultation with a list of questions that you want to ask the surgeon.You should ask at least the following questions about the procedure:


How long will it take?
What anaesthetic will be used?
What pain can you expect?
What are the risks?
What are the potential complications?
How long will the results last?
How long should be recovery period be?You can also ask to speak to people who have had the procedure with this surgeon previously.

, When you talk to the doctor you should also take the opportunity to find out more about their credentials and record. You should ask how many times they have performed the procedure, and how often they perform it.Ask if the surgeon is an NHS Consultant in the relevant speciality. This is not an essential qualification, but it is an indication of a high-level of expertise and experience.Check the surgeon holds a Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS).
Check he is registered with the GMC and BAAPS., Once you have all the information on your surgeons, give yourself a few weeks as a “cooling off period.” In this time you can consider carefully whether or not you want to go through with the procedure. If you have doubts or are still unclear on any aspects, don’t rush into a decision. Make sure you can answer the following questions before committing to a decision:


Do I completely understand what the procedure will do to me?
Is my expectation sensible?
Am I expecting reasonable improvement or perfection?
Do I completely understand the risks and what might go wrong?
If it did go wrong, could I cope?"

Keep an eye out for problems at work or school.,
Track legal and financial troubles.,
Count the lies and inconsistencies.,
Be wary of sudden changes in behavior.",How to Spot Drug Abuse1," Typically, the first sign of a problem is a drastic drop in attendance or engagement at school or work. Maybe you learn that your teen has been skipping school. Or, you are asked to repeatedly lie to your roommate’s boss about their “family emergency.” Sudden changes in their functioning suggest that something else, possibly drugs, has become a priority for the person., If your loved one has recently gotten into trouble with the law or other authority figures, take note—especially if this is out of character for the person. Also, pay attention to your loved one seemingly needing more money than usual. You might have to lend them money often or hear of others doing so.

Family members may have to bail abusers out of jail or get them out of trouble in other ways., Drug addiction and lying are like two peas in a pod. A person who is abusing drugs frantically tries to cover their tracks, but you’ll often notice gaps in their stories or excuses. For instance, maybe you believed your husband when he told you he’s been working late, except you bumped into his coworker who contradicted his story., A hot, then cold demeanor may be common in a person who is abusing drugs. You might notice your loved one suddenly becoming secretive and locking their bedroom door. They may stay out late. Or, you might catch them hiding things or acting suspiciously.

Other changes common to drug abuse include suddenly sleeping and eating too much or too little. In addition, your loved one may have trouble remembering things, seem paranoid or distrustful, speak differently (slurring), or act aggressively."

, Perhaps everyone has been lecturing you about smoking, but you don't really understand the hazards yourself. Browse online about the benefits of quitting cigarettes on helpful sites like Cancer.org or the CDC. Knowing just what you stand to gain from quitting might inspire you to move forward with actually quitting.


Connect with real life stories. Read about people who live with the devastating effects of smoking.

, According to the American Lung Association, there are more than 600 ingredients inside a cigarette. These ingredients combine to form over 7,000 chemical when the cigarette is lit. 69 of those chemicals can cause cancer.Some of the ingredients in cigarettes and smoke are: tar, lead, acetone, arsenic, butane, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and formaldehyde.
Maybe you've always heard that you should stop smoking because it's bad for you. Now, you know exactly why cigarettes are unhealthy.

, When you smoke, you not only jeopardize your own health, but you also endanger the lives of others by exposing them to second-hand smoke.Second-hand smoke can cause cancer in your loved ones. Those around you are also at risk of becoming ill with colds and flus more often as well as having heart disease, respiratory problems, and even having trouble getting pregnant.
Studies have shown that parents who smoke often raise children who end up smoking, too. So, quitting today could make a difference in your kid's life tomorrow., This person's first-hand experience with smoking and quitting might inspire you to quit more than your family members' lectures. Ask the person to recommend a few useful strategies. They may even suggest or accompany you to a local support group.

, If this is one of the people who pressured you to quit, all the better. Make sure this person agrees to hold you accountable and offer encouragement once you decide to actually stop smoking.


Research shows that having some form of support when trying to quit an addiction can assist you in being more successful.Your support group can be there on days when you really want to reach for that cigarette. Phoning a friend or spending time with someone you care about can prevent you from relapsing.

, Even if you have not quite worked up the nerve to quit altogether, attending a few of these meetings and hearing the struggles and successes of others might be just what you need to take the next step towards quitting.

, Keep some essentials with you at all times. The following will help you anywhere you are:


Alternative ""cigarettes""
Cinnamon flavored gum
Mouthwash and dental floss to get the taste out of your mouth.
A pen, a small rock or string of beads to fill the place of the physical action of holding the cigarettes.
The phone number of someone who will support you during difficult moments.

, There are several over-the-counter nicotine replacement products that can help ease you out of smoking. There are types of patches, gums, lozenges, nasal sprays, inhalers or sublingual tablets that deliver smaller doses of nicotine into the body.


Side effects could include: nightmares, insomnia, and skin irritation for patches; mouth soreness, difficult breathing, hiccups, and jaw pain for gum; mouth and throat irritation and coughing for nicotine inhalers; throat irritation and hiccups for nicotine lozenge; and throat and nasal irritation as well as runny nose if the nasal spray is used.
E-cigarettes look like regular cigarettes, but they are operated by battery. An atomizer heats a solution of liquid, flavorings, and nicotine that creates a mist that is inhaled. E-cigarettes look promising for quitting, but there are some cautions. While they do not contain as many harmful chemicals as cigarettes, they do contain nicotine. For someone who doesn't really want to quit, this could be a good compromise for the moment.

, You need to become knowledgeable about your smoking habit in order to defeat it. Observe yourself for a day or two. Write down your specific smoking behaviors. This will help you later on.How many cigarettes are you smoking per day?
When are you smoking? Morning? After lunch? Evening?
For what reason are you smoking? To ease your nerves? To relax you before sleep?

, The American Cancer Society states that the quit date is a very significant, almost ceremonial, date. Choose a day within the coming month for you to officially stop smoking, and stick to it. This day can be a special day such as a birthday, a holiday, or maybe just a Monday.Mark the day in your calendar and alert all your friends so that they can prepare to encourage you on your journey. This symbolic ritual helps you to get yourself prepared mentally to no longer being a smoker. Count down each day and aim to become more confident about your decision.

, In the days or weeks before your quit date, you need to work out some details that can influence your success. Purchase any smoking cessation aids like patches or nicotine gum. See a doctor if you would prefer to try prescription medications.You need to find healthier habits to add to your life that meet the same objective as smoking does for you.Becoming more active physically is usually one upside to quitting smoking. This will also help you offset any sudden weight gain.
If you simply enjoy the oral sensation, pick up a bag of lollipops or straws that you can put in your mouth when a craving strikes. If you depend on smoking to relax, download a relaxation tape or calming music and start practicing meditation or yoga.

, Use rewards as a motivation to keep you from smoking. If you have something exciting to look forward to, it will encourage you not to smoke. Rewards can be big or small, as long as they are things you really want to work towards.Buy yourself an ice cream or cupcake for getting through the first day. Or, treat yourself to a relaxing massage once you go without smoking for a week.

, Make a plan to cut down smoking from two packs a day to one pack a day over the course of several weeks, two cigarettes at a time, for instance. It takes the pressure off of quitting when you don't really want to, and you benefit from cutting down and smoking less.You can try taking a few cigarettes out of each new pack you buy until you are taking out more and more to wean yourself off. Once you start smoking less you will be more prepared when your quit date arrives., Throw any remaining cigarettes away. Keep gum/water handy. When day one is done, remember that today and the next week are going to be really hard, but you made it! Remember to treat yourself!

, Make sure to brag to friends, family, and co-workers when you have conquered Day #2, Day #3, or even completed a full week of not smoking. Every bit of progress counts. Plus, their praise and encouragement will help you persist on the road to being smoke-free.


Studies have revealed that we are much more likely to commit and persist during a challenge if we broadcast our intentions socially.Log on to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or your personal blog and let the world know that you are making a commitment to quitting cigarettes. Think about it this way: you'll have an even bigger support group!

, This includes any big parties or outdoor eating events. Also, avoid your usual triggers for smoking such as drinking alcohol or coffee or taking a smoke break with co-workers. Keep busy and remind yourself with each passing hour and day that you are a non-smoker! You are doing it!Many of us have developed associations between smoking and other activities like drinking alcohol or coffee. Do what you can to avoid those things you associate with smoking during that first month, or for as long as it takes for you. Don't test yourself until you're ready.

, After the first month, and maybe for the rest of your life, you might still think of how nice a cigarette could be after a good meal. The thoughts become easier to ignore over time. Your life as a non-smoker will be healthier and hopefully more enjoyable without the constant torment of being told not to smoke.Keep a positive outlook. You may relapse and start back smoking several times before you totally kick the habit. A Gallup poll showed that most U.S. smokers try to quit an average of 3.6 times in their lifetimes.You have formed an addiction to nicotine and it won't be easy to break the habit. Stay consistent with living a healthier life, avoiding triggers, and finding better ways to cope with stress. You can do this!
Think about the long run. If you need more help, ask for it and seek it. Get patches, herbal supplements, or nicotine gum. Look up pictures of lung cancer victims and read stories from surviving families.

Rely on moral support.",How to Quit Smoking Naturally," Some foods enhance the flavor of cigarettes, but other foods make cigarettes taste worse. Packing flavors that clash with cigarettes into your diet can make cigarettes seem less appealing.


While everyone's taste buds can vary slightly, the flavors of red meat, coffee, and alcohol tend to enhance the taste of cigarettes, so you may need to cut back on these foods and drinks while you're trying to quit.
On the other hand, most fruits, vegetables, and dairy products make cigarettes taste worse, so now would be a good time to add these foods to your diet.;
, On average, roughly 30 percent of a smoker's cravings are for carbohydrates instead of nicotine. Sucking on over-the-counter glucose tablets or long-lasting fruit candy can help satisfy the carbohydrate craving, making your overall cravings less intense.Moreover, chewing on gum or sucking on a piece of candy can give your mouth something to do other than smoking. By keeping your mouth occupied, your hands and brain can stay away from cigarettes, too.

, When your next craving strikes, cut open a lime and suck the juice out of its wedges. While not quite as effective as nicotine gum, early studies suggest that lime juice can slow and stop many cigarette cravings.Citrus is also one of the many flavors that can worsen the taste of cigarettes, so flooding your mouth with the taste of lime juice can make the thought of lighting up less appetizing.
If sucking directly on wedges of lime juice doesn't seem appealing to you, try lime-flavored candies or sodas. You can also cook more recipes that list lime juice among the ingredients for a subtle boost.

, Instead of reaching for a cigarette, reach for a stick of real licorice root. Sucking on licorice instead can satisfy the oral cravings driving you to smoke.Since many tobacco products are flavored with licorice, taming your craving with licorice can satisfy both the feeling and taste you're missing.
Only use licorice in moderate amounts. Prolonged or excessive use beyond six weeks can cause other health problems.

, Add fresh clover flowers to salads or chew on tobacco-free, clover-based snuff to ward off potential cravings.


In addition to satisfying oral cravings, clover contains genistein, a compound that may help prevent tumors from growing by stopping new blood vessels from forming.

, Fava beans contain I-dopa, which your brain converts to dopamine. Increased dopamine production can help soothe the physical and mental stress associated with nicotine cravings.


Nicotine boosts dopamine, so when you quit smoking, your dopamine and mood both drop. Adding more fava beans to your diet can help regulate your dopamine levels and prevent your mood from sinking too severely.

, Both vigorous exercise and relaxing exercise can help you quit, so try to work a little of both into your routine.


Vigorous exercise can cause changes in your brain activity, making it easier to relieve tension and fight depression without relying on your next nicotine fix. If you have breathing or cardiovascular problems, however, you should talk to your doctor to determine how much vigorous exercise is healthy for you.
Tai chi can also help you quit. This type of martial arts can train you to improve your breathing and move in stronger, more fluid ways. As a result, your mind and body feel more relaxed, and you may experience fewer cravings.

, If you plan on quitting the habit and losing weight through diet and exercise, you should focus on doing one before embarking on the other.


Quitting and dieting both require a great amount of dedication, and if you try to do both at the same time, you can easily overwhelm yourself.
Quit smoking first, then wait one or two months before making any major changes to your diet or exercise routine.

, Identify the situations that increase your urge to smoke and do what you can to avoid them. When avoidance is impossible, find another way to distract yourself during those trigger situations.Your triggers typically include the circumstances during which you smoked most often. For instance, you might smoke more when you're around other smokers in a bar or party, or you might smoke more when you're alone watching television or surfing the Internet.
If you can't avoid a trigger, give your hands and mind something else to do other than smoking. Doodle with a pen and paper. Teach yourself to crochet or knit. Nearly anything that keeps your hands busy could help.

, When the temptation to smoke grows strong and you feel like caving into it, tell yourself that you need to wait another 10 minutes before you light up. Then, immediately distract yourself with another activity.


Longer activities that will take more than 10 minutes to complete tend to work better. By giving your mind something else to fixate on, you can help draw it away from thinking about your craving.
You may need to repeat this practice more than once, but keep at it until the craving goes away completely.

, Visual reminders of the dangers related to smoking can make your urge to quit even stronger. Find images of mouths with cancerous lesions or diseased lungs and post them above the drawer you usually keep your cigarettes in.


If you haven't already talked to your doctor about your smoking habit, take the time to do so now. Having your doctor review the potential consequences can be another way to effectively remind yourself of the dangers you face by continuing to smoke.

, Balance out the negative by reminding yourself of the positive reasons for wanting to quit. Write down your reasons or recite them aloud each day.


Your reasons can be for your own health, for your self-esteem, for the health of your loved ones, or for the sake of your wallet. Regardless of the specifics, you should continually remind yourself of any and all reasons.
On a similar note, speak in positive terms. Giving yourself the occasional pep talk can help you push through. Instead of routinely fixating on negative words like ""quit"" and ""stop,"" recite affirmative sayings like, ""I can do this.""

, Pushing through can become easier when you can look back and see how far you've already come. Keep a journal or other record of your progress. Document the therapies you've tried and note which have been successful, and note how long you've gone in between cigarettes.


Nowadays, there are also mobile apps you can use to help record your progress. A few examples include Quitter, Livestrong MyQuit Coach, Smoke Out, and Smoke Break. These apps can track your progress, record your achievements, and integrate everything into your social media accounts.

, Some evidence suggests that the vapor of black pepper essential oil may reduce cigarette cravings. Using body and home fragrances that contain black pepper essential oil may reduce the number of cravings you get.


Try soaking the corner of a cotton handkerchief in black pepper essential oil. As soon as your next craving begins bubbling up, spend a few moments sniffing the patch and settling your mind.

, Make an appointment with someone licensed in hypnotherapy and ask about using the practice to help you quit smoking. If it'll work at all, you should see results within approximately eight sessions.


Note that the success of hypnotherapy depends on many factors, including your own willingness and the skill level of the practitioner. Only choose practitioners with good reputations to increase your odds. Moreover, if you feel notably skeptical about the practicality or legitimacy of hypnosis, it might be a treatment worth skipping since your skepticism could interfere with its effectiveness.

, When applied correctly, acupuncture can increase the production of serotonin. Since quitting the habit decreases serotonin levels in the brain, supplementing these levels with acupuncture can help you maintain a balanced mood.


This treatment works best if you get it within 24 to 72 hours of your last cigarette. Typically, auricular (ear) acupuncture will be used, and you may need a total of six treatments to maximize the potential benefit.

, Try massaging the ear or back of your hand for two minutes each day. Continue the practice for a total of one month, even if your cigarette cravings subside before then.


Self-massage can help relax your mind and body, especially when performed on your ears. It also gives your hands something to hold onto other than a cigarette.

, Mindful meditation can help you focus your mind and control your breathing, thereby decreasing your stress levels and giving you less of a reason to pick up another cigarette.


Attend group sessions or practice on your own by following an instructional CD or audio recording. Try to meditate for 45 minutes daily to maximize the effect, and continue for one to two months, or until the habit is safely behind you.

, If you have friends or relatives who smoke, agree to quit the habit together. If you don't know anyone already, find a support group to talk with during the process.


People who quit together can support each other through the process by sharing stories about the difficulties and successes they undergo.
If traditional support groups aren't your thing, seek support online. Many social networks, including Twitter and Facebook, have a plethora of groups dedicated to quitting the habit. Actively participating in these groups can be just as helpful as actively participating in a real-life support group.

, Loving friends and relatives who don't smoke can still serve as sources of moral support. Even though you won't be able to relate to them about the difficulties of quitting, spending time talking and being with them can boost your mood and distract your mind away from cravings.


Avoid people who criticize you, however, since spending time with them may increase your stress and intensify the urge to smoke.
Similarly, you should also avoid active smokers who aren't trying to quit, even if they're otherwise positive people. Being around someone who smokes while you're trying to quit can make your efforts feel less urgent.

Often this works better than the immediate thought of denying yourself a cigarette. In the meantime, begin an activity that will occupy your time. Use a timer if necessary and repeat the process.;
, Most indoor facilities do not allow smoking. Take a trip to the mall, a museum, a restaurant or a library.

, These could include drinking alcohol or coffee, smoking after a meal, or being in situations where others are smoking, such as at a party or a bar.

,


Eliminate spicy foods and sugar, which tend to increase cravings for cigarettes. This is due mainly to the fact that your blood sugar levels become slightly altered, which trigger you to supplement with nicotine so you will not eat any more.
Make your meals last longer. Try to stretch out the time it takes to eat, and chew slowly in order to digest your meal properly. This will leave you with a satisfied feeling, and lessen your craving for nicotine.
Eat a piece of fruit for dessert to enhance the feeling of satisfaction.
Snack frequently on foods that are healthy and low in calories, such as carrots or apples. This will allow you to use your hands and put something in your mouth instead of smoking.

Keep believing you can do it.",How to Stay Away from Cigarettes," Most people find that just knowing they should quit isn’t enough of a motivation to do so. To quit any type of addiction, it’s necessary to have a rock solid reason that means more to you than smoking cigarettes ever could. Think deeply about why you personally want to quit. In other words, what’s your motivation for living a full, healthy life?


Many people can only find the strength to quit when they realize they’re doing it for someone they love. Is your inspiration for quitting the fact that you want to live to see your children or grandchildren grow up, or you want to grow old with your partner?
Perhaps the reason is that you don’t want to ruin your own health. Maybe you have a list of things you want to accomplish before you die, like writing a novel or hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.
If you’re hard up financially, saving money can also serve as a motivation, especially when you consider all the other things you could be spending it on.;
, Just thinking to yourself that you’ll quit when you’re ready isn’t going to cut it. You’ll be able to come up with reasons why it’s never quite the right time. Instead, set a date about a month from now and mark it on your calendar. In permanent ink. Giving yourself a little time between now and the quit date will allow you the chance to let it sink in that this is really happening. You’ll be able to anticipate the date and plan ways to successfully quit.


Consider picking a meaningful day, like your birthday or Mother’s Day. If the day is especially meaningful it might help you get motivated to quit.
Tell people about it. If you tell everyone you know that you’re quitting on your birthday, you’ll be more likely to hold yourself to it.

, In the days leading up to your quit date, start getting rid of the stuff that helps support your habit. Toss out all your special papers, your ashtrays, and other items that remind you of smoking. Keeping them around is a sign that you’re not really committed to quitting, since you must assume that you’ll need the items again in the future.


Since even the smell of old cigarette smoke can induce cravings, you might want to freshen up your wardrobe and your home as well. Air everything out, wash all your clothes, and get rid of items that hold the smell.

, You can either slowly cut back until the day you plan to completely quit, or wait until the date arrives and quit cold turkey. There’s no method proven to be successful, so choose the one that best fits your personality. The important thing is to actually quit on the day you have chosen - no excuses.


If you choose to taper off, cut back your habit in the weeks before the date arrives. For example, if you’re a pack a day smoker, taper down to half a pack a day, then just three cigarettes a day, and during the week before your quit date, just one a day. When the day comes, quit.
You can also use products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches to help you make the transition to not smoking more easily. Prescription medications that make quitting easier are also available; talk to a physician for more information.
If you choose to quit cold turkey, make sure you have a good plan in place for really doing it when the day comes. It might help to make quitting into a bit of an event. Have friends witness you throwing away the last pack of cigarettes, then celebrate by eating a healthy dinner.

, Quitting cigarettes is very hard work. You’re going to be faced with daily cravings, and you’ll need people you can turn to when it all begins to feel like too much to handle. Talk with the people who are on board with your decision to quit. When you feel the urge to smoke, don’t hesitate to call someone and talk through the craving.


Consider seeing a therapist who specializes in helping smokers quit. He or she will have ideas to help you effectively deal with your cravings every day.
A support group could also be helpful.

, You know the habits that tend to make you want to smoke. Maybe you have to light up after having a beer, because the experience just feels right. Maybe you can’t hang out with your buddies from high school without wanting to share a pack of cigarettes like old times. Maybe just being in the vicinity of your favorite concert venue makes you want to cave in to all your bad habits. The solution? Avoid the people, places and situations that stimulate your cravings. Why make things harder on yourself by tempting yourself all the time?

, It’s hardly controversial to say that smoking has a negative effect on your health. In addition to causing a host of different cancers, it blackens your lungs and makes it difficult to breathe at full capacity. When you smoke, it’s hard to be fit. Start an exercise routine after your quit date. At first it will be difficult to run, swim or hike, but as the weeks go by, you’ll start to get fit again. As you enjoy your healthy body, easily running around when you used to huff and puff after taking one flight of stairs, it’ll become more and more difficult to imagine going back to your old ways.


Exercise can also be a great distraction. When your cravings get intense, sometimes the only thing that can help is to distract your body by exerting it. Try lifting weights, doing sprints, playing basketball - anything that gets your heart racing and helps take your mind off the pull toward cigarettes.

, The act of lifting a cigarette to the lips and sucking becomes a source of comfort to smokers. Many smokers miss the calmness that comes with this familiar physical act. You can replace the feeling of having a cigarette in your mouth by chewing gum or anise seeds. The strong flavors will help to soothe your cravings, and the chewing motion will provide a sense of comfort.

, In the first few weeks after you quit, you may have serious withdrawal symptoms. Headaches, pain, irritability and other symptoms of withdrawal are not uncommon. Many find that drinking a glass of water each time a craving hits is a good way to handle withdrawal. Simple hydration goes a long way toward expelling those toxins from your body and keeping you feeling strong and healthy.


Eating healthy food is also a good way to handle withdrawal. Choose nutrient dense foods that make you feel good. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and meat. Your body will feel healthier than ever.

, When you’re stressed, you’re going to want a cigarette. Every little situation can end up being a trigger: a phone call you didn’t really want to make, a break between classes during the school day, a traffic jam. It’s important to have a plan in place to relieve stress without using cigarettes.



Deep breathing is a quick, effective technique you can use anywhere, any time.
Make sure you get plenty of sleep. Being well rested helps to relieve stress.
Have sex or masturbate to release endorphins and relieve stress.

, . . just don’t do it. When you find yourself about to give in to the common rationalization that just one cigarette isn’t going to hurt, turn back to your reason for quitting. Are you quitting for your child? Smoking just one cigarette will hurt her. Your own health? One cigarette is going to set you back. Just one cigarette could make you wind up going back to your pack a day habit, and then you’ll have to start all over. Don’t throw away everything you’ve accomplished so far.


If you do give in? Don’t beat yourself up, but don’t use it as an excuse to indulge further. You’ll probably have worse cravings than before, but you have the strength to overcome them. You quit once, and you can do it again.

, Having a positive attitude is very important when you’re quitting cigarettes. Your mind may constantly pull you down with negative thoughts about everything you’re giving up, like having a good time with your friends or feeling the sweet rush of smoke after a long day. Focus not on what you’re losing, but what you’re gaining and have already gained. For example:


Your health
Your family’s respect
Money
Whiter teeth and fresher breath
A cleaner space
Clothes that don’t smell
Time to spend on anything you want to do besides smoking
Freedom from the incessant need to drop whatever you’re doing and have a smoke

, During the times when quitting feels impossible, and you just don’t think you can handle going without cigarettes anymore, go back to your calendar. Look at the date you quit. Every day you successfully avoided smoking since then is an accomplishment. You obviously have amazing willpower. You have physical strength. You’ve put your mind and body to the test in a way that no one who hasn’t done it could ever understand. Take pride in what you’ve done, and stay motivated to keep going.

Allen Carr was a former accountant who created a method for stopping smoking - which he later applied to a host of other addictions and issues. He was a former 100-a-day chain smoker and successfully quit smoking after 33 years. First he helped some friends quit smoking and eventually hosted seminars that enabled those who attended to quit smoking with ease. He was so inundated with clients (who heard about him via word of mouth) that he shared the method in (what turned out to be) a worldwide bestselling book The Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

The effectiveness of Carr's method has been boasted over the years, and spread largely through word-of-mouth. While scientific studies on the Carr method are limited, a 2014 study did show smokers using the Allen Carr method were six times more likely to abstain from tobacco after 13 months in comparison to smokers using other methods.In 2017 a study initiated by the Irish Government/Health Dept showed results that strongly support the use of Allen Carr's Easyway method. A full, large scale randomised controlled trial into Allen Carr's Easyway is currently underway (2017).;
, Allen Carr's book is still widely available both online and in bookstores. You can also likely find a copy at the library. Before you can begin using the Allen Carr method, you need to obtain a copy of the book (assuming you'd rather do that than attend a live seminar - use the online course).

, The first step Carr advises is to set a specific time and date to quit.


You should pick a time in the near future. Mark it on your calendar as the day you will quit smoking.You should not try to cut down beforehand. Carr aims to sever the relationship smokers have with nicotine by showing smokers cigarettes do nothing to enhance their enjoyment of life. Cutting back before the date you've set calls more attention to the fact you're quitting, making cigarettes seem more precious., One of the motivators Carr uses in The Easy Way to Stop Smoking is pointing out the absurdity of cigarette use itself. The method suggests that you ignore the poor effects cigarettes have on your health, wealth, lifestyle, and self esteem and instead examine what you think the benefits of smoking are.


Carr points out giving up cigarettes is essentially giving up nothing. The addiction provides no genuine pleasure. This seems hard to believe but the method explains how smokers are conned into believing the exact opposite. The only purpose nicotine serves is to keep users addicted. You are giving up nothing and simultaneously making a tremendously positive change to your health and lifestyle.Cigarettes are very dangerous to your health. You know this already and this is why Allen Carr says to ignore the harm cigarettes do to every organ in the body and the fact that they cause a litany of diseases including lung cancer, and reduce the overall health of the user. Stopping smokinbg will dramatically and quickly reduce your risk of lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and stroke., Once you have worked through the method Carr advises that when you light your final cigarette you make a vow you will never smoke again no matter how difficult the process of quitting becomes.Keep track of your quitting date. Don't put off the day you plan to quit.
Record what it was about your life as a smoker that made you want to quit. It's easy to forget what it was that made you want to quit - so a reminder for the future is useful.

, In the first days especially, your body will go through very mild feelings of withdrawal. As long as you understand the principle of Allen Carr's method, these feelings are hardly noticeable.


Remember that withdrawal is temporary and will pass within a few days. Also, keep in mind smokers suffer nicotine withdrawal every day of their lives. It makes them feel lousy at in situations where they cannot access cigarettes. As you are now a non-smoker, you don't have to endure those symptoms anymore.Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are often listed as anxiety, depression, difficulty sleeping, increased appetite, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and weight gain. But with Allen Carr's method these are easily avoided. These unpleasant symptoms, rather than being caused by nicotine withdrawal, are in fact, physical feelings resulting from a thought process. Of thinking ""I want a cigarette""....""Damn I can't have one!!""...and so on. As long as you're happy not smoking - you don't have any unpleasant feelings. In fact thinking about cigarettes is pleasant rather than unpleasant. This link shows what smokers think of as being the inevitable discomfort of nicotine withdrawal. The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, which are really mild, usually disappear within a few days (if, in fact, you are even aware of them). This is the case - no matter how much or little you have smoked - regardless of the misinformation published on this issue - such as on this link. , Carr does not recommend avoiding the parts of life that remind you of smoking. Rather, Carr advises that you enjoy going out and doing what you normally do. You won't feel tempted to smoke at those times - whereas if you hide away from friends and social situations, then you will feel deprived of friends and company.


Throughout the day, there will be times when you might be reminded that you used to smoke. If you always had a cigarette with your morning coffee, for example, you might suddenly think about having one then. If that happens it's important to remember that you've escaped from something awful and that you're happy to be free rather than think ""I can't have a cigarette right now."" Instead think, ""Isn't it great I'm free!""Do not shy away from social occasions. Go out and see people. If you notice people smoking, you won't envy them - you'll have compassion for them. You are freeing yourself from an addiction and making a commitment to a healthier future.If someone offers you a cigarette, simply say, ""No thanks, I don't smoke"" rather than ""No thanks, I quit."" You do not need to launch into a lengthy explanation. , If you try not to think about something -you'll think about it even more. Just make sure that you're thinking the right thing about it. Allen Carr's method makes this very easy.


If you feel something that feels like a craving instead of thinking, ""I can't smoke"" think, ""It's great I'm a non-smoker now.""

, Many smokers feel overconfident after refraining from smoking for a few weeks or months. You might think it's safe to go back to smoking socially once in awhile, but this is not the case.


Quitting smoking means totally severing your relationship with an addictive substance. One cigarette can quickly draw you back into the trap. Never think of one cigarette as one cigarette. Think of it as part of a lifelong deadly habit.Nicotine is one of the most addictive narcotics in existence. This is why social smokers or casual smokers tend to eventually become chain smokers. Nicotine affects the brain in many ways - the most serious being that it convinces the addict that cigarettes provide pleasure or support - when in fact - the opposite is true. There are all sorts of studies that look at how the brain does this - but the truth is - it doesn't really matter - as long as you follow Allen Carr's method - you'll find it easy to escape., Carr advises against nicotine substitutes, such as nicotine gum or the nicotine patch.


Substitutes encourage you to think in terms of sacrifice. You are not making a sacrifice by getting rid of nicotine but rather respecting yourself and your body enough to quit.Also, substitutes keep the nicotine addiction alive. The sooner you can break the feeling of dependency, the easier it is to stop smoking., Many people attempting to quit smoking keep emergency cigarettes in the house in case of a powerful craving. You should not keep any cigarettes in your home after you've had your final cigarettes. You won't need them and keeping them to hand creates and stimulates doubt about your decision.


Keeping cigarettes on hand implies doubt. In order to successfully quit, you need to proceed with the knowledge this is the best choice for you and your loved ones.Remember, you are a non-smoker the moment you finish your last cigarette. You have no need for tobacco anymore. Don't worry if you live with a smoker - as long as you don't retain your own cigarettes - they won't bother you. , After a while, not smoking will cease to feel abnormal. You will begin to return to your usual routine and establish new rituals and habits around your life as a non-smoker.


You might still have a fleeting thought about having ""just one cigarette,"" especially as normalcy resumes. Remember, it's never just one cigarette. It's a lifelong chain of misery which you have escaped from. Congratulate yourself on those moments, such as social situations, where you feel happy to be free. Take pride in yourself and the fact you've given up smoking., If you're having trouble quitting on your own, you might need to seek additional professional help alongside your Allen Carr book.


Support groups are usually available in psychiatric clinics, where a trained physician or therapist leads discussions with other people attempting to quit.
Narcotics Anonymous is a non-profit organization that hosts meetings for recovering addicts to provide support. You can find meetings in your area through NA's website.If you're struggling to quit smoking, talk to your physician. You could also seek out the help of a professional therapist to see if any underlying emotional issues fuel your addiction.

, Remember, you cannot quit smoking alone. As you continue in your recovery, talk openly with friends and family members about your decision to quit and ask that they support you.


Ask the smokers in the family not to smoke in front of you or offer you cigarettes.
Ask a few friends or family members if you can call them when you're getting a craving. Pick people who are empathetic and easy to talk to.
If someone does not support your decision, it's best to temporarily sever ties from that person. Negativity fuels addiction.

Watch for neglect in appearance.,
Look for physical signs.,
Notice uncommon use of breath mints, gum, or cologne.,
Be aware of missing items around the home.,
Spot their nifty hiding places.",How to Spot Drug Abuse2," People who abuse drugs may show signs of poor hygiene. The person may have a disheveled appearance: their hair is messy, they need to shower, and they wear the same outfit again and again., You might also notice physical signs that your loved one is currently or recently intoxicated. These may include red eyes, dilated pupils, or strange eye movements. If your loved one is abusing intravenous drugs, they may also have track marks or red bruises on their arms., The flip side of a neglected appearance involves your loved one seemingly covering up any obvious signs of drug use. They may frequently use eye drops, smell strongly of cologne or perfume, or constantly use mints or chew gum., If your loved one is trying to sustain a drug habit, they will likely need more money than usual. If they fail to borrow from friends or family, they may start to steal. Keep track of valuable items or cash that seem to disappear around your household or in the homes of others close to the person., If your loved one lives in your home, you may be able to find hidden drug paraphernalia. Use your imagination to explore their room or other common living spaces. Look under beds and couches, in desk and clothing drawers, in between the pages of books, in CD and DVD cases, and under loose floor boards.Not-so-obvious places might be empty containers, such as over-the-counter pill bottles or candy and snack containers.

Check if the person is frequently missing from important events.,
Notice signs of social withdrawal.,
Watch for new friends and/or hangout spots.",How to Spot Drug Abuse3," Your loved one’s social calendar may have been cleared of all events not relating to their drug habit. They may fail to show up for significant family, work, or school events again and again.You may have to speak to others to notice repeated absences. Check with your loved one’s friends, coworkers, or school to be sure.

, The worldview of a person abusing drugs closes dramatically. For instance, a typically outgoing, friendly teen may suddenly spend most of their time alone. If you notice your loved one withdrawing from friends or loved ones with no explanation, you may need to watch them more closely., If your friend or family member is abusing drugs, you might find that they have an entirely new social circle. They no longer have time for positive friends and activities. Instead, they may be spending more time with shady figures and hanging out in questionable areas where drugs are frequently sold or used."

Talk to the person.,
Ask them to get help.,
Speak with their closest friends and family.,
Consult with a professional.,
Research treatment options.,
Share your concerns with the person.,
Provide an ultimatum, and enforce it.",How to Spot Drug Abuse4," If you suspect your loved one is abusing drugs, speak to them about it. Do so in a non-confrontational manner. You don't want to scare them away or make them defensive. The best approach is to simply explain your suspicions and tell them you are concerned.You might say, ""Justin, I found a bag of pills in your pocket when I was doing laundry. I've also noticed a few changes in you lately and I'm worried you're abusing drugs. Can you tell me what's going on?""

, Once your loved one admits to using drugs, you might simply request that they get help. You might say, ""I will help you look up some treatment programs to help you get better"" or something similar. If the person is unwilling to get help or denies that they have a problem, you may have to convince them through intervention., If your loved one is abusing drugs but doesn't want treatment, you need to try to convince them to get help. One way to do this is by planning an intervention, which involves close friends and family talking to the person together.Reach out to others who care about this person. You might say, “I’ve noticed a lot of alarming signs with Jacob lately. I think he might be using drugs. Will you join me in talking to him?”

, The best interventions are facilitated by a mental health or substance abuse professional. This person can guide you in preparing for an intervention. It may help to have this person present during the meeting to maintain perspective and offer their expertise.Contact local substance abuse treatment centers or mental health agencies to find someone in your area who facilitate interventions.

, Before you talk to your loved one, it can help to educate yourself about the different ways to treat drug abuse. The type of treatment your loved one needs will depend on how severely their drug use has affected their life and functioning. Some people may be able to recover from drug abuse through outpatient treatment, while others may require more intensive inpatient treatment.Research some treatment programs in your area. If you are working with a facilitator, they can probably supply your with resources. Go over the treatment options with other key people to decide on possible courses of action. Gather the information (e.g. brochures and contact numbers) and prepare to present it during the intervention meeting.

, The purpose of an intervention is to relay your concerns to a loved one who is abusing drugs. Each friend or family member will take turns expressing their love for the person and pleading with them to get help. You might also share ways the person’s drug abuse has negatively impacted you.For instance, you might say, “Jacob, you know that I love and care about you deeply. But, I’m worried. I’ve watched you spiral over the last few weeks and I see how your drug use is causing problems at school and in your relationships. I’d feel so much better if you got treatment.”

, Typically, loved ones present possible treatment options to the person and let them know that they expect them to get help. You might communicate consequences if the person refuses. If you set consequences, be sure that you are willing to enforce them, if needed.For example, you might set the consequence that your brother will be cut off from his inheritance unless he gets help for drug abuse.

Make a list of reasons you’re quitting.,
Decide how to quit.,
Choose a quit day.,
Refrain from going to hookah bars.",How to Quit Hookah Smoking1," When you decide to quit smoking hookah, make a list of reasons you are quitting. Carry this list with you. Sometimes you may need a reminder of why you are making this choice. Pull it out each time you are tempted to smoke. Reading this list can help you stay motivated.Reasons you may consider quitting hookah include the health benefits, wanting to feel better, being tired of smelling like smoke, wanting to stop wasting money, or setting a good example.;
, You can either quit hookah smoking by gradually cutting back or stopping cold turkey. Stopping cold turkey may work for some, but for others it might not always work. Sometimes, quitting completely at once is hard, especially if you have tried to quit hookah smoking before and couldn’t. Instead, gradually cut back on the amount of hookah you smoke. Each week or each day, smoke less and less.Decide which way it best for you. If you start out by quitting cold turkey, but then find that impossible to stick to, switch to a gradual cutting back of your smoking.

, Make a commitment to quitting hookah by choosing a day you want to stop smoking. Make it at least within the next two weeks. Choose a day where nothing is going on, so you can focus solely on quitting.Try it on a Sunday or a Monday, which starts off your week with your new goal. Or, stop on a Saturday so you have the weekend to get used to quitting before you have to return to work.

, Since you are trying to stop smoking hookah, you need to stop going to hookah bars. This just puts you right in front of temptation. Plus, in hookah bars you will be inhaling the smoke, which won’t be very helpful as you try to quit.Instead of hookah bars, go to other places. Go to a real bar where smoking isn’t allowed. Go to the movies, a museum, or out shopping. Stay away from places where smoking is allowed.

Recognize the early symptoms of syphilis.,
Know the complications of late stage syphilis.,
Get a formal test for syphilis.,
Inform a physician if you are pregnant before beginning syphilis treatment.,
Ask about alternative antibiotics if you have a penicillin allergy.",How to Treat Syphilis1," If you think you have syphilis, then you will need to seek a diagnosis and medical treatment. Syphilis has multiple stages with different types of symptoms. These symptoms may come and go, but it doesn’t mean the disease is gone unless you have been treated. In the later stages, you may have no symptoms of syphilis itself but instead suffer from severe effects such as brain, liver, nerve, and bone damage. Early symptoms of syphilis include:A chancre, which is a small sore that appears near your mouth, anus, penis, or vagina. This is typically associated with swollen lymph nodes in the groin area.
A rash that starts on your torso and then spreads to the rest of your body, including palms and soles which is indicative of the secondary stage of syphilis
Warts around the mouth and/or genitals.
Muscle aches
Fever
Sore throat
Swollen lymph nodes;
, In the latent or later stages of syphilis, the early symptoms disappear. Without treatment you can continue to carry syphilis for years. 10 to 30 years after the initial infection you may develop late stage syphilis. This can cause severe symptoms, including:Difficulty coordinating your muscle movements
Paralysis
Numbness,
Blindness
Dementia
Organ damage that can lead to death

, A variety of tests can be used to detect syphilis and the stage of its progression. These can range from examination of the sores’ fluid to spinal fluid examination and echocardiograms. Most commonly, a quick and cheap blood test is sufficient to diagnose syphilis.Blood tests are used to confirm antibodies your body makes to fight the illness.Testing fluid scraped from sores will show the presence of the bacteria, but can only be done when sores are present.Spinal fluid tests should be used when you think you may have cerebral forms of this disease., Certain antibiotics can be dangerous to the developing baby if used during pregnancy. Penicillin is typically used to treat syphilis in pregnant women. Penicillin G is the only known means by which to prevent transmission of syphilis to the child during pregnancy.Syphilis during pregnancy greatly increases the chances of stillbirth., Other antibiotics that can be used to treat syphilis include tetracycline, doxycycline, cephalothin, and erythromycin. Consult your doctor to learn more about these medicines and how they might work for you. Do not take medicine that has not been prescribed to you.


Tetracycline and doxycycline are both in the Tetracycline class of antibiotics.Cephalothin is in the class: cephalosporins.Erythromycin is one of the macrolides."

Quitting is as much of a psychological as it is a physical task, and proper guidance, motivation, and encouragement is essential to success for most people.It is essential that you surround yourself with the right people at this time. Seek out supportive friends and family who understand your desire to quit and will offer you encouragement and even constructive criticism as warranted. You will probably need to stay away from many of your old “stomping grounds” and normal leisure activities for at least a while, as you may associate these with smoking. Make sure your friends and family can support such changes.How to Quit Smoking offers more information on the need for support, as well as more detailed information on quitting smoking in general.

This WikiHow article on quitting also offers a helpful array of advice regarding the need for internal and external emotional support when you want to stop smoking.;
, There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to smoking cessation, but some methods seem to be more likely to succeed than others. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a combination of counseling plus medication offers the best chance for success. This is followed by use of medications alone — including Chantix and nicotine patches, gums, sprays, etc. — and counseling and support alone.Accept that your initial attempt(s) to quit will quite possibly fail, no matter how highly-recommended your approach and how strong your determination. An early failure or two does not mean you are weak-willed; it means you are normal. Keep trying, and know that you can quit — because anyone can quit with the right mix of methods and support., The support of friends and family is essential, but smoking cessation often also requires the help of people trained specifically for the task. Regularly utilizing person-to-person counseling, or even counseling over the phone, can double your chances of successfully quitting.Quitting smoking isn’t just about kicking a nicotine habit; it also requires changes to behavior patterns that have become fundamental to your daily life. Properly-trained behavioral therapists can help guide you through the difficult transition into smoking-free behaviors, such as with your typical post-meal, after-work, or post-argument routines.
For most people, professional counseling works best when combined with medication, and when they are supported by friends and family.

, Recent years have witnessed a marked increase in approved medications that can help you quit smoking, and it is easier than ever to get started with them. Many of the common medications work by replacing your nicotine “fix” with an alternate source other than cigarettes, while others deal with how your body responds to nicotine.Varencline (Chantix), for instance, impacts your brain’s nicotine receptors and can make the sensation of smoking less enjoyable. It requires a prescription and must be taken according to specific instructions, and with an eye out for possible side effects.
Bupropion (Wellbutrin or Zyban) can help reduce your experience of symptoms caused by nicotine withdrawal. Again, follow your doctor’s guidance closely and pay attention to potential side effects.
Various nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) medications are now available in the U.S. without a prescription. They come in forms including patches, gums, lozenges, tablets, inhalers, and sprays, under brand names like Nicoderm, Nicorette, and Nicotrol. They deliver nicotine to your body to replace what you lose by not smoking, and ideally will make it easier for you to wean yourself off of nicotine dependency.
As mentioned in the counseling step, smoking cessation methods work best for most people when paired with professional therapy to deal with behavioral changes.

, Commercials, advertisements, and testimonials will tell you that methods like hypnosis, laser therapy, and acupuncture can help you quit smoking. There is nothing to say that they can’t work for you; however, there is also no solid scientific evidence that such alternative methods can improve your odds of quitting. You don’t have to avoid them because they are unproven according to medical research. You should just choose to use them or not with that knowledge in mind.Note that switching from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes also falls into this category of unproven methods.
In the end, it doesn’t really matter how you quit, so long as you are not using a method that harms you in some other way or replacing smoking with another bad habit. The most important thing is to quit, in whatever ways work best for you and for your overall health and well-being.

, Cutting out the act of smoking will create a void in your daily routines, and people often fill this void with comforts like food, alcohol, or other alternatives that are harmful in excess. It is important that you have a plan in place ahead of time to replace smoking with healthy, beneficial behaviors. Exercise is probably the best replacement, as it will help you compound the health benefits of not smoking.Smoking increases your metabolism and reduces your appetite, so it is common for weight gain to occur after you quit. Making healthy food choices, exercising regularly, and becoming more physically active in general will help combat weight gain, benefit your overall health, and give you positive replacements for the time you used to spend smoking.
Consider investing some of the money you’ll save by not buying cigarettes into healthy foods or a gym membership, for instance.

, Smoking any type of cigarette containing nicotine exposes you to compounds known to damage heart cells. No matter how you look at it, smoking is one of the worst things you can do for your health.The good news is that much of the damage caused by smoking can be reversed once you quit. Your risk of heart disease reduces by half one year after you quit, and your risk of heart attack after fifteen years is about the same as if you had never picked up a single cigarette.

, Because e-cigs are completely unregulated by the American FDA and many similar government entities elsewhere, there is no way to know for sure what is exactly in the e-liquid that turns into vapor. Your best bet is to seek out e-cigarettes from established companies that show at least some track-record of providing products of relative quality and safety (“relative” being the operative word, as no e-cigs should be called “safe.”)If you want to wean yourself off nicotine dependency via e-cigarettes, it is best to choose the refillable, tank-type version as opposed to the “cigalikes” variety (which look more like traditional cigarettes and are pre-filled). With the refillable type, you have more control over the amount of nicotine and flavoring you add, and can more readily reduce your nicotine amounts as desired.Once again, however, there is no regulation over the contents of the e-liquid refills, so there is no way to know for sure that the claimed amount of nicotine is accurate. Indeed, testing has indicated that some supposedly nicotine-free e-liquids actually contain nicotine.

, If you want to try to use e-cigarettes to help you quit smoking altogether, you almost certainly have to wean yourself off of traditional cigarettes first. For many people, e-cigs provide a similar but distinct type of “fix,” because of differences in the smoking process, the contents of the cigarettes, and the settings in which you can smoke each type.This means that if you are smoking both traditional and electronic cigarettes at the same time, you may be trying to quit two types of addictions at once. For most people, it is probably best to quit one smoking type at a time.

, Since e-cigarettes are not marketed or officially approved for smoking cessation, there is little clear advice on how best to go about using them in order to quit. Generally speaking, though, the best option seems to be to steadily reduce the nicotine concentration in your e-liquid until you are smoking (supposedly) nicotine-free vapor. From there, you can work on kicking the physical habit of smoking.For example, you may want to start with an e-liquid with a 1.8% nicotine percentage, then work your way down to 1.2%, 0.6%, and 0.0%. If you need to start at a higher nicotine level, many e-liquids come at 2.4% and 3.6% levels as well. The process may take several weeks or more, and is dependent upon your individual willpower, determination, and physical ability to shake your nicotine addiction. Please remember, though, that this is not an regulated, tested, or officially recommended process for reducing nicotine dependency or quitting smoking.

, Once your body has become accustomed to regular nicotine dosing, it will not respond well to having it taken away. Whether using traditional or e-cigarettes, withdrawal symptoms can start within two to three hours after your last dose of nicotine, and often peak about two to three days after you have begun the process of quitting.Typical withdrawal symptoms can include: intense cravings; increased irritability; drowsiness; anxiety; depression; headaches; nightmares; and a range of other physical and psychological impacts.
Expect to “not be yourself” for a while after you wean yourself off of nicotine, and make sure you surround yourself with supportive friends, family, and counselors, and stay clear of places or situations where you will be tempted to smoke again.

, One reason why e-cigarettes can be more appealing to people trying to quit than nicotine patches or gum is that it replicates the same habit of holding a nicotine delivery system between your lips and seeing a billowing puff in front of your face. If you want to quit e-cigarettes, you need to overcome not only your dependency on nicotine, but also your dependency on the habit of smoking.


Try to change up your daily routines while quitting, so you will be less tempted to fall into the habit of smoking after lunch or your afternoon meetings. Take a walk, read a book, eat your lunch at another time or in another place, etc.
Deal with your “oral habit” of smoking with healthier replacements like nibbling on carrot sticks, chewing sugarless gum, sucking on a cinnamon stick, or swirling a straw or toothpick in your mouth., Electronic cigarettes have been around for less than ten years, which means there is simply no way to know their long-term effects. This newness is part of the reason why they are still not regulated by many government agencies around the world, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. In short, there is often no way to know for sure what is in your e-cigarette, and what exactly the materials that are in it may do to you.Assuming that your e-cigarette contains what it is supposed to, it is probably safer overall than a traditional cigarette. That is to say, if you were going to spend your life smoking either only e-cigarettes or only traditional cigarettes, the e-cigs would likely be the better choice. However, there is no real way to know for sure yet, and most people who do smoke e-cigs don’t completely eschew traditional cigarettes anyway., Although they come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, practically all e-cigarettes work by using a battery-powered heat source to vaporize an “e-liquid,” which typically contains nicotine and flavorings (among many other things). You breathe in and puff out this vapor in much the same way as you smoke a traditional cigarette.Extra care needs to be taken with the e-liquid, especially if there are children around. The liquid provides a far more concentrated dose of nicotine and other compounds that the vaporized mist, and increasing calls to poison control hotlines indicate that consuming the e-liquid in non-vapor form can cause a host of medical problems, and can present serious risks to children.

, Proponents of e-cigarettes point out that they remove the “smoke” part from smoking. Traditional tobacco smoke contains a host of toxins and carcinogens, created in part by the burning process. This lack of smoke probably makes e-cigarettes overall less damaging to your health than traditional cigarettes, but they are far from risk-free.Traditional cigarettes bring nicotine and a host of other chemical compounds to the table; e-cigarettes are primarily nicotine delivery systems. Nicotine itself is not recognized as a carcinogen, meaning e-cigs are probably less likely to cause ailments like lung cancer.
However, nicotine can cause direct damage to heart cells, making heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems more likely. Therefore, switching from traditional to electronic cigarettes may simply be a case of trading one bad habit for another., Some people want to make the switch to supposedly healthier e-cigarettes long-term, while others want to use it as a bridge to stopping any and all types of smoking. While there is ample anecdotal evidence and some research indicating that e-cigarettes can improve your odds of quitting altogether, there is precious little clear, research-supported evidence that e-cigs are an effective method for quitting.Part of the problem is that it is not so simple for many people to switch completely from traditional to electronic cigarettes. Indeed, as of 2013, some three-fourths of e-cigarette users also regularly smoked traditional cigarettes as well.
For many people, e-cigarettes simply become another part of the smoking repertoire, one that is often more acceptable in public places."

Know your treatment options when it comes to taking antiviral drugs.",How to Treat Herpes1," With a sexually transmitted infection like herpes, you don't want to rely on self-diagnosis. You want to be sure, and in order to be sure, you need to visit the doctor. Many times, herpes is asymptomatic, meaning that the symptoms either don't present or are too mild to be recognized.Other times, herpes presents with the following symptoms:


Small, painful blisters that scab over and heal over the course of several weeks. These may either be on your genitals or your buttocks.
Red, caking, or raw skin in the genital area, with or without itching.
Frequent pain or discomfort during urination.
Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, body aches (especially in the back and neck), and swollen glands.;
, Your doctor should be able to give you specific suggestions about which drugs and precautions to take in order to manage symptoms. As there is no cure yet for herpes, managing symptoms is the primary concern.

, Managing your outbreaks with proper treatment will help you:


Heal sores sooner and more effectively
Minimize the duration and severity of outbreaks
Reduce the recurrence of outbreaks
Minimize the chance of spreading herpes to any sexual partners

, Antiviral drugs lessen the number of herpes outbreaks by reducing what's called ""viral shedding,"" or the process by which the virus makes new copies of itself on the skin's surface.Regular use of antiviral drugs also helps lower the risk that you'll pass the herpes simplex virus on to other sexual partners. The most common antiviral drugs prescribed for herpes include:


Acyclovir (Zovirax)
Famciclovir (Famvir)
Valacyclovir (Valtrex)

, Drugs are administered by a doctor during prescribed times. When the herpes virus is first diagnosed, drugs are usually prescribed. Then, on an intermittent or regular basis, drugs are also prescribed, depending on the severity of the outbreaks and the patient's individual needs.


Initial treatment: after you are diagnosed with herpes, your doctor will prescribe a brief trial (7 to 10 days) of antiviral drugs. If 10 days' worth of antiviral medication does not help manage the outbreak, your doctor may continue your course of treatment for a few more days.
Intermittent treatment: if you experience outbreaks seldom, or at irregular times, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug for you to use when outbreaks do occur. Having several days' worth of antiviral medication on hand will allow you to start a course of drugs as soon as the outbreak happens, minimizing its severity and duration.
Regular treatment: If you have regular outbreaks totaling more than six a year, talk to your doctor about taking antiviral medication every day. This is called suppressive treatment. Individuals with regular outbreaks who begin to take medication every day often find their outbreaks reduced by as much as 80%."

Prepare for possible hurt feelings by having planned reactions. For example, if they say, “I can make my own decisions” you reply with, “that’s true and I’m not trying to tell you what to do. I’m just concerned because…”
Appeal to their emotional side. This way they’ll know your motivation is in the right place and will be more likely to listen to your advice.;
, Smoking is an unhealthy habit, not only for the person who smokes but also for the people around them. It’s important to keep these messages positive. Don’t berate, nag, or induce fear into your loved one.


Remind them how much you love them and want to keep them around for many years to come. Smoking causes serious health conditions like lung cancer. It’s also a known cause of Osteoporosis, stroke, and depression.If your loved one values physical beauty, encourage them to preserve their beauty by avoiding smoking-induced wrinkles and yellow teeth., Remind them of their own loved ones (children, grandchildren, husband/wife, valued friends) and how important they are to the people around them.Placing pictures of young people might help serve as a motivating daily reminder.

Sleep might be hard to come by for a while. Suggest some things they can do, like read a book, watch a television show, or write in a journal.
Don’t take their bad moods personally. Continue to be positive and let them know that it’s okay to have bad days. Remind them how proud you are.

, Most people who quit smoking will slip up at some point in their process. It’s normal, and it’s okay. Unfortunately, a lot of quitters will see it as a sign of failure and stop trying. The first 2 weeks are usually the hardest.


Remind them of all the reasons they wanted to quit in the first place (or should quit).
Let them know they can still quit and haven’t failed.
Identify the trigger so they know what to avoid moving forward., Quitting smoking is not easy. Reward their efforts along the way. They promote encouragement and remind your loved one they’re still moving in the right direction.

Follow treatment plans for syphilis.,
Do not skip doses.,
Return for regular testing.",How to Treat Syphilis2," If you are in the first stage of the disease, you may only need a single injected dose of antibiotics; however, you will need to return multiple times within the next 12 months to get re-tested for the disease. You may even need to be re-treated if the infection has not disappeared.


The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction can occur on the first day of treatment and it goes away within a few hours to a day. This reaction includes fever, chills, nausea, pain and headaches.Even if treated during pregnancy, the newborn should still be treated., If your treatment plan for syphilis requires multiple doses over several days or weeks, it is crucial that you do not skip any doses. By not taking your full regimen of medicine, you risk not eliminating the infection. Then you may have to return for another round of treatment.


Antibiotic treatment courses work most effectively when taken according to the plan recommended by the physician or pharmacist. Taking the full course also helps prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of the disease.
Treatment of secondary syphilis may last an entire year but is essential to avoid the permanent disability that can be caused by tertiary syphilis.

, This not only ensures that you have successfully eliminated the syphilis infection but also enables swift diagnosis and re-treatment if you later become infected again. During this time of regular testing, you should avoid sexual contact. You should also take this opportunity to be tested for HIV.Having syphilis once does not make you immune to the disease. You can be reinfected even after successful treatment of the disease."
"
Abstain from sexual contact.,
Inform all sexual partners of your infection.,
Use a latex condom.",How to Treat Syphilis3," If you currently have syphilis, it is essential that you protect others from the disease, even if you are already on antibiotics. The disease may still be transmitted during treatment, even when physical symptoms are not present. If you are infected, it is your responsibility to avoid all sexual contact (oral, anal, and vaginal sex) during treatment to prevent transmission of the disease.If you have sores on your mouth, then you should not even kiss anyone because the disease may pass through the sores., This includes former partners who may have been exposed to your infection prior to treatment. It is essential all partners are informed so that they can seek testing and treatment if necessary, or decide to decline sexual interaction with you until you are completely free of the illness. Failure to do so may increase risk of transmission., This barrier method may help prevent transmission of syphilis during treatment. Make sure that you use condoms during all acts of vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Keep in mind that condom use is only effective if all of the affected areas are covered to prevent contact with the mucus membranes or broken skin of a sexual partner.Make sure that you use dental dams or latex barriers when performing oral sex on a female partner.

Try echinacea.,
Use baking soda to dry herpes sores.,
Use lysine or L-lysine to prevent outbreaks.,
Use a cool teabag to help manage flare-ups.,
Use aloe vera cream to treat lesions.,
Try Monolaurin.,
See a herbalist.",How to Treat Herpes2," Long used in the fight against colds and infections, echinacea is a natural herbal  remedy that has gained in popularity over the recent years. Echinacea may be ingested as pressed juice, as a tincture, or as an extract (i.e. tea). Although many people have taken to using echinacea in order to treat herpes, no scientific basis exists for saying that echinacea helps treat herpes., Baking soda is another time-tested substance for anything from smelly fridges to smelly underarms, as well as a toothpaste and acne treatment. Baking soda can help dry out moist or oozing lesions, thereby helping them disappear faster. As a dry agent, baking soda is clean and absorbent, though still not a doctor-recommended treatment option.

, Lysine is an essential amino acid that does a number of things for the human body (absorb calcium, form collagen, and produce carnitine, among others). In the case of herpes, lysine may help to prevent an outbreak by blocking arginine, which helps in herpes replication.Still, the clinical trials using lysine have been mixed, and scientists believe that lysine is better at preventing an outbreak than treating one.

, Some people think that the tannins found in tea help treat outbreaks when they do happen. To use:


Heat up water just enough to steep the teabag in.
Cool the teabag under cold water, until it is no longer warm. Remove most of the moisture from the tea bag.
Apply the teabag to the lesions. Let stay for several minutes.
Discard the teabag and dry the area off immediately with a clean towel or a hair drier.

, Aloe vera may be beneficial in healing herpes lesions, especially among men.Applying the aloe vera cream to the lesions, and drying thoroughly afterward, may reduce the duration of the outbreak.


Consider Bio-energetic homeopathic herpes nosodes such as 2lherp, HRPZ3 and Bio 88. They benefited 82% of trial participants for 5 years after 6 months of treatment
Look into Hypericum, Ayurvedic Doctors swear by it as the best natural treatment for herpes

, Monolaurin consists of glycerol and lauric acid, which together make up coconut oil. Coconut oil is known to have anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties. Cooking with it and drinking coconut water increases the immune support. Apply oil directly to sores it will clear them up very quickly


Look for tablet Monolaurin (if in gelatin form, crack open capsule, pour into almond milk or coconut water). Note: check to determine if supplement contraindicates any medications you are taking.

, You may wish to consult a herbalist about the possibility of finding an herbal solution to herpes. Herpes ulcers are usually very sore and excruciatingly painful. Many herbs mentioned in Ayurveda, have been used for thousands of years to soothe the burning, itching and the tingling sensation. Herbs such as Chandana (Santalum album), Devadaru (Cedrus devdar), Nagarmotha (Cyperus rotundus), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), Ficus group plants like Ficus bengalenis and sacred fig (Ficus religiosa), Sariva (Hemidesmus Indicus), Utpala (lotus), Yesthimadu (Glycirhiza glabra), are well known for their cooling powers on the skin. A mixture of the aforementioned herbs in equal proportions can be prepared and used in the following manner to help soothe Herpes ulcers and blisters. Talk to your herbalist about the following two possible forms of using herbs:


Decoction: Boil 1 tsp. of powder (on a low flame) with 16 ounces of water. Boil it till 4 ounces is obtained. Use this decoction to wash the infected area.
Paste: Mix the powder with milk, rose water or plain water. Apply this paste to the affected area. Paste is to be used when there is severe pain and burning.
Direct application is advised when the affected area is moist.

"
"
Soak the affected area in warm water, but when not soaking, keep area dry.,
Wear loose, breathable underwear and clothing.,
If your ulcers are very painful, ask a physician about a topical anesthetic to apply to affected areas.,
Try an ointment containing propolis.,
Try the herb Prunella vulgaris and the mushroom Rozites caperata.",How to Treat Herpes3," Doctors sometimes recommend soaking in warm water to relieve itching, pain, or discomfort associated with herpes outbreaks. You may find that aluminum acetate (Domeboro) or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) help relieve the affected area, although these are not doctor-recommended treatments.


Cleanse sores gently with soap and warm water. Keeping blisters clean may help speed healing.
When the area is not soaking in warm water, try to keep it dry. If toweling the area dry after stepping out of the bath is uncomfortable, use a hair drier instead.

, Cotton underwear is a must. Restrictive clothing and synthetic pantyhose, underwear, or pants can aggravate genital herpes symptoms, as these synthetic materials tend not to breathe as well as fabrics like cotton.

, Although topical treatments are generally less effective than systemic treatments, they can sometimes be used to treat pain or discomfort.


Taking OTC pain medications, such as aspirin (Bayer), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) is often recommended to help with pain.

, In its natural state, propolis is resinous material collected from the buds of poplar trees, although it is often harvested from beehives. A 3% propolis ointment (Herstat or ColdSore-FX), applied to herpes lesions, may help heal lesions.In one study, propolis ointment was used four times a day, for 10 days, among 30 participants. Afterwards, 24 of 30 participants who used propolis during the study reported that their lesions healed, while only 14 of 30 participants who used a placebo reported that their lesions healed., Prunella vulgaris and Rozites caperata have both shown some promise in fighting herpes.Prunella vulgaris can be used in a hot water treatment to soothe and heal sores, while Rozites caperata may be ingested to help treat sores.

Understand that outbreaks frequently occur during times of stress, illness, physical trauma (including sexual activity), and fatigue.,
Participate in stress relief activities.,
Always use a latex condom during oral, genital, or anal sex.,
Get enough rest.,
Avoid activities that put you at high risk of illness or infection.",How to Treat Herpes4," Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally may help you reduce the frequency of outbreaks.

, Managing your emotional stress may help you avoid outbreaks. Consider finding a routine, such as yoga, painting, or meditation, that helps you stay balanced and calm.



Exercise regularly. Exercise is a great natural stress buster, and it keeps you in peak physical health as well. Staying fit can help you avoid illness and protect your immune system, which may help prevent herpes outbreaks.

, This not only helps protect your sex partner (who should always be informed of your condition prior to any physical contact or sexual activity), but also helps protect your skin from damage that might lead to an outbreak.


Try not to have sex during outbreaks. Viral shedding of herpes may happen over the entire genital area, making transmission even likelier. If you're worried about transmitting the virus to your sexual partner, only have sex between outbreaks, always using a condom.

, Keeping your energy levels up by getting sufficient sleep helps you avoid illness and manage physical and emotional stress. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night and avoid activities that put your body through extreme endurance tests (such as marathons).

, Wash your hands regularly and avoid areas where communicable disease is common (such as doctors’ waiting rooms and other areas where sick people may gather). Keeping your immune system at its full capacity is important for maintaining an outbreak-free lifestyle with herpes.

Be aware of the symptoms and signs of chlamydia.,
Consult your doctor.,
Undergo medical examinations.,
Get treatment for chlamydia.,
Screen and treat newborns.,
Avoid all sexual activity.,
See doctor if your symptoms persist after treatment.,
Get tested regularly for chlamydia.,
Don’t use vaginal douching products.,
Practice safe sex.,
Be aware of the risk factors.",How to Treat Chlamydia," Although chlamydia often presents few symptoms in its early stages, it’s important to be aware of any symptoms you may exhibit. Consult your doctor for a definitive diagnosis if you notice any signs of chlamydia, especially if you’ve engaged in unprotected sex.


Both men and women can contract chlamydia and repeat infection is common.The early stage of a chlamydial infection often has little symptoms and even when signs are present, usually within 1 to 3 weeks after infection, they may be mild.Common symptoms of chlamydia are: painful urination, lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge in women, discharge from the penis in men, painful sexual intercourse, bleeding between periods and after sex in women, or testicular pain in men.;
, If you experience any symptoms of chlamydia, including discharge from your genitals, or a partner has revealed they have chlamydia, make an appointment to see your doctor. She will run tests and confirm a diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you.Tell your doctor about the symptoms you're experiencing, signs of chlamydia that you've noticed, as well as if you’ve had unprotected sex.
If you’ve had chlamydia in the past and are experiencing a recurrence, contact your doctor to get a prescription., If your doctor suspects that you have chlamydia, she may order further medical examinations or tests. These simple screenings will help definitely diagnose the sexually transmitted disease and make it easier to develop a treatment plan.


If you're a female, your doctor may swab the discharge from your cervix or vagina and submit the sample to a laboratory for testing.If you're a male, your doctor may insert a slim swab into the opening of your penis and swab the discharge from your urethra. She will then submit the sample to a laboratory for testing.If you've engaged in oral or anal sex, your doctor takes a swab of your mouth or anus for chlamydia testing.In some cases, a urine sample may detect a chlamydia infection., If your doctor diagnoses you with chlamydia, she’ll prescribe you a course of antibiotics, which is the only way to treat the disease besides prevention. Generally the infection will disappear after 1 or 2 weeks.The first line treatment is azithromycin (1 g taken orally in a single dose) or doxycycline (100 mg taken orally twice daily for 7 days).Your treatment may be a one-time dose or you may need to take it daily or many times a day for 5-10 days.Your sexual partner(s) also require treatment even if they have no symptoms of chlamydia. This will keep you and your partner(s) from passing the disease back and forth between one another.Do not share your medication for chlamydia with anyone., If you are pregnant and have chlamydia, your doctor may prescribe azithromycin in your second or third trimester to decrease the risk of transmitting the disease to your baby. Your chlamydia infection will be treated during pregnancy at the time of discovery you will be tested again to ensure the infection has resolved.After birth, your doctor will screen your newborn and treat her accordingly.If you give birth and transmit chlamydia to your newborn, your doctor will treat the disease with antibiotics to prevent pneumonia or a serious eye infection in your baby.Most doctors will prophylactically administer an erythromycin eye ointment to help prevent a chlamydia-related eye infection from affecting your newborn’s eyes.You and your doctor should monitor your newborn for chlamydia-related pneumonia for at least the first three months of her life.If your baby has chlamydia-related pneumonia, your doctor will likely prescribe erythromycin or azithromycin., During the course of your chlamydia treatment, abstain from all sexual activity including oral and anal sex.This may help from spreading the disease to your partner and decrease your risk of reinfection.If you take a single dose of medication, avoid sexual activity for seven days after you take the dose.If you take a seven day course of medication, avoid sexual activity for the duration of your treatment., If your symptoms of chlamydia persist after a course of treatment, it’s important to see your doctor as soon as possible. Managing and treating these symptoms and the disease will help ensure that you don’t have a recurrence or contract a more serious condition or complication.Not addressing symptoms or recurrences can result in reproductive health complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, which can permanently damage reproductive organs, and ectopic pregnancy., If a doctor treated you for an initial chlamydia infection, get retested for the disease in approximately three months and at regular intervals thereafter. This will help ensure that the disease has left your system and that you are no longer contagious.Continue testing for sexually transmitted infections with each new sexual partner.
Recurrence of chlamydia is very common and is often treated with the same course of antibiotics. If infection recurs after a follow up test that showed no infection, this is a new infection., Avoid using douches if you have or have had chlamydia. These products kill good bacteria and raise the risk for infection or recurrence., The best way to treat chlamydia is to avoid getting it. Using condoms and limiting the number of your sex partners will minimize your risk for contracting the disease or having a recurrence.Always use condoms during sexual contact. Although condoms will not eliminate your risk of getting chlamydia, they will reduce your risk.Abstain from any sexual intercourse or sexual activity, including anal and oral sex, during treatment. Abstinence can help avoid reinfection or passing the STD to your partner.The more sexual partners you have, the higher your risk of getting chlamydia is. Try to limit the number of partners you have to decrease your risk, and always use condoms with your partners., Certain factors can increase your risk of getting chlamydia. Being aware of them can help you reduce the likelihood of contracting the disease.If you are under 24 years of age you are at a higher risk for the disease.If you’ve had multiple sex partners within the past year you are more likely to get chlamydia.Inconsistent use of condoms can significantly increase your risk of getting chlamydia.If you have a history of sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia, you are at an increased risk of contracting the disease."

Know that the medical treatments for HIV have improved dramatically.,
Try antiretroviral therapy.,
Be aware of the medications you may be taking.,
Understand the goals of therapy.",How to Treat HIV1," While it used to be a disease that led to death within a number of years, it is now more similar to other chronic diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure. When HIV is appropriately treated from the outset, with the new medical therapies that are available, it is something you can live with for a lifetime;therefore, the disease has a much better outlook for patients than it used to.


If you suspect you may have HIV, it is always best to get a blood test to know about it sooner rather than later. This is because, the sooner treatment is instigated, the better when it comes to prognosis. In addition, you are less likely to infect others if you are diagnosed early.
If you are diagnosed with HIV, you will be put under the care of a specialty physician — someone who is extremely knowledgeable about all of the latest options for HIV treatment and management.;
, This is something offered to all patients diagnosed with HIV. It works to prevent replication of the virus within your own body, as well as to prevent transmission to others. When taken exactly as prescribed, and not skipping doses, it is an extremely effective treatment.Note that compliance with the medication regimen is key. If you start missing doses, the HIV virus in your body will become resistant to the medication.What this means is that the medication will no longer work for you in the future if you fail to take it regularly, because the virus will learn how to overcome it.
Treatment regimens vary between patients and depending upon the severity of the disease; however, most commonly you will need to take between one to four pills per day.It is important not only to take the correct number of pills each day, as prescribed by your doctor, but also to take them at the correct time.
Once you begin HIV treatments, you will need to stay on them for the rest of your life or until instructed to stop by a physician., There are a wide variety of antiretroviral medications that are now available for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Which ones your doctor prescribes to you will depend on a number of factors, including your age, any co-existing illnesses, and the severity of your disease. Some medications commonly used for HIV include:NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors)
NRTIs (nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors)
INSTIs (integrase strand transfer inhibitors)
PIs (protease inhibitors)
HIV treatments work by targeting the genetic material of the virus within cells and preventing it from replicating any further.

, There are several reasons to receive antiretroviral treatment for your HIV. Some of the biggest reasons include:To delay the rate of progression of the illness.
To create the minimum risk possible of transmission to your sexual partner, if you are sexually active.
To keep up your overall health. The biggest risk with HIV is not the disease itself, but the fact that it attacks your immune system, which then puts you at risk for catching a number of other infections that most people are immune to (but your immune system becomes too weak to fight them off). These are called ""opportunistic infections,"" because they take advantage of the ""opportunity"" to infect someone whose immune system is weakened from HIV/AIDS.
Some of the most common types of opportunistic infections in severe HIV patients are recurrent complicated pneumonias and unusual fungal infections, hepatitis B and C, and others.If you contract an opportunistic infection, your diagnosis will change from HIV to AIDS. This is because contracting one of these infections (which are deemed to be very unusual for the general population, and only for people with severely weakened immune systems) is an indication of the severity of your disease and the amount of damage to your body's immune system."

Learn the symptoms that present in females.,
Look for symptoms of gonorrhea.,
Know that gonorrhea requires medical treatment.",How to Treat Gonorrhea1," If you have had sex recently, you could be infected. In the United States, however, the highest reported rates of infection are among sexually active teenagers, young adults, and African Americans., They include burning or pain when urinating, blood tinged urine, discharge from the penis (white, yellow, or green in color), swollen or painful tip of penis that is red in color, and tender or swollen testicles. In addition, frequent urination and sore throat can also be symptoms., Symptoms in women can be very mild. They can be mistaken for another type of infection. The only way to differentiate bacteria is by doing serological tests (specific antibody detection) and cultures (taking a sample of the infected area and see what organism grows).Symptoms in women include: vaginal discharge (can have a yeast smell at times), burning/pain when urinating, increased urination, sore throat, painful sexual intercourse, fever, and severe pain in the lower abdomen if the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes.

, Symptoms may appear within 2 to 10 days of infection, or as late as 30 days after infection in males.. Most do not exhibit any signs or symptoms; up to 20% of infected males and up to 80% of infected females have no presentation.Signs and symptoms can be very non-specific, so if you suspect you have gonorrhea at all, contact your doctor.

, If left untreated, it can cause numerous serious health problems, including chronic pain and infertility in both men and women. Eventually, untreated gonorrhea can be spread to the blood and joints, which can be a life-threatening condition.


On the other hand, gonorrhea that is treated will by cured by antibiotics and the symptoms will go away.

Understand what HIV is.,
Get your vaccines.,
Practice safe sex.",How to Treat HIV2," HIV is a disease of the immune system, meaning that your body is no longer as strong or capable at fighting off other illnesses.It is not HIV itself that is the problem, so to speak, but rather the other illness you can catch when you are HIV-positive because of your weakened immune system.


This is why preventative measures are key, because if you take good care of your health overall, you are less likely to contract other illnesses despite having a weakened immune system.Eating well, maintaining an exercise routine, and quitting smoking are all healthy lifestyle choices that can improve your overall health while living with HIV.

, Getting vaccinated for the flu each year will help to reduce your chances of catching any strains of the flu. One shot will protect you from several strains of the flu virus. For someone with a weakened immune system, this can mean the difference between getting very sick or being flu-free.


You may also be eligible for other vaccines depending upon the severity of your illness. Your doctor can provide you with additional details if you are eligible for more.
Since HIV is specifically a disease of the immune system, boosting your immunity through vaccines is an excellent preventative measure to avoid unnecessary infections.

, If you are infected with HIV but take your antiretroviral medications regularly, your blood tests may show that HIV is ""undetectable."" Note that this does not mean there is zero HIV virus in your body; it simply means that the levels are too low to be detected by the medical test.If this is the case for you, the likelihood of transmitting it to your sexual partner is extremely low, but not impossible.


To be safe, it is recommended to use condoms as added protection during sexual intercourse.
Another option is for your partner to prophylactically (preventatively) take antiretroviral medications as well, so that if any of the HIV virus is transmitted to them they are able to fight it off.
Note that, for anyone who has had sex with someone diagnosed with HIV (or even suspected of having HIV), it is important to have a blood test to see if you have contracted the virus. Knowing about it sooner rather than later is very important for effective treatment.

Don't avoid treatment and think the infection will just go away.,
Understand that untreated gonorrhea can increase your chances of HIV infection.,
Visit your nearest health clinic or your doctor's office.,
Follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment.",How to Treat Gonorrhea2," Without treatment, gonorrhea will cause serious health problems. Both males and females can experience a condition known as disseminated gonorrhea. The bacteria has entered the bloodstream and spread to the skin and joints. This leads to fevers, maculopapular skin rash (tiny raised painful circular lesions from the neck down), and severe joint pains.


Complications of gonorrhea for women include inflammation of the fallopian tubes leading to pelvic inflammatory disease (sever lower abdominal pain). This can lead to severe scars within the area causing future pregnancy complications and infertility. In addition, a untreated inflamed pelvis can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside of the uterus).
In males, a condition called epididymitis can develop leading to pain behind the testes and eventually infertility.

, Gonorrhea contains proteins that allow HIV to replicate itself quicker, increasing the likelihood of passing along HIV. Those who are negative for HIV but have gonorrhea are five times more likely to acquire the virus.


Do not engage in sexual activity till the you are cured of the symptoms, as you may pass it along to someone else. Advise your sexual partners for evaluation and treatment since gonorrhea can go undetected without symptoms at first.

, Explain your history and complaints. Your doctor or nurse may ask the following questions: When did you have sex last? Did you perform oral, anal, or vaginal sex? How many partners do you have? Do you use protection? Gonorrhea is a sexual transmitted disease that can spread through sexual activity. The more sexual active partners the higher the risk.


Drink some water before going to the office. Your doctor will take a urine sample to see any white blood cells (immune cells), blood, or hints of infection in the urine.
If you are female, a urine pregnancy test may be performed.
Confirmatory testing will always be performed. This is an infection that is required by law to be reported to the health department and the CDC.

, When gonorrhea is diagnosed, doctors also normally treat as if chlamydia is there as well, as there is a high rate of co-infection These two bacteria are very common sexually transmitted diseases and can lead to similar symptoms. Your doctor will provide treatment for both.


The healthcare provider will clean the area (usually shoulder muscle) with an alcohol swab and Inject a 250mg dose intramuscularly of ceftriaxone to treat the gonorrhea. This medication is part of the cephalosporin class of antibiotics and prevents growth of the gonorrhea cell wall.
In addition your doctor will prescribe you, or give you, a one time dose of 1 gram Azithromycin. A 7 day course of 100mg Doxycycline twice a day can be substituted for the azithromycin to treat for chlamydia. Both these drugs prevent important enzymes and structural components of gonorrhea from being formed by interrupting protein synthesis.

It also may help in reducing the severity of outbreaks. Try getting tea with it in it. Drink 3-4 cups of Echinacea tea a day. You can also get Echinacea as a supplement., There is some research indicating that certain supplements can help. For example, 1-3 grams of lysine/day may shorten the length of an outbreak. Some studies have indicated that it may be effective in reducing the number of outbreaks of oral herpes sores. However, the supplement should be taken for only about 3-4 weeks at most.


Be aware that lysine is an amino acid that may increase cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Make sure you are consulting your doctor before using supplements. Some supplements can interact with certain medications., There is no cure for HSV infections. The virus is likely to be with you forever. Although not a natural treatment, some cases of genital herpes are severe. These symptoms can be treated with anti-viral medicines. These can reduce the pain, discomfort, and the frequency of the outbreaks. These medications may reduce the risk of infecting another person, but they don’t eliminate the risk.


Common anti-viral medicines to treat HSV include Acyclovir (Zovirax), Famciclovir (Famvir), and Valacyclovir (Valtrex).
These medications are given generally for the first outbreak and help control subsequent outbreaks. For example, an 800 mg pill of Acyclovir is taken 5 times a day for 7-10 days.
The most common side effects with these medications are nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness and muscle aches."

Know the causes.,
Understand how the disease spreads.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Expect periodic outbreaks.,
Understand the potential complications.,
Get tested if you have genital sores.",How to Treat Genital Herpes Naturally3," Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection (STI). It can be caused by the herpes simplex type 1 or type 2 (HSV-1 or HSV-2) viruses. Most cases of genital herpes are caused by HSV-2. HSV-1 more often causes sores or fever blisters on the mouth and lips. , Genital herpes is spread by direct sexual contact, genitally, anally or orally, with someone who is infected. Transmission is more common if the individual has open sores, but HSV can be transmitted by a person without any obvious sores. Birth control doesn’t protect against HSV infection. Male or female condoms do not always protect you because the sores are not always located on the genitals, though condoms may decrease the risk.


You can infect your partner whether or not you are having an outbreak, although the risk is lowest between outbreaks.
If you have any oral lesions, you should not give oral sex or receive oral sex from someone who has oral lesions.
In men, the sores or lesions are usually on and around the penis or around the anus. In women, the sores may be around the genitals, the anus or located in the vagina. The sores or lesions in the vagina may not be noticed except during an examination and can cause discomfort and/or a vaginal discharge.
The only way to prevent infection is to avoid having vaginal, anal or oral sex., Many people with genital herpes don’t have symptoms. Others can have mild outbreaks while others have severe outbreaks. Because of this, someone can pass along the infection without even knowing they have HSV. If a person does have symptoms, they usually get sores. Then fluid-filled blisters can form around the genitals or the rectum. The blisters can break, leaving tender areas. The sores may show up within 2 weeks of infection and can last for 2-3 weeks.Other common symptoms include an itching, tingling or a burning feeling in the genitals or in the anal area, flu-like symptoms, including fever, aches and pains, pain in the legs, buttocks, or genital area, vaginal discharge, swollen glands usually located in the groin or along the neck, and pain when urinating or having a bowel movement.

, HSV infection can result in long-lasting and recurrent outbreaks. The virus can remain hidden for a long time without showing symptoms. There is no clear cause for the virus to become active again. However, outbreaks tend to occur during times of fatigue, stress, and illness. For women, it can often resurface during a period. The average number of outbreaks is around 4-5 the first year. After that, your body tends to build a better immune response. The frequency, and sometimes the symptoms, decrease as time goes on., HSV is particularly a problem for individuals with a weakened immune system. It is also problematic for women who are pregnant or who want to get pregnant. HSV infections can lead to miscarriages and premature delivery. A mother can infect her babies with HSV. This infection can be very dangerous.


Moms who are HSV generally are scheduled for a C-section because this reduces the risk of infection.
HSV infection may increase the risk for cervical cancer. Women with HSV infections should get regular pap smears., HSV can be diagnosed during an outbreak by examining the sores and taking a sample to be tested in a lab. Make an appointment with your physician for the testing. Taking a sample from the sore is generally not very painful, but if the area is very sore, you may experience some pain.


If you don't have obvious sores, your doctor can give you a blood test that checks for antibodies to the virus.
Ask your doctor if the sore may be the cause of other medical issues. These include fungal infections, Hand-Foot-and-Mouth disease, syphilis, and a Herpes zoster infection."

Wash the genital area.,
Apply the lice-killing product that you have selected.,
Pay attention to how much time you should leave the product on your pubic area.,
Rinse off the medication and dry thoroughly.,
Change into new, clean clothes.,
Wash all fabrics that could be contaminated.,
Repeat treatment if lice are still present.",How to Treat and Prevent Crabs2," Thoroughly clean your genital area before applying any kind of lice lotion or cream. Your skin will absorb the lotion better if dirt and dust are removed from the skin and pubic hair.


Right after washing and cleaning the genital area, be sure to dry it thoroughly as most of the creams and lotions need to be applied on dry and clean hair., Read and follow the package instructions carefully to get the most benefit from the product that you have chosen. Remember to ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to use the product.Thoroughly saturate the infested area with the product, according to the directions on the package.

, Shampoos may only need to be left on for about 10 minutes, but lotions and creams may need to be left on for 8-14 hours. Note the time when you apply the product and set a timer or watch the time., After you have left the product on for the indicated amount of time, rinse it off with warm water. Rinsing away the product will help to remove dead nits and lice from your skin. It is important to rinse the dead parasites away because they may lead to hygiene problems if left on your skin.Be sure to separate the towels you used from your other clothes and linens. Wash the towels separately to avoid cross-contamination to other clothing and linens.
In some cases where nits stay in the base of the hair, you can just remove them using your fingernails or a fine toothed comb.

, Make sure that you put on clean, fresh undergarments and clothing to prevent a recurrence of the infestation. Any clothes that you wore when you had crabs should be immediately laundered., Infested clothes, bed linens, and towels should be washed in hot water. The hotter your washing machine goes, the better. Use at least 130F water. All clothes and linens should also be dried in a hot dryer until they are completely dry.You should wash any soft materials that you used 2-3 days before your treatment.Infested blankets, quilts, and carpets can be stored in a sealed plastic bag for 1 to 2 weeks to eventually kill the lice. This way, they are not able to feed on any blood and subsequently die.

, You can repeat the procedure in about a week. Follow the directions on the box or from your doctor. Even if you think the crabs are gone, it's best to repeat treatment just to be sure.There are some cases where lice relocate to other areas and will come back right after treating your genital area; however, this doesn't happen often.

Comb your pubic hair.,
Apply petroleum jelly (Vaseline).,
Trim your pubic hair.",How to Treat and Prevent Crabs3," If you only have a few crabs, using a nit comb to remove pubic lice and nits is one of the simplest and most cost effective treatments for the parasite. The treatment is also time consuming as it can take up to 14 days to manually get rid of all lice and nits. It is very common to combine this technique with another natural treatment., Petroleum jelly suffocates the lice on your pubic hair. Apply petroleum jelly generously to the pubic area. Make sure that the jelly covers the base of the pubic hair to make it easier to remove nits with a nit comb. You may apply petroleum jelly as many times as needed to get rid of the lice and nits.


Be aware that regular petroleum jelly should not be used to treat pubic lice and nits in the eyebrows or eyelashes because it can be very irritating to the eye. However, your doctor can prescribe an ophthalmic grade petroleum jelly that can be applied to the eyebrows and eyelashes., Trimming pubic hair as short as possible will increase the effectiveness of other treatments for pubic lice, whether natural, over-the-counter, or prescription. It is important to note that just shaving pubic hair is not an effective treatment for pubic lice, as they may simply relocate to other hairy areas of the body."

Avoid any close contact or sexual contact.,
Limit your number of sexual partners.,
Tell any person you're in close contact with to get treated.,
Avoid sharing your personal things.,
Clean your bed sheets before using them again.",How to Treat and Prevent Crabs4," Since crabs are often sexually transmitted, it is best to avoid any sexual activity unless you are totally lice free. Any close contact such as sleeping with someone or staying too close to a person infested with crabs will increase your chances of getting them again.


Although using a latex or polyurethane condom protects against most STIs, condom use does not adequately protect against crabs., As with all STIs, the greater the number of your sexual partners, the greater your chances of getting – and spreading – crabs.It's possible, in the early stages, to not know you have crabs. Therefore, limiting your sexual activity is best., For their health, tell them that you are treating yourself for lice and they should get treatment as well. Talking to a girlfriend or boyfriend about your pubic lice may be embarrassing, but it avoids creating a larger problem – and they'll probably figure it out eventually regardless.


Don’t partake in any sexual contact with the person until they are treated, too. Both parties should be treated before engaging in any sexual activity again., Combs, towels, pillows, and blankets should not be shared with any other person if either of you is or was infested with crabs. It is always better to use your own personal things rather than borrowing to avoid any possible issues with others.Anything that has come into close contact with your hair and skin may be infested, from hairbrushes and combs to towels, sheets, and pillows. If there's any risk at all, just avoid it by sterilizing the item and keeping it to yourself.

, While you’re sleeping, lice are free to move anywhere and can settle in any part of the bed. Before and after your treatment, bed linens and pillow cases should be replaced and washed thoroughly to avoid any possible recurrences.Feel free to wash surfaces, like in your bathroom, too. Washing surfaces with warm water and disinfectant solutions will help immobilize and kill the organisms.
Washing clothes above the 30 °C (86 °F) mark on your washing machine along with detergent and conditioner will help keep your clothes free from infestation.

You may not be able to do it all at once, but setting the goal will help you chart your next steps., Writing down a specific list of the ways in which your addiction is negatively impacting your life can give you a jumpstart toward changing your behavior. Rather than framing the addictions effect in general terms (""It's destroying my life"" or ""I'm not reaching my potential""), write down the ways that your individual life has changed since your addiction began. Seeing it all written down on paper might be jarring, but having the list will help you through the tough steps to come., You know that you are addicted if you experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop using.Withdrawal symptoms are the opposite of how the drug makes you feel when you are under the influence. If you feel energized when you are high, then you feel extremely tired and groggy when you are in withdrawal. If you feel relaxed and happy when you are high, then you experience intense anxiety and agitation when you are in withdrawal. You may feel sick when you try to stop using, and you need to keep using to feel normal.


Keep a log of how you feel and how your addiction is affecting you physically. Depending on the drug you're using, it might be causing skin damage, organ damage, dental problems, and other physical issues. Even if the physical effects are subtle, like you've lost a lot of weight or your face is aging more quickly than it should, write them down.

, A drug addict may neglect responsibilities such as school attendance, work, family, and other duties like laundry, housework, car maintenance, paying bills, etc. When a person is addicted to a drug, their world revolves around using, recovering from the effects of using, and then getting more drugs.An addiction is not recreational or experimental use. It is a compulsion that requires intervention to bring it to an end.


Write down how often you’ve been at work or school lately. Reflect on how attentive you are to your responsibilities.
Think about whether the addiction has taken a financial toll. Write down how much money you spend to feed it every day, week, month, and year.

, Withdrawing from family members and friends because you are under the influence or experiencing withdrawal and you don’t feel like being around anyone. This behavior may baffle friends and family who wonder where you are or why you are acting strangely.


There may even be confrontations about the frequency of your drinking or drug use. These are all signs of an addiction. , Stealing and lying to others, especially those close to you like family and friends. It is not unusual for the addicted person to steal valuables or money to pay for more drugs. An addiction affects not only the body but it impairs thinking to the point that the addict can even consider stealing from others.


Lying goes hand in hand with the secretive nature of drug addiction as well as the shame the addict feels for their behavior.

, You may have given up hobbies and other interests because using drugs has been your primary focus. Imagine trying to give equal time to drug use as well as hobbies and personal interests (i.e., rock climbing, dance, stamp collecting, photography, playing an instrument, learning another language, and more).


Anyone who can still concentrate on their hobbies is not in the grips of an all-consuming chemical addiction.

, Continuing to use drugs even though it is creating problems with school, work, the legal system, family life and relationships, and health. For most people, being arrested would be so jarring that it would force you to reconsider the course of your life. But in a person who is dependent on drugs or alcohol, those consequences are forgotten or the memory fades as soon as the overpowering cravings to use return.


You may have been arrested for a DUI (driving under the influence) or for possession of a controlled substance.
Your relationships may be in trouble or they may have failed. If you have an addiction, friends and family may not want to be around you.

, Now that you've written down the negative stuff, focus on how much better your situation might be once you beat this. How will your life story change post-addiction? You'll minimize or eliminate many of those negatives, and you'll be able to make positive changes.

, Consult with a doctor who specializes in chemical addictions. This professional can give you guidance on treatment options for your particular drug addiction.


The doctor will then likely recommend that you check into a detox facility to begin the withdrawal process under medical supervision. This is especially important if you are withdrawing from alcohol, opiates or benzodiazepines. Withdrawal from these substances can have agonizing and sometimes life-threatening symptoms., , Barbiturates, methamphetamines, cocaine and crack, benzodiazepines, and alcohol withdrawal can all be life threatening, causing seizures, and in the case of cocaine and crack, respiratory failure, stroke, and convulsions.It’s important to detox under the care of a rehabilitation facility to help you deal with the physical effects of withdrawal.


Even if the substance does not have any life-threatening withdrawal symptoms, there are other side effects that can make withdrawal very uncomfortable, such as anxiousness and even hallucinations.Experiencing the withdrawal symptoms is part of what keeps you in the cycle of addiction. The best place to recover is in the hands of the professionals who can help you deal with all the effects of withdrawal from the drug.
If you’ve been arrested, your probation officer might allow you to attend treatment in lieu of jail time. Take advantage of this opportunity.

, As with many treatment programs that focus on chemical addiction, successful treatment includes individual and group counseling. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you identify the thought patterns that keep you stuck in the cycle of drug use.


A counselor might also use motivational interviewing to help you see where you are still ambivalent about making the commitment to change.To find a counselor that specializes in drug addiction counseling, get a recommendation from your doctor or rehabilitation facility.

, In order to beat drug addiction, you will need help in many different parts of your life. This is because drug addiction profoundly affects every aspect of your life. Be ready to seek help for your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing.You may also want to seriously consider working with a family therapist, a life coach, a job coach, a fitness coach, a financial advisor, or any other type of expert to help you navigate those areas you need help in that you want to turn into strengths.

, Evidence shows that addicts who have a strong network of support have much better success in recovery.12-Step Programs are the most popular types of self-help, peer support programs in the world.


Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a very well-known program. AA and other 12-step programs outline twelve specific steps “that are guidelines for nothing less than a total personality transformation.”Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is geared towards supporting individuals recovering from drug addiction.There are other peer-based groups that offer excellent support, such as SMART Recovery. This group is a 4-point program that addresses all types of addictions and compulsions.Don’t be afraid to try several options before you find what works best for you.
Search the Alcoholics Anonymous Narcotics Anonymous websites to find local support groups.
Recognize that your addiction is a disease. Addiction is a disease that alters brain structure and functioning.When you acknowledge that you’re suffering from a disease, you can address your addiction more readily.

, Many peer-based support groups assign sponsors to new members. The sponsor is a recovering addict who will help you through the steps of the recovery program., Support groups will help you realize that there are people who’ve been through similar experiences as you. They feel just as desperate and ashamed as you do. Giving and receiving support can be a useful way to heal and become responsible., In order to break old habits, you might have to plan out every hour of your day. This will help you develop new routines that do not include drugs. Establish routines that center around the goals you want to accomplish, such as finishing school, raising a family, or going to work. Eventually, you will develop healthy habits that not only distract you from using drugs, but also will help you achieve your life goals.

, This will help you see exactly what you will accomplish throughout the day. Create a simple daily planner. Keep track of daily things that you need to accomplish and then check them off.


If you get stuck, have a place for notes where you write down who can help you with this. Never give yourself a dead end.
If you don’t have any family or friends to help you with completing the things on your list, it’s perfectly acceptable to bring your list to your counseling session and work out your difficulties with your counselor or psychologist.

, Another part of breaking old habits is to practice uncompromising honesty with yourself about where you go and who you interact with. The pull to reconnect with those people and places that involved drug use will be strong. Good planning and brutal honesty is required to keep you on your path to success.


For example, don’t try to talk yourself into going to places where you used to hang out to test your own strength. Likewise, don’t think that it is okay to see a person you did drugs with all the time. These are just rationalizations, or ways for you to convince yourself to go back to using drugs again. Don’t fall victim to these rationalizations.

, Recognize that, beyond the physical cravings for the drug, you might have emotional connections and ties. You might yearn for the way things used to be. Know that it takes time to adjust, and you can and will adjust if you stick to your plan for recovery.

, Find people who will support you in your efforts to beat drug addiction. Caring family and friends likely want to help you get healthy.


You can also choose people who have been through a similar situation. They can help you stick to your goals.Choose people who do not drink or do drugs, so that you won’t have to put yourself in tempting situations.

, Getting regular exercise can be an excellent way of handling the stress of beating drug addiction.


It can be a good idea to join a gym or work with a personal trainer. This will help make you more accountable to improving your health.

, Find a nutrition program offered through your community. Some programs are offered through the county, and others through local hospitals. Getting your body back on track can also mean eating properly and taking care of your nutrition, which may have been damaged by your drug use.

, Yoga is a form of exercise and meditation that can benefit your body and mind. Carve out 15-30 minutes at least a few times a week to give yourself time to manage the stress of coping with urges to use alcohol or drugs.

, Meditation can be an excellent way to manage stress and focus on breathing and body awareness. Meditate to calm yourself as you confront urges to use alcohol or drugs.


Find a comfortable and quiet spot to sit for 10-15 minutes.
Focus on your breath, inhaling deeply and steadily.
As thoughts pass through your mind, release them without judgment. Turn your attention back to your breath.

, Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese healing method that places needles at certain pressure points on your body. This method will help you address long-term withdrawal symptoms and discomfort.


Check with your health insurance provider to determine if acupuncture treatment is covered by your policy.

, Continue counseling for as long as you need support. You may want to also bring your family to counseling sessions to work out problems.

, This plan will involve how to manage temptations and cravings when they occur, how to deal with boredom and discouragement, and learning how to meet responsibilities that have been neglected. Living without drugs is a lifestyle. It is part of every aspect of life (such as relationships, parenting, work, socializing, meeting obligations, interacting with others, etc.).


Think about how you will address each of these aspects of life in order to remove drugs from them.
Write down ideas of how you will handle situations, such as stressful conversations, social gatherings, and so on., Write down the goals that you’d like to accomplish. These can be small things, such as taking a shower every day or eating a proper meal every day. They may also be larger goals, such as getting a job or visiting the dentist.


Keep track of your progress on these goals every week. Even small accomplishments are worth noting. You will start to see improvement and progress, which will motivate you to keep going.

, If you start to feel like you’re going to start using again, try urge surfing. This is a mindfulness relapse prevention technique. When you suppress urges, you tend to make the urges worse. By recognizing and accepting urges, you will be able to ride them out, or “surf” them.Recognize the urges that you feel about your addiction. Be conscious about the feelings and thoughts that you experience.
Rate your urge from 1 to 10 (1 being hardly any urge to 10 being a pressing urge). Wait for 10 minutes. Busy yourself with an activity, such as cleaning the junk out of your car, or writing a list, or putting away laundry. Check with your urge again to gauge its level. If you still experience a high level of urge, continue busying yourself with another activity. , Don’t visit the places where you used to obtain or use drugs. Don’t associate with the people who were your drinking buddies.


The flip side here is to frequent places that you don’t associate with drugs or drink. You may develop new hobbies, such as rock climbing, knitting, hiking or gardening.

, Keep yourself busy by getting a job, even if it’s part time. This will also start building up your self-worth as you bring home a paycheck.


Deposit your paychecks in the bank and save the money.
You might also think about volunteering if you don’t want to get a job. Having commitments to other people will help you stay on track.

, Once the worst has passed, and your body and mind are no longer consumed by withdrawal, spend your time building the life you want to live. Nourish your relationships with the people you love, work hard at your job, and throw yourself into hobbies and past times that are meaningful to you.


During this time, you should continue going to meetings with your support group and continue meeting with your therapist. The process of beating a drug addiction is not a quick one, so don't declare yourself cured when things start to go well.

Be aware of acceptable doses of OTC pain medications.,
Understand the risks of overusing OTC drugs.The greatest risk associated with excessive Acetaminophen (Tylenol) use is the possibility of liver toxicity.,
Consult your doctor if you are unable to manage your pain without exceeding the recommended daily dosage of OTC drugs.,
Lose weight to reduce your chronic pain.If you are suffering from chronic pain related to osteoarthritis, back pain, or other muscular or skeletal issues, being overweight simply adds to the stress and strain on your body.,
Increase your exercise to reduce pain.If you have an injury that makes it challenging to do specific activities (as in, the injury itself is the source of your pain), you will of course want to avoid exercising in a way that worsens your pain; however, there are plenty of forms of exercise that you can try which put very little load on your body, such as riding a stationary bike, swimming, or pool running.,
Improve your diet to decrease inflammation.Chronic pain is often linked to inflammation, and your diet can play a huge role in either worsening or improving the levels of inflammation in your body.,
Consider a topical painkiller.Taking oral over-the-counter painkillers is more concerning when it comes to potential side effects in the long run than their topical counterparts.,
Talk to your doctor about prescription-strength pain medications instead of OTC drugs.While OTC painkillers may, at first glance, seem less harmful than prescription-strength pain medications, this is not always true.,
Tailor your choice of medication to the underlying illness to avoid reliance on OTC drugs.It is always important to consider the actual source (that is, the cause) of your pain, and to tailor your choice of medications accordingly.,
Use heat/cold therapy and/or massage for muscles injuries, aches and pains.Applying ice (cold therapy) is generally advised in the first few days immediately following an injury.,
Try herbal remedies.One option for pain control is to apply topical capsaicin to the skin over sore areas.,
Visit an alternative practitioner for further pain-relief strategies.,
Avoid activities or work duties that exacerbate your pain.,
Consult an occupational therapist to modify your home environment and thus reduce triggers of your pain.,
Consider surgery to resolve the underlying issue.Depending upon the underlying reason for your chronic pain, surgery may be very helpful in alleviating or reducing your pain.",How to Avoid Overusing OTC Drugs for Chronic Pain," The most commonly used classes of OTC pain medications include Acetaminophen (Tylenol), and a class of drugs called ""NSAIDs."" NSAIDs stand for ""nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"" and include medications such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and Naproxen sodium (Aleve).Aspirin is also technically an NSAID, although it more frequently used in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes than it is in easing chronic pain.


OTC pain medications are generally safe to take in the short-term (meaning for less than 10 days at a time), as long as you adhere to the dosing instructions on the bottle and do not exceed them.
It is generally okay to have 500–1000 mg of Acetaminophen (Tylenol) every four to six hours as needed. However, if you consume moderate to heavy alcohol, your usage needs to be less and you should either temporarily reduce your consumption of alcohol, or speak to your doctor about a dosage that is safe for you.
It is generally okay to have 400–800 mg of Ibuprofen (such as Advil) every four to six hours as needed.
Note that the dosage for OTC drugs is smaller in children, and specific instructions will be present on the bottle.
If you need to use OTC meds for more than 10 days to manage your pain, it is always advisable to book an appointment with your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits of doing so. Your doctor can also diagnose any underlying conditions (the root cause of your pain) at this time, and possibly advise different treatment options that may be more useful for you (depending, of course, upon what specifically is causing your pain).;
, NSAIDs such as Advil should not be taken without first consulting a doctor if you have problems with stomach ulcers, or are on a blood thinning medication such as Warfarin or Coumadin (as NSAIDs can increase your risk of bleeding).


Another risk of overusing OTC drugs is when people inadvertently overdose by continuing with the maximum dosage of Acetaminophen or NSAIDs while simultaneously taking an OTC ""cold or flu"" medication that happens to contain the same ingredients.
If you take a cold or flu medication that already contains Acetaminophen or NSAIDs, you may inadvertently exceed the maximum recommended dose and put yourself at risk of potentially serious side effects.
Tylenol can irritate the stomach and cause ulcers and gastritis. This can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Special care should be taken with those who drink alcohol.
Always read the label of cold and flu medications carefully to see what ingredients are present in the mixture.

, If you need OTC drugs for more than 10 days, book an appointment with your physician to do a more detailed assessment of your pain, and to look into alternative modes of treatment that may be more effective (and also safer) for you moving forward.


Also consult your doctor if you have other health concerns, such as ongoing heart disease, kidney disease, or liver disease, prior to using OTC medications for your pain.

, Being overweight is known to worsen symptoms of both arthritis and back pain; therefore, if you are above your ideal body weight, now may be the time to look into strategies for weight loss, which will not only improve your overall health but may also make a notable difference in decreasing your pain.


One way to lose weight is by increasing your fat-burning exercise. Aerobic exercise such as jogging, brisk walking, riding a bike, or swimming is excellent as a strategy to burn fat and to lose weight.
Also modifying your diet to include healthier choices and smaller portions can make a big difference in losing weight.
Interestingly enough, studies have recently shown that being overweight not only adds stress and strain to your body (potentially increasing chronic pain that way), but it can also worsen chronic pain via chemical methods. What this means is that the fat particles that are stored in your body actually increase inflammation and worsen pain by chemical and molecular pathways, apart and aside from the pain of carrying the extra weight around!

, Depending on the cause of your pain, you may also find that activities such as brisk walking, jogging, or playing sports is something that your body can tolerate.


The benefits of exercise are numerous, including the fact that it can have a very positive impact on reducing chronic pain.
Exercise releases natural painkillers called endorphins in the brain, which work to diminish pain.
Also, exercise can strengthen your body overall, leading to reduced stress and strain on arthritic joints, sore backs, etc.
Exercise also enhances your long-term mobility and has been shown to improve your day-to-day function.

, Using dietary strategies to reduce inflammation can in turn greatly diminish your chronic pain, and reduce your need for OTC drugs to control the pain. Dietary strategies to try include:


Add turmeric as a spice to the food you cook. Turmeric is a known anti-inflammatory, and adding a small amount of it to your meals at least once a day can make a noticeable difference in reducing your inflammation levels.
Avoid consuming too much sugar or processed foods. Sugar and processed foods increase inflammation, and hence may be correlated to a worsening of your pain.
Eat more vegetables and fruits, both of which decrease inflammation.
Note that dietary changes will not be an immediate fix for your pain; rather, they will make a difference that gradually becomes more noticeable the longer you keep it up.
Practice dedication to a healthier and more anti-inflammatory diet for a couple of months and you may surprise yourself with the effectiveness of the results.

, This is because oral medications (taken in pill form) can have an impact throughout the body, while topical medications (applied on the skin) tend to act only at the location of the injury or of the chronic pain; therefore, if you have not yet tried topical pain medications, this is certainly something worth looking into.


You can try a topical anti-inflammatory such as Diclofenac (Voltaren), applied at the site of the injury.
You can also try alternatives such as capsaicin cream.
Speak to your doctor or pharmacist for further information if topical painkillers are of interest to you.
In general, these can also be purchased over-the-counter, with dosing instructions on the bottle.

, This is because you may need to take so much of the OTC medications, on a continual day-to-day basis, that the side effects of this may become more worrisome than simply opting for a stronger medication altogether.


Depending upon the reason for your pain, as well as the severity of it (and any other underlying medical conditions you may have), your doctor can help you to decide upon the ideal prescription-strength pain medication to try.
A first-line option is often Tylenol #3, which contains a combination of Acetaminophen (Tylenol) with Codeine. This is a good alternative if you need something for a short period of time to resolve the pain.
Tramadol is another option, as are opioid narcotics for pain that cannot be treated by any other means (opioids tend to be used as a last resort for pain that cannot be controlled with other strategies). Tramadol is good for people in recovery or suffering from addiction because it is not habit forming.
Be very cautious when it comes to treating pain with opioids, as they are highly addictive. Consider signing a pain contract with your doctor and ask about seeing a pain specialist.

, For instance, nerve-related pain (called ""neuropathic pain"") is treated differently than the pain of a musculoskeletal injury, which is treated differently than pain caused from muscle spasms. Talk to your doctor about which medication would best target the actual source of your pain, so as to diminish the degree to which you rely on nonspecific over-the-counter pain medications which may not be effectively targeting the root cause of your pain.


For neuropathic (nerve-related) pain, tricyclic antidepressants are a good option to consider. Gabapentin is a good choice for neuropathic pain. Dose should be orally 300–3600 mg/day depending on response to treatment and severity of symptoms.
For the chronic pain of irritable bowel syndrome, antispasmodics may be of help if dietary changes aren't helping. For moderate to severe IBS, your doctor may suggest taking rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 14.
For ongoing back pain, a muscle relaxant may ease symptoms.
There are a myriad of pain treatments available, and it is important to talk to your physician about which would be most helpful for your specific medical condition.

, Ice helps to diminish inflammation in the immediate phases following the injury, and as such to decrease pain in the area. Heat is recommended for more chronic injuries and/or for generalized sore muscles. You can use a heating pad, or simply opt for a hot bath.


Massage may also help to ease muscle aches and pains, and to speed the rate at which injuries heal.
If you have extended health coverage through your work or another form of insurance, you may get partial or complete coverage for massage therapy.

, Other options include consuming ginger (which helps to decrease inflammation), feverfew, and/or adding turmeric as a spice to home-cooked meals.



Click here for further information on how to relieve chronic pain naturally.

, If you are interested in trying options for pain control that fall outside of the traditional medical model, you may wish to book an appointment with an acupuncturist, a naturopath, or a hypnotist to discuss alternative healing options. Your work benefits may even offer you coverage for alternative therapies such as those provided by an acupuncturist or a naturopath, so it is certainly worth looking into.

, Although it almost goes without saying, you should avoid any physical activities or duties at work that worsen (or are the source of) your chronic pain. If you find that work is exacerbating your pain, speak to your boss about alternate duties you could take on, or look into any disability insurance that you may be eligible for if you need to take time off to recover (or if you are no longer able to continue in a certain line of work).


For instance, if you have a back injury, you should avoid activities that involve heavy lifting (as well as avoiding positions that trigger your back pain, such as sitting or standing for long periods of time).
If you have an injury such as carpal tunnel syndrome, you should avoid activities such as typing and ongoing computer use that may worsen your symptoms, if at all possible.

, If you are struggling getting around your home (such as climbing the stairs, getting in the shower, or using the toilet) due to chronic pain, you may benefit from modifications to your home that can make these day-to-day tasks easier in light of your pain-related disability. Occupational therapists (OTs) are specifically trained to make modifications to your home environment to optimize the ease with which you can perform day-to-day tasks.


Your family doctor can provide you with a referral to see an occupational therapist. Having a formal referral may allow you to receive insurance coverage for OT services.You can also look up occupational therapists in your area and arrange to see one privately. However, seeing one privately (without a physician's referral) is unlikely to qualify you for coverage.

, It may diminish your reliance on pain medications, both OTC and prescription, and it may help you to regain function that you did not have previously. Speak to your doctor to see if surgery is an option for you.


If the source of your pain is a specific area of your body — such as knee pain or shoulder pain — you may be eligible for arthroscopic joint surgery to ""debride"" (clean out) the joint and to hopefully reduce the abnormality that was causing the pain.
If you have more generalized chronic pain, a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon experienced in conducting surgery for chronic pain may be able to help you."

Identify long-term health issues.",How to Recognize the Signs of Meth Abuse1," Notice any changes in the person’s physical appearance. Physical signs are very common among people who abuse meth, unlike with other drugs which may have more subtle effects. Use your observation skills. Do you notice anything different about how the person looks? Any physical illness or complaints? Some common physicals signs of meth use are:Excessive weight loss due to low appetite.
Dilated pupils.
Eyes looking droopy, tired, or having dark circles (this can be due to loss of sleep).
Eye twitching.;
, Meth can adversely affect teeth, turning them brown and causing decay or ""meth mouth.""The person may also have red or sore gums because of damage caused by meth.


This may look like rotten or browning teeth.
The person may also have missing teeth.
You can look up pictures of meth mouth online and compare.

, You will notice track marks on the person's arms if the drug is being injected, or nose bleeds if the drug is being snorted. There may also be burn marks on the person's lips or fingers if the drug is smoked using hot glass or a metallic pipe., If a person is using meth, they will often give off a very bad odor. This is due to a combination of the drug use itself and the person forgetting to wash while they are using. Sometimes the odor is similar to the smell of ammonia., Meth users often start to look old before their time because their skin is damaged, becoming rough and itchy, and their hair can start to fall out., Skin lesions are very common in meth users due to compulsive scratching at the face.Look for open sores on the face.
Observe if the person picks or scratches at his face.
The lesions often become infected and result in sores and scars.

, Meth users are more prone to diseases, including high blood pressure and heart diseases. They may also pass away at an early age as a result.The following medical issues can be caused by meth use:


Hypertension, or high blood pressure.Tachycardia, a rapid heart beat.Hyperthermia, or a body temperature that is above normal.Heart attack, stroke, seizures, and renal/liver failure can result from large doses of meth.Respiratory symptoms, such as bronchitis, if meth is smoked.Risk for HIV and hepatitis C increase due to risky sexual behaviors and needle sharing."

Consider why you are quitting methadone.,
Speak with an addiction specialist.,
Set up a support network of friends and family.,
Do not try to quit “cold turkey.” The symptoms of methadone withdrawal are painful enough that quitting suddenly is simply not realistic.,
Be aware that quitting is a long-term process.,
Sign up with an inpatient program if possible.,
Reduce methadone use gradually.,
Taper with methadone.,
Maintain or taper with buprenorphine-naxolone (Subuxone).,
Get counseling.,
Join a support group.,
Use clonidine or lofexidine to treat lingering withdrawal symptoms.While clonidine is not as effective as buprenorphine during detox, it is useful in reducing lingering flu-like symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping, all of which may last up to eight months.,
Ask your doctor about using trazodone, zaleplon or zolpidem to treat insomnia.,
Treat the other lingering symptoms of withdrawal.",How to Withdraw from Methadone," If you are taking methadone as a maintenance drug to aid in recovering from an opiate addiction, you are probably better off sticking with it. Methadone maintenance has no significant negative health effects, and patients who remain on methadone show gradual but steady improvements in health and functioning, while those who quit worsen in both aspects and have a much higher tendency to relapse into opiate use., You will need both medical and psychological support to get off of methadone. It is important to note that not all doctors are able to prescribe withdrawal drugs like suboxone, because it requires a special training and approval from the government, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the Unites States. Physicians with the proper training can tailor a withdrawal program to suit your needs and prescribe appropriate withdrawal drugs.

, Quitting methadone is not easy. You will suffer withdrawal symptoms, and you will need to either carefully reduce your methadone intake over time or take medications regularly to substitute for methadone. Especially if you are quitting in an out-patient setting, it is extremely helpful to have friends and family who can hold you accountable and remind you to stay on course.

, They typically begin within 30 hours of last methadone exposure and include:Early symptoms: agitation, anxiety, muscle aches, insomnia, runny nose, sweating, and yawning
Late symptoms: abdominal cramping, diarrhea, dilated pupils, goose bumps, nausea, vomiting

, Methadone withdrawal symptoms typically begin between 24 – 36 hours after the last dose and peak between 96 and 144 hours. While the detox process is usually considered over after five to seven days, milder symptoms may last for weeks, and “abstinence syndrome” — including unease, fatigue, insomnia, and irritability — can last for up to eight months., Inpatient programs take less time and are up to four times as effective at achieving complete withdrawal.Check here to find a clinic near you.

, There are two methods typically used: tapering the amount of methadone used or substituting buprenorphine and tapering or maintaining. Long-term maintenance with buprenorphine, accompanied by counseling and support groups, has been shown to produce the best rate of success.Rapid detox programs using naltrexone to induce withdrawal can shorten peak withdrawal symptoms to two to three days, but there is no evidence regarding the rates of long-term abstinence for such programs.Rapid detox under anesthesia should be avoided. It does not improve long-term results and carries a significant risk of death due to pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).Maintenance on naltrexone is another option. It blocks the nerve receptors that opiates use, meaning that users of naltrexone will be unable to get high on opiates; however, relapse rates are very high for naltrexone treatments.

, There are two methods of tapering: a relatively quick method and a more recently prescribed long term method. In both cases, clonidine is often given to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal.


The more traditional tapering method usually takes five to seven weeks. Patients first rapidly reduce their use to 30 mg per day before beginning tapering at a typical rate of 5 mg per week.Some clinics now recommend a more drawn-out tapering over six months to a year. The dose is reduced by 5 mg every three to 14 days, and then even more slowly after reaching 20 mg., Buprenorphine maintenance has been shown to be more effective than simply quitting methadone, while tapering with buprenoprhine is just as effective as tapering with methadone, and helps withdrawal symptoms to fade more quickly.Patients must first reduce their methadone use to 40 mg/day for a week before beginning to substitute buprenorphine for methadone. Starting 36 hours after the last dose of methadone, the oral drug buprenorphine can be used to reduce symptoms of withdrawal.Initial dose is 2 – 4 mg of buprenorphine. If that is tolerated, a second 2 – 4 mg does is given an hour later, and then 4 mg six to eight hours later, for a total day one dose of 8 –12 mg.
A dose of 12 – 16 mg is reached by day two or three and should suppress most symptoms of withdrawal from methadone, with additional symptoms treated by clonidine.
Once the patient’s withdrawal symptoms are stabilized, buprenorphine can be continued as a long-term maintenance drug, or can be tapered off over two to three weeks.
Once you have been weaned off methadone, your primary care provider may also be able to prescribe another form of buprenorphine (Butrans) which is available in patch or oral form.

, Your doctor or the clinic you are visiting will be able to put you in touch with an experienced opiate-withdrawal counselor. Whether it is one-on-one, group, or in a family setting, counseling in conjunction with buprenorphine maintenance or detox has been shown to be much more effective than maintenance or detox alone., Support groups like Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery can be extremely helpful for the recovering patient. One study found that recovering patients attending NA and AA programs had an 81% abstinence rate, compared to a 26% abstinence rate among non-attendees.Don't force yourself to go through the pain of methadone withdrawal alone. There are thousands of other recovering patients just like you, who can not only give you advice and support, but who draw inspiration from you.

, Lofexidine is a drug with a similar pathway, recently approved in the UK, which can reduce symptoms with fewer side effects., Insomnia is a common symptom of withdrawal from methadone. Zaleplon and zolpidem work like benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, but without the same withdrawal symptoms.Trazodone is an antidepressant that regulates serotonin levels, thereby aiding sleep., Muscle cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and flu-like symptoms are most likely during detox, but such symptoms can linger for weeks. Aches and diarrhea can be treated with over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen (Advil) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol). Your doctor may prescribe prochlorperazine (Compazine) or ondansetron (Zofran) for nausea."

Take a deep breath and close your eyes.,
Grab a pen and paper (or a computer) and make six columns:


Situation: What is going on right now?,
Take contrary action.,
List what you are grateful for.,
Consider the people or things that you have in your life that you would lose if you were high.,
Call someone for help.,
Go to a meeting.,
Look into non-12 step alternatives.",How to Manage Triggers to Use Drugs and Alcohol,"  Inhale slowly to a count of three, then pause.  Hold for three seconds.  Exhale slowly through your mouth to a count of four.  Repeat.


Envision, in as much detail as you can, the most beautiful place that you can imagine. Perhaps it's a tropical paradise where you are standing on a beach watching the sunset.  What colors do you see? Notice all the colors and name them to yourself. Maybe you see a vibrant array of crimson, indigo, azure, and the pale golden light of the sun. Be here as fully as you can. Be present in every way. How does this place feel? Feel the cool breeze rushing through your hair and tickling your skin. Imagine you are standing there, with bare feet pressed firmly upon the shore, as sand squishes between your toes. What sounds do you hear? Maybe the sound of seagulls passing by or the crashing of the waves that gradually calm to a gentle ebb and flow. What smells or tastes do you notice?  Perhaps the salty sea breeze leaves its taste upon your tongue.  Savor it.  
When you have a crystal clear image of this place, with your eyes still closed, squeeze the space between your thumb and index finger with your other hand and hold firmly until the count of ten.  Release.  This is known in psychology as ""anchoring.""  This secures the image in your mind.  Anytime in the future that you feel a craving or experience stress, close your eyes and squeeze the space between your thumb and index finger.  The image of your safe place will come to mind.;
,  For example, you could write, ""I want to get high"" or ""My boyfriend broke up with me."" Move to the next column.  
Thoughts: Write down what thoughts are going through your mind at the moment.""  For example, ""I can't stay sober,"" ""I am weak,"" ""I hate my boyfriend,"" and so on.  The thoughts may even be negative ones you have toward yourself.  Write them all down.  It's important to get them all out.
Feelings: Write what feelings are coming up for you -  anger, sadness, loneliness, and so on.  If you list ""anger"" as one of your emotions, go deeper.  Anger is what is known as a ""secondary emotion.""  This means that it is the result of other underlying emotions.  Usually underneath anger is fear, sadness/pain, guilt and/or shame.  Identify all of them. Move on to the next column.
Actions I Took: List what actions you have taken or currently are taking to deal with the situation.  For example, ""I'm about to call my dealer,"" or ""I hung up on my boyfriend after calling him awful names.""
Other Ways of Seeing This: Come up with some other ways of looking at the situation.  For instance, in your ""Thought"" column, if you wrote down, ""I'm a weak person for wanting to use,"" you could reframe by saying, ""I'm a strong person for wanting to get better,"" or ""I am in control of the actions I take in this moment.""  
New Actions I Can Take: List what other actions you could take instead.  For example, ""I can apologize to someone I hurt,"" ""I can delete my dealer's number,"" or ""I will reach out for help.""  This step is important because this is where your power lies. We can't control other people or situations, but we can control how we respond to them.  Be brutally honest with what you write down.  No one has to see this list.  It is for your eyes only.  You can tear it up afterwards or keep it in a safe spot to look at later on.

,  This means doing something positive that we would not normally do in that situation.  For instance, your natural tendency may be to call your dealer.  When you take contrary action, you not only decide not to call your dealer, but you do the opposite.  This may mean deleting him or her from your phone, calling a friend, or going to a meeting.  Whatever you do, reach out to healthy people.

,  It seems like the last thing that may be on your mind - finding something to be happy about.  However, this can go a long way in changing your current state of mind.  Maybe you are grateful for your family, the job you got that you really enjoy, the new man/woman you just met the other day.  It could be as simple as the sunshine, a brand new day, and the chance to start over and do things differently.  There is always something to be grateful for, even if it doesn't seem like it.

,  What blessings do you have as a result of being sober?  Maybe it's a loving relationship that depends on your health and sobriety.  Maybe it's the opportunity to pursue your dreams. You can't make them come true when you're high.

,  Call a friend for support - a sober friend who has your best interests at heart.  Call a sponsor if you have one.  If you don't, it is highly recommended that you find one. A sponsor is there to help you in emergency situations in case you are having cravings to drink or use.

,  Alcoholics Anonymous has a listing of meetings in your area.There is also Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Love and Sex Addicts Anonymous, among many others.  Meetings will help you meet and connect with others who understand what you are going through and will be there in times of need.

,  If the 12 step programs don't appeal to you, there are other options available.  SMART Recovery is a program that helps people with substance abuse get sober, and the meetings are set up much like a therapy group, where you can openly talk about what you are experiencing.Unlike AA, ""crosstalk"" is allowed, so others can offer you feedback if you are open to hearing it.

Look for the immediate effects.,
Watch out for longer term signs.,
Search for life disturbances.,
Look for signs of impaired thinking.,
Catch signs of withdrawal.",How to Recognize the Signs of Meth Abuse2," The effects of meth may last several hours to a day or so, depending on the use.After using methamphetamine the person will likely experience:


Euphoria (due to increased dopamine in the brain).Increase in alertness.Increased cortisol levels (stress hormone).Decreased anxiety.Increased confidence.Improved attention and concentration.Decreased appetite.Hypersexuality or an increase in libido.Increased energy.Hyperactivity – as evidenced by excessive talking and inability to sleep.
Higher doses of meth can cause: increased anxiety, restlessness, compulsive behaviors, and tremors (physical shaking). These symptoms are often called tweaking., Due to chemical changes in the brain, some psychological symptoms are also visible. These psychological signs may include the following symptoms and might indicate meth use:


Impaired judgment or inhibition.Hallucinations or delusions, such as seeing or hearing things which others do not.Aggressive behaviors upon unavailability of drug (i.e. picking an argument for no reason).Increased anxiety or depression.Paranoia or believing that somebody is out to get him.Social isolation.Insomnia., Social, occupational, and functional disturbances are very common among people who abuse meth.The school/college life, work life and/or social life of people who use meth is impaired. You can detect signs of these disturbances by doing the following:


Remain in touch with teachers, peers and close friends. They can help you to keep track of the person's recent activities.
Keep in touch with colleagues, if the person is employed. They can tell you how the person behaves while at work and can fill you in on their daily routine, e.g when they arrive at work, when they leave, etc.
Observe the legal, social and financial condition of the person who is suspected of being a meth abuser. Poor social functioning, financial trouble and frequent legal issues are commonly the result of meth abuse., This may show up as reduced cognition or deteriorated memory. Many brain cells are damaged as a result of continuous meth use. This damage is caused by the many caustic chemicals used in meth preparation, and can manifest itself in slower brain function and loss of memory. Look for:Attention issues.
Issues with working memory or solving problems.
Lowered decision-making skills.

, Withdrawal signs occur when a habitual abuser stops taking the drug.Most symptoms of withdrawal typically subside around seven to ten days after taking meth.Withdrawal symptoms from meth use are mostly psychological and not as physical as other drugs. They include:Anhedonia or decreased motivation.
Irritability, anxiety, or depression.
Lower frustration tolerance.
Low energy or fatigue.
Sleepiness.
Impaired social functioning.
Inability to concentrate.
Loss of sexual interest.
Possible suicidality or thoughts of harming one’s self.
Intense craving for the drug – may last up to five weeks.

Keep an eye on the activities of the person.,
Notice hyperactivity and impulsivity.Being hyperactive, impulsive, and having low judgment are commonly associated with meth use.,
Pay attention to financial issues.,
Pay attention to the company your loved one keeps.,
Be aware of secretive behavior and social isolation.,
Look for a meth apparatus in the person's living area.",How to Recognize the Signs of Meth Abuse3," The observation of certain activities is very important in identifying the signs of meth abuse. Some common social problems faced by those who abuse meth are:


Heightened and unsafe sexual activity due to drug effects like confusion and inability to make decisions.Excessive aggression leading to relationship problems with parents, peers and siblings.Keeping company with those who either abuse drugs or have easy access to drugs.

, Pay attention to the person's behaviors and notice if they are uncharacteristic of the individual.


Notice excessive talking.For example, the person may try to finish others sentences and give advice to others, whether he knows anything about the topic being discussed or not.
Impulsivity may mean the person behaves recklessly and refuses to worry about the outcomes of his risky behavior., Meth users often have financial issues due to their drug use. For example, some meth users may spend all of their money to get the drug.Keep in mind that it is often difficult for teenagers, who only get pocket money from their parents, to afford drugs, so they find ways to make up for this shortage of money through various means.Some signs of financial issues are:


Inability to meet financial needs because of excessive spending on drug related activities like buying drugs or supplying drugs for a party. Notice unpaid bills or not being able to afford normal items like food.
Excessive debt as a result of asking for money from others in order to finance their drug habit.
Problems with friends and peers over money issues, due to the drug user's inability to pay back debts.
Problem with parents and complaints over not having any money.
Inability to report where the money is being spent when asked.
Stealing.

, Meth users tend to hang around with other people who abuse drugs. This is one of the easiest ways to detect drug abuse. Meth abusers often have the following kind of company:


People who abuse meth or any other drug.
People who have easy access to drugs.
People who don't pose a threat — i.e. those who won't tell the drug user's family or criticize him for his addiction.

, When using, the person may spend the whole day in his room with a closed door, not allowing anyone to enter. Additionally, the person will behave in a very closed off, secretive manner to hide their drug use., If you find certain drug taking apparatus in the person's headquarters, it is a pretty definite indication that the person is taking meth (or another drug).Items to look out for include:The tube of a ballpoint pen or surgical tubing that might have been used to sniff meth.
A crumpled can of aluminum foil.
A small bag of white powder or crystals.
A soda can with a hole on one of its sides.
A syringe that might be used to inject drugs.

"
Understand the patterns of low intensity users.,
Be aware of high intensity abusers.,
Recognize the signs of binge use.",How to Recognize the Signs of Meth Abuse4," These abusers intake meth just to enjoy its so-called benefits, such as feeling energetic, euphoric, experiencing increased alertness and sense of power.They are not psychologically addicted to the drug and they mostly take it by swallowing or snorting it.


Low intensity users may include truck drivers trying to stay alert while driving long distances, workers trying to stay awake through overnight or taxing shifts, a homemaker trying to juggle housework, raising kids, and trying to be a good or ""perfect"" spouse., High intensity abusers prefer taking meth by injecting or smoking it.They do so to feel high or aroused. They may become psychologically and physical addicted. They continuously intake large amounts of the drug.

, Binge abusers need to take more meth every few hours to maintain a high.They will do this for several days.


After taking the drug, binge users feel mentally and physically active. They feel a huge rush or high, but can quickly crash.Other common symptoms of binge users include: sleeplessness, hallucinations, paranoia, irritability, and unprovoked aggression.Binge users often experience punding which is repeated compulsive behaviors such as sorting objects or cleaning.Several hours after their last binge, the person may sleep for many days."

Many people use language that dehumanizes people who are addicted to substances, such as calling them ""drug addicts,"" ""smack-heads,"" ""dirty,"" or similar. This language increases the stigma surrounding addiction and will not help your loved one. Addiction is a highly complex phenomenon that is not entirely within a person's control. Do not define a person by her disorder.Always use language such as ""a person addicted to drugs"" instead of things like ""drug addict.""
When you speak with the person, always frame her addiction as something she has, not something she is. For example: ""I'm worried that your drug use is harming you"" is appropriate. ""I'm worried that you're a junkie"" is not.
Avoid using words such as ""clean"" to express being drug-free and ""dirty"" to express using drugs. These further the stigma and can increase your loved one's sense of shame about her addiction, which could lead to further drug use.;
, A qualified counselor who specializes in addiction can help you and other friends or family consider your options when it comes to dealing with a person addicted to drugs. Counselors are objective third-parties who have little personal stake and so can provide a much-needed outside and rational voice. In addition, counselors are trained to provide empathy, support and encouragement, which may be hard to get from other people who are concerned about the person and are too inside the situation to see clearly -- which could include you. Try to find a counselor in your area or consider consulting your primary care physician for recommendations.


Alternatively, if therapy is not a good option for you, you can attend Nar-Anon meetings, which are designed to be safe spaces for the families and friends of people addicted to drugs.A substance abuse professional may also be able to provide guidance on how to help the person. Be prepared to provide detail about how often the person uses heroin and how much, whether she uses any other drugs, the duration of the addiction, symptoms and behavioral patterns and the like.For more information on drug addiction in general, consult the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

, Make an attempt to talk to the person about your concerns about her drug use. Make sure the person is not using when you have this conversation; if the person is using or has recently used heroin when you try to have this conversation, try again later. Avoid blaming, preaching, lecturing, and moralizing and instead tell the person plainly about your worries.Come ready to offer specific instances of the problem behavior that has you concerned. Bring up past incidents, such as ""When you cancelled our plans last week..."" instead of ""You always break your promises."" Use ""I"" phrases, such as ""I noticed"" or ""I'm worried,"" since these sound less blaming and are less likely to place your loved one on the defensive.Focus on the effects of the person's heroin addiction on the things she cares about the most, whether that be career, friends, children, parents, etc. This may help the person realize her actions do not only affect her.You can also conduct an intervention, a professionally directed process in which the person addicted to heroin meets with friends, family, employers, etc. An intervention can be helpful because it can aid the person in connecting her drug problem to the problems in her life. Ninety percent of interventions done with a trained interventionist result in the addicted person making a commitment to get help. Contact your local National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) for more guidance.

, Upon learning about the person's addiction, your first reaction might be to convince her to stop by threatening, pleading or begging. This won't work – heroin is too strong an influence over the person's life for her to be able to stop just because you want her to. Heroin users will only stop when they are ready to. Although it might be tempting to launch heavy-handed threats, this isn't actually feasible and won't help her unlearn the behavior and treat the triggers that have led her to use heroin.


Keep in mind that emotional appeals could backfire in that they may only make the person feel guilty and engage in further substance abuse.
Sometimes an individual with a long-term addiction will have to hit 'rock bottom' (a personal low point in one's life marked by desperation and hopelessness or a major occurrence such as an arrest) before the person decides to quit. However, most people do not need to bottom out to want to get help., How you talk to the person will depend on her relationship to you. Is the person a family member, good friend, or co-worker? Consider writing down how you want to open the conversation in advance to mentally prepare yourself. Here are some potential ""opening lines"" that can help you approach the person in the appropriate manner:Helping a family member - ""Mom, you know how much I love you, and that's where what I have to say next comes from, from a place of love. You've been away a lot lately for days at a time, and we know you've been using drugs. You even missed my graduation last week. I miss you, Dad misses you, and we love you. Will you sit down with us to talk more about this?""

Helping a good friend - ""You know, Jennifer, we've been friends since we were little kids, and I consider you to be like a sister. While I know you have a lot going on, I have noticed that you've been cancelling a lot of our plans and showing up late and high. You also don't seem to be getting along with your family as much as you used to. I'm worried and concerned about you. I care very much about you and want to talk more about this.""

Helping a coworker - ""Dale, you're one of the best thinkers in this office but you've been missing a bunch of work lately. And just this week, I couldn't submit my report because I was missing your section. Lately you just haven't seemed to be yourself, and I know you've been using drugs. If you're having any problems, I wanted to let you know that I'd be happy to help you get the assistance you need. You're valuable addition at this company, and I don't want this to affect the security of your job.""

, Once you have explained your concerns, broach the topic of getting help and treatment with the person. A promise from the person to cut back or stop the problem activity is insufficient; treatment, support, and new coping skills necessary to overcoming addiction. Explain what kind of treatment you have in mind. As with other chronic diseases, the earlier addiction is treated, the better.


Do your research before recommending a treatment plan or center. There are many different varieties and cost is not always indicative of treatment effectiveness. Treatment typically depends on the severity of the addiction. You'll need to think about cost, of course, along with other factors such as the type of therapy offered (group, individual, combination, drug, etc.), the type of facility (outpatient, residential, etc.), and gender dynamics (co-ed or same-sex environment), among others.In most cases, outpatient or residential rehabilitation programs are needed to end heroin addiction. Prescription medication is usually necessary to help the person detox safely.After this, researchers have found that 12-step programs are useful as an inexpensive and effective way of maintaining abstinence from drug and alcohol addiction.Note as well that most people who are addicted to drugs, especially ones that can be expensive such as heroin, cannot financially pay for their own treatment so you will likely need to assist in that regard. There are also some state-funded treatment centers, available through SAMHSA., No matter what the person's response is to your confrontation, let her know that you are there for her when she is ready to get help.


If your friend agrees to treatment, be ready. Call the local number for NA to get a schedule of meetings for your area, for example. You could also talk to someone at a nearby treatment center so that you can have the name of a place and contact ready. Let the person know that you will accompany her to the institution, meeting or specific individual that you have recommended.
Your friend may respond with anger, rage or indifference. Denial in particular is one of the symptoms of drug addiction. Don't take it personally and avoid responding emotionally in kind. Instead, assert that you are trying to help her., The person may not think she needs the assistance you have suggested. Don't feel as though you have failed; you have at least planted a seed of recovery that can grow in the person's mind. However, if the person refuses treatment, you should be ready with a plan for what's next.


What will you do if the person refuses? This may involve cutting the person off from money and other resources (so that you are no longer enabling the addiction) or even asking her to leave your home (particularly if you have other friends or family members who may be at risk due to this person's addiction).It is not easy to let a loved one who's addicted to drugs go. However, stay in touch and make it clear to the person that if any point she opts to reconsider treatment, your door is always open. Remember, you are helping the person to heal. Sometimes, we need to endure the pain of a friend or loved one in order to provide her with the help she needs to get well. This is why it's called tough love - because it is not an easy way to help someone but you may be able to save someone's life.

, You must be careful with your own behavior and your attitude towards the person struggling with addiction. Be consistent and mean what you say to them; don't make empty promises or threats. For example, following through on an offer to ""Do whatever I can to help"" may be interpreted in a variety of ways. Does this mean helping the person find a local chapter of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or giving her money (which the addict could then buy drugs with)? Be very clear about your intentions to avoid confusion. The same goes for consequences. If you tell the person that next time she is caught using, she will be kicked out, you need to be prepared to follow through.


Always make sure you stick to what you say – this is the most important rule because it shows the person that you are trustworthy and that what you say holds weight. If you say you will do something for the person in return for something she has done, then do it. If she fails to do what you asked, don't do it. If you give her a warning, carry it out if she doesn't listen.
Creating and maintaining an environment of trust is of critical importance. Avoid trust-breaking behaviors, like screaming, nagging, lecturing and making promises and threats.

, Break out of a cycle of dependency whereby the addict relies on you and, in turn, your assistance inadvertently helps the person keep up the addiction. This is called negative enabling. Learn to say ""no"" and commit yourself to it; it is perhaps one of the most important components of bringing about transformation in an addict. It's also important to note that the addict will likely not respond well to your commitment to saying ""no"" since she may be used to getting what she wants and when. If the person is a family member or friend, you'll need to think about money in particular. Decide if you are willing to lend the person money or not. Many people don’t like to lend money knowing that it will be spent on drugs, whilst others see it as stopping the addict from perhaps committing crime and getting into further trouble if she is caught. Make up your mind about this matter and stick to it. If you don't want to lend money, firmly let the person know the reasons you are unwilling and don't waver. If you are willing to lend to the person, have her sign debtor's notes for each loan and let her know that you plan to pursue any unpaid debts. If the person does let you down, stop lending to her.In addition, don't enable the behavior or try to keep up with the person by joining in the drug use. You need to keep yourself safe first and foremost.

, Avoid covering up or making excuses for the person's behavior or taking over the person's responsibilities (whether they be work, family, or otherwise). Doing so shields the person from the negative consequences of her behavior. She needs to learn that what she is doing has adverse consequences.

, Very few people addicted to heroin manage to complete a detox and remain clean on their first attempt. If your loved one does relapse, don't lose faith and do something drastic like disown her or kick her out. Remember that most people relapse a few times before they make it. Even when the person is past the withdrawal stage, recovery is not yet a certain thing as it encompasses much more than just getting rid of the person's physical dependency on heroin.


Heroin addiction is not all physical. When someone is trying to recover from heroin addiction, they also need to deal with the mental aspects of their addiction and the triggers that led the person to engage in the behavior in the first place. Even though the withdrawal symptoms might have gone, the mental addiction will still be there, urging her to use again. Thus, treatment will have to involve dealing with those underlying issues in order to truly remove the impetus to relapse.
If (or when) the person fails, don't take it as a personal insult and instead offer support for the next time she tries.

, Be supportive and try not to be suspicious of the person all the time; appreciate that it is hard to overcome a heroin addiction and show compassion for this trial. Instead of nagging the person when she slips or falls on the path to recovery or trying to control her every move and behavior, offer understanding and empathy. The very fact that the person wants to try to get better and beat the addiction is encouraging.


Remember that recovery is not linear, like going simply from point A to point B. There are lots of ups and downs. Don't keep asking the person if she is still clean or lecturing her about not starting again. If you're constantly nagging the person, she will begin to lose trust and comfortability with you and may even start keeping things from you.

, Offer provide praise and encouragement when the person does something to further her recovery or as a way to mark a milestone on the path to recovery (such as one-week sober or 30 days sober). This is also called positive enabling, which refers to behaviors that encourage change in a person addicted to drugs.Enable the person to continue her recovery and her path of change by reminding her that you love her and that you too are committed to her betterment.

, Once the person is receiving treatment, whether that be by entering a rehabilitation center, seeing a therapist, or going to meetings, remain an active part of their recovery process. Getting the person to get help and treatment with only the first stage of recovery. Your loved one will need your support in order to carry on with the treatment and be successful in beating the addiction. Show the person that you are invested in her and her long-term recovery.


One way to stay involved is to try to attend therapy sessions or meetings that allow guests of people addicted to drugs. This may also help you build understanding and empathy as you will come to learn about heroin addiction and how it affects people.
Inquire about the person's recovery. However, rather than ask the person in a Q-and-A format or other style that resembles an interrogation rather than a conversation (e.g. ""Did you go to a meeting today?"";""Did you talk in therapy today?"", etc.), consider asking open-ended questions that allow the person to shape the narrative they want to tell (e.g., ""How have the meetings been going?"" and ""Have you learned anything new about yourself throughout this process?"").

, Heroin is a narcotic that comes from the opiate family, a class of pain killing drugs (analgesics) derived from the Opium Poppy (Papaver somniferum). For 7,000 years, this plant was the most effective painkiller known to medicine. Typically sold as a white or brown-colored powder that is ""cut"" with sugar, starch, powdered milk or quinine, heroin can be used in many ways, including through intravenous injections, smoking and snorting.Smoking heroin has become more popular since the 1990s due to fears of HIV infection through intravenous needle-sharing. Smoking is also the major method of using heroin in Asia and Africa.

, Heroin exerts its primary addictive effect by activating mu-opioid receptors (MORs, similar to the endorphin and serotonin receptors which are responsible for happiness) in the brain. The brain regions and neurotransmitters affected by heroin are responsible for producing the pleasurable sensation of ""reward"", the relief of pain, and physical dependence. Together, these actions account for the user's loss of control and the drug's habit-forming action. In addition to being a powerful painkiller, heroin also depresses the central nervous system activity, making the heart rate and breathing slow down and suppressing the cough.Soon after using, heroin crosses the blood-brain barrier. Heroin is converted to morphine in the brain and then binds to opioid receptors. Users report feeling a ""rush"" or surge of pleasurable sensation. The rush's intensity is tied to the quantity of drug taken as well as the quickness with which the drug enters the brain and binds to the receptors. Heroin is particularly addictive because it enters the brain so rapidly. The effects are almost immediate and the user may initially feel sick. A feeling of calm and warmth then spreads through the body and any troubles or pains seem very distant and unimportant.This ""high"" will continue until the effects wear off, usually 6 to 8 hours after a hit. The user will then need to start thinking about where to score and/or where to get the money from for the next hit before physical withdrawal sets in.
Know that heroin users can talk and think coherently. Even with doses sufficiently high to produce euphoria, there is little change to coordination, sensation or intellect. At higher doses the user slips into a dreamlike state where she is not asleep or awake, but somewhere between. Pupils become tiny (pinned) and the eyes roll back. This is referred to as 'nodding' or 'halucinodding' or opium dreams.

, Within as little as a week of usage, a person can develop a physical dependence on heroin. Although some users may take it occasionally, heroin offers most people an unparalleled state of mind and once used, most find it difficult not to keep going back for more.


It has been documented that it only takes three consecutive days of heroin use to become addicted, remembering that there are different levels of addition and withdrawal. Most people will not notice the subtle withdrawal symptoms after this short a period and may put it down to feeling a little down, getting a cold, etc.
The two issues with addiction are the length of use and the average morphine content in the body. Usually though, people will notice that they have become addicted between one to two weeks after beginning consistent daily use. After this amount of time, stopping will result in obvious withdrawal symptoms.
Once someone becomes addicted, finding and using heroin becomes her main goal., When helping a person addicted to heroin withdraw, it is important to know the facts and symptoms. Withdrawal occurs a few hours after taking the drug, once the effects start to wear off and the body has broken down the heroin in the blood stream. Heroin and other opiate withdrawal symptoms are extremely uncomfortable and are not likely to be fatal or lead to permanent injury, but can cause death to the fetus of a pregnant addict. Symptoms include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, trouble sleeping, diarrhea, vomiting, cold flashes, and restless legs.For short term users: After the last dose, users will normally start experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms around 4-8 hours later. These will get worse until they peak on the second day without a hit. This is the worst day, with things slowly improving from the third day onwards. These acute symptoms are usually greatly improved by the fifth day and are largely gone in seven to ten days.
For longer term users: Acute withdrawal (which is considered the first 12 hours without heroin) is followed by a ""protracted abstinence syndrome"" or 'PAWS' (post acute withdrawal syndrome) which can continue for up to 32 weeks afterwards. The symptoms that continue over this time are: restlessness; disturbed sleep patterns; abnormal blood pressure and pulse rate; dilated pupils; feeling cold; irritability; change of personality and feeling; and, intense craving for the drug.
Often the hardest part of detox is not the withdrawing itself but staying off it altogether. To remain drug-free, a whole change of life is required. New friends, keeping away from areas where you used to score, and finding things to relieve the boredom and time you would have spent using the drug are among the things that have to change as well as wanting to stay clean.

, Addiction to drugs is a lifetime struggle. It takes willpower and endurance to make changes. Sobriety may be achieved, but the person may always face tremendous temptation to use. It is difficult to change your whole life, since fighting a drug addiction also means having to change other habits and parts of a person's life, such as where they go and who they see socially. Even ""normal"" activities like watching television are totally different when you're clean. This is why so many people get clean and then relapse.


It is also worth remembering that many people use heroin to escape or cope with personal problems, such as a history of abuse or assault, low self-esteem, and depression, among other reasons. A person addicted to heroin has to fight through the agony of withdrawal only to then be faced with all the same problems she was escaping from in the first place, but now with the added burden of heroin cravings to deal with.

Helping a friend through a struggle such as drug addiction is one way to make a friendship stronger. As relationships build, you tend to care more about the person. When a crisis occurs, you naturally want to help him.


Show up when he needs you and listen to what he has to say. There are reasons this person is abusing drugs. Listening may allow him to express thoughts and feelings that will eventually help him and you to understand the root cause of the addiction.Be respectful, loyal and reliable. Expressing one’s feelings is a brave thing to do, and it can feel risky as well. You can acknowledge this by saying, “I know this might be hard for you and I am honored you are sharing this information. I respect you for doing this. I’m here if you ever want to talk.”
Helping a person with a drug addiction may be the most difficult, time consuming thing you will ever do, but the most rewarding.;
, Being listened to and understood are key components to personal growth.The emotional experience of dealing with a drug addiction will force a person to grow, which may be painful. You can help ease the person's pain by actively listening.


Put yourself in the person’s shoes. Learn to be compassionate and accepting rather than judging the person.It might be difficult to understand, but you can always try.
Treat the person like you would like to be treated. You have probably experienced struggles in your life and know what was helpful to you, and what wasn’t.

, It is hard to watch someone suffer or make poor decisions that negatively impact his life. At some point, you will have to tell the person you are concerned about his well-being. He may want to listen to what you have to say, but he may not. This is okay because you are being genuine and you are demonstrating that you care.


Ask permission to get involved. If a person is in the throes of addiction he may not realize he needs help, but might be open to it. You can say things like, “It seems like you are struggling with this drug. I’m here for you if you want me to help. Would you be okay with that?”
Don’t be afraid to ask the tough questions. Confronting difficult subject matter that might jeopardize a relationship is challenging. You will need to ask direct, honest questions like, “Do you think you are addicted to this drug?” and “I know it might be hard to talk about this, but I have to know if you’re willing to ruin your health, and your relationships because of it?”

, Know the signs and symptoms of drug dependency.A radical change in personality may indicate an individual is abusing drugs. Personality changes are a common sign of all types of drug addiction, including alcoholism, a dependency on prescription drugs and opiate abuse.


Signs of opiate addiction: needle marks may be evident on the arms of someone who is abusing opiates, although many addicts become skilled at hiding evidence of intravenous drug use by injecting the drugs in unseen areas, such as between the toes. A person who is abusing opiates may also appear unusually thirsty or sweaty, and their pupils may be small pinpoints.
Signs of alcoholism: may frequently smell of alcohol, exhibit irritable behavior, slurred speech, unusually bright or glassy eyes and difficulty expressing thoughts and ideas in a logical manner. Alcoholics often try to hide the physical evidence of the addiction, including empty bottles and cans.
Signs of prescription drug abuse: Individuals who suffer from a dependency on prescription drugs may exhibit signs of intoxication, including clumsiness, slurred speech and may appear droopy-eyed.

, If an issue happens more than a couple times, then you are likely seeing a pattern developing. It is difficult to predict if the pattern will escalate and deepen the severity of the problem. You want to be prepared.


Perhaps he or she consumes excessive amounts of a substance and continually passes out at parties. Has he or she gotten cited for a DUI or cited for substance-driven vandalism charges? Does he or she get into substance-fueled fights?

, It is most common for a person with an addiction to be using multiple drugs.This could be an obvious thing or a difficult thing to determine. If a person is secretly taking drugs, you may only see the signs and symptoms of abuse. When in doubt, you can always ask. Abused drugs include but are not limited to: amphetamines, anabolic steroids, club drugs, cocaine, heroin, inhalants, marijuana, and prescription drugs. Different drugs may affect a person in different ways.
There may be multiple drugs in a person’s system, so it will be difficult to determine.
In the event of an overdose or medical emergency you may be the one who must tell the medical personnel what type of drug or drugs were consumed so the proper treatment can be given., The goal would be to not wait until the person's behavior has spiraled so far out of control that relationships and situations cannot be repaired. Ideally, the person should seek help for addiction before consequences, such as job loss, abuse and neglect of loved ones and financial ruin occur.


Ask him, ""What attempts have been made by you to stop? Why do you think you weren't successful?""
Does the person appear and sound motivated to make a change, but repeatedly struggles with sticking to his plan? Is the drug controlling the person?
If he is your college buddy, or family friend call his family to let them know when things have gotten out of control. Don’t face the problem alone.

, Basic human rights allow a person to ask for and accept help. Those same rights allow a person to reject the help he might need. This creates friction among everyone involved; and the more deteriorated the situation becomes, the more desperate you might feel.


How involved do you want to be in the process? If you are reading this right now, you are probably invested in making a difference in a person’s life.
Plenty of people don’t want to get involved in helping someone who is addicted to drugs, so bravo to you for wanting to get involved.

, Healthy boundaries need to be discussed focusing on what is most helpful for the person with an addiction without being enabling. Behaviors that will enable a person with an addiction include but are not limited to: you ignore undesirable behavior; you lend the person money to buy drugs so he won't steal; you sacrifice your needs and desires to consistently help the person with an addiction; expressing your own emotions with difficulty; you lie to cover for the person with the addiction; you continue to provide help when it is unappreciated and unacknowledged.Tell the person with an addiction that you will help him and support him and his efforts to manage his addiction, but you will not engage in anything that promotes his continued use of the addictive substance.

, All the signs are there that he needs help. Now, it's time for you to show him the realities of the situation. Sometimes you need to compassionately force a person to consider the consequences of not getting help.


If you know he needs the help, but refuses, you can call the cops on the person to shock him into realizing he needs help. He doesn’t have to know you called the police.
Warn the person by saying, ""Jail is a horrible, dangerous, and disgusting place where no one cares about you. You don't want to go there. You will lose yourself in there and you might never recover.""
Show the person statistics and videos about drug addiction overdoses and traffic deaths caused by people who drive while intoxicated.
Do not flush drugs down the toilet because it will pollute the water system with dangerous substances that end up in the food supply.

, Driving with a person who is in possession of a controlled substance will lead to everyone in the car being cited and likely arrested. This is a perfect example of when a person's drug addiction infringes upon other people's lives.

, Help comes in many forms, and must be forced sometimes. It is a hard decision to make, but one that is necessary if the addiction has spiraled out of control and the person’s life is in danger.While an intervention will likely be overwhelming to the person, the intent is not to put the person on the defensive. Those who will participate in the intervention should be carefully chosen. The person’s loved ones can describe how the drug abuse is affecting them.


Prior to the intervention, develop at least one treatment plan to offer to the person. Make arrangements ahead of time if the person is going to be escorted to the drug treatment center directly from the intervention. The intervention will mean little if he does not know how to get help and does not have the support of loved ones.
You will likely have to trick the person into coming to the location where the intervention is supposed to take place.
Be prepared to offer specific consequences if the person rejects seeking treatment. These consequences must not be empty threats, so the person’s loved ones should consider the consequences to be imposed if he does not seek treatment, and be willing to follow through.
An intervention may also include the person’s colleagues and religious representatives (if appropriate).
Participants should prepare specific examples of how their loved one’s drug abuse has hurt the relationship. Often, those staging an intervention choose to write letters to the person. A person with an addiction may not care about their own self-destructive behaviors, but seeing the pain his actions inflict on others can be a powerful motivator for seeking help.

, Contact several rehabilitation clinics and inquire about their services. Don’t be afraid to ask specific questions about their daily schedules and how the center handles relapses. If an intervention is not necessary, assist the person in researching both the addiction and recommended drug treatment plans. Be supportive and allow the person to feel in control of the impending rehabilitation.


Tour the suggested programs and keep in mind that the more receptive the person with the addiction is of the treatment plan, the better the chances of overcoming the addiction.

, If the person is admitted into an in-patient treatment program, there will be rules for visitation that will need to be clarified. Understand that you need to allow the person to participate on his own without influence from anyone on the outside. The rehab staff will inform you when to visit, and the visit will likely be deeply appreciated.

, A person who has overcome a drug addiction will need structure in his life. You can be a big part of making that happen. A welcoming attitude might be exactly what the person needs. Every person has a need to feel a sense of belonging, and you can foster that for the person.Encourage and suggest the potential freedoms of new, healthier lifestyles. Invite the person to go with you on new adventures. Be mindful not to pursue those things that might increase the urge to partake in drugs.
The goal is to help the person not feel alone and to assure him that he can reach out to you and others when needed. He is going to be nervous, afraid and uncertain of his ability to stay sober.

, Make it clear that you are genuinely concerned for the person and want him to be successful. It is important that he attend therapy or support group meetings. These are likely to be a requirement of any rehabilitation program.


Help the person be accountable to his program. Ask him if there is anything you can do to help him stay committed to attending. Don't let him slack off.
Offer to attend meetings with him if you both are comfortable with the idea.
Always celebrate accomplishments. If a person is sober for one day or 1000 days, each day deserves a celebration., Drug addiction is a chronic disease, therefore it can be managed, but not cured. Relapses will most likely happen, and everyone involved should not consider a relapse a failure. However, treatment will be needed following each relapse.


Once you go through the process of helping a person with an addiction, you will have the know-how and information necessary to help. Psychologists and psychiatrists are available in your local area and can be located through the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association..
Be there for the person (text, call, see him, do fun activities, play sports, hang out, and support the person’s hobbies and interests). Help the person conquer the temptation to use drugs if a particularly difficult situation presents itself.

, He needs to know that there will be people to support him on the road to recovery, and that includes you.

Apply heat to your abdomen.,
Exercise during your period.,
Decrease your stress level.,
Distract yourself.,
Have an orgasm.,
Elevate your legs.",How to Beat Cramps Naturally1," Cramps are caused when blood vessels constrict and the muscles of the uterus tighten, and heat helps alleviate both of those problems.Place a heating pad or hot water bottle over your lower abdomen. You can also take a hot shower or soak in a hot bath.


A nice hot bath is a good time to use aromatherapy or essential oils for added benefit.;
, Getting physical can ease menstrual cramps by improving blood flow and releasing endorphins, your body’s natural “feel-good” chemical.Really intense exercise may be overdoing it if you’re cramping, so try a light activity like taking a brisk 30 minute walk daily, doing a light jog or bike ride, or trying dance movement therapy.People who are generally more active can probably tolerate more intense exercise like longer runs, or HIIT (high-intensity interval training).Listen to your body and push yourself as far as is comfortable for you.

, Due to hormones that your body releases when you’re really stressed, emotional and mental stress may actually worsen cramps.Relaxation techniques can help you to feel calmer, reduce those stress hormones, and ease menstrual pain. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, journaling, listening to music – whatever helps you relax.


The pleasant scents of aromatherapy and incense can have a calming effect, and certain scents like lavender, evening primrose, German chamomile, fennel, and marjoram can be good choices., The mind is notoriously bad at focusing its full attention on more than one thing simultaneously. Rather than lying in bed fully focused on your discomfort, give your brain something else to do. Read a book, do a crossword or Sudoku, work on a jigsaw puzzle, color, get homework done or get ahead for your next work-week. Do something that requires concentration, and your brain will notice your pain less.

, Having an orgasm increases blood flow to the uterus, which helps to diminish cramps. Orgasms also cause your body to release a flood of endorphins, which improve both mood and pain and aid in relaxation., When lying down, prop several pillows or cushions under your knees and ankles to elevate your legs and feet. This will alleviate low back tension and promote blood flow to your abdomen.

Walk or bike to work. Walking or biking can take less time than other modes of transportation, and the light exercise it entails adds up a lot over time.
Start jogging or swimming a few times a week. Jogging and swimming keep your muscles toned and give your body a strong, healthy foundation, which helps keep cramps at bay.
Join a team sport. Basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball get you moving several times a week.

, Have you every noticed that your cramps are more painful during periods when you're drinking a lot of coffee? That's because caffeine has an effect on the severity and duration of muscle cramps, as do alcohol and salt.Limit your intake of the following substances, especially as your period approaches:


Coffee, caffeinated tea, and soda.
Beer, wine, liquor, and other drinks containing alcohol.
Salty foods like chips, canned soups, and fast food.

, For people with severe menstrual cramps and other menstruation-related symptoms, taking birth control can help ease the pain. The hormones in birth control cause the uterine lining to thin, resulting in fewer uterine contractions and less severe cramps. Consider the following options:


The birth control pill is a popular method. A pill containing a certain amount of estrogen, progesterone or both is taken each day until the end of the cycle, when the period comes.
Injectable contraceptives contain the same hormones, and are administered in the form of a shot periodically.
Intra-uterine devices, or IUDs, are implanted inside the cervix. The device releases estrogen and progesterone hormones.

Use a menthol-based balm for a cooler feeling.,
Pick a capsaicin-based balm if you don’t mind a bit of heat.,
Try an arnica-based balm for especially sore muscles.,
Use a balm that includes oil for extra moisturization.,

Test for bad reactions.,
Slowly massage a small amount of balm into the cramped muscle.,
Wash your hands after each use.,

Use home remedies.,
Try an ice pack or heating pad if balm doesn’t work.,
Supplement balm with over-the-counter painkillers if necessary.,
Seek medical attention if you cannot move a joint through its full range of motion.",How to Apply Balm to Cramped Muscles," Most muscle balms have menthol as an active ingredient. Menthol soothes pain and generally gives your skin a cool feeling. But if that coolness would feel uncomfortable to you, pick a different balm.Some balms mix menthol with camphor. Camphor also produces a cooling feeling, but unlike menthol numbs the skin as well.
Menthol-based balms can sometimes give off a strong smell. Avoid using one right before bed.;
, Capsaicin is the active chemical in hot peppers. When used as the active ingredient in muscle balms, capsaicin can improve blood flow to the sore area. That can help relieve soreness. But it can also create a burning sensation on your skin, so only use capsaicin-based balms if you don’t mind some heat.


Other balms use methyl salicylate, which is derived from oil of wintergreen. This chemical produces a similar effect as capsaicin.If you use one of these balms, be careful to follow application directions closely. Methyl salicylate can be toxic in large quantities., Arnica is a European herb that, like capsaicin, can help increase blood flow. It is also useful for bruises. It does not cause the same kind of short-term discomfort that capsaicin- or methyl salicylate-based balms do.While arnica can be toxic if taken orally, it is generally safe when used in balms. Although it does not cause short-term discomfort, using it for too long may cause blistering.Some arnica-based balms also use comfrey, which helps stimulate tissue repair. These balms are especially useful for helping heal bruises.

, Some balms, whether capsaicin, menthol, or arnica-based, also contain oil to help moisturize your skin. While these balms may leave your skin feeling somewhat greasy, the oil can also help the active ingredient in the balm penetrate more deeply., Exercise increases your circulation, so your body could absorb too much of the active ingredient. You should be particularly careful with methyl salicylate-based balms due to that chemical’s potential toxicity. , Before applying the balm to a large area, test a bit on the inside of your wrist. Wait several minutes. If you develop a rash, pick a new balm.

, Use no more than a pea-sized amount. Give extra attention to what feels like the center of the cramp. Try to keep the area relaxed.


Avoid using any kind of balm on areas of broken or irritated skin. The active ingredients in the balm can worsen the irritation or even burn you.Repeat no more than 3-4 times per day. Remember to use small amounts each time. Doing so will decrease the chance of irritation or toxicity., That will decrease the chances of you accidentally rubbing balm into a sensitive area of your body. Be particularly careful to avoid touching your eyes, nose, mouth, or genital region after using muscle balm., Drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your workout will go a long way towards preventing muscle soreness in the first place. Dehydration can make muscle soreness much worse. This is especially the case if you’re working out in a hot and humid environment., Your muscles need time to repair themselves after a workout. They can’t do that if you’re not getting enough sleep. Aim for seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep each night.Always prioritize rest and sleep in any exercise program.

, Mild muscle soreness doesn’t always require balm. Light stretching may help to ease the pain. A hot shower can also provide relief. If you become stiff from prolonged periods of sitting at your desk, walking around for 20 minutes can work well.Drinking cherry juice can help reduce exercise-related muscle pain., A handful of ice cubes in a plastic bag or a heating pad available at most drugstores can go a long way towards soothing muscle pain. Alternating between the two can be even more effective. Try applying the ice pack for 15 minutes, then switch to the heating pad for 15 minutes. Repeat as necessary until the soreness subsides.Avoid using a heating pad immediately after applying muscle balm. That combination can lead to prolonged skin irritation or even burns, depending on the balm., Most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen will help to relieve muscle soreness. If you choose to take NSAIDs for muscle soreness, adhere closely to the dosing directions.


If using aspirin, don’t take more than the recommended dose, especially if using a methyl salicylate-based balm., You may have a muscle or ligament tear. That can require medical intervention.


Soreness that persists for longer than several days, or weakness that develops in addition to persistent soreness, may be an indicator of nerve damage or an autoimmune disorder. A tingling sensation is also a sign of nerve damage. These conditions will also require medical attention."

Do not use quinine.",How to Avoid Leg/Foot Cramps in Bed," Do you have a medical condition, such as fibromyalgia or neuropathy which may make you more prone to cramps? Are you taking any medications? Some can cause cramps, or make them worse.;
, Nocturnal leg cramps become more frequent as one ages, but they can also be precipitated by a host of conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and fibromyalgia. Getting the proper treatment and medications for these can alleviate some of the tendency to have spasms.

, Look over any prescriptions you are taking together. Some medication may be causing the leg cramps, or making them recur more often. Alternative medicines may be available. Also, if you have other symptoms apart from cramps, see your doctor who may examine you or do some checks to rule out a secondary cause for the cramps.

, There are many prescription drugs that are available, which help relax tense muscles and keep them from going into painful spasms. Be aware that some cause dependency, and ask your doctor how to avoid becoming hooked.

, Stretching exercises are commonly advised. Some doctors swear by these exercises to relieve nocturnal cramps, others aren't sold. Either way, stretching will not hurt you, so if you try them and find they help you, that's a good thing. Stretch your hamstrings, inner thigh muscles, and quadriceps, but stretch gently and don't overdo. There are lots of instructions with pictures available on the internet for each exercise.

, This is strongly advised. Positions which prevent the calf muscle from shortening when you are asleep may help. The following are not proven treatments (from research studies), but some experts believe that they help to prevent cramps.


Positioning your feet is helpful. If you can ""trap"" your toes against your sheets, it can keep your foot from turning down and allowing your calf muscles to seize.

, If you do get a cramp, stand up and walk around. This loosens the muscle in your leg, thus relieving the cramp.

, Cold muscles are much more likely to cramp. Even if it is a warm night, as you sleep, you become more sensitive to cool drafts. A light sheet will help reflect some of your body heat back to you, and warm muscles are much less likely to cramp.


In winter, use a covered hot water bottle to place near the area of your legs that cramps most often.






Try a warm shower if mid-cramp. It might help ease the pain.






Very hot water can get rid of cramps if you stay in it for a while. Your cramps will be less likely come back. Just be sure to use water that is hot but not burning.







, Prefer foods rich in magnesium, potassium and sodium., Be careful not to take too much; ask your doctor what the right amount is for you, as well as the right form (for example, magnesium citrate versus magnesium gluconate). Deficiency of any of these minerals can cause leg cramps., Serious safety concerns, including fatalities, associated with quinine are well-documented.Quinine can cause tinnitus, dizziness, disorientation, nausea, visual changes, and auditory deficits. There is also evidence that quinine causes serious cardiac arrhythmias. Serious adverse reactions associated with quinine use also include severe skin reactions, thrombocytopenia (a decrease in blood platelets that can cause hemorrhage or clotting problems) and other serious hematological events, permanent visual and hearing disturbances, hypoglycemia, kidney failure and generalized anaphylaxis.

If you hold your breath while exercising, you'll develop a cramp within a few minutes. As long as you provide enough oxygen for your body, then you'll prevent this type of cramp.


If you develop a cramp in your side, you are not breathing deeply enough to provide oxygen to your diaphragm. When you inhale, fill your lungs all the way to the bottom. Think of it as drawing air into your stomach rather than your chest. Your lungs are deep!
Take deep and complete breaths. Quick, shallow breaths do not fill your lungs all the way and can also cause you to become lightheaded. If you are having trouble taking deep breaths, slow down your pace for a few moments while your lungs catch up.

, Always provide your body with enough water, especially if you're sweating. When you sweat, you lose salt and water, which can throw off the balance of electrolytes and salt in your body. This causes your cells to swell, which causes calcium to stick to them, making the muscle contraction remain. You can prevent this by drinking enough water. Take regular water breaks, especially if you are doing a high-intensity workout.


It is crucial to continue hydrating after you exercise. Don't overdo it, but keep a water bottle handy for a few hours after your workout.
Take care not to drink too much water. Studies have shown that drinking water when you feel thirsty is a reliable way to hydrate your body sufficiently.
There are a number of sports drinks available that claim to provide extra hydration. These won't hurt you, but keep in mind that most brands do contain extra calories that you may not have accounted for in your eating plan. Most importantly, sports drinks do not improve your performance or provide any more hydration than regular water., A thorough ""cool-down,"" sometimes called a ""warm-down,"" includes 10-20 minutes of less intense exercise, some more dynamic stretching, followed by some static stretching. Basically, you want to do your whole workout routine backwards, but at a lower level of intensity. This will greatly reduce the buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, a major culprit of post-workout soreness.Here are some basic static stretches:


Posterior capsule stretch. Stand or sit up straight and stretch one arm across your torso, using your other arm to bring it close to your body. You should feel a stretch across the outside of your arm.
Quadriceps stretch. Stand on one foot, reaching out behind you to hold your raised foot in your hand. Engage your abdominal muscles to keep your back straight. You should feel a stretch down the front of your thigh.

Some foods contain vitamins, minerals, and elements that can make your muscles less prone to excessive cramping.,
Get some sun.,
Wait a while after eating before you exercise.",How to Avoid Cramps3," Consider incorporating some of the following foods into your diet:


Foods with high levels of potassium.Some of these foods are, in order from least to greatest potassium level: avocados, potatoes, bananas, broccoli, orange juice, soybeans, apricots, and raisins. You can have these at any time, not just while exercising.
Whole milk. Milk has a large amount of vitamin D, which will reduce your chances of cramping. Have one to two glasses of milk each day to help you prevent cramps. As a bonus, all the calcium in whole milk will also contribute to healthy bone growth.

, Lack of vitamin D can contribute to cramping; luckily, sunshine is chock full of vitamin D. Make sure to apply plenty of sunscreen before spending a day in the sun! Studies have shown that sunscreen application does not significantly diminish the body's absorption of vitamin D from sunlight.If you choose to exercise out in the sun, be extra sure to bring plenty of water.
Depending on your activity, consider bringing a pair of sunglasses to protect your eyes.

, Eating a large meal shortly before exercising can cause you to experience cramps. The amount of time you should wait between eating and working out depends on how much you have eaten. After a large meal, wait an hour or more. After a small meal or snack, give it 15-30 minutes.


If you prefer to perform rigorous exercise first thing in the morning, it is wise to have something small to eat first, such as a piece of fruit or yogurt. Exercising on an empty stomach can cause discomfort for some people.

Practice yoga.,
Utilize essential oils.,
Try acupuncture.,
Experience the Emotional Freedom Technique.,
Try having a reiki session.",How to Beat Cramps Naturally2," Practicing yoga stretches your muscles, tones and strengthens your core, gets your blood flowing, and can be extremely relaxing.Try a yoga class, or just start your morning with 20 minutes of practice at home (but remember to always practice at your skill level to avoid injury, especially with more advanced poses). Try beneficial poses:Child’s pose, Head-to-knee pose (forward fold): Massages the abdomen and internal organs, and gives a deep stretch to the low back. To do forward fold, sit with your legs straight out in front of you and bend at the waist to touch your toes. Bring your face as close to your legs as you can, without rounding your back much.

Cat-Cow pose, Cobra pose: Gently stretch both the front and back of the body.

Fish pose, Camel pose: Stretch the front of the body and abdominal muscles.

Bow pose: Stretches the front of the body and increases blood flow to the muscles due to the sustained effort needed.

Reclining hand-to-big-toe pose: Stretches the low back, hips, and groin. Lie flat on your back with your legs out straight. Raise one straight leg into the air while keeping the other flat on the ground. Grab your toes and bring your knee as close as you can to your face. You can also use a strap laced around your foot for better leverage.

Note however, that inversions are not recommended during your period. Avoid headstand, handstand, and other poses that put you completely upside-down., Essential oils are natural oils extracted from plant material. They are potent when undiluted. Some of the best oils to use are lavender, eucalyptus, or clary sage oil.Rub the oil gently around your stomach, or add 10 or so drops of oil to a warm, steaming bath for an aromatherapy effect.


Because essential oils are pretty strong, first do a “patch test” by rubbing a dime-sized amount on your skin to make sure you don’t react to it. You can use a palm-full of base oil like jojoba or olive oil with 2-4 drops of essential oil mixed in, if you have sensitive skin.
Many health food and holistic stores sell essential oils.
Do gentle abdominal massage with essential oils to really improve blood flow and ease cramps. Lie down with a pillow under your knees. Place your dominant hand with your palm on your stomach, over top your belly button. Gently apply pressure around the four corners of your hand in a clockwise direction, massaging your abdomen with smooth clockwise pressure. This can increase blood flow to the abdomen and help relax the uterine muscles.

, The practice of acupuncture involves having small, painless needles inserted into the skin at specific places on your body. It is thought to relieve pain by targeting energy at these pressure points. Though acupuncture is not scientifically proven to help with menstrual cramps, many women experience pain relief from this practice.If needles make you squeamish, try acupressure. Acupressure uses the same pressure points on the body as acupuncture with the same goals of pain relief and energetic balancing, except pressure is applied with the hands rather than with needles. Many massage therapists know acupressure points, and Shiatsu massage is well-known for using this system., Called EFT for short, the Emotional Freedom Technique might improve physical ailments, including pain from menstruation. EFT isn’t medically proven to be effective; it is a simple holistic technique that uses tapping on various parts of the body. The goal is to release negative emotional energy, restore the balance of energy in the body, and alleviate painful emotions that can worsen physical pain., Reiki is a form of energy work that aims to promote relaxation, health, and positive energy flow. The professional giving you reiki will place their hands either on your body or almost touching your body in your energetic field, with the goal of channeling positive healing energy into your body.There isn’t scientific evidence proving that reiki works; some people experience relaxation that may help with cramps.

, Fatty foods can worsen bloating and pain when you menstruate because animal fats – fat from meat and dairy – increase inflammation in the body.Avoid fatty cuts of meat, high-fat dairy, large amounts of butter, and all fast food.


Consider a vegetarian diet a few days to a week before, and during, your period. This may significantly ease menstrual pain.
Use skim or 1% milk and cheese, instead of whole, to decrease your fat intake.

, Sugar causes large amounts of inflammation in your body, and inflammation is a leading cause of increased pain.Despite the temptation to grab sweet treats during your period, avoid sugary foods and sodas. If you crave something sweet, munch on fresh fruit like plums and strawberries – natural sugars are much better for your body, and your cramps, than refined sugars from sweets.

, Stay hydrated to decrease your bloating and improve circulation to cramped muscles. Hot or warm water is best to increase bloodflow, so consider drinking hot water with lemon throughout the day.A woman requires 9 glasses (2.2 liters) of fluids a day to stay hydrated, on average.You may need more than 9 glasses a day depending on various factors. You need more water if you sweat a lot, have vomiting or diarrhea, or have a fever., Not only is tea a nice hot and hydrating drink, some herbal teas have excellent abilities to relax the uterus and reduce cramping pain. Chamomile is an especially good choice, as it decreases muscle tension and helps your uterus to relax.Other great tea options are black cohosh and cramp bark.Opt for decaffeinated tea, as caffeine worsens cramps.

, Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks, causes blood vessels to constrict, which will definitely worsen cramps. It’s advisable to avoid caffeine as much as possible starting a week before your period and lasting throughout.If you’re a heavy caffeine-drinker, stopping caffeine all at once can cause headaches and other unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Try to taper yourself down from, say, two cups of coffee daily to one cup, to a “half-caff” (half the caffeine) or decaf the week before your period is due.

, Using tobacco and drinking alcohol worsen cramps, due to the effects they have on your body systems. Do your best to stay alcohol- and tobacco-free if you suffer from bad cramps, and certainly during your period., Ginger may reduce prostaglandins and inflammation in your body, which are the chemicals responsible for causing the painful cramping of menstruation.Ginger tea, hot water infused with ginger, or fresh ginger added to food may help improve cramps.

, Infuse water with basil to drink or include basil in your meals. Basil may improve the inflammation and spasms of painful cramping. Pesto is a basil, pine nut, and garlic sauce which can be a healthy and delicious way to add this pain-relieving herb to your diet., Broccoli, kale, cabbage, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower are in a group of vegetables called brassicas which contain a chemical that may even out estrogen in your body. This might help to minimize cramping and bloating. Try to add at least one of these vegetables to a daily meal., Cinnamon may improves digestion and might help your cramps feel less painful.Add cinnamon to foods like oatmeal or your (decaf) coffee to when you’re cramping. You can also try cinnamon tea.

, Eating papaya may improve the flow of your period and possibly ease the pain of cramping during menstruation. Additionally, regularly eating green, unripe papaya throughout the month may help to regulate irregular periods.

, 1-2 teaspoons of blackstrap molasses added to water or warm milk might help cramps. Try drinking it at the onset of your period and until your cramps go away, and see if you notice an improvement., Maca, a root vegetable that mainly comes from Peru, has been used for centuries for menstrual pain.

You can find maca in its whole form, in powdered form, or even as a supplement.

Ask your doctor before starting any new supplement.

, Eating wild yam might decrease muscle spasms of the uterus, which would ease menstrual pain.Wild yam is often found as an herbal remedy, tea, or supplement form.


Wild yam is not the same thing as American sweet potatoes or yams.

Get your daily calcium.,
Shoot for 360mg of magnesium daily.,
Take your vitamin E. Vitamin E decreases production of prostaglandins, that chemical in your body that instigates cramping and causes pain.,
Get your omega-3 fatty acids.,
Soak up vitamin D from the sun.,
Ensure you get your B vitamins.",How to Beat Cramps Naturally4," Have a glass of milk with breakfast or, for the lactose intolerant, take a calcium supplement. Generally, 1,200mg of daily calcium is recommended, but since calcium may help diminish cramps you should definitely ensure adequate intake during your period.Spinach and kale are great sources of both magnesium and calcium., Magnesium can improve menstrual pain as well as the breast soreness and bloating associated with menstruation.Foods like spinach, kale, pumpkin seeds, soybeans, avocado, and banana contain magnesium, but you can also take supplements if needed and recommended by your doctor.

Bananas are also a good source of potassium and fiber, and can improve your bowel function.Constipation and intestinal cramping would certainly make menstrual cramps feel worse.

, Get 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E daily to ease cramps.Good food sources of vitamin E are sunflower seeds, almonds, peanut butter, cooked spinach, cooked beet greens, cooked collard greens, safflower oil, cooked asparagus, raw red peppers, mango, and swordfish., Omega-3’s, a good kind of fat, are great for overall health. They may also improve menstrual pain. Get your omega-3’s from fatty fish like salmon or mackerel but adding these to a meal 3 times per week, and snack on walnuts, almonds, and pumpkin seeds.If needed, fish oil and cod liver oil supplements are available at pharmacies, and can be taken for additional omega-3’s. This can be a once-a-day supplement, but speak with your healthcare provider before taking it.

, Your body can make vitamin D3, which eases menstrual pain, when you get sun – so apply your sunscreen and absorb some rays.Of course if you don’t always have fair weather, cod liver oil supplements provide vitamin D3. You can get a little from foods like beef liver, eggs (with the yolk), fatty fish, and cheese – but dietary sources are minimal.Even 10 minutes in the mid-day sun for fair-skinned individuals – without sunscreen – will enable your body to make a day’s dose of vitamin D.Dark-skinned people require more time in the sun. Of course, it’s safest to wear sunscreen and avoid midday sun so you don’t get a sunburn.

, Vitamin B-1, or thiamine, and vitamin B-6 may also reduce menstrual cramps.Supplements are available if you and your doctor decide your diet does not provide enough B vitamins.


B6 shows up in fish, liver, potatoes, and non-citrus fruit.You can add thiamine to your diet with beef, pork, liver, nuts, eggs, peas, legumes, seeds, and cereals and oats marked as fortified."

Review your medications.",How to Deal with Foot Cramps," If you are exercising or performing some activity that causes the spasm or cramp to start, then stop doing whatever you were doing that triggered the cramp.Avoid continuing activities that you recognize as causing added strain on your feet that leads to the pain and cramping.;
, Muscle cramps are sudden and unexpected, repeated contractions causing spasms of a muscle. To stop the foot or toe cramp quickly, the cramped muscle needs to be stretched.By stretching the muscle, you are preventing it from remaining in the contracted or cramped position.Stretching a cramped muscle works best if you can hold the stretched position for about a minute or longer, and until the cramp begins to release or until the repeated contractions begin to slow/stop. You may need to repeat the stretched position if you feel the cramp returning.The arch of the foot and the toes are the most common areas of the foot where cramping occurs.Stretch your arches by grabbing your toes with your hand while seated, and pull them upward until you feel a stretch in your arch. Hold this position for 30 seconds, and release. If you feel the cramp returning then repeat the stretch.You can also try rolling a tennis ball under your foot. While seated or standing, you can use this tool under the pad of the toes, the arch, and the heel.

, This is a good way to stretch muscles, tendons, and ligaments that are causing the cramping in either your arch or your toe area.As quickly as possible when you become aware that your foot or toe area is starting to cramp, change positions so that your body weight is on the painful foot., As the pain starts to subside, walk around.Continue to walk around to prevent the area from cramping again. Once a cramp or spasm occurs, the muscles in the area may continue to cramp or spasm until it is completely relaxed.This means that you may need to remain standing and/or walking around for at least three minutes, or even longer, until you feel the area is relaxed and there is no further pain.Be prepared to continue walking if the pain comes back when you remove the added pressure provided by your body weight.Once the pain is better, continue to stretch until you feel the muscles are relaxed. Stretch your arch and your toes by placing a towel on the ground and picking it up by scrunching your toes together.Add a stretch for your calf muscles to provide additional relief if needed to stretch the muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach to your heel area. Even if your calf muscle is not cramping, it may prove helpful to stretch your calf muscles once the initial pain is managed.Place one foot flat on the floor about four to five foot-lengths away from a wall. Lean into the wall with your hands until you feel a stretch in your calf muscles while keeping your foot flat on the floor. Hold for 30 seconds then repeat if you feel the foot or toe cramp returning.It is beneficial to do this stretch with the knee straight and also with the knee bent. This will stretch both components of the calf muscle.

, In addition to stretching your foot or toes that are cramping, remove your shoes and socks and gently massage the area.Keep your foot and toes in the stretched position as you massage the area.Massage your foot and locate the hardened muscle that is cramping. Using your thumbs, massage the hardened area of the cramp. You may need to be fairly firm and aggressive over the hardened muscle to create relief. Continue to massage the area until the muscle begins to relax.Begin to massage the surrounding area, returning to the primary trigger point as you massage. Work in either circular or stretching motions with your hands as your massage the areas.Pull your toes upward as you massage if they are being drawn down or if your arch is cramping.Use a downward pull to stretch your toes if they are cramped in a position that is pulling them upward. Continue your massage for two to three minutes, or until you feel the cramped muscle has relaxed and is no longer painful., If the muscle is currently cramping, heat helps when applied to tightened muscles.Use a heating pad or crushable hot pack as a heat source to relieve the tension in the muscle.
After the cramp subsides, if you have any residual pain from the event, ice applications can help to relieve sore and tender muscles., Ice your foot regularly for several days to help the area to recover from overuse, an injury, or improper-fitting footwear.Avoid applying ice directly to the skin. Use a thin towel between your skin and the cold pack or ice source to avoid damaging the skin.Apply the ice for 15 to 20 minutes several times each day for two to five days, or until the soreness and tenderness subsides.Apply ice to the bottom of your foot and heel area while standing by gently rolling a frozen 12 to 16 ounce water bottle along the bottom of your foot. Be sure you have support so you do not fall., Foot pain and cramping can be caused by several variables including either an injury or overuse.Your foot is made of a complex arrangement of bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Any of these can be overworked or injured which leads to foot pain, spasms, and cramping.Foot pain and cramps caused by both injuries and overuse usually respond to rest.There is no clear time frame recommended for staying off your foot if the cramping caused by overuse other than watching your pain level and following any instructions provided by your doctor. Take opportunities to rest your feet as often as possible.This may include a few days away from constant standing or walking, wearing work shoes or boots that may be triggering the cramps, or other activities that keep you on your feet for the majority of the day.If you have suffered a specific injury, stay off your feet for the amount of time directed by your doctor., Routine exercise keeps your muscles in good condition.Gradually increase your intensity of aerobic exercises to help condition the muscles, tendons, and ligaments in your feet and to reduce your experience with cramps. Swimming is a great aerobic exercise to treat problems with foot pain and cramps without bearing weight through the feet and unloading the joints.Work towards improving your level of fitness. Include stretching and flexibility exercises both before and after you exercise.If you already exercise regularly, evaluate your workout routines to determine if any existing exercises are contributing to your cramps.

, Select shoes that fit well all around, have shanks and solid heel counters built in, and provide good support.A shank is a supportive strip that runs along the bottom of the shoe. It is not visible, so it is difficult to tell if the shoe manufacturer included a shank in the design. If the shoe is flimsy, and easy to bend in the middle, then it probably does not have a shank.The heel counter is also not visible, but the presence of a solid heel counter can be determined by pressing inward on the middle, upper area of the back part of the shoe. If it easily collapses to the inside, then the heel counter is not very strong. The more rigid and supportive the heel counter is, the more difficult it will be to push the upper back part of the shoe toward the inside sole.Many shoe stores have specialists who can evaluate your gait and fit you properly.

, Prevent heel pain and plantar fasciitis by discarding shoes with worn soles and heels.Worn soles and heels contribute to an uneven step with heel counters that have lost some of their support. Discard old shoes and replace with new ones that have the proper support.Be aware that wearing high-heeled shoes may be part of the cause of repeated foot and toe cramps., Routinely performing flexibility exercises can work to prevent foot and toe cramps.Improve the flexibility and strength in your toes by raising your foot into a stretched position as if you were standing on your tip toes. Hold for five seconds and repeat ten times. Switch to the other foot.Try holding onto a wall or other support and raising yourself onto your toes, like a ballet dancer. Hold for five seconds and repeat ten times, then switch to the other foot.From a seated position, lift your flat foot onto your toes, but this time curl your toes inward. Hold for five seconds, repeat ten times, then switch to the other foot.Roll a golf ball along the bottom of your foot for two minutes, then switch to the other foot.Place several marbles, as many as 20, on the floor then pick them up one by one with your toes and place them into a bowl or other container. Switch feet and repeat the exercise., While some foot conditions recommend avoiding walking barefoot, foot and toe cramps benefit from the foot conditioning this provides.Walking barefoot in the sand helps to strengthen your toes along with all the small intrinsic muscles of the foot and ankle and provides a gentle massage for your feet., Dehydration is a common cause of foot and toe cramps.Drink water before and after you exercise, and throughout the day to be sure you are getting enough fluids.Try drinking an electrolyte-enhanced sports drink or water; very often it is an electrolyte imbalance causing cramps.
You may also want to keep a glass of water at your bedside for cramps that may occur during the night., Nutrition is an important part of giving your body and your muscles what they need to function properly and reduce problems like cramping.Muscles use potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Include foods like bananas, dairy products, fresh vegetables, beans, and nuts., If you develop severe pain or swelling, see a doctor promptly.Also seek medical attention quickly if you are unable to walk or put weight on your foot.If there are areas of broken skin that are oozing, or if you have any signs of infection, seek immediate medical attention.Signs of infection include redness, warmth or tenderness to the touch, or a fever of 100 °F (37.7 °C) or higher.Also seek immediate care if you have any persistent pain or cramping and you have diabetes., If you notice any changes in the immediate area, or if both feet become painful or are cramping, make an appointment to have your feet examined.Watch for symptoms such as redness, swelling, a burning sensation, numbness, tingling, or tenderness to the touch. See your doctor if any of these symptoms develop., Cramping and pain that continues for more than one week, with or without using rest and ice applications, warrants medical evaluation.Persistent cramps in one or both feet may indicate an underlying condition with your feet or possibly even a medical cause for the problem.

, Work with your doctor to evaluate for possible medical causes of your foot cramps if they persist. Some medical conditions that may be causing your foot pain and cramps include the following:Abnormal levels of electrolytes in the body.Dehydration caused by a need to increase your intake of water and/or electrolytes.Thyroid disorders.Vitamin D deficiency.Kidney disease including early stages as well as more severe forms of kidney disease that require dialysis.Diabetes, both type 1 and type 2.Peripheral arterial disease.Arthritis, both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.Gout, which usually does not cause direct cramps but does cause severe and intense pain.Cold stress or trench foot, which is caused by working in conditions where your feet stay either exposed to cold or exposed to warmer temperatures, as high as in the 60’s °F, but stay consistently wet.Nerve damage to either a single nerve or to a bundle of nerve fibers.Brain disorders such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and muscle dystonias.Pregnancy, most often with foot cramping and pain in the third trimester, but can occur anytime during the pregnancy., Several of the medical conditions listed can be easily resolved.For example, adjusting your fluid intake and/or the types of beverages you drink may be a simple step that resolves the problem. Use vitamin D supplements if instructed to do so by your doctor.Follow the directions provided by your doctor to correct the problem. Those instructions may include a needed follow-up with additional recommended tests, adjustments to your medications, or a referral to a specialist., Your doctor may be able to adjust some of your prescribed medications that may be contributing to your cramps.Some examples of medications that may contribute to foot and toe cramps include furosemide, donepezil, neostigmine, raloxifene, tolcapone, albuterol, and lovastatin. This is only a list with examples. If you feel you are taking a different medication that is related to your cramps, discuss this with your doctor.Never adjust your medications on your own. With the help of your doctor, doses can possibly be adjusted to correct the problem or a different medication can be prescribed to replace one that may be contributing to your cramps."

Stretch.,
Apply heat or cold.,
Massage the cramped muscle.,
Try medication to help with the pain.,
Try home remedies.",How to Treat a Cramped Muscle1," A cramping muscle can relax when stretched correctly. Stretching warm muscles regularly lengthens muscle fibers so they can contract and tighten more vigorously during exercise and you are less likely to experience cramping. A stretch should never feel painful. If you feel something sharp or stabbing, relax your stretch.For a calf cramp, stand with your feet set apart, placing the affected leg in front of the other. Lean your body weight towards the front leg, bending slightly at the knee. Keep the heels of both feet on the floor. Hold for 15 – 30 seconds.
Another calf stretch is seated with both legs extended together in front of your body. Hold the feet in a relaxed position, and keep your back straight.

, Applying a heating pad or ice pack on a cramped muscle can help soothe pain. Apply cold or heat for about 20 minutes at a time. Never apply ice or a cold pack directly on your skin — be sure to wrap it in a towel or other covering first. Be careful when using heating pads in bed. Falling asleep with a heating pad on can cause a fire.If you are using a hot shower for muscle cramps, direct the water flow towards the affected area. If you have a high-pressure water stream, this will provide additional massaging benefits.

Use heat for muscles that are sore due to chronic pain or stress., If your cramped muscle is in an area you can reach with your hands, such as your legs, try to massage it. Grasp your leg muscle tightly with both hands, and rub deeply and firmly to help it relax.Having a second person who can help massage areas you may not be able to reach will help. It's not necessary that the person be a trained specialist. Simply deep rubbing of your muscle often helps the muscle relax.
A massage should not be painful. If your muscles are tightly bound by cramping, certain types of massage can cause injury. Never continue with a massage that is painful.
A massage therapist works with deep tissue relaxation, and therapeutic treatment of muscle cramps. Seeing a professional massage therapist weekly or monthly should be considered for chronic cramps that don't respond to your own treatment.
You can also try foam-rolling. Place the foam roller beneath the affected area. Roll over it, applying gentle pressure, for about five to 10 minutes. This can also work with a tennis ball.

, Over-the-counter medications including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can be effective at relieving pain caused by cramped muscles, though they don't actually treat the cramp itself.Check with your medical professional if you have health conditions that may be negatively affected by taking painkillers or consume more than three alcoholic beverages daily.
Muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), orphenadrine (Norflex), and baclofen (Lioresal) can be helpful to relax cramping muscles. Speak with your doctor to learn if this is an option for you.

, If the above methods are not working, try home remedies. While these do not work for everyone, they might help you.

Wear sunscreen outdoors (even when it's not hot) to prevent dark spots, freckles and sunburn.
Using a medicated spot cream to get rid of any pimples and avoid touching your face without washing your hands first.
Always take your make up off before bed.;
, Create a perfect canvas for the rest of your make up by applying your foundation.


Spray an airbrush spray foundation (that perfectly matches your skin tone) onto the back of your hand, then use a stippling brush to dab it onto your face, creating an even flawless finish.
Use your favorite, high-coverage concealer to cover up any dark circles around your eyes or any other imperfections.
Use a powder puff to dab some loose powder onto your face -- this sets your foundation without smudging the flawless finish you've already created.

, Barbie has a tiny nose, so you'll need to make your own nose appear smaller using contouring.


Take a matte (non-shimmering), brown eye shadow and a thin make up brush and start contouring along the sides of your nose, in a straight line from the inside edge of your eyebrows down.
Take a fan brush and use it to lightly feather out the lines, to blend them in and make them appear more natural.

, The next step is the eyes. First take a light baby blue eye shadow and apply it all over your lids.


Next, take a matte white eye shadow and apply it to the inner corners of your eyes. This will help to open up your eyes. Also apply the white powder to your brow bone, as highlighter.
Now take a bright pink eye shadow and apply it above the crease of your eyelid, so it makes a semi-circular line from one edge of your eyelid to the other.
Lastly, take a dark blue color and use it to line the crease of your eyelid, so it forms a distinct line between the light blue and pink shadows. Then use this same dark blue color to line your upper and lower lashes, creating a cartoon look.

, Take a white eyeliner and use it on your waterline (the inside of your lower eyelash). This will make the whites of your eyes appear larger and wider.


Take your false eyelashes (whichever style you think is most Barbie-ish) and measure them against your natural eyelashes. Cut them to length (from the inside) if necessary.
Apply a line of the eyelash glue and wait a minute or two for it to become tacky. Then carefully apply the false eyelashes to your real lashes.
For a real Barbie effect, apply half-length strips of false lashes to your lower lash line, running from the outside corner to the center of your eye.

, Take a rosy pink powder blush and use a brush to apply it to the apples of your cheeks and along your cheek bones.


Take a shimmering pink lipstick and apply it to your lips. Use a lip brush to define the edges of your lips and achieve a more precise shape.
To create a doll-like effect, take a concealer and apply it around the outside of your lips to create a sharply defined effect. Use a brush to blend the concealer in well and apply some loose powder on top.
Take a pink lip gloss and apply it on top of the lipstick to add some shine. "

Go blonde.,
Style your hair.,
Get tan.,
Paint your nails.",How to Look Like Barbie2," Everyone knows that Barbie has blonde hair, so if you really want to imitate Barbie's look you'll have to follow suit!


If you really want to commit to the Barbie look, you'll probably need to bleach your hair to get that white-blonde effect. If you've never done this before, you should book an appointment with a professional hair stylist -- you don't want to ruin your hair!
If you're not ready to commit to all-over bleach, you can lighten the color of your hair less dramatically using a blonde hair dye or by getting highlights. Again see a professional if you don't feel comfortable doing this yourself.
But if you're simply trying to achieve the Barbie look for a costume party or fancy dress, a blond wig is your best option. This will give you perfect Barbie-blonde hair without the need for permanent color or dye.

, Barbie's hair is always perfect, without a strand out of place. If you decided to buy a blonde wig, your job is pretty much done, but styling your natural hair to look like Barbie requires a little more effort.


Keep your hair in good condition by washing it frequently with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. This is important, as blonde hair color can be very drying.
Keep your hair as long as possible, but make sure it's in good condition by getting it trimmed regularly. Barbie sometimes has bangs, so consider getting those cut in too.
If you decide to wear your hair down, use a flat iron to make large, loose waves and use some hairspray to give your hair lots of volume.
Alternatively, you can just wear your hair straight or tie it up in a high ponytail -- it depends on which Barbie look you're trying to achieve.

, Barbie has sun-kissed skin, something you can achieve by tanning your skin naturally or using self-tanner from a bottle.


If you can tan naturally, you're lucky. However, you still need to take good care of your skin. Always wear sun-tan lotion while sunbathing to prevent sunburn and skin damage -- otherwise you will pay the price in later life.
If you need to apply self-tanner, use one that builds up gradually and compliments your natural skin tone. Make sure to exfoliate well before applying -- this removes any rough or flaky skin and prevent the self-tanner from looking patchy.
Regardless of whether your tan is natural or fake, you should moisturize your skin regularly with a hydrating lotion to keep your skin nice and soft.

, Barbie girls should always have perfectly manicured nails -- on fingers and toes. You can paint your nails yourself or go to a salon for a more professional finish.


Obviously pink is the natural choice for Barbie nail color, but you could branch out a little by going for something like purple or orange -- as long as it's something bright and cheery. No dark colors, like red, purple or black (unless you wanna be a Goth Barbie!)
Another good option is a French manicure -- light pink or peach base with a white tip. This is very classic and sophisticated and works well with the Barbie look.
If you apply the nail polish yourself, try to be as neat as possible. Apply a single stroke of polish down the center of your nail, then do a second and third stroke on either side. Clean up any mistakes with a cotton bud dipped in nail polish remover.
If you decide to get your nails done professionally, think about getting a gel manicure. These are more expensive than a regular manicure, but the polish will last for up to three weeks and won't chip or peel.

Wear pink.,
Be stylish.,
Be sporty.,
Accessorize like Barbie.",How to Look Like Barbie3," If you want people to recognize your Barbie look, you've got to wear pink -- it's the classic Barbie color.


Incorporate as much pink into your wardrobe as possible -- pink tees, pink dresses, pink jeans, pink skirts, pink shorts etc. You can wear pink pajamas to bed (or to sleepovers) and get a pink robe for lounging around the house -- and don't forget the fuzzy pink slippers.
However, don't go too overboard by wearing head-to-toe pink. Even Barbie understands the need for a little variation. Try wearing one or two pink items per outfit, for example: a pink top and pink shoes. Then you can accessorize with more pink if you like!

, Barbie is a bit of a style icon -- she's always on board with the latest trends and never leaves the dream house without looking her best!


Look at fashion magazines and fashion blogs to see what's hot this season. Do your best to follow the latest trends while also staying true to your own sense of style and individuality -- that's what being a style icon is all about!
Don't feel like you have to spend a ton of money on clothes just to be stylish. Find some clever ways around your budgetary restraints -- for example, host a clothes swapping party with your friends or shop in vintage and thrift stores for some great bargains.

, Of course, Barbie isn't all about high heels and mini-skirts, she like to get active too! But that doesn't mean sweat pants and oversized tees -- Barbie still looks cute when she plays sport or hangs out at the beach.


Get some cute, colorful workout gear -- patterned bicycle shorts, stylish yet comfortable sports bras and funky running shoes. You could also wear a pink baseball cap if you're running outside!
Barbie loves the beach, so having some pretty swimwear is very important. Go for cute, girly bikinis with frills, bows and beads when you're just hanging out and sunbathing, or choose a functional yet feminine bikini for beach volleyball, swimming, or lifeguard duty.

, Any self-respecting Barbie girl knows that accessories are a vital component of virtually any outfit -- so don't forget!


Hair accessories are a great place to start. Cute pink headbands work nicely, as do sparkly clips, pretty ribbons and flower hair ties. You can also wear cute hats or head scarves.
Jewelry is another big one. If you're going for a sophisticated or vintage Barbie look, you should go with pearl necklaces and diamond earrings. More modern accessories include hoop or dangle earrings, colored bangles and chunky beaded necklaces.
Finally, Barbie always carries a handbag and it usually matches with her outfit, so the larger your handbag collection, the better!

Accessorize like Demi.",How to Look Like Demi Lovato," Demi Lovato often wears more subtle lipstick colors, which are peach, or light pink, with just a bit of gloss over them. However, she has also been seen wearing bright red lipstick. Her lips aren’t super thick, so you don’t need to go overboard with the lip liner, or even use it at all, to get her look. Just a bit of attention to your lips will do the trick if you want to look like Demi.


Keep your lip gloss and lipstick with you so you can refresh those lips as you go on with your day.;
, Demi likes to have smoky eyes with dark makeup and dark liner. She typically lines her waterline (the bottom of her eyes) with black, as well as wearing black or dark eye shadow. To get this look, you can use black or dark eyeshadow on the outer and inner corners of your eyelids, and then use a brush to blend them around your eyes. Pick a shimmery green or silver shadow to go in the middle of those lids and blend it in with the black for the full effect. You can also add some shimmery peach shadow on the inner corners of your eyes.


You can also add some flesh-toned or peach shadow between the brow bone and your eyes, to make the dark eye shadow and your eyes pop more.
Sometimes, Demi likes to go a bit more natural, and prefers to just have thicker eyeliner on the tops of her eyes, extending upward past her eyes, with a flesh-toned shadow instead of the smoky look.
Other times, she likes to keep the smoky eyes but to play around with the color of her bottom liner a bit. Once, she had a shimmery green bottom eyeliner to match her green outfit.

, Demi’s lashes are dark and beautiful. Sometimes, she just puts thick, lengthening black mascara over her top and bottom lids, while other times, she wears fake eyelashes. Her lashes also have a nice curl to them, so use an eyelash curler to give them that upward look.


If you’re not comfortable with fake lashes, just keeping them big and dark is fine for the Demi look.

, Demi tends to have pretty thick, dark brows with a nice arch, so if you want to mimic that look of hers, you should pluck your brows down to a nice medium shape of medium thickness with an arch toward each end, making sure they go past your eyes enough to frame your eyes, with about an inch and a half of space in between. Then, get a dark brown pencil to pencil them in and give them a nice, strong shape.


Sometimes, she likes her brows to be extra thick, and other times, they take on a thinner shape, so you don’t have to stick to one look.
You can also decide on a lighter color, if you think dark brows don’t look right with your light-colored hair.
Consider getting an eyebrow shaper to help keep the hairs of your brows in place.

, Demi has great skin– as evidenced by her selfie without makeup. To get her look, just put on a bit of foundation, whether it has a cream or a powder base, and put some concealer under your eyes for an added effect, as well as over any blemishes. You don’t have to have perfect skin to look like her, but you can work on applying foundation so your makeup appears more dramatic and your skin looks evenly toned.


You can also put a bit of blush along your cheeks to give yourself Demi’s healthy, sun-kissed look.

, Demi likes to keep it real. On August 13th, 2013, the day after the Teen Choice Awards, she posted a selfie of herself without any makeup at all. Her blonde curls were natural and she wore cute black eyeglasses, showing off her natural beauty and her sweet smile. Don’t be compelled to have perfect makeup all the time, either, and let yourself go natural when you feel like it, being proud of your natural look., The thing about Demi Lovato is that, even though she’s only 21, she’s already reinvented herself so many times, from the little girl on Barney and Friends to the more mature, edgy woman she is today. This includes having just about every hairstyle on the planet, from loose, blonde curls, to straight black hair with bangs, to her signature ponytail. If you want to look like Demi, then the trick is to not look the same two months in a row. Still, there are several key hairstyles you can try if you want to look like her.

, She has been known to wear her hair up in a high ponytail, wrapping it either with a thick (at least 6-inches) scrunchie, or even by wrapping her own hair around itself and securing it with a bobby pin. This look is pretty unusual, and you need a lot of confidence, as well as a big smile, to pull it off. Her ponytails are also pretty tight, as opposed to loose and messy. Make sure you’re pulling your hair up pretty securely over your scalp.You can also do the Demi bun, using the same principles, except having your hair up high in a tight bun instead of in a ponytail.

, Demi has been seen with so many different hair colors that it can be easy to forget what color her natural hair really is. She has had platinum blonde hair, blonde hair with black highlights, dark brown hair, black hair, brown hair with blonde highlights, pink hair, white-blond hair with green highlights, and just about every other hair color on the planet. If you want to rock her look, there’s no one hair color you should have, though her hair has most recently been brown.

, To get Demi’s wispy curls, make sure your hair is at least down past your shoulders, and then use a curling iron that is at least 1 ½ inches thick to get some nice, loose curls into your hair. Let them fall over your face a bit as well as over your shoulders, and add a bit of mousse or hairspray to get them to stick, but don’t worry about making your look perfect. You can even accessorize with a black, wide-brimmed hat., Demi has rocked bangs in her recent years. She has had super straight bangs with curly hair, bangs that are a bit wavy, or currently, bangs that fall over the side of her face. If you want to rock the Demi look, then you can consider adding bangs to your look — while knowing that it can take a bit of a commitment to grow them out. Let them fall just over your eyebrows, if you want to keep them straight, to rock one of Demi’s most popular looks.

, Demi’s more recent awesome hairdo involves her having shaved part of the left side of her head, while keeping the rest of her hair straight and long, letting it fall a bit over the other side of her face. If you have the guts to pull this one off, just shave one side of your hair, from about your ear to your middle part, while keeping the rest of your hair long. This is a more edgy and exciting look, and it’s part of the new Demi.


Most recently, she’s cut her hair shorter, leaving the shaved part standing.

, Demi’s hair is always changing, and part of the reason why that’s so easy for her is that she has been known to rock hair extensions. If you want to chop off your hair for a dramatic look one week and have long, flowing curls the next, then you may want to try hair extensions for fun. They can also help you make a great, thick Demi ponytail or bun. #*Her hair is pretty thick, and extensions can help make your hair both thick and versatile.

, Demi Lovato loves wearing her leather. She wears leather bomber jackets, leather pants, leather boots, and sometimes, even leather with fur around the collar. If you want to get her look, then you should add some leather into your wardrobe — or even go for the full-body leather look! She also has been seen with leather purses, too. Of course, you can go for the fake leather, not the real stuff, to get her look., She loves wearing leather jackets that are studded, dresses which have rhinestones, or which just have some kind of sparkles all over them. She doesn’t wear too many plain outfits, and always has a bit of bling on her clothes, whether you can see it on her shoes, around her wrists, along the collar of her dresses, in her ears, or even on her shoulders. Try adding a bit more metal and shininess to your outfits if you want to get the Demi look.

, Black is definitely the color that Demi wears the most. She doesn’t wear it to look dark, gloomy, or Gothic, but to show how unique, mature, and gorgeous she really is. Don’t be afraid of wearing black pants, a black shirt, and a black jacket all in one day — along with a black purse and some black boots, of course. If you’re not fond of normally wearing black, you can always bedazzle your outfit to give it some extra flair.


The black also looks great with Demi’s ever-changing hairstyles. Add some to your wardrobe today.

, Though black is the color Demi has most commonly been seen wearing, white is probably the color she wears the most often after black. Wear a plain white t-shirt, a more girlie, lacy white top, a white blazer with a white t-shirt, white leggings, or white pants, along with some white heels or some white slippers. Of course, don’t forget the chunky white jewelry and the white purse, either.

, Demi loves rocking the tight-fitting blazers along with some tight pants. This makes her look classy and professional at the same time. She’s not afraid to wear them with low-cut tank tops, either, or some metal jewelry that draws attention to her chest. Get some blazers that fit you well and that are tight and flattering, and which don’t make you look like you’re headed for a job interview. She wears black blazers, white blazers, leather blazers, and blazers that zip up on the side.

, Demi has also been known to wear flannel on occasion. Though the flannel she wears the most often is — you guessed it — black and white, she has also been seen in green and blue flannel, as well as some other colors. She wears it loose, with blue jeans and graphic tees, or tight black pants or leggings. If you want to go more casual but still want to have Demi’s awesome style, then wear some flannel when you feel like it.

, Demi doesn’t always look edgy, serious, or grungy. Sometimes she has some fun and gets a bit more girly or creative with her look. She has worn leopard-print low-cut shirts, tops with silver tassels all over them, strapless tank tops with sweet-heart cuts, and pink, shimmery skirts. She has also worn light pink dresses, shirts with floral patterns, and tank tops with white lace around the collar.


Wear all black one day and go girly the next. The fun of being Demi is that you can transform yourself every day!

, Demi’s favorite shoe color tends to be black, whether she’s wearing black stilettos, black boots with high, thin heels, black strappy sandals, or black shoes that are studded with spikes and sparkles. She also wears gold and silver high heels, with a heel that is at least 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) high. She likes strappy shoes, whether they are white, black, or shiny and silver. She wears both close-toed and open-toed shoes, and when her shoes are open, she shows off her red nail polish.Demi has rarely been seen wearing flats, though you can wear them if you need a break, as long as they aren’t too bright.
She also likes to wear heels with a high platform.

, Demi Lovato wears cute accessories that accentuate her look without taking attention away from her face and clothes. Sometimes, she wears simple studs in her ears, while other days, she wears big metal or white hoop earrings, or long black necklaces with tassels. She sometimes wears subtle thin silver necklaces with tiny pendants or thick chunky metal chokers and chunky metal rings and bracelets. She mostly sticks to metal, silver, gold, or black accessories and doesn’t go overboard with them.


If you want to accessorize like Demi, then it’s all about deciding whether to go loud or quiet, and to wear just one or two key pieces of accessories with each outfit.
She also has sometimes worn a silver stud nose ring in one nostril.

Determine if your gastroenteritis requires medical assistance.,
Avoid certain medications before seeing your doctor.",How to Cure Stomach Cramps7," Knowing when to contact a doctor or get help is essential. Stomach pain is a symptom of many different issues and some can be serious, such as peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, appendicitis, autoimmune disease, gall bladder issues, cancer, and more. Generally for stomach pain, get help immediately if:You have abdominal pain that is sudden and sharp, or you have pain in your chest, neck, or shoulder
You’re vomiting blood or have blood in your stool
Your abdomen is hard and tender to touch
You can't move your bowels and are also vomiting

, Though these conditions are typically minor and can easily be treated with over-the-counter medicines, you should see your doctor if:Your symptoms last longer than a few days or do not improve with medication
You lose weight you were not trying to lose
You have sudden or severe pain. Get immediate care if you feel a crushing or squeezing pain.
You have trouble swallowing
Your skin or eyes look pale or yellow

Candice has long and blonde hair.,
Physique.To get her Body, don't feel like you need to go on a diet.,
Diet: Candice is very thin, but healthy.,
Clothing.,
Have pets.Candice has a little dog, called milo- he is a jack Russel Terrier.,
Height.Candice is very tall (1.75m) if you are tall- that's great for you!,
Candice has blue eyes and a light Skin color- even though she usually sports the bronzed glow.,
Look after your Skin.",How to Look Like Candice Swanepoel,"


If you already have blonde hair: Great! If it isn't long yet, let it grow, look after it.(maybe use some treatment such as Moroccan oil and a hair mask once a week).






If you don't- that's fine too! Just copy the step above, look after your hair, let it grow etc.If you really want to color it, do so, although it isn't recommended since it'll be a struggle to maintain healthy looking hair because you have to keep touching up the roots (especially if you have very dark hair)!






Take note that if you want the perfect blonde for your skin colour, you should find a hair salon that is highly recommended and has possibly even won prizes.
Remember,your natural hair color is usually the one that fits you best! (skin color and eye color wise).





;
, Losing weight consists of mostly working out! Go running a minimum twice a week and do Pilates/yoga three times a week.On youtube, the VS channel has videos on how to train like a VS Angel, with the Angels' personal trainers and the Angels' themselves.


Candice is famous for her beautiful bump, so you should also do squats, to get yours resembling hers.

, You don't need to diet to be the same size as her, just eat healthy, eat A LOT of vegetables,fruit and meat, while getting food from all the major food groups.

, Candice claims to wear comfy, yet girly clothes that are also casual. Such as Jeans and a White tank-top with some nice jewels.


Take note that your clothes should always be clean, ironed, tidy and the outfits should be good looking.You can make a research on outfits on google from celebs and models and take ideas and such from them.

, If you like animals, maybe ask your parents for one.

, But if you aren't, invest in some nice wedges, etc. to seem taller than you already are.

, You can easily get it by buying a good bronzer.

, Not everyone is blessed with clean skin- but there are ways, to make it look more even- or even beat the impurities and pimples!


The best cream for getting rid of pimples (in my opinion) is Clean and clear blackhead clearing scrub. I also use clean and clears morning burst facial cleanser. I highly recommend these products for flawless skin.
Go to a cosmetic Salon (if you can afford it) to get a facial.






Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night!






Wash off your Makeup as soon as you get home






Use a moisturizer, that is made for your skin-type!






Before applying make up wash your face and wipe dry with a towel, so your face is rid of oil and a couple more of dead cells.(It looks more flawless and pinker after that). Then put on foundation, but extremely light and not all over your face if not needed. Hide the blemishes and such with powder dots or concealer. Add pink hue(with blush) to your face and mostly on the apples of your cheeks, chin and the two sides of your forehead. Blend the blush with the back of your hand or fingers. Do winged eyeliner for your eyes if you want and lipstick(that stains lips) in a nice shade that suits you.
Finally apply highlighter and bronzer to key places on your face(all Victoria Secret models do it).That adds that amazing glow, they all have.

Lana often calls herself “Gangsta Nancy Sinatra.” Take a look at photos of artists from the 50’s and 60’s to find inspiration for vintage hair, clothing, makeup, and music.Lana has cited Cat Power, Eminem, Nirvana, Amy Winehouse, Elvis Presley, and many others as inspiration for her musical style. Check out a few of these artists to get a feel for how Lana shaped her style.;
, Lana is known to not shy away from controversial topics and take on people who dislike her.Emulate Lana by expressing your own emotions.


Speak your own opinion, even if it is not popular. Lana took heat early in her career for her performances, but stuck to her artistic vision and made a successful career.
Respond to negative moments by looking at your accomplishments. Lana uses her successes to support the idea that she is doing well in her career. Use your own daily achievements as reminders of the good things in your life.
Express your emotions. Lana’s songs and art are deeply emotional. Let them inspire you to express your own emotions in creative ways.

, Lovestruck is a recurring theme through Lana’s songs and videos. It makes her moody, pouty, and occasionally risqué.


Imitate her lovestruck attitude for a convincing impression by casting long glances and pretending to be wrapped up in your own emotions.
Smile softly, giggle very lightly, and gently look off into the distance.
Try picturing someone you like to give you inspiration.

, Mimic her attitude on stage by using slow, graceful hand gestures. Lana rarely dances on stage.Move slowly around the area or performance space.
Shift your weight back and forth from foot to foot to create a slight side to side motion. Lana often fidgets this way on stage.
If you are imitating her on an actual stage, make sure to walk around and have fun with whoever might be on stage with you.Lana is known to interact with her band and dancers and make use of the whole stage.

, Lana is often smiling, friendly, and mimicking child-like behavior off-stage. Develop an amiable and innocent personality to match Lana’s.


When she speaks with interviewers, she tends to laugh a lot and smile. Watch how she laughs and smiles by watching interview clips on YouTube.
Try to make your giggle high-pitched and look away from people playfully when they ask you questions.
Speak slowly. Talk deliberately and smile when you talk. In interviews, Lana does not seem like she is in a hurry. She speaks slow and laughs often.
Talk without rushing yourself, and pause to make it seem like you’re thinking every once in awhile.
Remember that when you are emulating Lana, silence and breaks in the conversation are acceptable.

, Lana often plays with her hair, flutters her eyelashes, and preens on camera. Emulate her off-stage playing with your hair and eyelashes, and gently touching your face.


Use primping as an accent. Too much of it may cause your look to be disheveled or be distracting.
Alternate gently twirling your hair around your finger and pushing it back away from your face.
Run your fingers along the top of your eyebrows as if trying to straighten them.
Gently wipe along the edge of your eyelashes as if you are clearing something from the tips.
Remember to keep conversation going while you primp. This is supposed to look like a subconscious action.

Get the hair.,
Get the face.,
Get the eyes.,
Get the lips.,
Get the clothes.,
Get the attitude.",How to Get the Partied All Night Look," If you've partied all night, you'll have been sweating, and sweaty hair + dancing = messy hair that stays that way unless you wash it. To stay clean, you can use a texturizer. That is, a texturizing hair product which gives your hair, well, texture. Use the product on all of your hair and just mess it up really well. You can even shake your head about to your favourite song if you want. The point is to make sure you don't look the least bit polished or pulled-together. You have to stay out of place, but in an attractive way. Alternatively, you can spritz some hairspray all over and mess your hair up.;
, You won't want to have a completely matte complexion, so use a bit of highlighter on your forehead, bridge of your nose, apples of your cheeks and brow bone. Just don't go overboard. Also, you'll want a dewy complexion because if you've been dancing the night away, as with any other form of exercise, you'll be flushed and glowing. So perhaps a slightly shimmery powder or tinted moisturizer might work as well. Using a pinkish blush, sweep blush on the apples of your cheeks so you'll look flushed but not blotchy.

, This is the fun bit. The typical party look is heavy on eye makeup, but the partied all night look calls for looking like you've worn it for quite some time, so it can't be perfect. First, put some dark eyeshadow on your lids, but not past the crease of your eyelids. Be sure to blend really well so the colour fades out. Line your eyes with pencil eyeliner, in black or brown. I highly recommend black, though. Pencil because it has the best potential for blending and smudging. Thus, do not use liquid eyeliner or gel eyeliner. Line both your upper eyelids and your lower lid. Concentrate most of the eyeliner at the outer corners of your eye. Using your finger or a brush, smudge the eyeliner outwards. Line your bottom lash line with eyeliner, and then with a q-tip, gently blend it so it looks smudgy and smokey, and as if you didn't try at all. Or you could always rub your eyes gently to make it look like you've gotten it smudged. Just be sure not to end up looking like someone punched you in the eye. Also, pile on the mascara and even falsies if you want.

, You'll have pout, slightly swollen lips if your partying involved kissing lots of boys, so use a tinted lip balm or a lip plumper. Lip gloss would not have stayed on overnight and would look as if you're going for trying to look like this (which is not what we want. we want it to look effortless and like you just rolled out of bed with perfectly messy makeup). You don't have to paint it on perfectly. Just a few swipes will do, but the key is for your lips to look full from all the laughing and smooching and drinking you've done.

, To look like you've really partied, wear trendy clothes that are club-worthy, but choose a worn-out style, like an off-shoulder slouchy top with skinnies, basically anything that you can tweak to make you look like an attractive mess. Your shoes should be high heels. The most inappropriate to go dancing, but the most popular choice nonetheless, so you'll have to go with it and break out the strappy black stripper heels.

, To add the cherry on your partied-all-night ice cream sundae, you have to act the part. Maybe you could skip the drugged, hungover or unconscious look. Instead, you should be a tad dazed, a lot giggly and overall, exhausted but happy. Most people are after a night of well-deserved hard partying.

Learn about her look.,
Get a flawless base.,
Fill in your eyebrows.,
Get big, bright eyes.,
Sculpt your features.,
Shape your lips.",How to Emulate Lana Del Rey2," She likes to regard herself as a “gangsta Nancy Sinatra” and “Lolita lost in the hood.” Aesthetically, this often means big eyes, a fair complexion, and a vintage look.Check out pictures of Nancy Sinatra as well as Lana Del Rey that focus on their faces. Look at their make up and see what features make it unique.

, Create flawless looking skin to get your face ready for other products. Use a complementing primer, foundation, concealer, and powder to build a smooth, pale base that imitates Lana.


Always start by moisturizing your face and dabbing on a primer with a blending sponge. This will help the makeup last longer.
Apply a light foundation using a foundation brush or blending sponge. Choose a shade lighter than your own skintone if you are not naturally pale. Do not try to change your skin tone all together, though. Simply opt for the palest version of your natural color.
Use concealer on dark circles and imperfections. Blend out into the foundation with a small concealer brush.
Use a fluffy brush to top your whole face with a translucent powder. Use a light hand and gently brush on a small amount of powder to set the look.

, Lana regularly sports straight, dark eyebrows with little arch. Use a brow powder to darken and redefine the shape of your brows.


Choose a color no more than a shade darker than your hair’s root color. Too dark of a brow color could overwhelm the rest of the look.Use an eyebrow gel or powder and an angled brush. Start by defining the bottom line of your brow, keeping it straight at the arch.
Once you have a baseline for the shape of your brow, fill in the area above it. Use small flicks of the brush in the same direction as your brow hairs to imitate the natural hair.
Set with a clear brow gel to keep the natural hairs in place.

, Lana is known for her big-eyed looks with simple shadows and large eyeliner wings. Create a softy, smokey eye look with bold black liner and oversized lashes.


Start with an eyeshadow that matches the color of your skin and apply all across your lids with a fluffy brush.Once your lids are neutral, take a cool gray or gray-brown shadow and buff it into your crease. Blend outward toward the tip of your brow, and concentrate the bulk of the shadow on the outer third of your crease.
Take the same color used on the crease and apply it lightly along the lower lashline using a flat brush.
Brighten your lids below the crease by patting on a pearl or satin-finish eyeshadow in a beige, peach, or nude shade. Use a flat brush, and concentrate most of the product on the center of your lid.
Use a liquid black eyeliner to make a bold wing. Start by lining your lid using short strokes and connecting the dots in between each stroke. Then, draw on the wing by making a line that runs along the outer corner of your eye toward the thin tip of your eyebrow. Stop about halfway up the lid to the eyebrow.
Connect the wing to the rest of your eyeliner by creating a triangle. Draw a straight line down from the tip of the wing down to the line you created on your eyelid. Then, fill in the triangle.
Apply generous coats of black mascara to boost up your lashes on top and on the bottom. Apply a pair of false lashes along your upper lash line to get Lana’s exaggerated volume.

, Lana doesn't often use an extreme contour, but she does shape her features slightly. Use a light hand to define your cheekbones and highlight the high points on your face.


Contour your cheeks with a contour powder or bronzer. Pick a color that looks tan on you, but not like a different skin tone.Apply the powder to the hollows of your cheeks and brush up toward your temples and into your hairline.
Sculpt your forehead by bringing a slight amount of the contour color down from the sides of your head toward your ears.
Strengthen your jawline by brushing the contour powder along your chin and jaw up to your ears. Blend down toward your neck.
Highlight your cheekbones and nose bridge with a non-shimmering highlighter. Brush the highlight at the high points of your cheekbones and down your nose, as well as just under the brow bone. Use a cotton swab to place a very small amount of highlight just above your cupid’s bow.
Use a light peach blush on your cheeks between the highlight and the contour. Lana wears peach and nude blushes instead of pinks and reds, so opt for something that doesn’t pop too much.

, Pick a matte lipstick that best fits your look, and look at pictures for inspiration. Lana wears a variety of shades, including reds, soft pinks, nudes, and berries.


Line your lips with a neutral liner, or one that matches your lipstick color. Do not overdraw your lips. Instead, follow your natural lip line.
Fill in your lips with the liner to help your lipstick last longer.
Use your lipstick and a lip brush to apply color to your lips. Trace the edges of your lips with your lip brush before filling in the rest of your lip.
Use concealer on a small brush to trace around the edges of your lip and create a sharp, defined line.

Know that all of Nate's outfits have several common aspects.,
Pick which outfit you want to wear.,
Grow out your stubble.,
Style your hair like Nate.",How to Dress Like Nathan Drake," Before you pick a specific outfit, you must have each of the following items:



Belt Buckle---Nate always has a big belt buckle, the symbol on the buckle varies between each game. In Uncharted one, there was a skull and crossbones, Uncharted 2 had a shell pattern, and Uncharted 3 had a horseshoe design. Getting the specific belt buckle from any of the games is difficult, however and expensive, so it's best to use a similar one. There is a replica buckle from Uncharted 3, but this might be hard to find.







Nate's Ring Necklace---Nate never goes anywhere without the ring of his ancestor Sir Francis Drake. There are several replicas online from places like Shapeways or Etsy. These usually don't come with cords though, so you'll need to buy some leather cord to tie around the ring. The prices range depending on the seller. Also, an official ring from the third game can be found on places like eBay. However, the official one is of poor quality and is quite expensive, with the prices rising constantly. You can also buy a plain steel ring and some leather cord.







Shoes---Nate's shoes aren't usually the focus. But if you want to be one-hundred percent accurate, you'll need to to buy brown walking shoes. However, as these are quite costly, so a dark pair of sneakers/trainers will do fine.







Gun holster---Nathan Drake is always seen with his brown shoulder gun holster and 45 Defender. Make sure to get an obviously fake pistol to avoid panicking people. Fake guns and a holster should be available on costume shops and various places online.







Watch---Nathan Drake wears a circular, leather watch with a brown leather cuff underneath.





;
, Nate wears different outfits in each game; his clothing choice depends on the climate or the situation. E.g. He wears lighter clothing in the desert than he would wear in Nepal. These are some of his outfits you can choose from:



Standard Outfit---Nate is usually seen in jeans and a plain, long-sleeved t-shirt. Any blue jeans will do. Ripped ones can even add to the effect. For the shirt, pick either a long white sleeve shirt, or a brown long sleeve shirt with a white undershirt. An olive henley shirt is another variant of this outfit.







Desert Outfit---In Uncharted 3, Nate visits the Rhub Al Khali, one of the biggest deserts in the world. Nate wears a white henley shirt (Polo shirt without a collar) and beige cargo trousers instead of his standard jeans. Nate also wears a middle eastern desert scarf AKA Shemagh. Henley shirts can be found in several retailers, but if for some reason you can't find one, a regular white shirt will do. For the shemagh, make sure to get a blue and white one and to wear it around your neck. Shemaghs are fairly easy to find online for a reasonable price.







Stealth Outfit---In Uncharted 2, Nate pulls off a heist at a museum in Turkey. For this outfit, you need a black shirt, black carpenter jeans, black sneakers, a headset, and a pair of black gloves. These clothing items should be available at most retailers.







Nepal--The Nepal outfit is Nate's standard outfit with a brown coat.







Teenage Nate---In Uncharted 3, you get to play as fourteen year old Nate for a short stint. For this outfit, you'll need a red and white baseball shirt, blue jeans, a pair of black high top sneakers, a metal analogue watch, and a brown satchel. Teen Nate wears an analogue watch on his belt. You'll also need shaggy hair.







Uncharted 4 outfits---As of Uncharted 4, Nate has some new outfits, the newest common element is the rope and grappling hook. These include:


Scotland Drake---Nate wears a green/brown military jacket over a dark blue jumper and has blue jeans.

Africa Drake---Nate wears a dark blue henley shirt with brown chinos.



, When Nate's on a quest for adventure, he doesn't always have time to shave. Don't shave for a few days, a week if possible.

, Nate's hair is fairly short with a spiked up fringe. To achieve this style, you'll need fairly short hair, your preferred styling product (Gel, Wax, etc), and a comb. When you've put the product into your hair, comb your fringe upwards and the rest of your hair forwards.

She wasn't preppy, or trashy, or colorful. And she always wore a pair of beat up, low top black converse with things written on them in sharpie. You could also colour your hair, but keep in mind most hair-colouring products are permanent, so you can't switch back to your natural hair colour very fast.

, You can use perfume, deodorant, body lotion, or something else that smells like lemons. Maybe you also can do some rosemary in your pockets. Make this smell your signature!

, And, although it sounds cheesy, it works. To be like Lena you have to think like her too!

Don't force yourself to stay in bed if it's uncomfortable.,
Don't make sleeping all day a habit.",How to Sleep All Day," Sleeping an entire day is not something the body is designed to normally do. As a very rough average, adults tend to require about 7.5 hours of sleep per night, though individual sleep needs can vary greatly from person to person. It can be easier to sleep beyond your normal ""limit"" if you're abnormally tired when you go to bed, so if the opportunity presents itself, you may want to pull a long night or two in the days leading up to your sleep session.


Note that it's almost impossible to make yourself sleep for a whole day simply from tiredness alone. For example, Randy Gardner, who broke the world record for sleep deprivation after 11 days without sleep, only slept 14 hours the first night after his ordeal.;
, For most people, it's easiest to sleep deeply when you know there's nothing — absolutely nothing — you need to do the next day. Take the time before your sleeping adventure to give yourself a completely open schedule for the following day. A few things you may want to consider canceling or rescheduling are:


Work/school commitments
Hangout time with friends
Dates
Checkups/appointments
Family obligations
Obviously, if you have any serious commitments, you'll want to attempt this a different day. Sleeping all day isn't worth missing something important.

, Everyone has different preferences when it comes to sleep — as just one example, some people like firm mattresses, while others like soft ones. You know your personal preferences better than anyone else, so make sure that, when you go to bed, things are just right. A few things you might want to consider include:



Pillows: Do like a big pile, or just a few?

Blankets: Do you like a few thin sheets, or a warm down comforter?

Mattress: Do you like your mattress hard as a rock, or soft as a feather? Do you need a second mattress or box spring?

Sleeping Accessories: Do you use a supportive foam wedge? A neck pillow? A pillow between your legs?

, Seal the blinds, close the curtains, and shut the doors. Ideally, you want your sleeping area to be 100% pitch-black. The human body takes its cues for going to sleep and waking up from the environment around it — when it gets dark, we tend to sleep easier, and when it's lighter, we tend to wake easier. Thus, making your room darker than it normally would be can easily add hours to your sleeping time.There's no extreme that's ""too far"" here — if light is coming through the bottom of the door, for instance, don't be afraid to block it with a towel.

, Keeping yourself at a comfortable temperature is extremely important for good sleep — get too cold or too hot, and it will be almost impossible to stay asleep. As a very general rule, most people tend to sleep best within 65-72 degrees F (18.33-22.22 degrees C).However, this can vary from person to person, so listen to your body and set the temperature to whatever is most comfortable for you.


Sleeping in a too-cold room is generally easier than sleeping in a too-hot room — you can always pile on more blankets, but you can only take so many away. In the latter case, having an air conditioner or a fan with you will make your task much easier., If you have the chance, try to exercise hard the day before your sleeping marathon. There's nothing like going to bed with the feeling of having done a ""hard day's work"". Physical exercise is well-known for its effect of promoting good sleep. In fact, exercise is even a frequent treatment for clinical cases of insomnia.Note, however, that there is evidence that working out too close to bedtime can actually make it harder for some people to sleep.If you're worried about your ability to fall asleep after exercise, simply leave at least an hour or two of ""down time"" before you go to bed.

, Eating well the night before your sleep marathon serves two purposes. First, it makes it less likely that you'll be hungry in the morning, which can force you to wake up. Second, it can make it easier for you to fall asleep in the first place. If you've ever felt drowsy after eating a big lunch, you're familiar with this phenomenon. Meals that contain tryptophan (a chemical found in turkey) and large amounts of carbohydrates tend to make people drowsiest.As with exercise, you usually do not want to eat right before bed. This can sometimes lead to digestion problems like gas, bloating, and heartburn that make sleep difficult., Knowing that you'll have everything you need to stay in bed the next day will help give you peace of mind so that you can drift off to sleep easier. Before you go to sleep, gather whatever you'll need to be comfortable the next day, plus a few things to keep you entertained when you inevitably wake up. Just a few ideas are:


Tissues
Earplugs
Spare clothes
Books
Laptop
Video games
Water and snacks
Garbage bin

, No matter how well you prepare, there is very little chance that you'll actually sleep for 24 uninterrupted hours once you go to bed. What's much more likely is that you'll sleep a little longer than you normally would, but that you'll eventually wake up. If you're still trying to sleep for the whole day, simply close your eyes and continue to rest. Depending on a variety of factors, like how dark it is and how tired you are, you may very well be able to squeeze in a few extra hours of sleep.

, A few biological needs can make it much harder to get back to sleep, so they're worth getting out of bed for, even if it means abandoning your mission for a few minutes. A few examples include:



Eating: Hunger is a big distraction when it comes to sleep. Evidence suggests that going to bed hungry can make it harder to get to sleep (and to stay asleep). On top of this, it's simply not nutritionally healthy to fast for a whole day simply because you're trying to sleep.Going to the bathroom: This is a no-brainer. In fact, this may be what forces you to wake up in the first place.

Stretching: When you've been laying in bed for a long time, your muscles can get stiff and start to ache. Fight this unpleasant feeling by rolling out of bed for a little stretching, walking, or yoga, which can help you stay comfortable and fall asleep faster., Everyone has a routine before they go to bed. Some people read, some wash their face, some surf the internet, and so on. If you're having a hard time getting back to sleep, performing these bedtime habits can help signal to the body that it's time to ""shut down"" again. Below are just a few ideas, but you can do anything that you normally do before bed:Reading
Listening to a book on tape
Drinking decaffeinated tea
Brushing your teeth
Bathing or washing your face
Spend a few relaxed minute with a hobby
Filling out a schedule for the next day

, Ever watch a friend (or a family member, or even a pet) yawn and suddenly feel the urge to do the same? For many people, the act of yawning is connected to a gentle feeling of fatigue. Even if they're not tired, they'll get a gentle sleepy feeling and even sometimes a desire to shut their eyes. While this won't always work, it only takes a few seconds, so it's definitely worth a try.


Yawns still aren't perfectly-understood by medical science, but one theory is that yawns produce their mysterious effects by literally lowering the temperature of the brain.Another theory is that yawning helps lubricate the lungs so that they can take in as much oxygen as possible.However, neither theory is proven.

, Sometimes, problems with getting to sleep can be all in your head. If you've tried everything else and you still can't get to sleep, you may benefit from using mental thought techniques to encourage sleep. There's no ""right"" way to do this, but a few ideas are listed below:Distract yourself with a mental game: Pick a category (e.g., cars, animals, movies, etc.) and think of one item for each letter of the alphabet. Try to mentally replay all of the scenes in your favorite movie in reverse order. Pick a word and change one letter at a time until it is another word.

Focus on an imaginary sensation: Pretend your body is gradually turning to stone from your feet upwards. Pretend you are slowly sinking into your mattress. Pretend your are levitating out of the bed. Try to focus on the space beyond your eyelids when your eyes are shut.

Try reverse psychology: Pretend there's something that you need to stay awake for (like that an important phone call is coming). Mentally repeat to yourself: ""I need to stay awake"" as you lay in the darkness. Once you're actually trying to do this, you may find that it's a lot harder to do what was quite easy before!, Small, gentle doses of sleep aids can be beneficial if you're trying to pull off a massive sleep-a-thon. However, you will want to be careful with how you use these — using large doses or unsafe drugs to force yourself to sleep is never a good idea. Always follow the directions on the packaging of whatever substance you use. Talk to a doctor if you have any drug allergies or you are already taking other medications.


A few safe over-the-counter drugs that can help you fall to sleep include Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, etc.), Doxylamine succinate, Melatonin, and Valerian.Never, ever use narcotics, barbiturates, or other illicit drugs to get to sleep. These drugs are illegal, habit-forming, and dangerous. Side effects can range from mild to deadly. There are no standards of quality control for these drugs.

, Because caffeine is one of the most popular substances in the world, it's one of the most common causes of sleep difficulties. Caffeine's stimulant effects can make it difficult to fall asleep when it's bedtime, even if you'd normally tired. For this reason, it's best to avoid any caffeine the day before you're trying to sleep all day. This includes coffee and tea, plus caffeinated gum and snacks.


If you have to have coffee the day before to get through something important, try not to have any after noon to ensure your body has plenty of time to process it before bed. It takes about six hours for the body to get rid of half of a dose of caffeine., Alcohol can make you drowsy in the short term, but it's a bad idea if you're aiming for healthy, restful sleep. Sleeping while drunk forces your body straight into deep sleep. As the alcohol wears off, you may drift back into ""light"" sleep, which is easy to wake up from. This is why it's common to wake up after a few hours when you sleep while drunk.If you do have to drink, try to leave your body about an hour per drink or shot to process the alcohol before you go to sleep.On top of this, alcohol is a diuretic (something that encourages urination), so it can force you to wake up to go to the bathroom. It can also leave you with a dry mouth and nausea the morning after, further preventing you from getting back to sleep.

, As mentioned above, sleeping all day is not something the body will be used to. Laying in bed for excessive lengths of time can cause aching and stiffness. If these symptoms don't go away with light stretching, abandon your mission. Sleeping all day isn't worth being miserable.


In addition, even a single day of bed rest can cause significant health problems, like blood clots, bed sores, and nausea. Though these are rare in young, healthy people, they can become a real risk in older individuals. For best results, break up your day of rest with a few periods of activity spent up and walking around.

, Spending the entire day in bed is never something you'll want to do on a regular basis. Even if you manage to avoid the physical symptoms above, a day in bed can seriously affect your mental state. Notably, too much time in bed can cause depression (or worsen it if you're already depressed. For your mental health, don't make sleeping all day something that you do with any regularity.


In addition to this, spending all day in bed means that you aren't spending it doing something else productive. Everyone has a limited amount of time on Earth — do you really want to spend much of yours doing nothing?

Plan your nap to minimize grogginess.,
Nap for 20 minutes at a time for a quick ""power nap"".,
Nap for 30-60 minutes to slip into slow-wave sleep.,
Nap for 60-90 minutes to reap the benefits of REM sleep.,
Try not to oversleep.",How to Recover from a Nap1," An average sleep cycle lasts from 90 to 110 minutes, in a flux from light sleep to deep sleep.Consider the stages:


Stage 1 is the first and shallowest stage of sleep – it lasts anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. Your eyes are closed, but it's easy to wake you up. You probably won't feel terribly refreshed if you nap for five minutes, but you shouldn't feel too groggy, either.
Stage 2 is a slightly deeper stage of shallow sleep. Your heart rate slows, your body temperature drops, and you begin to sleep into deep sleep. This may last
Stage 3 is the ""deep sleep"" stage. If you're awoken during deep sleep, you will feel groggy and disoriented for a few minutes.;
, Set an alarm for about 25 minutes from now: 20 minutes to sleep, and 5 minutes to fall asleep. A short ""power nap"" ends before your brain sleeps into deep or slow-wave sleep; you will wake feeling rejuvenated, and you shouldn't feel groggy. If you nap for longer than 20 minutes, you may slip into a deeper sleep phase – and if so, you may find yourself groggier if you wake before the end of the full sleep cycle.The 20-minute power nap, sometimes called the stage 2 nap, is good for alertness and motor learning skills – things like typing and playing the piano.

, Research shows that longer naps help boost memory and enhance creativity. When you nap for 30-60 minutes, you slip into slow-wave sleep, which is the deep phase that comes between REM ""dream"" sleep. A 30-60 minute nap is good for decision-making skills – e.g. memorizing vocabulary or recalling directions. Be aware that you may wake up groggier, at first, if you are awoken during the deepest part of the sleep cycle.

, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is the final phase of the sleep cycle; it is when dreams happen, and it is when your brain restores itself. REM sleep plays a key role in making new connections in the brain and solving creative problems., The purpose of a nap is to rejuvenate your body, so it's important that you give yourself plenty of time. Set an alarm to make sure that you stick to your desired naptime. If you want to get very precise, add several minutes to your ""nap time"" to allow yourself plenty of time to fall asleep."

Splash water on your face to wake more quickly.,
Drink water to kick your metabolism into gear and get your electrolytes flowing.,
Drink caffeine to wake up more quickly.,
Eat a light snack.,
Stimulate your mind.,
Try listening to upbeat music.,
Open your window to get fresh air into the room.",How to Recover from a Nap2," Wipe your face with a clean washcloth, or cup water in your hands. Rub the corners of your eyes to open them up. You can use warm or cold water, although cold water may be more refreshing: cool water has been shown to lower heart-rates and help you wake more quickly.


Take a shower, if you have time. Make sure to run plenty of water into your face.
Not only will washing your face make you feel less tired – it will make you look less tired. Wash your face thoroughly to rub out any lingering sleep-wrinkles.

, When you fall into a deep nap, your metabolism slows into a low-maintenance sleep-state. Drinking water will signal to your body that it's time to wake up. Fill a tall glass and drink it, slowly.

, If you're feeling especially groggy, try ingesting a caffeinated beverage—coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc.—to stimulate your mind and clear away the heavy-headed haze.


Avoid drinking caffeine if you're planning to fall back asleep anytime soon. Coffee affects everyone differently, but there's a good chance that one dose will keep you awake for hours to come.
Be aware that many caffeinated drinks have a dehydrating, diuretic effect. Drink coffee, if necessary, but be sure to also drink water.

, Spur your metabolism and settle your stomach. If you feel nauseous when you wake, it may help to put a bit of food into your system. Eat something light, digestible, and energy-rich: fruit and nuts are ideal.

, Read a book, read the paper, or go online. Work a crossword puzzle, play a video game, or watch an upbeat television program – anything that gets your brain working. If your mind is active and engaged, you'll find it more difficult to slip back into sleep.

, Put on a party playlist or a workout playlist – anything that pumps you up and makes you want to get moving.

, This should make you feel more awake and less groggy.

Be patient.",How to Recover from a Nap3," Swig a mouthful of mouthwash, if you please, and gargle to refresh your throat. The ritual of washing out your morning breath may help swing your mind back into the bustle of the day, and you may feel more ready to resume your day once you've rid your mouth of its ""fuzzy"" feeling. If you don't have access to a toothbrush, chew some mint gum.

, Depending on where you napped, you may feel stiff and sore. Try stretching our all your muscles to loosen up and relax. Go for a run, if you have time, to get your heart pumping and put your brain into action mode.


Try dynamic stretches like lunges and high-knees. Try jumping jacks and squats. The faster you move, the more quickly your blood will get flowing.

, Fix your hair, get dressed (or smooth out your clothing), and reapply your makeup if necessary. If you are going back to work or venturing back out into the world, you may need to put a few minutes into restoring your appearance.

, Don't go back to sit wherever you were napping. There's a good chance that you will fall back asleep.

, Listen carefully to pick up the thread of the lecture, and try to get back into the flow of the discussion. Try to remember what you were doing before you fell asleep. Don't jerk your head up suddenly, unless you love attention – instead, slowly lift your head up and blink a lot so your eyes can get used to the light.

, You should feel awake and fully alert within about 30 minutes. Drink water and caffeine, eat an energy-laden snack, and try to stay active – you will gradually recover from the nap the longer you're awake.

Leave yourself enough time.,
Start slowly.,
Be consistent.,
Take naps sparingly.,
Use melatonin supplements.,
Reset your internal food clock.,
Try herbs.",How to Reset Sleep Cycle1," Your sleep cycle should include the right amount of sleep each night. This usually changes if your sleep cycle gets off. If you are a teenager, you need about nine to 10 hours of sleep a night. If you are an adult, you should get seven to nine hours a night.If you don't have this much time a night, you should think about changing your priorities to where you can get the recommended amount of sleep each night. If you don't your productivity and overall health will suffer.This might mean fewer commitments — you may have to say no to late night dinners with your friends, or moving your schedule around, like switching your super early workout at the gym to after work. You may also want to talk to your partner if you are overloaded with obligations at home — splitting up the work can lessen your load so you both get to sleep on time.;
, If you are trying to reset your sleep schedule to a different time, you need to start small and slowly. Starting from your current bedtime and wake up time, shift the time by 15 minutes. This will allow you to change it slowly, which will make it easier to do over time.


For example, if you used to go to bed at 11:30 pm and get up at 7:30 am but now have to get up at 6:30 am because of a new job, start going to bed at 11:15 pm and getting up at 7:15 am. After a night or two of this new schedule, shift it another 15 minutes, repeating until you reach your new sleep times.
If you need to shift your schedule quicker than this or change it by a large amount, you can shift your sleep time by 30 minutes., One of the most important factors in resetting your sleep schedule back to what it once was is to be consistent with your bedtime and wake up time. If you are consistent, your body is more likely to pick your typical sleep cycle back up.


During the week or so it will take to reset your sleep cycle, try not to sleep in, even on the weekends. The more consistent you are with your schedule during this time, the faster your sleep cycle will reset. If you want to sleep in during your reset, only allow yourself an extra hour of sleep one night per week. After your sleep cycle is reset, you can sleep in about two hours during the weekend.

, While you are trying to reset your sleep schedule, try to avoid taking naps. This will confuse your sleep cycle and make it harder to return to the schedule you had before it was disrupted.


If you are too tired, or if you work in a job where you need to be extremely alert, you can take naps; however, do so sparingly so your sleep cycle won't keep getting disrupted and it will take longer to reset it., If you are having a hard time adjusting to your new sleep cycle, you may be able to use melatonin supplements to help reset your sleep cycle. The dosage you need may vary, depending on how much you naturally produce. Adults should start with two tenths of a milligram and increase as needed, up to 5 milligrams. Children should start with an even smaller dose — consult your doctor first.Only use melatonin while you are trying to reset your sleep cycle. It should not be used except for a short period of time.
Do not use if you are pregnant or nursing.If you don't want to take a supplement, try a glass of cherry juice about two hours before bed. Studies have shown that cherry juice can increase melatonin levels.Also try taking a hot bath or hot shower. There have been some studies that suggest your melatonin levels may be increased after a hot bath. This activity can also help you relax as well., A recent study was done that suggests that you can reset your sleep cycle overnight by shifting the time that you eat. Your body naturally thinks it is time to be awake when you eat first thing in the morning. In order to fool your body into changing this cycle, avoid eating for 12 to 16 hours before you want to get up.


For example, if you need to get up at 6 am, avoid eating after 2 pm (16 hours) to 6 pm (12 hours) the day before. Once you wake up the next morning, eat a big, healthy breakfast to kick start your system into being awake.If you have any medical problems, ask your doctor before going this long without food.

, There are many different herbs that can help you sleep better. These may be helpful if you find it hard to adjust to your new sleep cycle. Herbs such as chamomile, lemon balm, and valerian root can be taken in supplements or as a tea to help you get to sleep, which in turn will help your reset your sleep cycle.


Always talk to your doctor before using herbal remedies."

Improve your sleep hygiene.,
Choose relaxing activities.,
Keep your bedroom dark and cool at night.,
Fool your body.",How to Reset Sleep Cycle2," If none of these methods are working for you, you may need to improve your sleep hygiene in order to reset your sleep cycle. This means you should make the activities surrounding sleep and your bedtime and wake-up time consistent and relaxing.


Try only doing bed-related activities in your bed. This means you should avoid working or watching TV in your bed.
Make your room, bed, and bed clothes comfortable every night.
Avoid exercise too close to bed and never drink caffeine or alcohol within a few hours of sleeping., If you are having a hard time adjusting back to your old bedtime because you aren't tired, try relaxing activities before bed. This can include listening to relaxing music, watching a calm movie, or doing some gentle stretches.


The more relaxed you are, the more likely you will be able to go to sleep at your old bedtime., When you are trying to change your sleep schedule, it can be hard to make yourself sleepy earlier. To help, make your bedroom and the room you spend the few hours before bed in darker as your bedtime approaches. This will help increase the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, which is produced when you are in the dark.In addition, turn the thermostat down to around 67–68°F (19.4–20°C).


You can do this by using light blocking curtains if it stays light later in your area or if there are street lights outside your window. This is also helpful if you need to sleep past when it gets light outside.
If you have a dimmer switch on your lights, try making the room progressively darker as you approach your bedtime.
If you are really having a hard time, try wearing sunglasses so your eyes adjust to the darkness and to get you used to switching to sleeping mode.

, If your new sleep cycle requires you to get up before it is light outside, the transition may be harder to make. If you are having a hard time waking up, turn on as many lights as you can in your room and house. This will decrease the production of melatonin, which will help wake you up. "

Adjust your sleeping habits based on stress.",How to Recover from Lost Sleep," ""Sleep debt"" is the term medical professionals use to describe a deficit in the amount of sleep you have gotten versus the amount of sleep you should get. While the exact amount of sleep you need varies from person to person, each hour lost per night can have effects that last for days, weeks, or longer.It may be possible to recover from short-term sleep debt and regain normal function by sleeping longer in the days following the lost sleep, but there is no scientific evidence to back up the idea that you can ""make up"" for lost sleep by sleeping more.If, for instance, you lost 10 hours of sleep during one week, you could recover from your sleep debt by sleeping an additional three to four hours during the weekend. Then, during the next week, you would need to sleep an additional hour each day until the debt is ""repaid."" So, if you slept an extra four hours during the weekend, you would need to add an hour of sleep to your normal seven to nine hours of sleep for the next six days in order to recuperate.Even if you make up your deficit with extra sleep, this will not immediately bring you back to normal. Your neural and metabolic systems will take much longer to recover. Instead of telling yourself that you can make up for a sleepless night or getting too few hours of sleep every night by sleeping in on the weekend, focus on creating a sleep routine that ensures you get adequate sleep every night.;
, Long-term sleep debt — or insomnia — is created when you don't get enough sleep on a regular basis for a prolonged period of time. If you stay up late every night, or are simply getting a limited amount of sleep (due to a baby, multiple jobs, studying for school, etc.) for a time that exceeds a week or two, it may take a significant amount of time and rest to compensate.If the sleep lost is chronic (greater than one month), it should be addressed by medical professional to identify the cause of insomnia. This may be primary insomnia (caused pain or a disease or condition) or secondary to behavior which causes insomnia (stimulant use before bed, exercise before bed or activating activities, etc.).
Adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you need eight hours of sleep but you are only sleeping five hours every weeknight, you will have racked up 15 hours of sleep debt by the weekend. If this continues every week, you will have 60 hours of sleep debt by the end of the month.
Long-term sleep debt requires a considerable amount of time to ""repay"" — it will take far more than a few extra hours on the weekend to bring your body back to normal. While sleeping in on the weekend may help you feel more rested on Monday, you will still suffer the neurological and metabolic consequences of lack of sleep — reduced ability to focus, for instance.Sleeping late or napping on the weekends may interfere with your circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to fall asleep at bedtime, thus being counterproductive in fixing the sleeping issue.Again, instead of thinking about how you can make up for that lost sleep later, think about how to ensure you get enough sleep every night. Setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it, as well as practicing good sleep hygiene, will help you reach a normal state of alertness and functioning., To figure this out, you can perform a sleep test. Take a few vacation days and clear your schedule as much as possible (at the very least, try to schedule things for the afternoon).Go to bed at a reasonable time, or around the time you would like to sleep every night, and turn off your alarm clock.
Allow yourself to sleep until you wake up naturally, feeling rested. The first few nights you may sleep for a very long time thanks to your sleep debt.
Go to bed every night at the same time with no alarm. After a few days, you should start to wake up naturally at the same time every morning. This will give you an idea of how much sleep you need each night.

, The best way to bounce back from lost sleep and prevent it from happening again in the future is to establish a sleep schedule and stick to it. There are a number of ways you can go about establishing a healthy sleep schedule:Once you know how much sleep you need each night, you can work on arranging your life to accommodate that number. This might mean you have to go to bed earlier than you used to (maybe at 10pm instead of 12:30am), or you have to move your 6am workout to a later time.
Stick to the same schedule as much as possible.
Ease into your sleep schedule. Try going to bed 15 minutes earlier each night until you reach your new bedtime, rather than making big changes.

, By sticking to a pre-bedtime ritual, you can train your body to identify signals that it's time to go to sleep. Your bedtime ritual should be relaxing.It may include taking a warm bath or a shower, setting out your clothes for the next day, writing in a journal, reading (but skip crime novels or thrillers or anything that will make you alert), doing evening yoga, or meditating.


Avoid confrontation or emotionally upsetting conversations at bedtime. If you're upset about something, write it down and tell yourself you will deal with it in the morning. Using positive coping strategies can help avoid negative coping strategies and equate better health in long run — both mentally and physically.

, A large part of sleep hygiene involves creating the right environment for sleep. Make sure you eliminate all sources of light (with black-out curtains or a sleep mask) when sleeping and avoid using electronic devices before bed. The blue light from these devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, and TV) can suppress melatonin, which is a hormone that makes you sleepy. Dim your lights around bedtime as well, as bright lights can affect melatonin production.Keep your room cool when sleeping. Experts recommend keeping the thermostat set between 60 to 67°F (15.6 to 19.4°C).Block out external noises. Use earplugs or a sound machine to block out any sounds that might keep you awake. A fan can be a good source of white noise and keep you cool at the same time.
Use your bed only for sleeping and sex. Working in your bed or even watching TV in bed can confuse your body. Train it to recognize that when your body hits the mattress, it's time to go to sleep.

, Taking a nap seems like a great way to make up for lost sleep, and it can be in the right circumstances, but you should limit the practice of taking naps during the day in order to ensure you get a full, restful night’s sleep each night.Take advantage of napping to help repay short term sleep debt, but limit it to just an hour or two to prevent missing more sleep that night.
If you find yourself napping regularly, this is a good indication that you are likely not getting enough sleep at night. Consider adjusting your schedule to give yourself more time to sleep, either by going to sleep earlier or waking up later (or sometimes both).

, Getting exercise can help you to fall asleep easier and stay asleep through the night. If you find that you have trouble sleeping at night and that is causing your lost sleep, adding or increasing exercise in your daily habits can help combat the problem.Avoid exercising too close to your bedtime as it may make it difficult to fall asleep. Exercise increases blood flow and releases endorphins into the system, which can increase energy. This can be great to give you energy to power through your day, but can become problematic when you're still feeling the energy-boosting effects and you're trying to relax and fall asleep.
Some kinds of slow paced exercises like yoga or stretching are okay near bed time and may help you to relax.

, Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol can all negatively affect your sleep. Caffeine and nicotine can make it difficult for you to fall asleep. Alcohol may initially help you drop off, but will cause you to be restless and may wake you up later in the night as your body begins to metabolize it.In addition, avoid eating too close to bedtime, as this can disrupt your sleep as well., There are a number of variables that can affect how much sleep you need each night and what is right for another person your age may not be right for you. That said, there are some general guidelines you can follow to establish a sleep pattern, then adjust it to suit your needs.People under thirteen years of age should get between ten and thirteen hours of sleep per night.
Teenagers through seventeen years old should get eight to ten hours of sleep each night.
Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep to maintain their health and feel alert during the day.

, Sleep debt can lead to a number of complications in your life. The most prominent and easiest to identify is experiencing sleepiness during your normal daily activities. If you find yourself sleepy during the day, consider why that may be.Are you staying up too late? Does your pet sleep in bed with you and wake you by moving around in the night? Trying to sleep but finding it difficult to fall asleep? Waking up early in morning and unable to fall back asleep?


Even if you think you get enough sleep, experiencing daytime sleepiness can be an indicator that you should allow yourself to get more, or could it be indicator that there is medical condition that is decreasing oxygenation while you sleep (sleep apnea), periodic limb movement disorder, or restless leg syndrome, or some combination of these things.
Daytime sleepiness may not be caused simply by not sleeping enough the night before, it could also be indicative of an outstanding sleep debt caused by missing too much sleep on previous nights.

, If you find yourself confused or unable to focus on things during the day, it is likely that you have not been getting enough rest. Even if you feel alert and awake, confusion and difficulty paying attention to things is a sign that you need to allow yourself to recover lost sleep.If it is difficult to pay attention or understand things on a regular basis, you are likely not allowing yourself to get enough sleep.
Consider changing your sleeping habits to increase your attentiveness and ability to comprehend things you are working on throughout the day.
If fixing your sleeping schedule does not resolve these issues, see your doctor for an evaluation. These can be symptoms of other underlying medical disorder as well.

, Another common sign that you are operating with lost sleep is a higher than normal level of stress, or an inability to cope with the type of stress you experience often.Lost sleep can inhibit your ability to cope with stressors in your life and make things feel worse than they are.
Operating at a sleep deficit can make you feel stressed even in the absence of significant stressors.
If increased stress is causing sleepless nights, consider talking to mental health professional to help you identify signs/symptoms of anxiety, depression, or another possible disorder. A mental health professional can help you learn better ways to cope with stress.

Sleep before you plan to learn.,
Sleep after you learn.,
If you want to remember declarative memory, such as facts or vocabulary, you must sleep after you memorize.,
If you want to learn to associate and integrate information, sleep is crucial the night after you learned this information.

,
Get enough sleep regularly.,
If you get behind on sleep you will have lowered immune function and will likely end up sick.,
Sleep is not like a bank account you accumulate debt in, and can then “pay back”.,
Lack of sleep can lead to emotional instability and excessive focus on the negative.",How to Sleep for Better Grades," This is important for all types of learning.;
, Sleep for several days after you learn to reap the most rewards from your learning. This is especially important for procedural learning, such as learning to play the guitar or learning how to type, or any other memory where you learn “how to” do something.

, Pulling an “all nighter” to memorize flashcards will not be nearly as effective as sleeping after learning, as this allows your brain to retain the information you have just learned, and will allow you to remember it for the final. It could also lead to association and integration

,, This means ~8hrs per night for adults and ~9 or 10hrs for teens and young adults. This amount can vary from person to person. You know you have been consistently getting enough sleep when you can wake without an alarm, and do not need to sleep later on weekends to “catch up” on sleep.

, Your body will also have lowered response to vaccinations such as flu shots. This means your body will build up less immunity to the substance you were vaccinated against, and you will NOT be protected as well from substances like the flu. You must consistently get sleep after your vaccinations as well as before for the strongest protection. If you end up sick it is harder to study.

, Your body will not let you use sleep time as a “credit card” to get time to accomplish other things. You must sleep to function properly, and at your best. Being at less than your best will not lead to the best grades.

Once you acquire the necessary aptitude for relaxing, the next step is to organize a proper time to practice your technique.,
Slowly begin to wind down, releasing all negative thoughts and worries.,
Watch for any signs of bright colours or patterns emerging in front of your eyes.,
Try sipping on green tea.",How to Reach the Hypnagogic State of Sleep," The most effective method is to set your alarm to the early morning hours, staying up for at least thirty minutes to allow yourself to regain awareness. Engage in some sort of stimulating activity while building up your intention to observe the unconscious mind. If possible, generate a mantra that you will actively repeat to remind yourself of the important task at hand. Some people like to take caffeine before their attempt to improve their success rate even more, but this is not completely necessary. Another ideal time is during an afternoon nap, when the human brain is at its highest level of alertness with an increase in beta waves.;
, After reaching a state of reasonable serenity, there may be an increase in strange or intrusive thoughts that may distract you from your intention. The only way to prevent these abstract thoughts is by focusing on something to stay alert, thus bringing your consciousness into the sleep state. There are numerous ways to do this, but the most simple technique is to focus on your breath moving into and out of your body. While doing this, repeat your mantra in co-ordination to the breaths. In other words mentally recite 'One, I will stay alert. Two, I will stay alert' and continue to count your breaths while attentively focusing on your intention. Some people prefer to use visualization to induce the mysterious state faster, which involves engaging all of your senses in the scene. For instance, some people imagine climbing up stairs or driving a car, while really trying to experience it as if it's actually happening. This will also keep you aware and bring you closer to conscious sleep. Another way to reach the hypnagogic state is to distract your mind by thinking about things until you are about to fall asleep

, Do not try to control these shapes, just observe quietly and keep your mind on your intention to stay aware. Keep in mind that the imagery is hypnotic and can rapidly cause you to lose awareness. Watch it indirectly to prevent this from happening. Eventually, as the state deepens you will begin to hear voices or see scenes. Hypnagogia can include all of your five senses, even your sense of taste and smell. Sometimes, music or poetry will be heard, but the context in this state often uses various forms of wordplay. Scenes will often blend into each other or simply float around, and can be either extremely lifelike or rather vague. Just enjoy the ride, and when you wake up, immediately record any prior experiences. This will help you develop new creative insight or ideas.

Harness the power of scent.,
Outfit yourself properly.",How to Sleep for Better Health1," Try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. You may also want to change your regular bedtime to ensure that you are getting enough sleep.


For example, if you usually don’t go to bed until 11:30pm and you wake up at 6:00am, then you may want to consider pushing back your bedtime to 10:30pm to get more sleep.;
, If you try to go to sleep at a set time and your body resists, don’t give in completely. Stay up (still lying in bed) for an extra 15 minutes and then attempt to fall asleep again. Resist the urge to get angry or frustrated as this will only increase stress and keep you up longer.


Use the extra minutes to think of 15 dreams that you would like to have., There are some things that might be interfering with your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep at night. Consider what you can change to improve your sleep, such as by avoiding:Drinking alcohol at night.
Using stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine in the afternoon and evening.
Eating heavy meals before bed.
Exercising within four hours of your bedtime.
Napping during the day.

, Avoid dwelling on the day’s duties, stress, tension, and negative emotions. Mentally visualize putting all of your concerns in a box and placing that box on a shelf to take down tomorrow.


Your mind continues to work on developing skills during sleep via a process called “consolidation.”, An hour before bedtime, turn off the TV and put your phone away. Instead of watching the news, read something light-in-content. A good novel or comic is a great way to escape reality and segue into dreams., The mind and body are two pieces of a whole. If your mind is relaxed, you need to get your body to that state as well. About 30 to 45 minutes before bed, avoid all strenuous physical activities, essentially anything that breaks a sweat.


Try doing a relaxing yoga routine. Yoga-inspired stretches can help you to improve overall circulation and fall into a deep sleep. Start by taking calming, deep breaths, in through the nose and out the mouth. Then, sit cross-legged on the ground for a seated cross-bend, for example. Or, simply bend over and slowly touch your toes., Light a few candles prior to bed (just remember to snuff them out), use incense, or massage your hands with essential oils. Lavender and vanilla are particularly relaxing scents.

, As you choose your nightclothes, take into account personal preferences, but also factors such as temperature and skin irritants. For example, if polyester feels itchy, you might be better served by choosing cotton fabric. Flannel is a popular fabric for sleep clothes as well, but many find it to be too hot in the summer.


Investigate the benefits of sleeping naked. Wearing no clothes lowers your body temperature leading to deeper, more restful sleep. It could also help build body confidence."

Also, make sure that you go to bed only when you are sleepy.

, Install dimmable lights or use a bedside lamp. Try to avoid going immediately from full light to full dark, ease your body into a state of sleep.


Make sure that your room is dark and that there are no lights coming into the room that might disturb your sleep. You might consider getting some light blocking curtains if your room tends to get really bright before you have to wake up or if street light shine in. Or, you could wear a sleep mask.
If you need a little light to feel comfortable, consider a nightlight, some flameless candles, or even a lit up alarm clock.

, Start out by picking one temperature and then gauging how your body reacts overnight. The ideal thermostat setting is around 65 degrees for deep sleep. Avoid extreme hot or cold temperatures in your bedroom.


The most important thing is to keep your head cool throughout the night without chilling the rest of your body. This often means that you will want to experiment with clothing and linen layering., Allergens are a serious problem for many people and complications (sneezing, wheezing) often appear at night. Eliminate dust in your bedroom regularly to keep it from going airborne. A good air purifier can help with this as well.


In winter, humidifiers can assist people with breathing problems by adding moisture to the air., Stock it with all of the items that you will need throughout the night. Place medications, tissues, lotion, any electronic devices/alarms within arm’s reach., If you wake easily, consider purchasing ear plugs or muffs intended for sleep. Sound machines are also a good investment. They can mimic soothing waves, rain, or even jungle sounds!


You can also try playing some white noise, such as rain or ocean sounds on your phone. Just make sure that the light from your phone is blocked out.

, One might use a (Goldilocks) firm mattress, not too hard and not too soft. One might consider a thick cotton Futon style mattress without springs, on some stiff surface like a bed-spring, plywood or some stand that may come with it.


Mattresses impact blood flow and, therefore, those that relieve pressure points are the best for overall health., There are pillows for your head and for your body, and those made with foam, feathers, and even water. The pillow that you choose will often depend on your preferred sleeping position. For example, back-sleepers often place an extra pillow under their stomach.


Pregnancy pillows, in particular, are often used by women to cradle their abdomen and relieve hip pain.

Consider medical options.",How to Sleep for Better Health3," Breaking a sweat creates extra stores of energy, but it also has the potential to stimulate deeper sleep. Individuals suffering from sleep disorders, in particular, stand to see benefits from long-term workout patterns.


The key is consistency. Commit yourself to three 30-minute work-out sessions a week and build up from there.Insomnia increases with age. Counteract this by participating in aerobic activity. Join a cycling class at the local gym or begin a DVD kickboxing routine in the privacy of your own home.Healthy sleep also promotes workout recovery via accelerated protein synthesis and muscle growth., Your choices here are: side, back, and stomach. Side-sleeping is the most common with 41% of people preferring some version of the fetus position (side lying with knees slightly bent). Sleeping this way especially benefits anyone suffering from hip issues, including pregnant women.Is it better to sleep on the left or right? You may experience more episodes of reflux with right-side sleeping.Sleeping on your back is better with a pillow placed under your knees for lumbar support.
Physicians are the most concerned about stomach sleepers as this position places pressure strain on the lower back and neck., Write down everything that you eat or drink, along with the time, and how it affected your sleep. Then, you can look back to see any food-related patterns. For example, do you sleep better after drinking a glass of milk in the evening?


You may also find that the more you sleep, the less you eat. A sleep-deprived body produces less of the hormone leptin, which tells your body to stop eating, thus leading to overeating and possible obesity., Altering your diet in a positive way can lead to significant improvements in your waistline via the process of deeper sleep and hormonal balance.


Avoid alcohol and caffeine. These are the biggest offenders.
Examine the timing of meals. Be consistent with your meals both in substance and scheduling. Don’t skip meals early in the day or you could create a hormonal imbalance later, contributing to poor sleep.The digestion of food affects the body as it enters the bloodstream. Ideally, you want to finish your evening meal two to three hours before going to sleep. This allows your body enough time to process the food.

, Drinking water is your safest bet to ensure a good night’s sleep. Caffeine and sugar act as stimulants and should be consumed in limited quantities.

, Try various kinds of herbal teas and drinks such as milk and honey, usually warmed.


Chamomile tea is a favorite herbal beverage. It is best to drink a cup one to two hours before bedtime., Various pharmaceuticals are available to improve sleep quality. However, be sure to understand any possible side effects. It is advisable to consult with your doctor when considering the use of medical sleep aids."

Don’t smirk.,
Act disoriented and confused if someone tries to wake you up.,
React slightly to loud noises.",How to Pretend to Be Asleep," Why do you think people look so peaceful while they’re sleeping? When you’re asleep, your breathing slows down slightly. You can practice a breathing exercise to relax and slow down your breath. Try breathing in through the nose for a count of four, and then out through the nose for a count of four.When you are sleeping, your heart rate also slows. Although you can’t intentionally slow your heart rate like you can your breathing, relaxing will help to naturally slow your heart rate.;
, When we’re awake, our breathing patterns are irregular because of a variety of factors, including speech, exercise, and emotions. When sleeping, our breathing patterns become more regular. , Though your breathing naturally slows down when you are in non-REM sleep, your breathing pattern varies and increases again when you are in the middle of your REM cycle. Only do this if you are pretending to sleep for a couple of hours. At which point, you might actually have fallen asleep and will not have to worry about this.

, Most people move around during the night to find a more comfortable position. Try moving from your back to your side.


If you know you have a position that you usually favor when you’re sleeping, stick with that. You want your pretend sleeping to emulate your real sleeping.

, Don’t do a big, growly snore, or you’ll give yourself away, but some soft snoring can’t hurt.


If you know you never snore, don’t start now. A person observing you will be able to pick up on the fact that something is different.

, If you’ve been known to occasionally talk in your sleep, why not really hit the ball out of the park and mumble a couple of words?


People who sleep talk are not aware that they’re talking, and often will say things that don’t make sense.You can have fun being creative with your sleep talking! Say something absurd, like, “I forgot to take the potatoes down to the river!”

, It is a dead giveaway if you refuse to ""wake up"" no matter how many times someone calls your name or shakes you. People who are really sleeping wake up from disturbances.

, If you start smiling when someone is trying to wake you up, you will give yourself away. Instead, groggily moan and act irritated that you were woken up.

, It takes a little while for people to regain their clarity when they are woken up suddenly.


Have you ever woken someone up by calling them? Think of how you could tell they were sleeping. They probably seemed disoriented and their voice may have been muffled. , If someone else is in the room with you and there is a loud noise, like thunder or an ambulance, move a little bit so the other person can tell your sleep was disturbed.


You don’t have to jump out of bed wide awake. We sleep through loud noises all the time, and we may never remember them, but often our sleep is slightly disturbed.

Practice positive visualization.",How to Prevent Sleep Paralysis1," Designate your bed as a place only for sleep and sexual activity. Don't watch TV or read in bed. Your bed should be firm enough to give you support, but still be comfortable. Consider placing a few drops of lavender essential oil on or near your pillow to create a calm, relaxing environment.While specific sleep disorders are treated differently, good sleep hygiene can improve anyone's sleep (even people without a sleep disorder).
Reduce the light in your room with blackout curtains, removing sources of ambient light and possibly wearing a sleep mask.
Keep your room at a comfortable temperature. It is recommended you keep your room at about 65°F (18.3°C) when sleeping.Use a fan, earplugs, or a sound machine to neutralize any disruptive sounds that might wake you up.
Keep the use of electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and TV, to a minimum in the evening. These devices emit something called blue light, which can make it difficult for you to fall asleep.;
, Start winding down before you go to bed. Avoid eating within two hours of going to bed and don't drink coffee (especially after noon), caffeinated drinks, or alcohol. These can keep you awake or cause discomfort that prevents you from sleeping. You should also avoid strenuous exercise at night. If you're taking any medications, talk with your doctor to determine if any are causing sleep issues.Always tell your physician if you're using herbs and supplements. These can interact with prescription medicines.
Instead of strenuous evening exercise, go for walks, do weight training, or simply stretch. Save the strenuous activity for the morning or afternoon.
Try not to go to bed when you're stressed out. Try writing out your thoughts in a journal and tell yourself you'll deal with the issue in the morning.

, Create a simple sleep routine that you can follow. Be sure to include something relaxing, like taking a hot shower a few hours before you go to bed. While research is needed, many people believe this can increase melatonin secretion, making sleep come easier.You may also want to listen to calming music or use white noise to help you sleep, especially if you live in a noisy area.


Your sleep bedtime routine can be anything you prefer. Consider reading, brushing your teeth, preparing your bedsheets, changing into pajamas, meditation, dimming the lights, or doing a relaxation technique. A routine will eventually signal to your body to get ready for sleep.

, Help your body develop consistent sleep habits by going to bed and waking at the same time every day. While this may be hard if you have a flexible work schedule, your body will begin to expect sleep at consistent intervals.You can be a little flexible, but try not to deviate from your bedtimes and wake times by more than 30 minutes. For example, you may allow yourself to sleep in half an hour on the weekend.
You should also try to wake up at the same time every day.

, To prepare for a good night's sleep, gradually relax the muscles in your entire body. Start at your toes and tense the muscles of your toes for five seconds, then relax the toes for about 30 seconds. Then, move to your ankles and legs. Tense the muscles for five seconds and then relax them for 30 seconds. Move your way up toward your neck and finally your face.


Research has shown that relaxation techniques can reduce the frequency of sleep paralysis.You might also relax by doing Tai Chi, Qigong, or yoga.

, As you lay in bed, try to focus on positive things or experiences. For example, ask yourself if you can remember your favorite place (real or imagined) or your favorite memory. Then, visualize that place or memory being as detailed as possible. Try to remember the smells, sounds, and touches. Breathe deeply as you visualize to help you relax. Positive visualization can remove negative thoughts, preparing you for a restful night's sleep.


For example, if your memory or visualization is at the beach, you may want to play sounds of the ocean and hold a handful of sand. After some practice, you won’t need the extra sounds or that sand, but to begin with, these “props” can be helpful.

Keep your mind active.,
Go to bed with the right mindset.,
Have a strong bedtime routine.",How to Not Be Tired," Waking up on the right side of the bed really is the key to having a great day and feeling alert and refreshed. As you hone your morning routine, you need to find what works best for you and execute your wake-up plan every time so you wake up feeling balanced instead of scattered and rushed. Here's what you should do to start off your morning the right way:


Don't hit snooze. Hit the alarm and get ready to start your day. Hitting snooze will just waste your time and will plunge you into a drowsy half-sleep for a few extra minutes.
Take a deep breath and fill your lungs with air.
Get up and smile! Don't waste time playing around with your phone or yawning and tossing and turning. The sooner you get started, the better you'll feel.
If you're still feeling sleepy, take a step outside or on your balcony to breathe in some crisp morning air. And smile
Always give yourself enough time to get ready. Though you may think you'll feel more well-rested if you let yourself sleep for ten extra minutes, this will actually have a negative effect if it means that you give yourself ten less minutes to get ready. Though sleep is precious, it's equally important to walk out of the house feeling relaxed and refreshed instead of like you're sleepwalking.;
, Next, go to the bathroom and start getting your face and body ready for the day. Brushing your teeth and hair will make you feel like you're getting ready for your day, and the bright lights in the room will slowly make you more alert. Here's what you should do:


Splash some cold water on your face.
Try a morning shower. Though some people like to shower at night, taking a cool shower in the morning is a great way to wake up. Just don't take a warm or hot shower, or you'll be ready for bedtime.
Consider having a radio in the bathroom to play your favorite pump-up music to get yourself up, or just sing to yourself.

, A healthy breakfast is the key to a healthy and alert day. The wrong breakfast -- or even worse, no breakfast at all -- can make you feel sluggish and fatigued for the rest of your waking hours. It's important to make time to eat a healthy and filling meal no matter how busy you are. Here are some foods to try:


Fruit, yogurt, and granola.
Greens like spinach, kale, or celery. Try mixing them up into a smoothie.
Eggs and a lean ham or turkey. They will give you protein, which is required within your body for the growth and repair of tissues and damaged cells; this will give you a clear thought process throughout the day.
Oatmeal, whole grain bread, or healthy cereal. Avoid sugary cereals because they will give you a spike of energy that will make you crash later.
Avoid foods that are soaked in grease, butter, or maple syrup. These foods can be great for the weekend or special occasions, when you're trying indulge and relax a little more and aren't so focused on being alert.

, If your senses aren't stimulated, then your mind won't be stimulated and you'll be headed toward nap mode. If you want to stay alert, you have to work to make sure that your eyes, ears, and even your nose is stimulated throughout the day. There are some things you can do to achieve this, whether you're home, at work, or at school. Here are a few:


Keep your mouth engaged by sucking on a mint or chewing gum. This is a great trick especially if you're feeling tired during your morning or evening commute.
Let there be light. Turn on as many lights as you can if you're in a position to control the lights. Or better yet, try to position yourself near a window that gives you a great source of light. Sitting directly in the sun can make you tired, but being near sunlight can wake up your senses.
Wake up your sense of smell by sniffing peppermint oil. You can carry a tiny bottle of it with you.
Keep your eyes active by taking breaks to shift your gaze when they get tired from looking at the same thing.
Listen to music. Jazz, hip-hop, or light rock can wake you up. If you can, talk radio can also make your senses more alert because you'll have to engage with the material more actively.

, Keeping your body stimulated is just as important as stimulating your senses. If your body is more active, your mind will be too, so you should try to keep your body engaged no matter where you are -- even if you're stuck at a desk all day, you can do a few things to stay more engaged. Try a few of these tricks:


Gently pull down on your earlobes.
Pinch yourself in sensitive places. Pinch yourself in parts of your body that don't have much fat, such as your forearms or the place under your knees.
Stretch your wrists by pulling your fingers back away from you.
Roll your shoulders and your neck.
If you really feel like you're in danger of falling asleep, lightly bite down on your tongue.

, Though you may think that exercising will make you feel more tired, it actually will have the opposite effect if you do it in moderation. Exercising will improve your overall energy level and will make you feel invigorated. Exercising works best in the morning and afternoon because that's when you'll need an extra boost of energy; if you work out late in the evening, your adrenaline will spike and may make it harder for you to fall asleep. Here are some great ways to exercise:


Go for a jog around your neighborhood in the morning. Nothing will wake you up like filling your lungs with fresh air.
Take a morning yoga class. This is another great way to clear your mind, improve your breathing, and to get ready for the day.
Join a team sport, such as soccer, volleyball, or baseball. This will keep your mind and body more energized.
Try to take a 20-minute walk at least a few times a week whenever you can.

, Even if you don't have time for a full workout, you can make your body more alert by taking out the time to do some basic physical activity throughout your day.Just five or ten minutes of extra exercise from time to time is a great way to tell your body, ""Hey, it's not time for sleep!"" Here are some easy ways to do some light physical activity:


Walk whenever you can. If you're in school, try walking there instead of taking the bus if it's not too far away, or taking the longest route possible to get to class if it won't make you late. If you're at work, take short walks in the halls or go across the street to get coffee.
Avoid elevators whenever you can. Take the stairs to pick up your heart rate.
If you're at a desk all day, stand to do some basic stretches from time to time.

, A healthy breakfast is a great way to kick off your day, but you need to follow it up with a nutritious lunch and dinner as well.Eating healthy foods will give you more sustenance and energy, while the wrong foods can drag you down and make you feel ready for bed. Try these healthy eating tips to avoid being tired:


Don't forget to snack when you're feeling tired or a little bit hungry. Carry around an array of healthy snacks so you don't give in to thee vending machine. Some great snack foods are almonds, cashews, celery sticks, and peanut butter. Fruit is always a great snack and it's easy to bring with you wherever you go.
Eat three healthy and balanced meals throughout the day. Make room for some light snacking so you don't overindulge during mealtime.
Avoid heavy meals, starchy foods or foods that are high in fat, and alcohol. All of these foods will make you more tired and will tax your digestive system.
Try some caffeine. If you need it, caffeine is a great help for staying awake. Try a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, but don't overdo it because it can make you crash.
Stay hydrated throughout the day. Water will always rejuvenate you.

, If your mind is engaged, excited, or even being creative, it's guaranteed that you'll be less tired. To keep your mind focused, you should make sure you're always focusing on something interesting instead of daydreaming or drifting off. There are a number of ways that you can ensure that your mind is always engaged.


Switch tasks from time to time. You may get bored if you're doing the same thing for hours in a row, so take breaks to have a healthy snack, stand at the window, or send a quick text message to a friend.
If you're at work, strike up a conversation with a colleague in the break room. This will make you more alert, and you may even end up laughing and having a great time.
If you're in school, pay extra attention to what your teacher is saying. Ask and answer questions to be a part of the discussion, and take notes with pens in multiple colors so your note-taking feels less monotonous.

, To make sure that you won't be tired the next day, it's important for you to go to bed feeling positive and excited about starting the next day. If you're feeling grumpy or even angry it will be much harder for you to go to sleep. Here are a few things to do:


Don't ever go to bed mad. If you're angry because you had a fight with someone you love, however big or small, try to resolve it to the extent that you can before falling asleep.
Think of at least two things you're looking forward to the next day. If you go to bed feeling positive, you will be more excited about getting up.
Visualize your wake-up success. It may sound silly, but you should imagine yourself hitting your alarm as soon as it goes off, stretching, and jumping right out of bed. If you visually it enough times, it will become second nature to you in the morning.

, Having a good routine for getting ready for bed is just as important as having a good morning routine. Going to bed the right way is the key to not being tired. Once you find what works for you, you should try to do the same thing every time so your body gets used to your bedtime routine. Here's what to do:


Go to bed and wake up at the same time every night. Though this may sound difficult with your busy schedule, it's the easiest way to make sure you're not tired. Having a consistent routine of 7 hours of sleep a night is much better than sleeping 5 or 6 hours a night and then sleeping 10 hours the next night. This will make your body feel out of balance.
Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, or caffeine in the hours before you go to bed, or you will stay up longer. Cut off caffeine after noon if you really want to go to bed without any trouble.
Take some small steps that will make it easier for you to get up. Set up your coffee maker or put out your clothes for the next day.

Drink more water.,
Eat breakfast.,
Eat frequently.,
Exercise more often.,
Get some sun.,
Adjust your caffeine intake.,
Regulate your sleep cycle.",How to Not Feel Sleepy1," A classic fix-me-up for most ailments, drinking water regularly throughout your day will have you feeling peppy in no time. Often times those feelings of fatigue and lethargy are due to nothing more than basic dehydration. Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up in the morning to start up your metabolism, and continue drinking several glasses throughout the day.;
, Rolling groggily out of bed in the morning after hitting snooze for the fifth time means you’ll probably be on your way to starting your day with a meager breakfast, if any. Doing so will keep your metabolism in sloth-mode, making you slow to start most anything throughout the day. Force yourself to get up a bit earlier if necessary, and take the time to eat a complete breakfast. The nutrients will energize you throughout the day, making sacrificing your snooze button worth it.

, Similar to suffering from a bout of dehydration, exhaustion may be your body telling you that its hungry and needs energy in the form of food. Rather than complying with the socially dictated three large meals a day, try to eat 5-7 smaller meals throughout the day. This will keep your blood sugar levels from plummeting, and provide your body with more vitamins and nutrients that it needs to stay focused.

, Getting on your feet and moving around can seem even more difficult when mid-afternoon drowsiness has a solid hold on you, but adding physical activity to your routine will limit your exhaustion. Work out for at least ten minutes a day, even if all you do is take a brisk walk outdoors. Getting your blood circulating and a breath of fresh air will have you pumped and ready in no time., There’s a reason you’re more sluggish in the winter; exposure to sunlight increases your vitamin D levels, which give you a boost of energy. If you’re lucky enough to have good weather, head outside for a brief reprieve from your lethargic work indoors. Kill two birds with one stone, and do your exercising outdoors as well!

, You get hit with a wave of sleepiness, and your first instinct is to reach for yet another cup of coffee. But wait! Turns out, drinking more than 2-3 cups of coffee a day doesn't increase your energy any more, and doing so after 12 or 1 in the afternoon will worsen your night of sleep later in the day. Therefore, limit your caffeine intake to three cups or less a day, so that you get the boost of energy without the nasty jittery side effects. Try to do so before lunchtime, and you’ll be thanking yourself the next day as well.

, So last night you went to a great concert, staying up till wee hours in the morning, and then you slept in till noon. Then you had to head to bed early later the following night in preparation for a 7 am meeting for work. With such a fluctuating sleep schedule, its no wonder you’re tired! Try to go to bed at the same time every night, and wake up at the same time every morning. This will help your body to have clear boundaries for when sleep should occur, and reduce your sleepy feelings during the day."

Get on a regular sleep schedule.,
Break your sleep into two nightly segments.,
Decrease your nightly sleep.,
Add naps during the day.",How to Practice Segmented Sleep1," If you want to be able to practice segmented sleep, you need to be on a regular sleep schedule. Establish a set sleep/wake time that allows you to get adequate sleep. From there, you will break your sleep time into segments.Aim for around 7 and a half hours of sleep per night and set a schedule that allows you to achieve this. For example, you can go to bed every night at 12:30 a.m and then wake up at 8 a.m.
Stick very strictly to this schedule. Eventually, you will begin feeling tired around 12:30 and energetic around 8 a.m. As time goes by, you will not even rely on an alarm clock to wake up in the morning.
Keep on your sleep schedule as long as it takes. Some people will adjust quicker than others. Once you're easily falling asleep at night and waking up in the morning, you can begin breaking your sleep into chunks.;
, Start small. If you try to break up your sleep too fast, you will not be able to maintain a segmented schedule. To start, break up your sleep into two segments.Aim for about a 90 minute break in between sleep segments. Do not attempt to alter the amount of sleep you're getting.
For example, go to sleep at 12:30 AM and then wake up at 4:30 AM. Stay awake until 6 AM and then sleep from 6 AM to 9:30 AM.
It will take time to adjust. Expect to feel slightly groggy and off at first. You may not get back to sleep exactly at 6 AM, but if you're strict about attempting to sleep at 6 and always getting up at 9, your body will eventually adjust.

, Eventually, you will want to further segment your sleep. Decrease your nighttime sleep in small intervals. Try to go from 7 and a half hours of nighttime sleep to six hours of nighttime sleep.For example, go to bed at 12:30 AM and then wake up at 3:30 AM. Stay up until 5:30 AM. Go back to sleep and then wake up at 8:30 AM.

, You will need to make up for the sleep during the day. If you've cut back to six hours of sleep at night, try to get 90 minutes to 2 hours of sleep in during the day. For example, take a nap at noon for an hour each day. Then, take another hour long nap at 4 PM.At first, it may be difficult to nod off during the day. Your body is likely not used to sleeping when it's light out. However, if you're strict your schedule your body will adapt. You will begin to feel sleepy when nap time arises.

Try valerian as a tea or supplement.,
Use passionflower as a tea or supplement.,
Take chamomile as a supplement or tea.,
Use lemon balm as a tea or supplement.,
Take a melatonin supplement.,
Take 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) supplement.",How to Prevent Sleep Paralysis2," To use an herb as a tea, boil water. Add either 1 teaspoon of loose, dried herb, 1 tablespoon of fresh herb or a tea bag to a cup of boiled water and let it steep for five to ten minutes.


Strain if the tea if you used loose herbs and flavor it with honey or lemon if you like.

, Ask your pharmacist to recommend a reputable brand of supplements; the supplement industry is not regulated, meaning there is no guarantee you are getting the advertised product. Your pharmacist may know which companies are trustworthy. You should also look for verifiable contact information for the company and look for any seals of approval from the Natural Products Association (NPA), Consumer Labs or the US Pharmacopeia (USP). The manufacturer should follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when taking supplements. You should also inform your doctor of any supplements you're taking.
Buy only fresh supplements (check the expiration date).

, Valerian is a root that has the properties of a mild sedative, helping you fall asleep faster and more easily. Valerian has been used as a sleep aid for thousands of years, although it should not be given to children under 3 years old.You may want to add honey, cinnamon, cloves, or lemon to valerian tea to improve the flavor.
Valerian root may interact with prescription medications like antidepressants and antianxiety medications.

, Passionflower is used to reduce anxiety and can also lower blood pressure. If you take blood pressure medications, talk to your doctor before supplementing. Passionflower has a light, pleasant taste, but you can flavor it with honey and lemon if you're making a tea.Do not use passionflower if you're pregnant. It may induce uterine contractions.Since passionflower hasn't been studied in children, talk with a qualified healthcare professional to determine a safe dose to give your child.

, Chamomile has traditionally been used to help induce sleep, although clinical studies are needed to support this. Chamomile is used to increase calm while reducing anxiety. When purchasing chamomile, look for German (which is more widely available) or Roman.Chamomile is safe for children, but dilute the tea with warm water (use ½ cup of tea and add ½ cup of water).
Chamomile can interact with a number of prescription medications, so talk to a knowledgeable healthcare professional (your doctor or pharmacist) before using it.

, Lemon balm can also reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality, but should not be used by anyone with an overactive thyroid or anyone who is pregnant.Lemon balm has Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) status in the US and can be used with children older than 3 years old, but dilute the tea with warm water (use ½ cup of tea and add ½ cup of water).


Lemon balm may interact with certain medications for thyroidism, HIV, and sleep issues like anxiety or insomnia. Talk with your doctor before supplementing., Take 1 to 3 mg of melatonin one hour before bed. This ""sleep hormone"" can regulate your sleep cycles. Avoid taking melatonin every night, unless your doctor advises it. You can also try to increase the amount of melatonin in your system by drinking a glass of tart cherry juice.Melatonin may interact with prescription medications and should not be taken when pregnant or when nursing. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before use.

, This chemical is used by your body to make a neurotransmitter, serotonin. Serotonin is known to regulate mood and behavior, which may improve your sleep. Take 50 to 100 mg of 5-HTP every night before bed for six to 12 weeks, unless your doctor recommends otherwise.5-HTP is not recommended for pregnant or nursing women.

Recognize the primary symptoms.,
Look for potential symptoms.,
Consider your risk for sleep paralysis.,
Know when to see your doctor.",How to Prevent Sleep Paralysis4," If you have sleep paralysis, the area of your brain that detects threats becomes more active and overly sensitive to stimuli. The temporary paralysis is caused by this oversensitivity.To be diagnosed with sleep paralysis, you must be experiencing three of the following primary symptoms:Inability to move: This may feel as if some outside force is causing the paralysis.
Feeling fear, dread, or anxiety because of the paralysis
Being consciously awake during the paralysis
Clear perception of surroundings: You may notice the time, the moonlight coming in through the window, what your partner is wearing and so on.

, In addition to primary symptoms, you may experience these symptoms:A sense of overwhelming fear and dread
A sense of another presence
Pressure on the chest
Difficulty breathing
Laying on your back even if that is not your preferred position
Visual, olfactory (smell) or auditory (sound) hallucinations. These may be combined with the sense of another presence.
A feeling of impending doom or death

, Studies estimate that sleep paralysis affects 5 to 40% of the population, affecting men and women of any age group, although most sleep paralysis begins during the teenage years. Risk factors for sleep paralysis include:A family history of sleep paralysis
Changing sleep schedules
The existence of another sleep disorder like insomnia; narcolepsy; parasomnias such as sleepwalking or sleep talking, confusional arousals, bedwetting and sleep terrors; hypersomnias (excessive sleepiness)
A history of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar disorder. These mental disorders were also associated with some of the more disturbing hallucinations.
Sleep related leg cramps and Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)
Medications, including those used to treat anxiety and ADHD
Drug and alcohol abuse

, If you don't notice a reduction in the number of sleep paralysis events within two to four weeks of trying treatment methods or you're losing significant amounts of sleep, talk with your doctor. You may even want to schedule an appointment with a sleep specialist. Sleep paralysis can be a symptom of other underlying sleep conditions or of significant psychiatric problems, but only a physician can make that determination.


For example, sleep paralysis can actually be a symptom of narcolepsy, a condition with daytime drowsiness and sudden “attacks” of sleep.

Listen to some music.,
Try a breathing exercise.,
Eat Omega-3s.,
Try water therapy.,
Consume some fiber.,
Take a catnap.,
Take a magnesium supplement.,
Deal with stress.,
Change your environment.",How to Not Feel Sleepy2," Music has a huge affect on mood and mental state; in addition to the ability to change your emotional state, music can also increase your energy levels. One major study done showed that people who listen to music, regardless of the volume or tempo, were more energized than people who did not. So, grab your iPod or turn on your favorite radio station and crank up some tunes!, Our breathing patterns are altered by our emotional and mental state, even when we aren't aware of it. If you’re stressed and tired, it is likely you are taking “chest” breaths that don’t supply enough oxygen to the brain.


Try breathing in slowly, imagining that you’re filling your stomach with air like a balloon, and then breathing out slowly. Doing this for a minute or longer will help wake up your brain and de-fog your thoughts.

, These often talked about nutrients are beneficial for wakefulness, among other things. If you’re pondering your lunch or dinner menu, throw some salmon on your plate and consume all those awesome omega-3 fatty acids. If you’d rather not eat fish that often, substitute with fish oil pills on a daily basis.

, Throwing a bucket of cold water on a sleeping friend isn’t just a great prank, it actually helps to wake them up. If you can’t seem to do anything to stay away, splash your face with cold water or hop in a cold shower. The cool temperature and feeling of the water will improve circulation and have you concentrating a bit better than before.

, Fiber, unlike many of the foods we eat, takes a very long time to digest fully. Therefore, eat some fiber-filled foods and allow them to slowly release energy into your body over the course of the day. Try out an apple with the skin, some black beans, or a bran cereal and let go of your weary ways., Long naps during the day can disrupt your sleep later in the night, but taking short, timed naps in the afternoon can be just what your body needs to refresh itself. A veritable reboot can be performed by taking a nap that is 20 minutes long. This is just enough time for your body to fall asleep and kick out fatigue-causing stressors that have built up in your mind.

, Your sleepiness could indeed be due to a basic lack in vitamins and minerals. If you aren’t getting enough magnesium in your diet, try taking a magnesium supplement. These are available at most health food stores and can be taken on a daily basis.

, If you have a messy desk, ongoing argument with a friend, or an overwhelming amount of work to do, it could be stressing you out and making you more tired than you normally would be. Deal with the stressors you are aware of, whenever you are able. Managing anxiety-provoking things as they pop up will improve your overall mental health, as well as keep you focused throughout the day.

, Studying or working in bed or on a comfy couch is a great way to make yourself tired. Rather than imposing fatigue on yourself by staying in a location that is much too comfortable, move to a place you are less likely to fall asleep in. Working in a coffee shop or at a hard desk will make it much more difficult to want to sleep than piles of cozy blankets and pillows will."

Minimize use of electronic lighting.,
Stay away from screens if you're trying to sleep.,
Schedule social commitments around your sleep.,
Wind down when necessary.",How to Practice Segmented Sleep2," One of the main reasons it's sometimes difficult to maintain a sleep schedule is electronic lighting. Electronic lights stimulate the brain, resulting in you not feeling tired at sunset. In order to help you ease into a segmented sleep schedule, shut off electronic lights when you're getting close to your sleep times.During the day, it can also help to darken the room by closing the blinds.

, The light emitted from electronic screens can stimulate brain activity, making sleep difficult. Before your set sleep segments, stay off electronic devices like phones and laptops.Instead of using your phone near sleep times, try doing something relaxing like taking a warm shower or reading a book.

, One major issue with segmented sleep is social commitments. If you're usually asleep between six and seven, for example, this can pose an issue when making dinner plans with a friend. Strive to plan social events around your schedule. Remember, the stricter you are with a sleep schedule, the easier it is to maintain.Let friends and family members know that you're practicing segmented sleep. Explain to them what times you will be napping or in bed.
Try to plan your social calendar around when you'll be asleep. You can also adjust sleep times depending on your preferred methods of socialization. For example, if you like to stay out late on the weekends, plan nighttime sleep segments for later in the evening.

, Many people practice segmented sleep to achieve more during the day. If this is your goal, you may be wired by the time you need to get back in bed. If you've been doing something stimulating, like writing, it can be difficult to turn your mind off. Look for effective ways to unwind so you can easily stick to your schedule.Have a pre-sleep routine you stick to before each sleep segment. Your brain will learn to associate certain activities with bedtime. For example, read a book before each sleep segment.If there's something stressing you out or occupying your thoughts, give yourself 15 minutes to write it out before bed. This way, troublesome or stimulating thoughts will be out of your system near bedtime.
Do not use your bed for anything other than sleeping. You do not want to associate your bed with stimulating activities.

Avoid segmented sleep if you have certain health conditions.,
Make sure you get enough sleep.,
Watch out for symptoms of sleep deprivation.",How to Practice Segmented Sleep3," Sleep is necessary to good health. Breaking up your sleep into segments can cause sleep deprivation at first, and may not be a good idea if your health is already compromised.Health problems from sleep deprivation may include mood disorders, obesity, stroke, and heart disease.If you have any health conditions that affect your immune system, you should not practice segmented sleep. Sleep deprivation may cause you to become sick.
Sleep deprivation has also been found to increase the risk of cancer, injuries, workplace errors, and poor performance in people who work in shifts, such as night-shift workers.It's a good idea to talk to your doctor before attempting segmented sleep.

, While you can train your body to sleep in intervals, it's very difficult to train your body to need less sleep. Sleep is vital to your health and well-being. If you practice segmented sleep, make sure you're still getting enough sleep each 24 hour period.Teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 need 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.Between the ages of 18 and 25, aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep.
Between the ages of 26 and 64, 7 to 9 hours of sleep is ideal.
If you're older than 65, try to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep.

, Sleep deprivation can be a serious issue. Talk to a doctor and scale back on your segmented sleep if you notice signs of sleep deprivation. Signs of sleep deprivation include slower reaction times, difficulty making decisions, problems performing daily tasks, and irritability.Signs of sleep deprivation may include:Lack of focus
Risk-taking
Extreme sleepiness
Increased anger or other emotions
Falling asleep while performing daily activities, such as while you are driving.

Adopt an irregular sleep cycle.,
Break up your sleep cycle with naps.,
Lie in bed and relax.,
Wake yourself up in the night.",How to Induce Sleep Paralysis1," Research has shown that there is a connection between irregular sleeping patterns and the likeliness of experiencing sleep paralysis, as well as a potential genetic influence.People who work irregular shifts and have unusual and disrupted sleeping patterns are more prone to sleep paralysis. Generally sleep paralysis is more common among those who sleep less and are more sleep deprived.Remember that adults should aim for between six and nine hours of sleep a night, and frequently forcing yourself to have less than this is not advisable.Regular sleep deprivation increases your risk of serious health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. You will also find it harder to concentrate and will have reduced alertness which can make you more prone to accidents.;
, There are no guaranteed ways to induce sleep paralysis. Although it is fairly common, the exact causes of the phenomenon are still not fully understood.Disrupting your sleeping cycle with shorter sleeping periods at night and naps in the evening is one way to do this. It is not precise, but is reported as one way to upset your regular sleep cycle and potentially induce sleep paralysis.


Get out of bed earlier than usual, before carrying out your daily activities as you would normally. You should be generally active during the day even if you feel tired.
Then have a short nap in the evening, for not more than two hours, some time between 7pm and 10pm.
After the nap stay awake and be active for at least another hour before heading back to bed., If you are trying to induce sleep paralysis it's important to lie down in bed in a comfortable position. Lying on your back when you sleep is one commonly reported factor that may help induce sleep paralysis. It is not really known what the causative connection is, but it is thought that a significant number of people who experience sleep paralysis sleep in a supine position.Lie as still as you can and try to repeat a single word in your head, like a mantra. This will help you relax and clear your mind.


Repeat the word again and again, and begin to imagine that somebody is speaking the word to you.
Try not to become distracted if you sense lights and other sensations.
Concentrate on the word, stay relaxed, and you may feel yourself moving towards the threshold of sleep paralysis., An alternative way to disrupt your sleep and potentially help induce sleep paralysis is to wake yourself up during the night. Set your alarm for between four and six hours after you fall asleep, and then keep yourself awake for a short period of 15 minutes to half an hour.Get your mind active by reading for this period. Then as you go back to bed, close your eyes but maintain awareness.


To do this, repeat a mantra, such as ""You're a wizard Harry"", or focus on a particular point in your visual field.
You may then slip into sleep paralysis as you return to sleep but your mind stays aware."
"
Know what it is.,
Recognise the symptoms.,
Know when to seek medical help.",How to Induce Sleep Paralysis2," During sleep paralysis you will feel conscious and aware but unable to move your body or speak. This phenomenon could last just a few seconds, few minutes or in very rare cases longer. It is not unusual for people experiencing sleep paralysis to feel pressure on the chest or a choking sensation, as if something were pushing down on their chest.The paralysis does not cause you any harm, but it can be a frightening situation, especially if you have not experienced it before.
Some people will experience it a few times in their life, others more frequently, and some not at all.
Typically, it is more frequently observed in teenagers and young adults, although it can affect anybody and is not thought to be influenced by gender., The main symptom of sleep paralysis is the sense of consciousness without being able to move. This is often coupled with a feeling of restricted breathing. It is not uncommon for someone to experience scary hallucinations and have a powerful sense that there is something threatening in the room during sleep paralysis. These hallucinations may be especially vivid because you are semi-awake when you are dreaming.These symptoms can create an anxious and disturbed feeling which can persist after you move out of sleep paralysis.Sleep paralysis itself can be a symptom of narcolepsy., Sleep paralysis itself does not cause you any harm, but if you experience it frequently it can be upsetting and disruptive for your sleeping pattern. Most often, making adjustments to your sleep cycle so it is more regular, and trying to limit stress in your life will lower your chances of experiencing sleep paralysis. If it is having a negative impact on you, visit your doctor for advice. In some cases the doctor may prescribe a short course of antidepressants.If you have severe symptoms, they may be connected to another sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy.
Visit your doctor if you experience excessive sleepiness during the day and are finding it difficult to concentrate on everyday tasks."

Weigh your options.,
Ask for a recommendation from your primary care giver.,
Visit a medical marijuana evaluation center if necessary.,
Seek a recommendation online for convenience.,
Remember to renew.,
Find a licensed dispensary.",How to Get Weed in California1," Understand that California allows the use of medical marijuana to treat any condition if the patient finds relief in it and a doctor recommends its use. However, keep in mind that doctors are not required to recommend it just because the patient believes that it will provide relief. Depending on the attitude of your primary care physician, you can also consider obtaining a recommendation from:A brick-and-mortar medical marijuana evaluation center.
An online medical marijuana evaluation service.;
, Make an appointment with your doctor. Discuss medical marijuana as a possible option to treat whatever condition you might have. Since California doesn’t limit which conditions are applicable, don’t feel like you need to fake an illness that you don’t have (and thus ruin your credibility with your doctor). When approaching the subject, keep in mind that:There's nothing wrong with posing the question, so don't feel guilty. Be straightforward with your interest and why you think you might benefit from it.Not all doctors may be personally familiar about how marijuana relates to your particular situation. Bring along any research that you've found regarding how marijuana may benefit your specific condition if needed.
Many established physicians are reluctant and often refuse to give out recommendations. If they don’t seem willing to write you one, don’t force the issue. Preserve your relationship with your doctor.

, If your primary doctor isn’t willing to write you a recommendation, don’t worry; they don’t have the final word. As an alternative, search online for an evaluation center in your area. Visit them as you would with your normal doctor, except here the primary focus is whether or not marijuana is a viable option for your treatment (as opposed to just one of many possibilities). However:These centers often range pretty widely in terms of quality care and service. Compare customer reviews online for any that you might be considering.
Don’t treat evaluation centers as a substitute for your primary doctor. Although some may be on par with “legitimate” doctor’s offices, others may operate according to much lower standards., If you’re unable to find a brick-and-mortar evaluation center that you’re comfortable with (or if you’d just rather not leave the house at all), search online for a web-based evaluation center. Sign up for their service and fill out their online forms when prompted. Then talk with one of their doctors via phone or video to discuss marijuana as a possible treatment.If approved, they’ll send you two recommendations: an electronic one that you can print out and use that day if needed, plus your official written copy through the mail for long-term use.

, Regardless of which method you choose to obtain a doctor’s recommendation, keep in mind that it doesn’t last forever. Expect it to expire within one year. For longer treatment, repeat whichever method you’re most comfortable with each year., Search online for nearby medical marijuana dispensaries. Confirm that they have been licensed by California’s Bureau of Marijuana Control (formerly the Bureau for Medical Cannabis Regulation). Bring your doctor’s written recommendation with you to prove that you are eligible.You do not need a medical marijuana ID card in order to purchase medical marijuana.

Expect the same age restrictions enforced with alcohol to be applied here. If you are 21 or older, feel free to enjoy, but if you’re younger than that, expect the following penalties:A $100 fine for possession of any amount if you are between 18 and 21.
Court-ordered counseling or community service for possession if you are under 18.

, Although consuming recreational marijuana is now legal, expect to wait until 2018 before you can purchase it legally. In the meantime, feel free to grow up to six plants on your own. If you grow them outside, do so in an enclosed area to restrict access. Either way, be sure to:Check both your county and town’s laws regarding growing before you start. Be aware that local governments are allowed to establish further restrictions, such as prohibiting outdoor growing altogether.

, Remember: just because recreational use and sales are now becoming legal doesn’t mean that buying an eighth from that dude in the park is now legal, too. As businesses begin to open, be sure to only purchase from those licensed by California’s Bureau of Marijuana Control.

Don't ruin your hair with special shampoos or solutions.",How to Get Pot Out of Your System," After using pot, THC, its primary psychoactive ingredient, remains in the body. The length of time that THC (or its metabolites - chemicals produced as it is broken down) can be detected in your system is different for everyone and depends on a number of health and lifestyle factors (see below).


Metabolism. Your metabolism plays a part in how quickly or slowly the THC metabolites are broken down and released from your system. Everyone has a different rate of metabolism determined by their height, weight, sex, level of physical activity, and genetics that determines how quickly THC leaves your system.
Body fat. THC is stored in fat cells. This means that, after use, THC is most densely concentrated in fatty organs like the brain, ovaries, and testicles. However, THC metabolites also have been detected in body fat for up to a month after ingestion.Frequency of usage. The frequency with you use marijuana helps determine the length of your detectable period. Because THC and its metabolites linger in the body even after a noticeable high has faded, frequent use will cause these chemicals' levels to ""build up"", eventually plateauing at an elevated level. Thus, heavy users will generally test positive for longer than light users if they both cease using marijuana at the same time.
Potency. The potency of the marijuana also has an effect on the length of time it stays in your body. Strong pot - that is, marijuana with a high level of THC - will stay with you longer than low-grade weed.
Exercise/lifestyle. The level of exercise a person gets is known to affect the level of THC in his or her system - what's less well-known is precisely how it affects this level. Contrary to the popular legend which claims that exercise can ""release"" TCH from the body by burning fat cells, some scientific studies have actually found the opposite in the short-term - in other words, exercise the day after ingesting marijuana can slightly elevate blood THC levels.;
, If your prospective employer has about 100 employees or has government or private financial backing, you will probably be tested, either as part of your pre-employment screening or at some point during your tenure with that company. The Department of Defense requires frequent, observed tests of its military personnel, and parole/probation officers are subjected to a similar style of screening. In certain industries, like the restaurant and hospitality sectors, testing is much rarer, but by no means nonexistent.


Note that, while urine tests can be used to test for pregnancy and certain other medical conditions, your employer has no legal basis to do so and, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), is in fact prohibited from denying you employment based on one of these conditions., There are a number of different ways that employers screen for THC in your system. They vary in terms of cost, convenience and accuracy. This means that most employers (but certainly not all) employers will use the cheaper methods, while employers offering high-responsibility positions may require the more expensive tests. Below are the most common forms of testing:



Saliva test. The saliva test, in which a sample is taken from inside the mouth via swab, is inexpensive and has a very short detection timeline. Theoretically, it can detect THC only within a few days of use. Some employers like saliva tests because they're convenient to administer, make random testing easier, and are tough to beat. However, saliva tests are thought to be fairly unreliable and are not yet widely used in the U.S, though they are prevalent in certain other countries, like Australia.Urine test. Urine tests do not actually detect THC in the body. Instead, they search for its metabolite, THC-COOH, which is produced after ingesting cannabis and can linger long after the THC itself is gone. There are two types of urine tests an employer may order:

In the first, most-common type, you are required to go to an off-site collection facility. There, your urine is collected in a specially designed cup, sealed with a tamper resistant tape, and sent to a testing laboratory for screening.
A second, more cost-effective method that is gaining popularity is an instant, on-site urine test that's often used for random employee testing and patient testing as well as in drug rehabilitation programs.



Blood test. Blood tests test the blood itself for the presence of THC. Since THC only stays in the blood for a short amount of time (usually about 12-24 hours), this is an uncommon option for pre-employment screening. Instead, blood tests are usually used to determine whether someone was recently impaired in situations where this information is pertinent (like, for instance, after a workplace accident).

Hair follicle test. These tests are somewhat expensive and are most commonly used for highly sensitive jobs or jobs that requires special clearance. Depending on the length of the hair, hair tests can show results that date back up to about three months.Hair tests are widely used in the casino industry.

, The internet is full of misinformation and half-truths when it comes to beating drug tests. Many of the most commonly-cited tricks and home remedies aren't supported by any scientific evidence whatsoever. Thus, it's important to be very skeptical before trying one of these methods to avoid wasting your time and money or needlessly failing your test.


The methods in this section may help you but are by no means guaranteed to work. Applied improperly, some of these methods can even increase the chance that you fail your test, so proceed with caution.

, The dilution method for beating a urine test works on the principle that, since a positive or negative result is based on the concentration of THC metabolites in your urine, giving yourself extremely dilute urine can bring your concentration below 50ng./ml (the cut-off point for most drug tests), allowing you to pass the test. Unfortunately, many urine tests now account for this strategy,requiring the use of several countermeasures. See below for a brief guide to ""dilution"".


Starting three days before your test, build up the creatinine levels in your system. Do this by eating a lots red meat or taking creatine supplements (available in specialty health food, vitamin and supplement stores). This first step is important because many urine tests check for this substance (a metabolite of creatine) to make sure that your urine isn’t diluted. Failure to take this step can cause you to fail the test on suspicion of diluting your urine.
An hour or two before the test, take 50 to 100 mg. of B2, B12 or B-complex to add color to your urine. Then, drink a glass of water every 15 minutes or so. You should drink about a quart (roughly a liter) of water. Don't overdo your water intake to the point of water intoxication - a real and lethal condition. You should also urinate at least once during this time because you don't want to submit your first urine sample for testing.
When it is time to give the sample, take it “midstream”, in other words, first pee into the toilet and then into the collection cup. This will give you the best chance of the lowest concentration of metabolites, as this flushes any old (higher-concentration) urine from the urethra.

If your urine comes off as too dilute, and you get a second chance to take the test, schedule it as far out as possible. This will give you time to either reach the end of your detectable period or to try the dilution method again, making adjustments so that you don’t over-dilute.
Drinking water will not “flush"" the THC out of your system; it simply serves the purpose of diluting your urine.



, Hair tests require the person administering the test to cut a short lock of hair from your head - no hair, no test. In such a case, the test-giver may ask for a sample of body hair. To avoid this, you could conceivably shave every hair on your body before the test and claim that you’re a body builder or swimmer. However, if you appeared for your initial interview with a full head of hair or noticeable body hair, your employer will likely suspect that you're cheating. Thus, the best policy may be to shave before the interview itself so that your story is consistent.

, Every type of marijuana test has a different ""window"" in which it tests for THC or its metabolites. Thus, if you can time your test (and/or your marijuana use) so that your last usage falls outside of this window, you can improve your chances of passing (though not guarantee them). Notably, most hair tests are unable to detect pot use within the last few days because the length of hair in which THC from this use is present has not yet emerged from the scalp. Below are the detection windows for the common methods of marijuana testing, assuming a single use of marijuana:Saliva test - 12-24 hours after use
Urine test - 1-3 days after use
Blood test - 1-3 days after use
Hair test - from 3-5 days after use up to 90 days after use
Note - for heavy users, these windows will be substantially less forgiving.

, When all else fails, try to postpone or re-schedule your test. Every extra day you give yourself increases the chance that you'll pass your test unscathed. Even just a day or two can make a significant difference. For instance, one (admittedly informal) study found that, under the right circumstances, certain types of urine tests can give ""clean"" results in as little as 24 to 48 hours after marijuana use., As noted above, one widely-spread home remedy for ""cleansing"" the body of THC is to sweat it out - usually via exercise, but sometimes via sauna. The reasoning behind this method is that THC is stored in the body's fat cells, so sweat-inducing, fat-burning activities will cause the THC to be excreted through sweat. In fact, there is no hard evidence supporting this claim. While exercise can boost the body's metabolism and thus might logically decrease the amount of time that THC remains in the body in the long term, some studies have actually found that exercise can raise blood THC levels in the short term, making this a bad last-minute choice. , As with the method above, this method suggests eliminating fatty foods from your diet to reduce your level of body fat and, thus, the amount of tissue that THC can be stored in. For many of the reasons above, this method can also be classified as unsupported by hard evidence.

, Since there is no shortage of people looking for a quick way to pass a drug test, certain opportunistic companies selling supposed ""detox"" kits have capitalized on this captive market. Usually, these detox kits contain a regimen of pills or supplements designed to ""cleanse"" your system of THC and its metabolites before your tests. There is no scientific evidence supporting these companies' claims that vitamins or supplements can remove THC from your system. Any testimonials of testing negative after taking such supplements should be regarded as occurring in spite of, rather than because of the supplements.

, One widely-circulated rumor regarding hair tests is that washing with a specially formulated (usually fairly expensive) shampoo can eliminate THC from the hair. In fact, no shampoo has been scientifically proven to eliminate THC. In addition, some ""home remedy"" versions of this method recommend creating a solution from chemicals like bleach which can potentially irritate your scalp. When it comes to marijuana tests, use a healthy amount of discretion whenever rubbing strong chemicals into your hair - just as you normally would.

Stay awake yourself.,
Keep your friend moving.,
Talk to your friend.,
Stay on your feet as much as possible.,
Nudge or gently shake your friend if you observe her nodding off.,
Yell loudly at your friend if he starts to doze off.",How to Keep Someone from Falling Asleep1," This is key. By staying awake yourself, you will be able to observe when your friend is about to nod off, and you can intervene before he does fall asleep. Staying awake will allow you to talk to your friend and provide other support.;
, Navy Basic Underwater Demolition and SEAL (BUD/S) candidates who have successfully completed “Hell Week,” in which they are awake for virtually five days, say that it is difficult to fall asleep when you are moving around. The candidates are constantly moving, exercising, and being yelled at by their SEAL instructors.You can use some of these techniques to help your friend stay awake:


Create an exercise circuit to keep moving. Try doing 10 pushups, 10 sit ups, 10 squats for as many rounds as you can.
Throw a football or play a game of soccer. Near the end of Hell Week, SEAL instructors have the candidates engage in fun sports to stay awake.

, Try telling stories. Speak in a loud voice.


Tell your funniest story.
Tell a scary story.

, If you are studying late into the night, stand up to take your notes.

, Have her move around or stand up immediately.

, This is common in BUD/S training. The candidates are constantly being yelled at by their instructors.

"
Find or create a cool or cold environment.,
Make your friend as physically uncomfortable as you can without physically harming him.,
Turn on loud music.",How to Keep Someone from Falling Asleep2," BUD/S candidates say that when you’re freezing cold, it’s almost impossible to fall asleep. They are subjected to up to 15 minutes immersed in water that is barely above 60°F (15.6°C).Be careful, however, because exposure to extreme cold can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as hypothermia.


Have your friend drink a cold beverage.
Make an ice bath for your buddy and have her sit in it for 10 minutes.
Adjust the air conditioning to make the room cool or cold.
Have your friend take a cold 10-minute shower.

, People are less likely to fall asleep when they are uncomfortable, according to one military member who successfully completed Hell Week.Get “wet and sandy."" Jump into a body of water then roll around in the sand like BUD/S candidates do.
Sit in the most uncomfortable chair available.
Take away your friend’s pillow and blankets.

, Loud sounds make it difficult to doze off.

Help your friend write down a goal.,
Break down the goals into small, manageable chunks.,
Repeat or chant a mantra.",How to Keep Someone from Falling Asleep3," Is her goal to stay up for 24 hours? For 48 hours? Studies show that writing down goals improves achievement of the goal., Research shows that when people break their goals down into smaller chunks, they complete the goals more quickly and accurately.Help your friend look at this challenge as an hourly goal or break it down even further, to minutes. Goals might be: Stay awake for one more hour, until 2am. When that goal has been reached, the next goal might be the same: Stay awake for one more hour, until 3am. Staying awake for one more hour (or 15 or 30 minutes) seems more manageable and easier to accomplish than staying awake for 24 or 12 hours.

, Often times, repeating a mantra can help focus the mind on something other than the difficult experience at hand. Good mantras are short, encouraging, and rhythmic.


Make up a mantra.
Use someone else’s mantra and repeat it. Try out, “Feeling strong, feeling good,"" or, “Looking good, feeling good, oughta be in Hollywood.”"

Offer your friend some caffeine.,
Help your friend to avoid alcohol.,
Make sure your friend avoids illegal drugs.,
Make sure your friend avoids using legal prescription drugs contrary to how they are prescribed.",How to Keep Someone from Falling Asleep4," Caffeine is a legal drug found in coffee, chocolate energy drinks, and in pill form. It is a stimulant, and it is more difficult to fall asleep while under the influence of a stimulant.According to experts, up to 400 milligrams per day of caffeine is safe for most people.A cup of coffee has about 95 mg of caffeine. An energy drink has around 74 – 111mg of caffeine.
Children and teenagers should not consume more than 100 milligrams of caffeine per day.Avoid over-consuming caffeine. In large doses it can be dangerous. Caffeine can cause increased blood pressure, increasing heart rate, dizziness, dehydration, and headaches., Too much alcohol has a depressant effect on the nervous system (the opposite of the stimulant effect that caffeine has).

, Although some illegal drugs are stimulants (methamphetamine, cocaine), avoid using these as a method to stay awake. These drugs are harmful, illegal, and potentially deadly.

, Do not allow your friend to take someone else’s prescription drugs. Advise her to avoid taking her own prescription drugs in a manner that is different from how a physician prescribed them. Failure to follow the directions on the prescription label can result in severe medical complications and even death.

Relax your muscles progressively.,
Breathe deeply.,
Adjust the temperature if necessary.,
Change your sleeping position.,
Change your clothes.",How to Get Back to Sleep1," If you woke up and are struggling to get back to sleep, one excellent method of falling back to sleep quickly without moving or getting up is to try a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. It's easy and effective in helping people get back to sleep quickly.


Start with your feet, focusing all your attention on your feet. Breathe deeply, sending all your relaxation and your energy toward your feet. Feel your feet start to relax and start to fall asleep.
Next, move up your legs and feel your legs start relaxing. Progressively move to each section of your body, breathing ""into"" that body part and slowly relaxing your body in this way. Try to take at least 5-10 deep breaths per body part.;
, Sometimes, just focusing on breathing very deeply into your diaphragm can be an effective technique to help you fall back to sleep quickly. There's no big secret to it. Just focus on breathing deeply, holding it for a count of three, and letting it back out very slowly.


Breathing deeply helps to oxygenate your blood, making you feel relaxed and drowsy. Focusing your attention on your breath also helps to calm you mind and relax you.

, If your room is the wrong temperature, it can be very difficult to fall back to sleep. Some studies reveal that most people sleep best at a temperature of 68 °F (20 °C).The ideal sleeping temperature will vary depending on your personal preference, as well as the climate that you live in, but adjusting things gently can help you get more comfortable.


If you're too cold, get another blanket, or wear some more layers in bed. Adjust the thermostat or use a space heater if the room is very cold.
If you're too warm, try losing a blanket, or losing some layers. Turn on the air conditioning, or use a fan for some cool air and ambient sound in the room.

, If you're struggling to sleep, the position that you're sleeping in can be partly to blame. Try sleeping on your back if at all possible, or on your side if you feel more comfortable. Try to keep your neck and shoulders relatively straight while you sleep, to strengthen your spine and allow your muscles to relax.


Make sure your pillow is wide enough, and not too tall. If your pill angles your neck down, or bends your neck too much it can be very difficult to get to sleep and stay asleep.
If you sleep on your side, put a pillow between your legs to help keep your back straight.
Avoid sleeping on your stomach. This puts a lot of strain on your neck and can make you breathe improperly, making it very difficult to get to sleep.

, If you're feeling restless, your clothes could be to blame. Try to wear comfortable and loose cotton sleeping pajamas and avoid synthetic fabrics, wool, and other itchy fabrics that might irritate you during the night.


Some studies show that people who sleep naked actually report longer hours of sleep and better quality of sleep as well.Consider going au natural.

Get up if you can't fall asleep in 20 minutes.,
Read something uninteresting.,
Write down your anxieties or to-dos for tomorrow.,
Try repeating a phrase or sound repeatedly.,
Try listening to some white noise.,
Try to visualize something relaxing and dull.",How to Get Back to Sleep2," If you're just laying in bed and tossing and turning, it's better to get up than to keep fighting and letting your mind go nuts. Don't just lay there and get more and more frustrated. It'll only make it worse. Instead, get up after 20 minutes of restlessness and try to do something actively to make you more drowsy.


Don't eat anything. A lot of people think a midnight snack can be a good idea, but digesting food while you sleep will affect the quality of rest you're able to achieve.Whatever you do, stop watching the clock. The worst thing you can do is sit in bed and watch the hands tick by. This will only keep your mind occupied and anxious., One of the best ways to fall back to sleep quickly is to read something complicated, dull, or just otherwise uninteresting. Pull out your old history textbook, or flip open your copy of Ulysses. Time to pass out.


Reading helps to tire your eyes and still your mind, keeping yourself focused on reading the words instead of letting your mind wander and stress.Very successful people often make reading before bed a habit.
Keep the lights very low while you read. Don't watch television, or use a mobile device if you're trying to get to sleep. Some studies show that the high contrast light displays will actually affect your body's internal sleep clock, making it confused. Bright lights late at night make it more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.

, If you can't quit thinking about all the stuff you've got to do tomorrow, or the million things you left undone today, it can be very relaxing and calming to write them down before you go to bed. Just the act of writing things down in a list can give you a sense of accomplishment, helping you feel that you've gotten part of the task done. And that can help you get back to bed., If your mind won't calm down, try forcing it to calm down by repeating a mantra, or a small phrase repeatedly. This will force your mind to focus on something, but not something that will be complicated or force you to spin off into anxiety and other worrisome thoughts.It doesn't have to be complex, or fancy. Just repeating your own name, or ""Go to sleep"" or ""Everything is fine, I am relaxed"" is a great way of calming yourself. You don't have to say this out loud, just think it to yourself.

, In much the same way a repetitive phrase can calm your mind, so too can a repetitive sound. The low hum of static, or the sound of crashing waves, or the sound of a crackling fireplace, or the sound of a fan blowing gently can help lots of people get to sleep and stay asleep.


White noise generators are commonly sold at novelty stores and housewares departments. They're also common YouTube videos and widely available on the Internet.

, Visualization helps some types of insomniacs get to sleep quickly. If you find yourself restless and with an anxious mind, try picturing yourself in a relaxing and calm location, and make yourself do specific tasks around the room. Don't just be in the room, do some task.


Picture yourself at your grandmother's house at Christmas, kneading dough for Christmas bread. Or picture yourself with your partner in a calm and quiet meadow, rubbing their shoulders after a walk. Make it easy, calm, and quiet.

Keep your sleep schedule regular.,
Avoid bright lights for at least an hour before bed.,
Avoid eating or drinking for a few hours before you go to sleep.,
Take a warm shower before getting into bed.,
Get more exercise.,
Talk to your doctor if you regularly wake up in the middle of the night.",How to Get Back to Sleep3," Your natural sleep clock works a lot better if you go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day.Try to keep your schedule fairly consistent, so your body will get used to going to sleep and waking up at a set time.


An hour or two before your bedtime, turn the lights down lower and go about a relaxing routine. Brush your teeth and do any nighttime grooming that you usually do, keeping your space quiet and as soothing as possible.

, TV glare and the bright lights of mobile devices can make it more difficult for you to settle down and sleep.Although we all like to check our phones frequently throughout the day, give yourself a break as you're getting ready to go to sleep, to allow your eyes and your brain a chance to settle down.


Reading before bedtime can be a great way to settle your brain down and coax yourself to sleep, but try to avoid using an e-reader. Use an old analog book or magazine instead, and read in low lamp light.

, Even though turkey makes you sleeping, it's never a good idea to eat or drink anything for a few hours before you go to bed, especially if you wake up in the middle of the night regularly. This is because your body needs to work to enter its digesting phase, which can interfere with sleep.Avoid caffeine and alcohol specifically, which can make it more difficult for you to sleep soundly. Alcohol has a reputation for making people sleepy, but it's usually fitful and poor-quality sleep. Any liquid taken an hour or two before bed might make you have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, interrupting your sleep., Some studies show that a warm (not hot) bath or shower before bed can help you settle down and get in the mood for resting. When you transition between a warm shower and a cold room, your body temperature will drop in much the way it does when you fall asleep. A short shower, between 5-10 minutes, at about 104° F is optimal., If you struggle to sleep through the night, betting more exercise can improve your sleep significantly. Exercise can increase your body temperature and release serotonin, helping to reduce anxiety symptoms that may be keeping you from sleeping.If you struggle to stay asleep through the night, try doing some moderate exercise. Try doing 15-20 minutes of light cardio in the evenings, 4-5 hours before you go to bed for the night.

, If you're waking up in the middle of the night more than once or twice a week, you may have a more significant sleep disorder that can be corrected with treatment or medication. If this is a regular problem for you, it could be a sign of any of the following problems:


Insomnia
Sleep apnea
Stress-related wakefulness
Restless leg syndrome
Other sleep disorders
Enlarged prostate or other health problems

Keep track of when you feel like dozing off. This can clue you into if you’re simply sleepy or sleep deficient. Common times people get sleepy include:Sitting down in your office, classroom, or a meeting
Reading
Watching TV or a movie
Riding in a car for an hour without stopping
Waiting in traffic for a few minutes;
, Sleepiness can make your body uncomfortable. Watching for physical symptoms can help you figure out if you are drowsy instead of fatigued. Symptoms include:Heavy eyelids
Trouble keeping your head up
Inability to keep eyes open
Frequent yawning
Slow reaction times, Drowsiness can affect your brain’s ability to work at its best. Look for the following cognitive signs of sleepiness, which can alert you to nap or get a good night’s sleep:Wandering thoughts
Inability to focus or pay attention
Difficulty making decisionsInability to solve problems
Making many mistakes
Inability to finish tasks

, Sleepiness can also affect your behavior, such as times you snap at someone because you need a nap. Watching for certain behaviors can let you know if you’re drowsy. Behaviors to watch for include:Inability to cope with change
Inability to control emotions and behavior
Having mood swings
Feeling sad or depressed
Lacking motivation
Being impulsive

, Certain conditions or medications can make you drowsy. Being aware of these can alert you to potential problems or plan to get extra sleep at night. Underlying medical causes of sleepiness include:Apnea
Insomnia
Narcolepsy
Taking tranquilizers, sleeping pills, or antihistaminesLong-term insomnia
Diabetes
Underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism

, The big difference between sleepiness and fatigue is that fatigue is unrelenting exhaustion that isn’t relieved with sleep. Asking yourself, “Do I still feel tired and achy even after a good night’s sleep?,” can alert you to a more serious issue than not getting enough sleep.Acknowledging that you are constantly tired or feel weak can ensure you get prompt care.

, Fatigue can really affect how your body feels. Constant and reduced levels of energy are two factors that distinguish fatigue from sleepiness. Identifying physical symptoms can help you figure out if you are just drowsy or fatigued. The physical signs of fatigue include:Persistent weariness
Reduced energy
Feeling unrefreshed after a night’s sleepMuscle pain
Frequent headachesMulti-joint pain without redness or swelling
Dizziness
Appetite loss
Reduced immune system function
Slowed reflexes and responses

, Like drowsiness, fatigue can also affect your brain. However, the cognitive signs may be more noticeable or not go away. Watching your cognitive ability for symptoms can help you determine if you have fatigue. Signs of fatigue include:Inability to concentrate
Impaired decision making and judgmentMoodiness
Irritability
Impaired hand-eye coordination
Short-term memory problems
Poor concentration
Reduced ability to pay attention

, Constant weariness can noticeably change your behavior. Seeing if your moods are different over time may signal fatigue. Watch for the following behavioral signs that can indicate fatigue:Low motivation
Moodiness
Irritability
Feeling constantly stressedAnxiety
Depression

, Make a doctor’s appointment if you are fatigued for two or more weeks. This may signal an underlying condition such as hypothyroidism or depression. Get immediate medical attention if you have fatigue with the following symptoms:Abnormal bleeding, especially from your rectum or vomiting blood
Severe headache
Chest pain
Shortness of breathe
Irregular or fast heartbeat
Dizziness or feeling like you might pass out
Severe abdominal, pelvic or back pain
Feelings that you may harm yourself or someone else

, Go to bed at the same time every evening as much as possible. Regular bedtimes set your body clock. This can make it easier to get a good night’s rest and avoid drowsiness or fatigue.Figure out a reasonable bedtime based on factors such as your work schedule, exercise, and diet. Schedule your bedtime 2-3 hours after hard activities or eating a heavy meal. This gives your body and mind time to wind down.
Adjust your schedule as needed.Get into bed at the same time every night, even if you are not tired. Get up for a few minutes and do something relaxing like listening to music or reading in dimmed light if you can’t fall asleep immediately.

, Set aside one hour of relax time before your fixed bedtime. You can read in dimmed lights or take a bath, for example. This time can signal your body to sleep as well as help you relax and fall asleep quickly.Avoid using electronics, devices, or bright lights during this hour. Light, images, and other content can stimulate your brain and may keep you from falling asleep., Do activities every night that relax you before bed. These might include taking a warm bath, reading a book, or having a glass or warm milk. A routine can signal your body and mind that it’s time for bed. It may also help you sleep better.Choose something that you can do in dimmed light or you can switch into bedtime mode. For example, play with your pet, read a magazine, or watch a show in your TV or device’s nighttime mode, which blocks out blue light.

, Having a comfy and cozy bedroom can help you get an optimal night’s rest. This can help ease sleepiness and fatigue that you may have the next day. Try the following to turn your bedroom into a sleep paradise:Removing electronics
Leaving work in another room and any work from your room
Setting your bedroom temperature between 60-75 degreesOpening a window or running a fan for ventilation
Having comfortable beddingBlocking out light with blinds or curtains
Dampening sounds and listening to white noise

After the expiration date, the reagents that detect drugs start to degrade, which makes the test inaccurate.You should be particularly careful about purchasing tests online. Make sure any product you purchase has a guarantee or return policy in case you find that it’s expired when you receive it.

, If you’re concerned about getting the most accurate results possible, look for kits that include lab testing in the purchase price. If you yield positive results, you can mail the sample to a lab for confirmation.While more expensive, a lab can rule out false positives caused by foods, drinks, and over the counter products, like cold or allergy medications.

, In addition to home urine, saliva, and hair tests, there are kits that can test a substance itself. If you’re concerned that a substance contains a harmful additive, testing it can determine its purity.Don’t take a substance that tests positive for anything other than what you believe it to be. While testing a substance can detect undesirable additives, remember that no illegal drug or substance of abuse is safe.

Practice progressive muscle relaxation.,
Distract yourself.,
Get out of bed if nothing works.",How to Go Back to Sleep After a Lucid Dream1," Light is a stimulant. On the other hand, darkness triggers your body to produce more sleep-inducing melatonin. Avoid reaching for the lamp on the nightstand. If you wear a sleep mask, keep it on. If not, simply close your eyes., Place your phone beyond arm's reach. Looking at the clock will make you realize how much sleep you've lost and increase your stress levels. Turn your alarm clock toward the wall. The blue or green light from your phone could make you feel more alert.Avoid watching TV, as well. Like your phone, the TV emits light that can trigger activity in your brain. Furthermore, the activity on the TV and the storylines attached to it could further engage your brain into a fully conscious state., Don't think of anything at all. Close your eyes and lie as still as possible. Try to be present in the moment and not worry about finding a solution that you can't achieve now. These actions will reduce the activity in your heart and brain, allowing you to get into a more relaxed state., Focus on one muscle group at a time, trying to isolate each group. Flex your muscles to about three-quarters strength. Hold each flex for five seconds and slowly release the tension. As you transition between muscle groups, take slow, deep breaths.

If any muscle group causes you pain, skip it and move on to another group that doesn't cause discomfort., Everything from an approaching deadline to a sudden realization that you're out of bread can charge your brain. Use any distracting tricks you can to allow yourself to calm down and go to sleep. Count sheep. Think of the lyrics of your favorite song., Don't try to force yourself back to sleep if you can't unwind. Turn on the light at the dimmest setting you can stand without straining your eyes.

Get rid of distractions.",How to Fight Sleepiness1," One great way to fight sleepiness is to take a nap. These naps should be short - 5 to 25 minutes - and well before your bedtime. Try to nap 6-7 hours or longer from your bedtime.


If you can't take a nap, try closing your eyes and lying there while you rest for about 10 minutes.Try not to sleep too long. If you sleep more than 20-30 minutes, you won't get into a deep sleep or mess up your inner clock, both of which can make you feel groggy.;
, One of the main reasons you feel sleepy is because you don't get enough. You need to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Get on a sleep schedule so that your body can form a habit.

, Sleep during the hours of 10 p.m. - 2 a.m. The body relaxes the most during those hours.If you stay up too late, your body's natural sleep rhythms can get out of balance. Plus, going to bed late might not give you the 7-8 hours you need.

, One thing that can help you get proper sleep is to rid yourself of distractions in your room. This includes electronics such as cell phones, laptops, tablets, and televisions.You might be inclined to stay on the computer or cell phone too long, which cuts into your sleep time.


Cut off all TVs and radios. If you need to sleep with sound in the background, try soothing music, sleep sounds like rain or thunderstorms, or small water fountains.

If you can't remember, make it a habit to pay attention to the position your body's position upon waking. This can make re-entry into a lucid dream more successful in the future., Open your mind to continuing where you left off. Intend to participate actively. If part of the dream was disturbing, build up your courage to face that aspect.Repeat a mantra, if you want. You could say something like:

“I want to finish my dream.”
“I'll pick up where I left off when I woke up.”, Meditate on what you can recall. Focus on changing what you did in the dream, even if you were satisfied with the whole thing. This will increase your sense of control. Continue to relive the dream as you go to sleep."

Exercise regularly.,
Avoid caffeine after lunch.,
Cut back on your alcohol intake.,
Wear earplugs.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Go Back to Sleep After a Lucid Dream3," Physical activity can reduce your stress level and make you more likely to fall asleep quickly after waking up from a lucid dream. Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise regimen and work out a plan that's right for you. Get active at least 20 minutes a day, three days a week.

Physical activity increases your heart rate and stimulates your brain. Don't exercise within two hours of going to bed., Even if that cup of java doesn't get you wired, limit your intake to the morning. Read the labels on the other beverages or foods you consume to see if they contain caffeine. Stick to decaffeinated coffee, herbal tea, or water for your after-lunch choices. As difficult as it might sound, avoid chocolate during this time, as well., Yes, alcohol can make you sleepy, but it also raises stress levels. If you don't want to quit altogether, limit yourself to one drink per day. Don't drink within two hours of going to bed., Sometimes noises outside or a snoring partner can prevent you from getting back to sleep. Buy earplugs at your local drug store. Opt for reusable earplugs to save money and landfill space. Wash and sanitize your earplugs with hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol every day to avoid ear infections., Ask them about the side effects of any medications you might be taking. Look into alternatives that don't disturb your sleep. If prescription meds aren't the problem, ask about medications or herbal supplements that might help you get back to sleep more quickly.If your family doctor can't help you, ask them to refer you to a qualified sleep specialist. Sometimes, they can help you without any medication."

Eat an adequate amount of food.,
Reduce your fat intake.,
Drink enough water.,
Reach for a healthy snack.,
Drink caffeine.,
Refrain from drinking alcohol.",How to Fight Sleepiness2," Not fueling your body can cause sleepiness and fatigue. By eating a balanced diet of at least 3 small meals a day, along with healthy snacks in between, you fight off fatigue by keeping your blood sugar levels in check. Eating throughout the day also helps you sustain your energy levels.


Don't skip meals, especially breakfast. Start the day with protein and complex carbs instead of sugary foods. Too much sugar in the morning can cause you to crash later in the day. Try eggs and whole-grain toast., Diets with high concentrations of fat can make you sleepier during the day. A study done at Penn State University found participants who ate more fatty foods were sleepier during the day. Diets high in fat can also decrease alertness.Carbohydrates were found to help fight fatigue during the day. Diets high in protein also help give you sustained energy.
Don't eat lunches with high concentrations of fat. Instead of fries, eat a baked potato.

, Dehydration can cause sleepiness. Drink water continuously throughout the day. On average, you need 6-8 cups of water a day. If you are doing any physical activity, have 2 cups of water before the activity and 2 more after.


If you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated and need to drink more water.
Your urine should be a light color if you are drinking enough water., Instead of getting a sugary snack, like a candy bar, eat a healthy snack. Snacks full of protein and other healthy ingredients will help give you lasting energy without the crash.


Try peanut, almond, or cashew butter on apples, celery, whole wheat crackers, or a piece of whole wheat bread.
Put some fresh fruit into Greek yogurt or unsweetened plain yogurt. Also try honey or nuts in it, too.
Eat baby carrots, cucumbers, or cherry tomatoes with low-fat cream cheese dips.Eat avocado with tomatoes, nuts, or other vegetables.

, Caffeine helps you wake up by getting your heart pumping and stimulating your body. It also helps improve concentration and attention span. However, caffeine can be addictive and cause headaches and anxiety.Coffee is a common way people get caffeine. An average cup of coffee has 95-200 mg for an 8 ounce cup.Consuming coffee can give you ""jitters"" after you drink it, so you may want to limit your intake.
Tea is another common way to get caffeine. Tea may be more effective at keeping you awake because in addition to caffeine, it has three other stimulants that work with caffeine: Theophylline, Theobromine, and L-theanine. Coffee gives you a kick after drinking it, whereas tea works continually through the day to keep you awake and alert. Tea won't give you that wired, jittery feeling after drinking it.In some individuals, caffeine can cause fatigue., Many people use alcohol to help them sleep. This might seem effective because you quickly fall asleep after drinking the alcohol. This is because it sedates your body. However, when the body starts to metabolize the alcohol, it overshoots, which can wake you up in the middle of the night. To help fight sleepiness the next day, don't drink alcohol to help you fall asleep the night before.


Alcohol has been shown to disrupt sleep patterns, which can make you feel sleepy the next day."

Regular exercise also helps improve the quality of your sleep.Try walking, cycling, swimming, or hiking. Do something each day for 30 minutes that gets your heart rate up.

, If you are sitting at your desk and feel like nodding off, try getting out of your chair and moving around. Take a walk around the office, do a few jumping jacks, run in place, or even do some squats and crunches. This helps get your blood pumping and wakes you up.A study at California State University found that a 10 minute walk kept you alert for 2 hours afterwards, while a candy bar only kept you alert for 1 hour and led to a crash afterwards.Stretch. Get out of your chair and touch your toes, stretch your back, and stretch your arms overhead.Stretching gets your blood flowing., When sleepiness hits, try doing some simple yoga poses. Yoga can help warm up the body and work as a natural stimulant.Start with cat-cow pose. Get on your hands and knees with your shoulders and hips over wrists and knees. Move your spine rhythmically. With every inhale, arch the back and lift the sitting bones and chest. When you exhale, round the back and tuck your chin and pelvis.
Start in downward facing dog. Lift your right leg up behind you. Round your spine while drawing the knee to your chest. Round your upper spine upwards as you keep the pelvis low. The right thigh should be against your chest and your knee should be against your nose. Return to downward facing dog. Repeat with the left leg., This raises oxygen levels in the blood and helps improve circulation. Breathe through your abdomen for the most effective deep breathing.


Sit up straight. Place a hand on your belly. Inhale through your nose. Make sure your belly pushes your hand out while your chest doesn't move. Push the air out through your lips. Complete this exercise 10 times.
Inhale and exhale quickly through your nose. Keep your mouth closed and relaxed. The breaths should be short. Then breathe normally.

, If you're feeling sleepy, splash some cold water on your face. To further wake up, step outside with your face still damp.Cold water gets the blood flowing, so it helps wake you up. If you have the time, try taking a cold shower. A contrast shower, where you switch back from warm and cold water, can also help wake you up and energize you., Mint flavored items can help refresh and wake you up. Chew some mint-flavored gum or suck on a peppermint., Involve yourself in conversation to help stimulate your mind and wake yourself up. If you're at work, go talk to a colleague about a work-related topic. Find a study buddy when studying late and discuss the information to help keep you awake. Try calling a friend or family member for a brief 5-minute chat to wake you up., Getting sunlight on a daily basis can help you get your natural circadian rhythms regulated. Try spending at least 30 minutes outside in the sunlight.


If you can't spend 30 minutes outside, go outside and get some fresh air to help you re-energize., Dimmer lights can cause fatigue by making your body think it's almost time to sleep. Dimmer lights also boost relaxation, which can make you feel sleepy. Turn on brighter lights to help fight sleepiness."
"
Take a breather.,
Use the cool-down time to learn more.,
Arrange to talk with your teenager privately.,
Be reassuring.,
Ask what you can do.,
Make an appointment.,
Encourage alternative behaviors.The people or places your teen is around may be contributing to the drug problem.",How to Confront a Teen Using Drugs1," Your first reaction after learning that your son/daughter, nephew/niece, student, or athlete is using drugs is probably one of anger or frustration. As a parent, relative, teacher, or coach, you have invested a great deal of time and energy into ensuring that this young adult has a bright future. Drugs can be a major roadblock along a path to greatness, so it's understandable to be upset. Just don't show your initial reaction to the teen. Take a moment to calm down first.


Deep breathing can be done anywhere, anytime. Place one hand over your abdomen and the other on your chest. Pull in air through your nose for about 4 counts. Your belly should expand beneath your hand. Hold the breath briefly, then exhale through your mouth for 4 counts. You should feel your belly deflating like a balloon beneath your hand.Repeat the cycle for a few minutes until you feel your body's natural relaxation response kick in.;
, Before you approach your teen with your concerns, it's a smart idea to do a bit of research. A quick Google search will uncover statistics about teen drug use, the latest research, and even suggestions for supporting teens with addictions.Learning more about teen drug use before the confrontation can help you figure out how big of a problem your teen has and how to help him get help.
Be sure to use authoritative sites like the National Institute on Drug Abuse for Teens. This website has a resource page specifically for parents., Let your teen know that you want to talk to him or her and decide together on a good time when this can happen without interruptions. It may be helpful to take your teen somewhere out of the norm, such as a public park or an ice cream parlor, so that you are both out of your everyday environments.


Talking in public may help you place limitations on the discussion, preventing screaming, slamming doors, or making a scene.
Start the discussion by sharing what you know. Stick to the facts. Then, follow up by showing your concern. Your teen may be defensive at first and deny the problem. Clarify that you know about the drug use and simply want to open up the floor for a discussion.
You might say something like ""I love you deeply. I found drugs in your bedroom, and I am disappointed because I have been very clear that using drugs is not acceptable in our family. Drugs can lead to serious consequences. But, I am not here to punish you. I want you to work with me to help you stop using.""

, Encourage your teen to talk to you honestly, and avoid saddling him or her with guilt. Remind your teen about his or her positive traits and demonstrate confidence that you believe he or she can stop using and get back on track.For example, your reassurance might sound like ""Tim, you are a smart and talented young man. Your father and I have always appreciated all the hard work you put into school and your extracurriculars. I know that person is still in there somewhere.""
You might get your teen to open up more by sharing some of your thoughts about why he or she may be doing it (e.g. peer pressure, emotional numbing due to a loss, etc.).

, Let your teen know that you are willing to do whatever it takes to help him or her stop using drugs. See if your teen has any ideas of things that you can do to assist him or her. Actively listen to what your teen says and make a plan to take action.


Teens may use drugs to act out, get attention, or to help them cope with an unstable or high-pressured home life. See if you can meet your teen's needs in a way so that the drug use becomes irrelevant.
For example, if your teen is abusing prescription drugs because she is trying to improve concentration or performance in class, you might try to take some of the pressure away concerning her academic performance. You could suggest that she reduce some of her responsibilities or find a hobby that helps her let off steam.

, Your teen can be feeling a range of emotions associated with his drug use. Find a local mental health therapist or psychologist who specializes in teen drug use. This professional can help your teen process what he or she is going through, figure out the stimulus for the behavior, and develop healthier coping methods.


Don't assume you have the power or skill to help your teen on your own. Your teen needs to see a trained professional in order to truly stop using drugs and address the underlying issue that is stimulating this behavior.If you notice any of the following signs, your teen needs to see a professional right away:Losing interest in activities he/she used to enjoy
Lying about where he/she has been or with whom
Noticing blood shot eyes, dilated pupils, and using eye drops to hide the signs
Isolating him/herself from friends or loved ones
Acting irritable and getting angry easily
Skipping school; having failing grades; or experiencing behavioral issues at school
Noticing the disappearance of money, valuable items or prescriptions



, Talk with your teen about positive activities or hobbies he or she can get involved with that will help boost self-confidence and keep your teen away from undesirable crowds.


Your teen may like the idea of joining a club at school, participating in sports, volunteering or getting a small job.
Also, be sure that you are spending quality time with your child alone and as a family. Feeling accepted within your household can help drug use seem less desirable.

Recognize the benefits of an intervention.,
Decide if an intervention is necessary.,
Make a plan.,
Prepare individual statements.,
Hold the meeting.,
Stand firm.",How to Confront a Teen Using Drugs2," An intervention can be either formal or informal. Regardless of the structure, the ultimate goal is to break through to someone with a drug problem, and help them notice the problems she is experiencing due to her drug use. Friends and family attend in order to provide information to the teen and offer their support and encourage him or her to get professional help.An intervention can be done alone with just family and friends. However, an addiction specialist or other mental health provider can offer both experience and guidance in planning and executing an intervention. The most successful interventions are facilitated by a professional.

, As an adult who cares for the teen, you want to see him or her get professional help. Drug addiction can be disastrous to a user's life and completely overshadow hopes and dreams for the future. Luckily, a drug intervention can help. Most addicts who undergo an intervention do eventually go into treatment.An intervention may be a necessary step if the teen continues to deny or lie about drug use despite obvious signs of an addiction problem.
It also may be helpful if the teen is unaware of how his or her negative behavior is affecting others.

, Since confronting your teen about a drug problem can be highly emotional, there needs to be a plan in place to guide the course of the intervention. First, family members will go over the extent of the drug problem and collect information about addiction and treatment programs. Then, with the help of the professional, you will set a desired outcome and decide who should participate.Usual attendees to an intervention are parents, grandparents, siblings, friends, teachers, or coaches. All of these should be individuals with whom the teen has a close relationship, and people who are concerned about her welfare.

, Once the plan and group is in place, everyone needs to develop a short script on what they will say. A professional interventionist will guide you all on what and what not to say. In general, each person will take turns discussing how the teen's drug us has affected him or her (e.g. relationship strain or financial/legal troubles). Each individual will also share their love and concern as well as the hope that the teen can get better with treatment.As a rule of thumb, attendees should keep the focus of their statement on the facts. Then, follow up with their own emotional response. Refrain from attacking the teen or bringing up issues unrelated to the drug us.
For example, a parent might say ""I am really concerned about your drug use. You had an accident in the car that totaled it and could have cost you your life. I can't sleep at night, worried if the next time this happens I will lose my daughter.""

, On the scheduled day of the intervention, all the loved ones will meet with the teen--he or she shouldn't know the purpose of the meeting beforehand. With the guidance of the mental health provider, each person will take turns sharing their prepared statement and presenting any consequences that will occur if the teen does not cooperate with treatment.During the intervention meeting, the attendees will also explain the proposed plan for help, such as enrolling in a drug treatment program.

, Family members and friends will have to follow through on consequences set forth during the meeting if the teen does not cooperate with treatment.


Consequences set forth during the intervention may include losing access to a vehicle or cutting off allowance. If the teen does not agree to getting needed treatment, you must follow through with these consequences, no matter how hard it is.
The point is not to punish the teen, but to show him or her that the drug problem is unacceptable and that you are serious about getting him/her professional treatment.

Don't think teen drug use is just ""experimentation"".,
Check your environment.,
Stay engaged with the school and your teen's friends.,
Take note of the warning signs for mental illness.",How to Confront a Teen Using Drugs3," Parents may dismiss the early signs of drug use by labeling their teen's behavior as ""experimenting"". Unfortunately, even casual drug use can result in addiction. Early intervention is critical.Many parents hesitate to confront their teens because they, too, went through similar experiences.Even if you did the same thing in your youth without any negative effects, that does not mean the same will be true for your son or daughter.

, You need to conduct a thorough examination of your home environment to ensure that you are not reinforcing drug-taking behavior.Parents may occasionally use alcohol, but say that it is off-limits to the children. In addition, many parents become dependent on prescription pills themselves, which can increase the odds of your children becoming addicted.If there are two parents in the home, you need to carefully assess and discuss how readily available drugs and alcohol are in your home. It's highly possible that your tendency to turn to drugs may be influencing your teen.

, When parents are disconnected with their teenagers lives, they miss an opportunity to receive help and support. If you are not knowledgeable about your teen's behavior at school, you are losing a chance to intervene with problem behaviors.Reach out to your teen's teachers and guidance counselors so that they know you and are aware of your concerns.
The same goes for who your kid is hanging out with. Try to meet and get on speaking terms with the parents of your son or daughter's friends so that you are kept in the loop.

, Comorbidity, or coexistence, of an addiction and a mental disorder are very common in adults and teens. Many parents may overlook the signs of psychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders that may be affecting teens. Such disorders can result in your teen self-medicating with drugs to relieve emotional pain.Mental illnesses all have a very distinctive set of signs and symptoms. However, there are some signs that overlap among disorders. Below are some of the warning signs of mental illness:Worrying excessively
Seeing changes in eating habits--eating too much or too little
Seeing changes in sleeping habits--sleeping too much or too little
Experiencing a range of physical complaints (e.g. headaches, stomach aches, etc.)
Feeling angry or irritable often
Having problems concentrating or focusing
Having thoughts of hurting oneself

Prepare for withdrawal symptoms.,
Go into a detox program.,
Wait.",How to Clean Your System of Cocaine1," If you need to get your system clear of cocaine, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least 4-8 hours afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to 4 days even after a single use.However, habitual users can show up positive on a drug test for up to a month.The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean.
, This is your body rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days.The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms.

, If you’ve been using cocaine regularly, you will probably experience symptoms of withdrawal when you remove it from your life. Tell yourself ahead of time that you will get through it, and prepare yourself mentally to experience any of the following:Severe cravings
Nausea and vomiting
Paranoia, depression, or anxiety
Mood swings or irritability
Itching or a feeling that something is crawling on your skin
Insomnia, sleeping too much, or vivid and distressing dreams
Fatigue and exhaustion

, If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, you may need to go through medically-supervised detoxification. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional can help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you.Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from 3 days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days.
Outpatient detox can cost you between $1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to $20,000.

, There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you may just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors:How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave.
How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body.
What was mixed with the cocaine, i.e. how pure it was: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body.
If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer.
How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have liver or kidney problems, your body won’t clear cocaine as effectively as in a healthy person.
Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer in heavier individuals.

This can help to flush the metabolites of cocaine out of your system more quickly. The effect of this is temporary, so you have to stay very well hydrated for the amount of time cocaine would be in your system., If you’re generally healthy and active, your body may clear cocaine faster than someone overweight or sedentary. Be active and exercise daily while trying to clear your system of cocaine.Do some aerobic exercises to get your blood pumping, like swimming, running, biking, or playing a sport., Include fresh fruits and vegetables in every meal while you’re detoxing. Eating healthy will help your metabolism, and may possibly aid in excreting cocaine and its metabolites more quickly., Abstain from alcohol while your body is getting rid of cocaine. Just like how it takes longer to clear cocaine if you were drinking simultaneously, drinking alcohol after the fact may also slow the elimination process., Zinc is sometimes considered a mineral that will help your body cleanse itself, though whether it works to clear cocaine from your system is not scientifically proven.Check with your doctor about whether it’s safe for you to take a zinc supplement. If so, take one daily at the recommended daily dose (8mg for adult women and 11mg for adult men).Don’t overdo it in an attempt to clear cocaine from your system – toxicity from too much zinc can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches.

, The internet is teeming with pills, powders, and beverages claiming to rid your body of cocaine – whether permanently or just for a few hours so you can pass a drug test.Many of these products claim to be natural, but because they are not supervised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this may or may not be true. In reality, these kits and products have not been proven to remove cocaine from your system, and they can be quite expensive. If you choose to use one, it’s at your own risk.

Know that any product you use can interact with medications you take or medical conditions you have. It’s best not to take untested products from the internet.

A state actor is someone who is acting on behalf of a governmental body.For example, if you are a high school athlete who is drug tested by your school, there is most likely state action. If this is the case, the school must adhere to constitutional principles. On the other hand, if you play club sports as an employee for a private entity who drug tests on their own (i.e., testing is not mandated by law), constitutional principles will not apply.


If constitutional provisions apply, the entity administering the drug testing policy will be bound by the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Under the Fourth Amendment, drug testing is considered a search and therefore it must be reasonable. The most essential factor in determining reasonableness is whether you have an expectation of privacy when it comes to testing. One Supreme Court case has determined that high school athletes have a lowered expectation of privacy and that drug testing policies are a valid condition for participating in high school sports. Under the Fifth Amendment, you must have a meaningful ability to challenge and appeal drug testing results. The right to go to school and participate in sports has been determined to be a property right that triggers these requirements.
If constitutional provisions do not apply, most of the issues will surround your contract rights (and any breach caused by the drug testing) and consent. This is often the case with professional sports.;
, If you are an athlete employed in the private sector (i.e., the Constitution does not apply), you must determine whether you are part of a union or not. Most professional athletes are a part of a union. Unionized athletes are generally more protected than their non-unionized counterparts. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), with respect to unionized employees, has held: (1) the institution of a drug testing policy for current employees is a ""material change"" in working conditions that must be collectively bargained for; and (2) pre-employment drug testing does not.


This means pre-employment drug testing policies can usually take any form the employer sees fit, but post-employment drug testing policies must be bargained for. When a drug testing policy is bargained for, your employee union will try to make compromises restricting the time and manner in which testing can occur.If you want to challenge a drug testing policy as a union athlete, talk with union leadership. In general, you will be able to file a complaint with the NLRB, file a grievance according to the policies set forth in your collective bargaining agreement, or you can seek an injunction in court., If you are not part of a union, the pre-employment - post-employment distinction becomes less relevant. In these cases, you will most likely be subject to any testing the employer sees fit. However, you might be able to challenge a policy on contractual grounds (e.g., your contract states you will not be tested and you were) or consent grounds (e.g., you did not consent to drug testing when it was required).

, If federal law requires drug testing, no state law can say anything to the contrary. However, state law may bar certain employers from engaging in drug testing, even where federal and constitutional law would allow it. This is particularly true in private sector jobs where federal law does not legislate as much. In California, for example, pre-employment drug testing requires a showing of ""reasonableness"" and post-employment drug testing requires a ""compelling interest.""Therefore, if you are an athlete employed in a private, non-unionized role, state law may protect your rights. If you think you have been drug tested inappropriately, check with your state laws to learn more.

, If you sign, then it will be harder to challenge the drug testing policy. You can consent to any search, and signing a consent form might prohibit you from claiming that the drug testing policy is an unconstitutional search.If your child is a school athlete who has already signed the consent form, you can have him or her revoke the consent.
Realize that you or your child might not be able to participate in athletics as you challenge the drug testing policy.

, Your lawyer will want to see the details of the drug testing policy. For this reason, you should hold onto a copy of the policy.


If you didn’t receive a copy, then you should ask the appropriate person for a copy.

, Immediately after refusing to sign the consent form, you should contact a lawyer to discuss challenging the drug testing policy. You will want to bring the legal challenge as soon as possible, so you shouldn’t delay in finding a lawyer.


You should reach out to civil liberties organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU has brought challenges to school drug testing policies in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.In addition, the ACLU may be able to help you if you are a private employee working as a club sport participant.
You can reach your local ACLU affiliate by searching the map at https://www.aclu.org/about/affiliates?redirect=affiliates. Click on your state.
If the ACLU cannot help you, then they can direct you to a lawyer who might be able to represent you. If you are part of a union, discuss legal representation with your union leaders.

, In order to successfully challenge the drug testing policy, you will need to argue that it is unconstitutional or in some other way against the law. Unfortunately, you can’t learn the details of the law on your own, so you will need to hire a lawyer to bring the lawsuit.


The ACLU represents clients free of charge.You shouldn’t hesitate to contact them and ask if they will represent you.
If the ACLU cannot represent you, then you might be able to get a law firm to represent you pro bono. Sometimes law firms will provide free legal services to handle interesting legal issues. Your local chapter of the ACLU might know of firms willing to represent you for free.

, Your lawyer will file a lawsuit challenging the athletic drug testing policy. Your lawyer will file a petition and probably also file a motion for a preliminary injunction. Your lawyer should draft these documents.


An injunction is a court order directing the employer (employer throughout also refers to schools) to stop doing something. In the context of your lawsuit, your lawyer will seek an injunction stopping the employer from enforcing its drug testing policy.An injunction is only a temporary remedy. It is possible to get an injunction but then lose the trial.

, Your lawyer will need to give the employer notice that a lawsuit has been filed challenging its athletic drug testing policy. The employer will then have a certain amount of time (usually 30 days) to respond.


Your lawyer will serve the notice on the defendant using a court-approved method. Generally, your attorney can send the employer notice by hiring a private process server or having someone 18 or older who is not part of the lawsuit make service.
In some courts, you can also mail the employer a copy of the notice certified mail, return receipt requested.
You typically cannot personally deliver a copy of the notice., The employer will respond to your lawsuit by arguing that the drug testing policy is legal. It will file either an answer or a motion to dismiss.Your lawyers will receive a copy of any documents the employer files.


Your employer will probably argue that its athletic drug testing policy is legal. It will argue that your state’s supreme court has not outlawed athletic drug testing under your particular circumstances.

, The court will hold a hearing on your motion for a preliminary injunction.After deciding whether to grant an injunction, the court will hold a full trial on the legality of the employer's athletic drug testing policy. Generally, you won’t have to do anything during the hearing or any trial. Nevertheless, you should talk to your lawyer about what your role will be during the litigation.


Your child should not have to testify. You aren’t suing for emotional distress, pain or suffering, or other kinds of damages. For this reason, you or your child will probably not testify.
Although you won’t do much during the court case, you should try to stay engaged. Have regular meetings with your lawyer and ask questions. Read the documents filed in the case so that you will have some idea of what the arguments are.

, At a hearing, your lawyer will argue that the judge should give you a preliminary injunction. Your lawyer will argue the following:That you will be “irreparably harmed” without the injunction. This should be fairly easy to show. Without the injunction, you cannot play sports, and a trial will not be decided before the end of the season.
That you will likely win the lawsuit because the law is unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. Here, your lawyer will have to argue the legal issue: that the drug testing policy is against the law. The judge will have to believe that you are likely right before he or she will give you a preliminary injunction.
That the balance of hardships tips in your favor. You also need to argue that if you don’t win an injunction then you will be burdened more than the employer would be burdened if you won the injunction.

, The judge will first have to decide whether to grant a preliminary injunction. After deciding that issue, you will then prepare for a trial on the merits of whether the athletic drug testing policy is against the law.


If you get an injunction, then you have not won the lawsuit. However, the employer will be temporarily ordered not to enforce its athletic drug testing policy. Typically, this means you should be able to participate in athletics since no drug testing can take place.
Regardless of whether the judge grants the preliminary injunction, you will have a full trial on the issues. If you win at trial, then a preliminary injunction can be made permanent.
If you lose at trial, then any preliminary injunction will be dissolved."

Learn to dip or chew.,
Pick your brand.,
Choose your spitter.,
Decide what kind of dipper you are.,
Learn how to multitask.,
Learn to drink with it.,
Learn more multitasking"" there is so much more you can do with a lip in.,
Use your dip at the appropriate times.,
Keep your mouth clean.",How to Be a Dipper," This page is for those who already learned this step and would wish to make dipping apart of their every day lives. If you don't know how to dip or chew there are a few pages on this site (How to dip tobacco) and many videos on youtube also used to teach how the product is used.;
, While you first start dipping you will be tempted to try new brands of dip but, like cigarette smokers you will be drawn to mainly one throughout your dipping and spitting career. Mine personally is Grizzly or Kodiak wintergreen. The type of dip you choose depends on what kind of person you are. If you like a good nicotine hit, Grizzly, Kodiak or Copenhagen will be the perfect fir for you, if your a bit on the broke side Longhorn and Kayak are offered for a very cheap price. If you want something to just relax and take the edge of the day, Skoal is the ultimate favorite. All and all, it is up to you.

, Despite the fact that dippers don't smell like an ashtray nor have them scattered around the house. We are cursed with the unused ""Spitter."" Spitters can be anything including water bottles, milk jugs, soda cans, coffee cans and even the ground we stand on outdoors. Use soda cans or styrofoam coffee cups with extreme caution for these are more prone to some nasty leaks and spills. Plastic soda and water bottles are the best choice because you have the option to put a cap on the spitter when you're not using it (no spills). Be sure to use bottles whose drinks are not the same color as dip spit (iced tea, coke, Pepsi etc.) which will prevent a very displeasing mix up. Coffee cans work well because of the wide target and potion to seal it off. But, if you want a less disgusting and non-spilling spitter, try a MUDJUG, a portable spittoon that does not spill (even when you turn it up side down)to order one visit their site, MUDJUG.com they have all sorts of designs and offers.

, People chew and dip for a majority of reasons. If you like an occasional chew here and there while at work or just in your down time then you might not want that nasty water bottle on your car floor for your friends to see. If you chew or dip because you can't smoke in your workplace, be sure to monitor your use on each product, the high nicotine content and effect of the stomach that chew has does not mix with the head rush of a cigarette and will get you sick. Each dipper has a set of customs so my advice is to fit your dipping in your life without disturbing it or the others around you.

, The best advantage of dip is that you can do so much during the day with both of your hands free and still get your nicotine hit. This is a must if you want to be a ""professional"" dipper. While working on a task ""let's say cutting wood"" (a very manly and very fun dipping activity), put your pinch in and split a log, spit on the ground while repositioning the other and repeat. Try to figure out a pattern some are more complex than others. If you are plowing snow, you may have to prop a spitter in a cup holder for when you are in the truck and then have to resort to spitting on the ground when scooping sand. You may have to be creative and some may backfire on you the first few tries.

, This is another key essential. The best technique is to suck your ""dip lip"" in as tight as possible and proceed to drink you beer, coffee or soda. Make sure the beverage flows right down your tongue and straight down your throat without touching the dip. Be sure to practice as you may swallow the juice during this (and get sick) or the dip and drink will get mixed resulting in a strange after taste (especially if it is Grizzly Wintergreen and Orange Juice...EW!)

, Some people can sleep with a pinch in and others who can eat with one. The more you know how to multitask the more fun dipping will be.

, Popping a dip in during your Great Aunt Helen's funeral will get you many glares and stares. So will carrying your spit bottle along with you in the Mall Complex while going bra shopping with your teenage daughter. And the women at your wife's baby shower will be really disgusted. Like smoking, there is a time and place for dipping. It may be incredible awkward to have a dip while all your friends are smokers. The best advice I can say is use your discretion. The best part about smokeless tobacco is that it is allot easier to hide so if you do find yourself in one of these positions just use a solid colored non see through spitter and pretend it is a drink or keep it carefully hidden and spit when no one is looking.

, The warning labels will tell you why. Just because dipping causes irritation to the mouth, doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. The most important of all steps is to brush your teeth three times a day. If your lip gets a white patch or feels a bit scaly, use the other side of your mouth until the side you usually use heals up. Mouth wash is also a good thing to have if you dip straight or natural flavors. One of the big reasons why smokeless tobacco users get these gum conditions is that they don't take care of their teeth. just brush and floss and try to avoid sugary snacks between dips (you don't want to add more irritation to your mouth).

Disassemble your device.,
Run warm water through the tank.,
Pull paper towel through the tank.,
Clean other pieces individually.,
Air dry for ten minutes.",How to Clean a Vape Tank1," Remove the mouthpiece and battery portions of your vaporizer. Take off the top and bottom of the tank and discard any remaining e-juice. Continue to take apart the vape tank and the pieces attached to it, taking care to remember where each piece goes.Take the tank assembly apart as much as possible so you’ll be able to clean each piece individually.
Draw a diagram if you think it may be helpful during reassembly.
Note that different devices will have different specific assemblies.;
, Hold the tank itself under a faucet running warm water for 20 seconds or so. Adjust the water to be as warm as possible without being too hot to touch. This will help rinse away residual e-juice.Use a faucet that provides a moderately powerful stream.
If you clean your tank regularly and prevent e-juice from forming deposits within the tank, warm water will usually be enough to clean your tank.

, Twist a small sheet of paper towel or small microfiber cloth at the corner and fit it into one end of the tank. Twist the material and pull it back and forth through the tank to wipe residual water away., Hold the pieces you've removed from the vape tank in a bowl of warm water. This will help you keep track of each piece, and a short soak will assist in cleaning.Use a small microfiber cloth or clean toothbrush to wash each part of your tank assembly, especially those that have fine features such as threading.

, No matter how well you attempt to dry the tank and other components, a bit of water is likely to remain. For this reason, allow everything to dry for at least ten minutes before reassembling and refilling.Simply allow the tank and other pieces to air dry. Do not dry your tank with heat or direct sunlight, as these risk weakening or damaging some pieces.

"
"
Wipe with high-proof alcohol.,
Use a jewelry cleaning machine to remove stubborn deposits.,
Avoid soaking or boiling.",How to Clean a Vape Tank2," High-proof, unflavored liquor such as vodka is the ideal solvent to help break down persistent e-juice deposits. Dampen a microfiber cloth or paper towel with the alcohol and rub the dirtied areas until the e-juice is removed. Wipe and rinse with warm water.


While isopropyl rubbing alcohol (90%) also works well, it can be toxic if you don’t rinse and dry the tank extremely well after cleaning.Soap and other types of detergents are unnecessary when cleaning a vape tank and may leave behind unwanted residue.

, Ultrasonic jewelry cleaning machines are designed to remove residue from small, fragile items and are perfect for cleaning your vape tank. There are also similar devices designed specifically for cleaning vape equipment. If you have access to one of these machines, fill it with warm distilled water, vodka, or rubbing alcohol and use it according to the included directions.You can purchase these machines from many vaping stores or online. You may also be able to take your equipment to a vaping store and have them clean your device.
Do not allow parts that have plastic, rubber, or vinyl components to sit in alcohol for too long.
Usually, one cycle in a cleaning machine will be sufficient to clean your tank, etc.
Be sure to fully rinse and dry your tank after cleaning.

, Overnight soaking in water or alcohol is not recommended, as it may degrade your equipment. Similarly, boiling your tank may cause damage as well. While these methods may work with some pieces, they are unnecessarily risky."
"
Clean your vape tank weekly.,
Wash the tank between flavors.,
Replace parts when necessary.",How to Clean a Vape Tank3," Weekly cleanings are important to prevent damage or unnecessary wear of your device. Consistent cleaning will also prevent older e-juice from collecting in your vape tank, which can negatively affect the quality of your vaping experience., Cleaning is important between different types and flavors of e-juice. If you don’t clean the tank fully when you switch to a new flavor, you may experience “flavor ghosting,” or the taste of a previous flavor mixed into a new flavor.Even if your tank appears empty, e-juice from the previous load has formed a layer on the walls of the tank and is still contained in the wick and coil of your device. In order to remove the flavor, the tank must be cleaned.

, Many vaping setups house the wick and heating coil that are used to produce vapor near or within the vape tank. Accordingly, you’ll usually be cleaning these parts when you’re cleaning your tank. When you do so, make sure to check them for wear. The coil in particular should be changed regularly.If your tank includes o-rings, check them for damage or wear each time you clean the tank. Change the o-rings whenever you're uncertain about their condition.
If your vapor tastes burnt, even after a fresh cleaning, it’s likely time to replace the coil.
Other signs that the coil or another piece may need to be replaced include less vapor coming through your device, any leaks, or an unsatisfactory vape.

Take steps to quit.",How to Choose the Right Moist Snuff for You," Smokeless tobacco products come in a variety of different cuts, which each have slightly different qualities. The main cuts are long cut and fine cut. Snuff is a name given to finely ground tobacco, which you can buy in pouches, or loose. These are the most common types of dip, which you have to spit out when you are done.


Pouches make it easier to hold the tobacco in your mouth, as well as putting it in and taking it out.
If you use pouches you are also less likely to swallow any of the tobacco, which is not advisable.
If you are not using a pouch, long cuts are easier to manoeuvre and control in your mouth than fine cuts.;
, You can buy snuff in a variety of flavours, ranging from fruit and mint flavours, to the more “natural” tobacco flavours. Some of the fruit flavours include apple, berry, citrus, peach and grape.You can try a variety of different fruit flavours to find the one that you like the most. If you don’t like the sweeter fruity flavours, you can go for a mint or “natural” flavour.


There are a number of minty flavours available, such as regular mint, spearmint, and menthol flavours.
The “natural” flavours will have a more authentic tobacco taste, but will not be for everyone.

, There are a number of major brands in the US, who sell a variety of different flavours and cuts of moist snuff. Some of the most popular brands include Copenhagen, Skoal, Timberwolf, and Husky. The different products available vary from the premium more expensive snuffs of Copenhagen, to the cheaper brands like Husky.


You can read user reviews and recommendations on the different brands and flavours available online., If you enjoy the physical sensation of dipping, but don’t want to risk nicotine addiction and the health risks associated with dipping and smokeless tobacco, there are some alternatives. These products are sometimes known as “fake dip” or “fake tobacco.” There is an extensive list of these products online.Some of these non-nicotine alternatives are coffee flavoured.


Some non-nicotine and non-tobacco chews and dips are made from FDA approved ingredients.
Because of the contents of these products, it is not necessary to spit, and you can swallow it.Switching to “fake dip” can be an excellent way to quit the tobacco and nicotine version., Smokeless tobacco products contain at least three elements which are known carcinogenic agents: N-nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polonium 210.The tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs)are present in extremely high levels in many snuff products, both moist and dry. These TSNAs are thought to present the highest carcinogenic risk associated with dip and snuff.As dipping has become more popular, scientists have begun to conduct more detailed research into the contents and carcinogenic effects of smokeless tobacco.
Scientists have identified the presence of at least 23 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in popular snuff brands.
9 of the PAHs detected so far are carcinogens., Moist snuff can lead to a number of very serious health problems, including oral cancers, cardiovascular diseases and gingival diseases. Scientists and researchers have studied these effects and recommended that snuff be considered a public health problem in the same way that smoking is.As well as the risk of disease, dipping can lead to discoloured teeth, receding gums, chronic oral sores, and bad breath.The nicotine raises your blood pressure and cholesterol level, and this can increase your risk of a heart attack., Smokeless tobacco products, such as moist snuff, contain very high amounts of nicotine. Research has shown that two of the most popular snuff brands are 3.3% and 3.2% nicotine. This is considerably higher than the equivalent in cigarettes, which typically have between 1.5% and 2.5% nicotine.Snuff products also deliver this nicotine very rapidly, and can very easily lead to nicotine dependency.Holding an average sized dip in your mouth for half an hour will deliver as much nicotine as chain-smoking three cigarettes.

, If you are regularly dipping, it is highly likely than you will develop a level of addiction or dependency, due to high levels of nicotine in snuff. It’s important to think about the different indicators that help to identify the level of your addiction. Did you feel dizzy or sick when you first began dipping, but don’t now? Do you dip more often, and in a variety of settings? Have you switched to stronger snuff with higher nicotine content?


Do you regularly swallow the juice from the tobacco?
Do you ever sleep with dip in your mouth?
Do you have strong cravings when you go without dip?
Do you find it hard to go for more than a few hours without dipping?

, If you decide that you want to quit dipping, and break free of your addiction, that are a number organisations that can help you.Once you decide to quit, pick a day and get emotionally ready for it. You can try to quit quickly cold turkey, or you could set a date a little in the future and try to gradually cut down in advance of your final quitting date.



Try to be excited about it rather than anxious. It’ll be tough to quit, but the long-term benefits far out way the short-term pains.
You will have to make a clear plan, and be prepared for the withdrawal symptoms if your attempt to quit is to be successful.

Do some research on the substance.,
Know about the five levels of psychedelic experience.,
Ensure that the user's schedule is completely empty.,
Create a proper set and setting.,
Consider filming the experience.,
Choose whether you want to actively interact with the user or stay uninvolved.,
Have a supply of water nearby and encourage the user to keep hydrated.,
Anticipate ""the munchies"" by preparing food.,
Intervene if the user feels a bad trip coming on.,
Discuss the experience.,
Monitor the aftereffects.,
Allow the user to rest.",How to Be a Trip Sitter," Although trip sitters can be used with any sort of mind-altering substance, they are usually assigned when dealing with hallucinogens, which are classified into three groups: psychedelics, deliriants, and dissociatives. Educate both yourself and the user on the specific substance to know what the effects will be and the duration.


Psychedelics, such as LSD, peyote, and psilocybin mushrooms, alter cognition and perception. Common effects include visual and auditory hallucinations, sensory changes, and feelings of happiness, euphoria, and relaxation.Deliriants, such as atropine, induce a state of delirium, characterized by vivid hallucinations, confusion, and stupor (a state of non-responsiveness).Dissociatives, such as ketamine, PCP, and DXM, cause the user to go into a state of dissociation (meaning one becomes detached from reality). Distortions in sight and sound are also present.Unwanted adverse effects common in all drug classes include nausea, anxiety, paranoia, fatigue, and irregularities in heart rate.;
, In Timothy Leary's book entitled, The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, there are five levels that depend on the substance and dosage strength.Level 1: user feels relaxed and subtle visual enhancements can be observed, as well as music having a richer sound. Light doses of magic mushrooms and common doses of cannabis can bring on this level.

Level 2: colours and visuals appear brighter and closed-eye hallucinations may appear as geometric 2-D patterns. Thought processes may be abstract and the user's train of thought may not be easily followed. This level is caused by strong doses of cannabis, light doses of LSD, and light to common doses of mushrooms.

Level 3: open-eyed visuals become very obvious, with patterns and warped textures. Closing one's eyes brings on extremely vivid multidimensional geometric patterns. Time begins to become noticeably distorted and movement can be difficult. Brought on by common doses of LSD, mushrooms, and very high doses of cannabis.

Level 4: Strong hallucinations as objects may morph into one another. Personification of objects may be observed, such as things speaking to the user. Ego death may occur, resulting in a loss of sense of identity. Time is no longer apparent. Strong synesthesia. Achieved with strong doses of LSD, mushrooms, and mescaline.

Level 5: high-intensity experience; total disconnection with reality to the extent that attempting to explain the effects would be near impossible. Senses no longer function normally. The ego is completely gone. Extreme euphoria and enlightenment may occur and the user may feel a sense of complete oneness. Consuming salvia or extremely high doses of mushrooms or LSD brings on this level.

, Depending on the substance and dosage, the high may last for up to 8 hours. Aim for a weekend or a day when the user won't be bothered by unexpected phone calls or guests.


Because some physiologic effects may still occur even after the high is gone, consider a date when the user doesn't have any plans or deadlines the next day. You wouldn't want the user to get high on Sunday, only to skip the very important meeting on Monday due to fatigue.

, Keeping the user relaxed and comfortable will minimize the possibility of a bad trip.


""Set"" refers to the mindset of the user, such as thoughts, moods, and expectations of the experience. Because these substances alter how the user thinks and views the world, it's important for the user to have a relaxed state of mind prior to consumption. Address any concerns the user may have to prevent the possibility of a bad trip.
""Setting"" is the physical and social environment surrounding the user. Negative experiences and feelings are less likely to occur if the user is located in an open, familiar, and relaxing environment, such as a bedroom. Do whatever it takes to make the room as comfortable as possible: adjust the lighting, change the temperature, or put on some music.

, Psychedelic drugs have the potential to widen the user's sense of self-awareness with the world and consciousness. Because psychedelic experiences are largely influenced on the drug, dosage, tolerance level, and personal expectations, trips can be quite vivid and extremely difficult to describe. Filming the trip allows both you and the user to easily discuss and reflect on the experience.

, In some situations such as during psychedelic therapy, the user may engage in guided meditation with the sitter. In other cases, the mere presence of another person is enough to keep the user calm.

, A common side effect is dry mouth.

, Many drugs, like cannabis, cause an increase in appetite and users often experience greater enjoyment of food. Savoury foods like pizza, sandwiches, and chicken wings are sure to enhance the experience.

, Overwhelming fear, anxiety, and depression are signs of an unpleasant experience.


Calm the user by reminding them that this experience was brought on by a mind-altering substance and it'll fade away in a matter of hours (or minutes).
Because a person's thoughts can influence the nature of the experience, reassure the user that everything will be okay. Try to change their mood by telling them that they took this substance to have a good time and nothing bad will physically happen to them.
Move the user to another relaxing location. If the weather is nice and sunny, go for a walk. A change of scenery should provide more reassurance.
Know what situations you can and can't handle and consider calling for professional medical assistance if you need to. Hospitals provide a safe environment and doctors are able to administer sedatives to help the user calm down and become less agitated.

, If it was being filmed, play back the recording.


When practicing psychedelic therapy, integrate the experience into your notes and make connections as to how the experience changed the user's thoughts and cognition.

, Some users may still feel a bit anxious and paranoid after the drug's peak has passed. Dry mouth is a common aftereffect, so continue hydration.

, Fatigue and tiredness is common after a trip (for instance, cannabis indica has the potential to induce sleepiness after the initial high). Sleep will also bring the user back to sobriety.

Examine an individual’s physical appearance.,
Look carefully at an individual’s eyes.,
Notice how an individual smells.,
Note any sinus changes.,
Watch for needle (track) marks on an individual’s body, particularly their arms.,
Look for unusual body issues.",How to Detect Drug Use1," A lack of interest in clothing, grooming, and personal hygiene may be a sign they have a drug problem. This is especially true if the person once took pride in their looks and public presentation.Pay special attention to stains on clothing that appear to be caused by vomit, urine, blood, or burns.;
, They will often appear different if someone is intoxicated. Red, bloodshot, glassy, and unfocused eyes are all potential signs of drug use. Specific drugs change a person’s eyes in the following ways:


Alcohol can make eyes appear glassy and unfocused.
Marijuana leads to bloodshot and red eyes.
LSD, ecstasy, cocaine, amphetamines, and methamphetamines cause the pupils to dilate (grow larger).
Opiates such as heroin and narcotic painkillers cause the pupils to constrict (shrink). , Strange or unpleasant odors may be a sign that they are using drugs. Alcohol and drugs can sometimes be detected on a person’s breath, clothing, and even skin. Odors connected to poor hygiene can also be a sign of drug use.


Alcohol lingers on a person’s breath long after their last drink, and can even seep out of their pores the next day.
Marijuana odors can seep into clothing and fabrics. Roaches or half-finished joints generate an especially powerful smoky smell.
Methamphetamines can cause chronic bad breath. Meth labs often smell like sulfur, rotten eggs, and powerful cleaning chemicals.
When smoked, crack has the smell of burning rubber or plastic.
Many stimulants and opiates don’t have strong odors. However, cocaine smells faintly of gasoline or ether, and heroin smells like vinegar. , Unusual or excessive sniffles or frequent nosebleeds could mean that an individual is snorting drugs. Cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy (when crushed), and many other drugs can be snorted up the nose. By snorting drugs, they enter the bloodstream through sensitive nasal membranes, which respond by producing excess protective mucous and sometimes bleed. , Also look for bruising that could demonstrate the injection of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, or meth. Injecting drugs is very dangerous because unclean needles carry a risk of infection and transmit diseases including HIV-AIDS.


Repeated injections cause increasingly pronounced marks and scars on the body.
The more an individual injects drugs, the more they must find new places to insert needles, as the previous injection areas suffer vein collapse and scarring.
Someone who covers their skin with excess clothing may be attempting to hide ulcerations, abscesses, infections, scabs, and skin damage. , If someone is shivering when it is warm, sweating when it is cool, or shaking uncontrollably, they may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms. If addicted to drugs, withdrawal symptoms can start in a matter of hours after they last took the drug.


Other signs of withdrawal include watery eyes, sneezing, coughing, headache, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. "
"
Watch for decreases in attention-span, memory, motivation, and/or concentration.,
Note drastic changes in sleeping patterns and energy levels.,
Notice changes in an individual’s values and morals.,
Reflect on changes to an individual’s social life.,
Check for the presence of suspicious items.",How to Detect Drug Use2," Declining performance in school or work is often connected to drug use. Drugs not only decrease mental capacity, they increasingly dominate a user’s thought process. Instead of focusing on issues related to education or employment, a drug user may be constantly thinking about becoming intoxicated, and how to obtain more drugs. , Both insomnia and unusual sleepiness may indicate drug use. Does the individual sometimes seem strangely lethargic and tired? Do they suddenly crash and sleep for long periods of time? Alternately, do they have giddy or manic energy even without sleeping? See-sawing between high and low energy, between periods of excessive and insufficient sleep, should raise the alarm.


Opiate users may exhibit a euphoric wave of energy and then abruptly fall asleep, even while sitting upright.
Alcoholics might be full of energy at night and then sleep well into the morning, exhibiting an aversion to light and sound.
An LSD high can last for up to 12 hours, during which time an individual cannot sleep. But following the high, a user may “crash” and sleep for an entire day.For more information on the relationship between sleep and drugs, see: http://www.drugs.com/medical_encyclopedia.html


, Have they started doing things they previously considered immoral? Have they been lying and skipping school or work? Are they asking to borrow unusual amounts of money? Have property, valuables, and money gone missing? Are they taking risks that put themselves and others in harm’s way? Answering yes to any of these questions may indicate problematic drug use. , Have they become more reclusive, avoiding family and long-time friends? Are they more irritable and distant with loved ones? Has the individual started hanging out with mysterious new friends that they refuse to introduce? Are they taking suspicious phone calls, or constantly texting unknown people? If so, the individual may be using drugs. , Consider looking through the individual’s dresser, desk drawers, or clothing pockets. Suspicious items may include eye drops, mouthwash, “baggies,” cigarette rolling papers, cotton swabs, roach clips, pipes, bongs, needles, pill bottles, incense, or room deodorizers. While some of these are common personal hygiene items, they could also indicate a drug use problem.


Be very careful when infringing on an individual’s privacy. You may anger them greatly and you will be very embarrassed if you are mistaken about their drug use.
Only look through someone’s personal things if you deeply concerned about their wellbeing and willing to face the consequences of doing so.

"
"
Buy a drug detection test when all signs point to drug use, or if you just can’t tell but need your suspicions satisfied.,
Administer the test without prior warning for the most accurate results.,
Notify the individual of the drug test results to arrange any necessary follow-up testing, drug treatment, counseling, or even job termination.",How to Detect Drug Use3," These are readily available at drug stores and online. One website with an extensive inventory of drug detection devices is http://www.origindiagnostics.com/. Do not feel you must purchase devices from this site; it simply provides an overview of what is available on the market.

, Giving an individual warning beforehand could allow them time to alter the test results by staying clean for a period of time, or even by securing clean urine or blood to substitute for their own.

,


Never force someone to take a drug test against their will. Doing so is ethically wrong, and there could be legal repercussions.
Remember that drug tests are not 100% accurate. For example, if you were to terminate an individual’s employment on the basis of a single drug test, legal action could result.

Set goals for yourself.,
Spend time with your loved ones.,
Talk to someone about what’s going on.,
Do something else to feel good.,
Stop before you start.,
Keep your distance.,
Avoid temptation.,
Reflect on your temptations.,
Say no assertively.,
Stay engaged.,
Figure out what makes you happy.",How to Be Drug Free1," Studies suggest that having goals (and people who support those goals) may help you be less likely to use drugs.This is likely because it encourages you to consider what you want out of your future and what you'll do to get yourself there. In contrast, using drugs is all about what feels ""good"" right now, regardless of the impact it makes on your future.If you feel tempted to try drugs, even once, consider what it may do to your goals for the future. How likely are you to be able to achieve your goals if you're dependent on an expensive and/or illegal drug, or in jail or with a criminal record for using it?
Setting goals can also help improve your self-confidence.When you feel confident in yourself and your ability to achieve what you set out to do, you're less likely to want to do drugs.Setting and achieving goals is also crucial to getting off of drugs. This practice shows you that you can achieve what you set out to do, including kick your drug use.;
, Strong relationships with your family and loved ones are a protective factor against drug use. In other words, having a strong relationship with your family and friends will make you less likely to give in to temptation.If you’re feeling pressured or curious about drug use, don’t keep it to yourself. Find someone you know, trust, and respect to talk to about it. Other people can offer you advice and support, which is very important for staying drug free., If you’re consistently being pressured, even bullied, to try drugs, talk to someone in authority, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor.You don’t have to face this pressure on your own. Getting support from others will help you stand strong against drugs.

, If you are tempted to use drugs because you want to feel good, keep your focus off of drugs by doing other things that are enjoyable and fun.For example, take up a hobby, spend more time laughing with friends, play a fun video game, or help others out, to feel better instead. This will help you find new meaning in your life.
Go for a run, get lost in a good novel, talk to family and friends, play a fun video game, or actively try to solve your problem or negative thoughts by seeking counselling.Talk about how you feel with friends or engage in a distracting activity like going out to a movie.

, If you're offered drugs, decline and walk away. If you're afraid of peer pressure, then know in your heart that true friends will respect you if you decide to say no to a drug, and they won't push you into doing something you don't want to do. If they do, then consider finding a new group of friends.

, If you see a family member or friend taking drugs, stay away from them and definitely don't follow in their footsteps. If you can, talk to a trusted adult friend about it; they may offer guidance or social support. A support system can be crucial to a person's success in achieving and maintaining a drug–free lifestyle.Be aware that vulnerability to drug addiction can run in the family, so if you have a family member who is addicted to drugs, know that you may be especially vulnerable and should do that much more to be drug free.If you have friends who actively use drugs, find new friends. Instead, surround yourself with people who do not use drugs and who think being sober is a better way to live.Teens are especially likely to use drugs if their friends do., If there is a certain group of people at school who are known to do drugs, don't hang around them. You can find friends who are interested in more productive behaviors.


If you are at a party and you realize that there are drugs there, simply leave. Peer pressure might make you crack, even if you're certain you'll be able to say no.
Be aware that social influence is very strong, and it has an effect on your temptation to use drugs.Even social media can influence you to be more likely to use drugs.If you notice a lot of photos about drug use on your social media, consider blocking those sources of influence too.

, If you're tempted to try drugs even when you're on your own, such as seeing what it would be like to experiment with your kid brother's Adderall, you can handle that temptation too. Think to yourself, ""Why am I really wanting to try this?"" What are your reasons for wanting to try drugs?If it's because you think everyone else is doing it and you want to connect with your buddies, remind yourself that not everyone is doing drugs. In fact, drug use in general is down among young people.There are plenty of great, healthy ways to connect with your friends, such as taking up a hobby or sport together.
If it's because you're feeling stressed or pressured, recognize that drug use is a common way to handle stress, but it's very unhealthy. There are great ways to handle stress, such as exercise, yoga, and meditation. If you feel really stressed out, talking to a therapist could help too.
Remember that your decision-making skills haven’t fully matured if you’re a teen.Choosing to use drugs is a decision that could haunt you for the rest of your life. Will your 50-year-old self thank you for deciding to try drugs?

, Most likely there will come a time when you will be asked to do drugs. Be firm in your answer and do not hesitate. If you hesitate you leave the door open for peer pressure.


If someone who offers you drugs asks you why you do not want to do them you do not need to give any reasons. Just say that you don’t do drugs. If you provide reasons you leave the door open for further conversation, where the person can then try to persuade you to try the drugs.You may have people try to change your mind by saying things such as ""But everyone's doing it"" or ""Just once won't hurt you."" Remain firm. You can tell the person that in fact, drug use has gone down among young people, so clearly not everyone is doing it, and you won't be either.Or you can say ""Nope, not even once. I don't need that in my life.""

, Keep your mind sharp and actively involved in the world around you. If you stay engaged and busy and active you will not have the time to do drugs. Boredom can lead to drug use, so by never being bored you will be less likely to use drugs.Learn a new language. Pick up a hobby. Teach yourself a musical instrument. Volunteer in your community. You will enrich your life (and boost your resume) and help yourself stay away from drugs.

, Depression and low self-esteem can lead to drug use. If you are experiencing depression, you should seek a counselor to help you work through it. In addition, pursuing things that make you happy and maintain your self-esteem will make you less likely to default to drug use.Make a list of everything that makes you happy. Pick a few that are easily attainable, such as experiences like cooking an inexpensive meal, or going to the movies, and be sure to engage in those activities regularly.

Understand why people use drugs.,
Know your triggers.,
Join a community or family-based recovery support system.,
Try “urge surfing.” Urge surfing is a mindfulness exercise that acknowledges your craving and helps you “ride it out” until it goes away.,
Tell yourself you’ll wait 10 minutes.",How to Be Drug Free2," People become addicted because they are self-medicating. Then they are held within the cycle of addiction because of the withdrawal symptoms from the drug.The way to become drug free is to first confront the physical addiction through going to a clinic where you can participate in a program to help with the withdrawal symptoms, which at times can be life-threatening, and then addressing the emotional issues that lead to the decision to use addicting drugs to mask the emotional pain.People who use drugs are not “bad” or “immoral” people.
People who use drugs often cannot simply “knock it off.” Drug addictions change your brain in ways that make it difficult -- but not impossible -- to quit.

, If you have used drugs before, be cognizant of the triggers that are associated with your using drugs. This could include drug paraphernalia, a group of friends, a certain location, or even a certain song that you used to listen to when you did drugs.If there are certain triggers that you know may cause a problem and lead to drug use, throw them away. Delete that song from your ipod or throw out those rolling papers; if your triggers are permanently gone you will be less likely to use drugs.
You may also need to not go to places you used to go when you used drugs. Staying away may be difficult, but it will help you kick your drug use.

, Support is key not only to staying off of drugs, but to getting off them. If you are struggling to live a drug free life, a support group may be helpful.


To find one, talk to your doctor, counselor or other healthcare provider, check your phone book for a list of local support groups, consult with your religious or secular community groups, or speak with local or national groups who are devoted to helping people get past addictions.

, Imagine you are a surfer riding your craving like a wave until it breaks and becomes soft and small and easy to handle.Urge surfing is more effective than trying to ignore or repress a craving.Remind yourself that this probably is not the first time you have experienced the urge to do drugs. Has that urge passed before? The answer is almost certainly yes. Remind yourself that it will pass this time too. The urge exists, but you do not have to act on it.Notice the thoughts and sensations that you experience during the urge. For example, you might feel a strong feeling that you want to use your drug of choice. You might feel sweaty or itchy, or feel restless. Acknowledge these as existing. Remind yourself that they are just thoughts; they do not truly have power over you.Focus on deep breathing as you surf your urges. Breathe slowly and evenly, in and out. This will help keep your attention on the present moment rather than focusing on your craving.

, If you feel a very strong urge to use drugs, delay by telling yourself you will make yourself wait 10 minutes. Just 10, that’s all. You can do that. When that 10 minutes is up, if the urge is still strong, tell yourself you’ll wait another 10 minutes. Keep delaying until the urge passes. It will, given enough time."

Eat healthy.,
Exercise.,
Avoid having too much caffeine.,
Get enough sleep.,
Relax your body and mind.,
Try meditation.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.",How to Be Drug Free3," The mind and body are intricately related because the mind consists of the complex workings of the brain, a biological organ and part of the body. This means that mental health and bodily health are closely related. Since poor mental health is associated with drug use, and mental and bodily health are related, keeping a healthy body is an important part of being drug free. One way to maintain a healthy body is to eat healthy foods.Eat whole foods such as lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Who knows, you might even develop a passion for cooking that builds your self-esteem and turns into a hobby that helps to keep you drug free. , Working out can release endorphins that make you feel good in a much healthier way than the way that drugs make you feel good. Exercise helps to reduce stress and can even combat minor cases of depression; both stress and depression increase risk for drug use, so it is important to exercise regularly to help to keep drug free. , Too much caffeine can make you jittery and anxious which can contribute to feelings of stress and make you more likely to turn to using (other) drugs to counteract the anxiety that the caffeine produced. , A lack of sleep can contribute to poor mental health such as by causing feelings of fatigue, sadness, and anxiety, all of which may add to your likelihood of using drugs in order to avoid feeling bad., Practice relaxation techniques to help stay mentally and physically healthy. Relaxation techniques reduce the impact of stress on your body by negating negative feelings and negative bodily sensations such as muscle tension.Stress is a common reason that people begin using drugs, so managing your stress will help you stay drug-free.Try visualization. This technique involves forming peaceful and relaxing mental images. For example, picture a calm ocean and try to imagine it with all of your senses; think about how it would smell, how the wind and sun would feel against your skin. Fully immerse yourself in the experience.Try a soothing exercise, such as yoga or tai chi.

, Meditation can be an excellent way to manage stress and focus on breathing and body awareness. Meditate to calm yourself as you confront urges to use alcohol or drugs.People who meditate tend to have greater success rates of staying off drugs in the long run.Find a comfortable and quiet spot to sit for 10-15 minutes.
Focus on your breath, inhaling deeply and steadily.
As thoughts pass through your mind, release them without judgment. Turn your attention back to your breath.

, This technique helps you to figure out the difference between tense and relaxed muscles. It involves slowly tensing then relaxing each muscle group; this will help to delineate the difference between tense and relaxed and take your mind off what is stressing you out.Begin with your toes. Clench them as hard as you can for 5 seconds, and then relax for 5 seconds. Notice the sensation of relaxation. Move up your body from your calves, thighs, buttocks, abs, chest, shoulders, arms, neck, and face."

Seek counseling.,
Consider attending a detox facility.,
Find a sponsor.",How to Be Drug Free4," People who are recovering from an addiction need guidance and treatment. Counseling can offer you the support you need to remain drug free when giving up or recovering from an addiction.Behavioral treatment, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, is very effective in helping people who use drugs manage their urges and stop their drug use.
Family therapy can also be helpful, particularly if your family dysfunction is contributing to your drug use.
Contingency management uses positive reinforcement, such as rewards, for staying off drugs.

, There are benefits and drawbacks to inpatient or outpatient facilities. Inpatient facilities enable close monitoring, remove the potential for drug use, and the detox process is fairly accelerated. However, these can be quite expensive and may limit other activities, such as work. Outpatient treatments cost less and have less of an impact on the individual's life, but may not be as effective due to the potential for access to drugs due to being outside of the facility.This has the advantage of being less disruptive to the patient's life and less expensive. The best setting depends on a variety of factors, including the drug of abuse, the drug user's amount and length of history of abuse, the patient's age, and co-existing medical and/or psychiatric conditions among others. To find a detox center, search here: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/

People with serious drug use problems, a long history of drug use, involvement in criminal activity, or trouble with social functioning due to drugs are often helped by residential treatment at a detox facility., Many peer-based support groups assign sponsors to new members. The sponsor is a recovering addict who will help you through the steps of the recovery program. A good sponsor will:


help you to grow, to become more productive, by your definition.
help you become more autonomous, more loving of yourself, more excited, less sensitive, more free to become the authority for your own living.
not be a crutch or be around you if you fail to make progress.

Learn about the different types of tobacco products.,
Understand the benefits of homegrown tobacco.,
Recognize the risks of homegrown tobacco.",How to Buy Home Grown Tobacco1," Most tobacco products that you buy in the store are processed in some way. Tobacco that is ""homegrown"" may be processed as well. If you are looking for an unprocessed product, you should seek out whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves, which you can buy from an individual who grows the plant at home or from a company.


It is illegal to sell processed tobacco products without a license in the United States, but whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves are not subject to these same regulations.;
, If you are looking for a more natural, higher quality tobacco product, homegrown, unprocessed tobacco might be right for you.


Homegrown, unprocessed tobacco may contain fewer chemicals and additives than commercial tobacco.
Homegrown, unprocessed tobacco may come from heirloom plants, which can produce a higher quality product with a better taste., While there may be certain benefits to using unprocessed tobacco products, you should understand that purchasing homegrown tobacco will not prevent you from developing any of the various diseases that have been linked to smoking. Large tobacco companies do add many chemicals to their products, but tobacco naturally contains compounds that are known carcinogens as well. If you want to be healthy, the best thing you can do is to stop smoking.Unless you buy unprocessed, whole-leaf tobacco, or you buy processed tobacco illegally, which is strongly discouraged, you will have to pay taxes. For this reason, purchasing homegrown tobacco from a legitimate source may not save you any money over purchasing conventional tobacco products from a store."
"
Find a legal source.,
Buy unprocessed tobacco online.,
Consider growing tobacco yourself.",How to Buy Home Grown Tobacco2," You probably don't want to get wrapped up in an illegal operation, so if you are buying anything other than whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves, make sure the person who grew the tobacco has a valid Manufacturer of Tobacco Products permit from the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau.If you are ever in doubt about the legitimacy of a source, contact the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau to check for the existence of a manufacturer's license.
In general, you should avoid tobacco products that are not sold in stores. There are a variety of heirloom and additive-free tobacco products on the market that may offer the benefits you are seeking from homegrown tobacco. You may also be able to find small companies that sell directly to consumers in your local area, but you should check to make sure they are licensed before purchasing from them.
If you have a friend that gets homegrown tobacco, ask him where he gets it, but remember to always verify that the source is legal. You can legally buy whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves from anyone, but you will most likely have to have some kind of a connection to find a source, as these individuals are unlikely to have stores or websites.
Finding a legitimate source will also help protect you against sellers who may be selling tainted products.
Avoid getting ripped off by educating yourself about the different strains of tobacco and the going rate in your area. You can also look online to see what whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves are going for.

, If homegrown tobacco is appealing to you because it is more natural than commercially produced products, you may be able to find the same benefits in whole, unprocessed tobacco leaves that are offered for sale online. You can choose from a wide variety of strains from many online retailers.


If you are not very knowledgeable about tobacco, it may be difficult to tell if a product is high quality or if the price is fair. Before buying, always check online reviews for the retailer and look at other sources to compare prices for the strain that is being offered. Be wary of any retailer whose prices seem unusually high or unusually low.
If you buy whole tobacco leaves, you will have to process them yourself, which involves washing, drying, separating, and shredding the leaves., If you have decided that you definitely want to smoke homegrown tobacco, but you can't find a legal and reliable source, consider growing it yourself. It will take some hard work and dedication, but it will save you a lot of money.In order to grow your own tobacco, you will need a well-equipped indoor growing area, an outdoor garden, and space indoors for drying leaves. You will also have to tend to your plants every day.
Don't sell processed tobacco! You will get into a lot of trouble if you are caught.
There are risks associated with growing tobacco, including the potential for nicotine poisoning if you handle wet tobacco leaves. Make sure you understand how to properly handle the crop before you start growing it."

Chewing tobacco has the same serious health risks as cigarettes.,
Recognize you are at a higher risk for mouth cancer, disease, and infection.,
Get help if you are trying to quit doing chew or want to avoid trying chew.",How to Chew Tobacco," Different forms are used in different ways.Chewing tobacco consists of loose, sweetened tobacco leaves that are sweetened. You put a wad of the tobacco between your cheek and gum and hold it there, sometimes for hours at a time. It's also called chew and chaw.Snuff is finely ground or shredded tobacco leaves. It's available in dry or moist forms and is packaged in tins or tea bag-like pouches. A pinch of snuff is placed between the lower lip and gum or cheek and gum. Dry forms of snuff can be sniffed into the nose. Using snuff is also called dipping.
Plug is chewing tobacco that has been pressed into a brick shape, often with the help of syrup, such as molasses, which also sweetens the tobacco. You cut or bite off a piece of the plug and hold it between your cheek and gum. You spit out the tobacco juices.
Twist is flavored chewing tobacco that has been braided and twisted into rope-like strands. You hold it between your cheek and gum and spit out the tobacco juices.
Snus (the ""u"" is pronounced like the ""e"" in ""news"") smokeless, spit-less tobacco product. It comes in either a pouch or as a moist loose form that you stick between your upper lip and gum. You leave it in your mouth for about a half-hour or more without having to spit, then discard it.
Dissolvable tobacco are pieces of compressed powdered tobacco, similar to small hard candies. They dissolve in your mouth, requiring no spitting. They're sometimes called tobacco lozenges, but they're not the same as the nicotine lozenges used to help you quit smoking.;
, There are many brands of chewing tobacco on the market today, which range in price and flavor. Some of the most popular are:Copenhagen is a premium tobacco made by U.S. Smokeless and the most expensive moist tobacco on the market. It comes in flavors like Natural, Straight, Bourbon, Whisky, and Smooth. For a beginner, it may be best to start out with the Long Cut version of Copenhagen as it packs more easily and will stay together in your mouth as you get accustomed to chewing.
Skoal is known for its high quality and variety of flavors, including Apple, Peach, and Wintergreen. Fruit flavors are good for a beginner chewer as they are milder than the mint varieties.
Timberwolf is value-priced, high quality tobacco. It comes in flavors like Apple, Peach, Mint, and Cool Wintergreen.
Grizzly is considered “floor tobacco” for it’s very cheap price. It comes in Mint and Wintergreen and is not recommended for beginners because of its high nicotine content.

, You might be surprised at what dangerous chemicals are found in smokeless tobacco products.

Smokeless tobacco contains a number of cancer-causing chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polonium–210 (a radioactive element found in tobacco fertilizer) and nitrosamines.Chewing tobacco contains sugar, which leads to tooth decay and gum disease.
It also contains salt (sodium), which raises blood pressure.
Of course, smokeless tobacco products also contain the addictive substance, nicotine.

, Just like cigarettes, chewing tobacco is regulated by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), so you will be required to prove you are 18 years or older before you can purchase chewing tobacco.


Some states have higher age limits so make sure you know the law in your state.
For example, in 2013 the city of New York raised the legal age for buying tobacco from 18 to 21 years old.In accordance with federal law, tobacco retailers in all states will check the identification of anyone appearing under 27 years old.

, You will use the bottle to collect the spit from the chewing tobacco.If you are chewing tobacco outdoors, you can skip this step as you can simply spit the tobacco out on the ground.
Be aware that some places ban spitting on the side walk. Know the laws in your city and state.Alternatively, you can use a cup.You can also purchase a spittoon for spitting into., Do this by shaking the tin between your thumb and pointer finger in an even up and down motion for about ten seconds.


Packing the tobacco is important because this will make it easier to pinch the tobacco.
If you are using a pouch, shake the pouch in an even up and down motion so the tobacco gets packed together in the pouch.
Alternatively, you can also tap the tin or pouch on a hard surface to pack it.

, Open the tin or pouch and confirm that the tobacco is now firmly packed together.


It should all be gathered on one side of the tin or pouch.
If it is not properly packed, replace the lid and tap the tin again.

, Depending on how much tobacco you’d like to chew, lift more or less tobacco between your fingers.For beginners, start with a small amount of chew, about the size of a penny.
As you become more comfortable chewing tobacco, you can increase the amount you use.

, While you may eventually feel comfortable enough with the chew to place it between your cheek and your back teeth, start with this placement as it is easier to keep in place.


If you are having trouble keeping the tobacco in place, take an empty tea bag (or cut a tea bag open at the top and empty out the tea) and place the chew in the tea bag.
In effect you are creating something like a snuff pouch but with chewing tobacco.Place the tea bag of chew in your mouth, between your lip and bottom teeth.
Using a tea bag will help the chew stay in place, but it will lessen the flavor.

,


When you put it in your mouth, you will most likely begin to salivate heavily. This is a normal reaction to the presence of the tobacco, as the oils from the chew interact with the saliva in your mouth.
You need to chew the tobacco with your teeth to release the nicotine.
Chew the tobacco lightly as you do not want to break up the leaves and accidentally swallow any of them.
Chew for a little while to get nicotine out of the leaves then push the tobacco back between your cheek and gums with your tongue. Repeat as wanted.
Getting tobacco in your throat or stomach will lead to vomiting and increase the chances of long term health issues, so try to avoid swallowing any of the chew or chew-tainted spit.
As you chew, you should feel the effects of the nicotine in the tobacco. You may feel light-headed, a more rapid heartbeat, and an overall buzz, as well as a tingling sensation in your mouth. You may also feel nauseous or dizzy during your first time doing chew., Purse your lips and spit the juice out into the empty water bottle, other receptacle or on the ground outdoors.


Keep the tobacco in your mouth when you spit.
Avoid spilling the bottle with the spit by keeping the cap on.Empty spittoons or cups regularly.

,


Rinse your mouth with water, being careful not to swallow any remaining tobacco or juice.
You also want to brush your teeth as your breath will smell like tobacco.
Brushing your teeth will not reduce the staining that will occur with chewing tobacco., Like other tobacco products, smokeless tobacco contains nicotine, a dangerous and addictive substance.Most people who chew become addicted to it. Just as with smoking, withdrawal from smokeless tobacco can cause symptoms like intense cravings, increased appetite, irritability, and depression.While chew was very popular among many major league baseball players in the past, the league currently prohibits the use of chew by players and strongly discourages clubhouse attendants from purchasing chew for players.Probably the most well known professional baseball player to advocate against chewing tobacco is outfielder Bill Tuttle. After thirty-years playing and chewing in the professional league, Tuttle had a tumor so big it came through his cheek and extended through his skin. Doctors removed the tumor, likely the result of his decade long chew habit, and also had to remove much of Tuttle’s face. Chew cost Tuttle his jawbone, right cheekbone, the majority of his teeth and gum-line, as well as his taste buds. Tuttle eventually died from cancer in 1998, but spent his last years trying to steer people away from doing chew., Chewing tobacco greatly increases your chances of cancer, including esophageal cancer, as well as cancers of the mouth, throat, cheek, gums, lips and tongue, and pancreatic cancer.An accumulation of chew over an extended period of time will also likely lead to tooth decay. Chew contains high amounts of sugar, which contributes to cavities, and also contains coarse particles that irritate your gums and scratch away at the enamel on your teeth, making your teeth weaker and more susceptible to cavities and infection.
The sugar and irritants in chewing tobacco also cause your gums to pull away from your teeth, especially in the area of your mouth where you chew. This can lead to gum disease, which can be severe enough to destroy the soft tissue and bone that support your teeth and lead to tooth loss.
Chewing tobacco also increases your risk of developing precancerous lesions in your mouth, called leukoplakia, that could one day become cancer.Each year about 30,000 Americans learn they have mouth and throat cancers, and nearly 8,000 die from these diseases. Only about half of the people diagnosed with mouth or throat cancer survive more than 5 years.Some forms of smokeless tobacco, like chew, increase your heart rate and blood pressure. Studies suggest that long-term use of smokeless tobacco can increase your risk of dying from certain types of heart disease and stroke., Some smokers switch to chew in the hopes it will lessen their tobacco addiction, but this rarely works and can in fact lead to a greater addiction to tobacco.If you are trying to quit using chew, talk to your doctor about preventative methods like using nicotine gum, the patch or other medications.Smoking cessation programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, employers/work sites and national organizations.Using substitutes like gum, beef jerky, hard candy, or dried fruits instead of chew can also help to lessen your tobacco addiction by curbing the oral fixation.Teens who use chew are more likely to become smokers later in life."

Choose a dense source of smoke.,
Pull a large amount of smoke into your mouth.,
Move your mouth into an O shape.,
Make a tiny coughing motion.,
Try pushing with your tongue instead.,
Flick your cheek instead.,
Try the snap method.,
Blow one smoke ring above the other.,
Raise the middle of your bottom lip while blowing.,
Practice in an area without wind.,
Angle your head downward.,
Don't blow more than necessary.,
Practice simple rings first.",How to Blow Smoke Hearts," A hookah may give the best results, followed by a cigar or tobacco pipe. Don't use something too harsh or too hot. You'll need to be able to hold the smoke for at least five seconds without coughing or exhaling.Skip ahead to the next section if you already know how to blow a smoke ring.;
, Inhale for several seconds from the hookah or other smoking device. Open your mouth wide by lowering your jaw, so you gather more smoke in your mouth instead of just your lungs.

, Let go of the smoking device and move your mouth into an O shape. Your lips should make a round opening, but lower your jaw as well to make your mouth larger. If you're making a ""kiss face"" or ""fish face,"" open your mouth wider to make a larger O.You do not need to puff out your cheeks.
Don't exhale or inhale during this step. The smoke should remain still as a dense cloud in your mouth.

, Close the back of your throat and open it again, making a tiny, inaudible cough or a ""reverse hiccup.""The small, controlled release of air can push a little smoke through the opening in your mouth. This moves through the narrow opening of your lips and flows into a ring shape.


This is the easiest method for most people, but it often takes fifteen minutes of practice or more before you make your first ring, and a lot more practice before you can blow rings consistently.

, This method is usually more difficult, but might give you the ability to make larger, longer-lasting rings. Curl the tip of your tongue to the far back of your mouth. Flick your tongue forward in short bursts, scraping the top of your mouth or just beneath it, to push smoke quickly through the O opening of your lips.


Place your hand on your throat as you do this. If you're using the right technique, your Adam's apple will move up as you flick your tongue.

, This method works best if you have a cheek dimple, or if you already know how to make a water drop sound by flicking your cheek. Form the O shape with your mouth as usual, but lower your jaw enough that your cheeks are stretched. Flick your cheek with your finger, experimenting with the amount of force and shape of your mouth until the smoke emerges in strong, symmetrical rings.Your cheeks should be stretched, but still have a little looseness in them.

, After blowing a successful smoke ring, snap fingers gently, right above the smoke ring. If you time this correctly, the shock wave from your fingers will gently push the top of the smoke ring down, bending the ring into a heart shape.You can also try poking the smoke downward with your finger, but this can easily break the smoke ring apart.

, This is a very difficult method that is only possible if you are skilled at blowing smoke rings. Blow one large, slow smoke ring first. Immediately follow it by making a small, fast-moving smoke ring, aimed so it passes right through the top of the first ring. This can push the ring down into a heart shape.You can increase the speed of a smoke ring by narrowing your mouth more, and by moving your tongue or throat more quickly while you release it.

, Smoke is pushed into a ring shape by the air it travels through, which makes it very difficult to release smoke as any other shape.Still, you can try this by raising the center of your lower lip upward while you make the O shape for blowing rings, creating a bump that the smoke might tumble over to form a heart shape.If you can't hold your lip in this position, push it up with your finger.
If you push the middle of your upper lip down instead, you can try to make an upside-down heart.

, It's hard enough to blow ordinary smoke rings in an area with a breeze or a fan blowing, let alone more complicated shapes. Practice in a room with all the doors and windows closed, without any people or pets walking through it.

, Some people find it easier to blow smoke rings (or other shapes) with their head tilted downward, at roughly a 45º angle.This might be because this motion tightens the throat, making it easier to release a small, quick ball of air through.

, You only need to release a tiny amount of air to form a smoke ring with the ""cough"" method, and you don't need to breathe at all if you're using your tongue or flicking your cheek. If you're making smoke clouds instead of rings or hearts, you are probably exhaling without realizing it.Concentrate on your breathing first, until you can release a tiny puff of smoke, then focus on your mouth shape.

, Before you try blowing hearts, practice blowing smoke rings until you succeed on about half of your attempts or more. You'll probably need quite a bit of practice to go from there to blowing hearts, so having a good grasp of the basics will save time in the long run.

Let the book air out.,
Seal the book in a container of potpourri.Place the smelly book in a resealable plastic container and cover it with new, fresh potpourri for a day or so.,
Press dryer sheets in between the pages.,
Use cedar chips or activated charcoal.,
Try a baking soda fix.",How to Get Rid of Smoke Smell1," Gently hang an open book over a railing or on a clothesline outside for a few hours to a day. This should cause the smell to decrease.


Make sure that you choose a shaded spot since sunlight can bleach the pages.;
, The smoke smell should be replaced by the smell of the potpourri.


You may need to replace the potpourri after a day and continue sealing the book up with fresh potpourri for several days after that.
Get rid of the potpourri when done.

, Shove four to five dryer sheets in between the pages at even intervals and seal in a plastic bag. Let sit for a few days before removing.


Both scented and non-scented sheets should effectively absorb the smell.

, Place the book or paper product in a resealable plastic bag or container and cover with a handful of cedar chips or roughly 1 qt (1 L) of charcoal. Use activated charcoal, not charcoal briquettes. This should neutralize and mask the smoke smell after a few days.


Cedar chips and activated charcoal can be purchased at pet stores, aquarium shops and hardware stores.
Cedar chips may leave behind strong odors of their own when finished, but these odors are usually capable of warding away the smoke smell.
Activated charcoal absorbs the odors without leaving its own smell. Put it in a cloth bag or wrap it in cheesecloth to keep the book clean. It doesn't have to touch the book to absorb those nasty odors.

, Place the book in a plastic bag or container and sprinkle with a decent dusting of baking soda. After two or three days, gently remove the baking soda using a vacuum cleaner.


Baking soda is one of the best tricks you can use to neutralize the odor since it has no smell of its own to mask the smoke smell with.

"
"
Attack the odor with baking soda and dryer sheets.,
Alternatively, soak the clothes in vinegar, baking soda, and water.,
Use a washing machine cleaner, when necessary.,
Spray odor-eliminating fabric spray on your clothes for a quick fix.",How to Get Rid of Smoke Smell2," Place the smoke-saturated clothing in a plastic bag. Add two dryer sheets and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) baking soda to the bag for every three to five clothing items in the bag.


Seal or secure the bag and give it a thorough shake to spread the baking soda and dryer sheets around.
Let sit overnight. When you remove the clothes from the bag, shake out the remaining baking soda.
Run the clothes through a standard washing cycle in your washing machine when done.
This method of odor removal is beneficial since much of the smoke smell gets removed from the clothes before you wash them. As a result, very little odor gets transferred into the washing machine.

, Add your smoky clothes to the washing machine tub and fill the tub with enough water to cover the material. Add 1 cup (250 ml) baking soda and 1 cup (250 ml) white vinegar to the water.


Let the clothes soak in the solution for one hour at minimum.
Add a normal amount of detergent to the water and wash using a normal cycle.
This method is beneficial, too, since the baking soda and vinegar can help neutralize the smoke smell in your washing machine, too.

, If you find that you washing machine smells smoky after you have washed several loads of smoky clothes, you should purchase a commercial washing machine cleaner to remedy the problem.


Add as much cleaner to the tub as the label directs you to.
Run the machine on its hottest cycle without any clothes in it.

, If you need to get rid of the smoke smell on your clothes temporarily before you wash them, quickly spray an odor-eliminating spray over the material.


Make sure that you choose a spray that can neutralize odors, not one that simply masks the odors with another smell.

Roll the windows down.,
Shampoo the car.,
Use a specialty product.Some automobile dealers and parts stores sell specialized chemical removers that are capable of removing heavy, strong smells like smoke.,
Try vinegar, charcoal, coffee grounds, or baking soda.",How to Get Rid of Smoke Smell3," One of the most important things you can do is simply to let your car air out. Roll all of your windows down and let them remain open for a few hours to a couple of days.


If possible, leave the car doors wide open instead of simply the windows. This maximizes the amount of airflow going through the car.
Consider running battery-powered fans in the car to push the air out faster. If possible, choose a windy day to air the car out, as well.
Do not turn the car on and run the fan as it sits in one spot, especially if the car is in an enclosed space like a garage. Doing so can cause deadly carbon monoxide to build up.

, Use a vehicle upholstery cleaner on the the seats and floors. Scrub the interior of the car from top to bottom.


Floor mats may need to be removed and washed separately. If you find it difficult to remove the odor from the mats, replace them.

,


Follow the label instructions carefully when applying the product.
Let the car air out for a few days after using a product like this since a chemical smell will likely remain immediately after use.
Use a vacuum cleaner to remove any residue left behind by the product.

, While these remedies usually mask the odor instead of removing it, many people do stand by them.


Place a bowl of vinegar, container of fresh coffee grounds, or open bag of charcoal in the car overnight or for a few days.
Sprinkling baking soda over all the surfaces of the car interior and let sit overnight. Vacuum the excess in the morning.

"
"
Open the windows.,
Let your furniture air out.,
Run air purifiers in each room.,
Scrub down each part of your home.,
Place vinegar around the home.,
Use baking soda.,
Try activated charcoal.",How to Get Rid of Smoke Smell4," Open as many windows as possible to increase the amount of airflow inside your home, pushing the smelly smoky air out of the house and bringing the fresh air inside.


It is best to do this on a slightly breezy day. In the absence of a natural breeze, however, you can run ceiling fans and other fans inside the house to keep the air moving.

, Take any piece of furniture that you can remove from your home and let it sit out in the sun for a day or two.


The fresh air helps reduce the smoke smell.
The sun's UV rays are also thought to help neutralize smoke smell.

, Air purifiers trap odor in filters or neutralize odors completely. There are multiple types you can use:Electronic air cleaners produce an electric field that ionizes odor particles, causing them to become trapped to a collection plate.
Ionizers also produce an electric field that ionizes odor particles, but these machines cause the particles to drop to the ground for later vacuuming or sweeping.
Mechanical High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air filters trap pollutant particles on a charcoal filter. These filters are then cleaned or changed out, removing the smoke particles for good.

, Getting the odor out of the air and furniture may not be enough to remove smoke from your home, of course. There are other surfaces that need to be cleaned before the smell will go away for good.Wipe down the walls and ceilings. Look for a cleaner with glycol or ammonia. When you scrub down your walls and ceilings, keep the room well-ventilated and do not let kids or pets inside.
Clean the floors. Hard floors can often be cleaned with standard floor cleaners, but carpets will need to be shampooed and deep cleaned. Professional carpet cleaning is often necessary.
Wash your drapes and blinds. Soak your blinds in a bathtub full of water. Mix in 2 cups (500 ml) or more of white vinegar for a more thorough cleaning. Throw your drapes into the washing machine or have the material dry cleaned if the fabric is too delicate for a home washing cycle.
Wipe down windows and mirrors. Spray each surface with white vinegar and wipe them down with a clean, soft cloth.
Swap out your light bulbs. Smoke residue builds up on the exterior and interior of the bulbs. When the light warms up, the smell is released back into the air.

, Pour white distilled vinegar into small, shallow bowls and set a bowl in each smoke-infested room. Let the liquid evaporate.


This method is actually best to use after the windows and doors have all been closed. Minimize airflow so that the vinegar can have a stronger effect.
You can dampen a soft cloth with a little vinegar and use the cloth to wipe down your walls, as well.

, Sprinkle baking soda over your furniture, rugs, and other cloth or upholstery items. Let it sit overnight and vacuum it off the following day.


You an also set out bowls or open boxes of baking soda in each room instead of vinegar.

, Leave a bowl of activated charcoal in a smoky room to quickly absorb the odor.


Note that charcoal is also an active component of many HEPA air filters.

Seek medical assistance.,
Join a counseling program.,
Try medication.,
Understand why quitting is important.",How to Reverse the Effects of Smoking1," Though many people are able to quit ""cold turkey,"" the best way to devise a treatment plan is in consultation with a medical professional. For some people, this may simply mean a brief information session with a primary care giver. For others, a more long-term treatment plan may be necessary.Talk to your doctor about devising a smoking cessation plan that's right for you.
Try the START method:

S= Set a quit date.
T= Tell friends and family members that you plan on quitting.
A= Anticipate hard times ahead and plan for them.
R= Remove tobacco products from the house, car, and work.
T= Tell you Doctor so that you can get help.

;
, Counseling is available through most healthcare providers. Counseling may range from individual (one-on-one) counseling sessions, group counseling sessions, or remote counseling by telephone, depending on the individual's needs and the options available through a given healthcare provider.Some people find behavioral therapy to be an effective tool in quitting smoking.There are a number of smartphone apps available that can help smokers quit. One such app, called quitSTART, was designed in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.You can get help by calling a free phone hotline 1-800-QUIT-NOW. You can also find many resources for quitting at www.smokefree.gov.

, There are many medication options available that can help you quit smoking. These medications range from over-the-counter options to prescription-strength medicine. Prescription medication will help reduce your cravings for tobacco and help unwanted withdrawal symptoms.Over-the-counter options typically involve nicotine replacement products, such as the nicotine patch, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges.Prescription-strength nicotine replacements are available as patches, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Other prescription medications that may help you quit smoking include bupropion SR (Zyban) and varenicline tartrate (Chantix)., Smoking cessation is the most effective way to reverse the effects of smoking. Any other plan that does not incorporate quitting tobacco will not be as effective at reducing the health impact on your body.Studies have shown that quitting smoking has both immediate and long-term effects on your health. After quitting smoking, you can expect the following results:


Your heart rate and blood pressure will return to a more normal range within 20 minutes of quittingThe carbon monoxide levels in your blood will return to a normal range within 12 hours of quittingYour blood circulation and lung function will improve within two weeks to three months after quittingCoughing and shortness of breath will decrease and cilia function will resume within one to nine months after quittingYour risk of coronary heart disease will drop by up to 50 percent within one year of quittingYour risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder cancers will drop by 50 percent within five years of quitting, your risk of cervical cancer and stroke will drop to that of a non-smokerYour risk of fatal lung cancer will drop by approximately 50 percent after 10 years of quittingYour risk of coronary heart disease returns to that of a non-smoker within 15 years of quitting"

Learn controlled breathing.,
Allow yourself to cough.,
Reduce mucus.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Maintain a healthy diet.",How to Reverse the Effects of Smoking2," If you suffer from respiratory ailments, there are a number of breathing positions and relaxation techniques that can be used to assist you when you find yourself feeling short of breath. Talk to your doctor or a qualified respiratory therapist about controlled breathing techniques to help you improve your lung function.Sit upright. This can help increase the capacity of your lungs, which may be invaluable during times when you are short of breath.Breathe in through the nose and out through pursed lips. This can help you find a slow, steady rhythm to regulate your breath.Use your diaphragm to breathe. That means taking deeper, more substantial breaths, rather than the shallow breaths associated with the upper chest.Using your diaphragm to breathe will also have the added benefit of activating the parasympathetic nervous system and relaxing you. When you are short of breath you may feel very anxious.
Relax your neck, shoulders, and upper torso while breathing. If at all possible, have a friend or relative stand behind you and gently rub your shoulders while you sit and breathe., Coughing is a side-effect that some people may experience in the weeks or months after giving up smoking. It may seem counter-intuitive, but coughing is actually good for your body once you've quit smoking. It helps clear irritants (including mucus) out of your lungs, which is often considered a sign that the lungs are healing.If your coughing persists for more than a month or is accompanied by any blood, call your doctor right away, as this may be a sign of a more serious respiratory condition., Many current and former smokers experience elevated levels of mucus in the lungs. To combat this, you may need to cough more frequently (unless it is painful to do so). You can also help combat mucus and airway irritation by using a humidifier in your home to moisturize the airways. You should also drink plenty of water to help keep your body hydrated each day., For some people with respiratory problems, exercise is exhausting and difficult; however, regular exercise — especially cardiovascular exercise — has been shown to improve the respiratory muscles and provide you with stronger lungs.Just don't overdo your workout or push yourself too hard.


According to the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition you should aim 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.This is equivalent to working out for 30 minutes five time a week.
You can further break down your exercise into 10-minute increments. Any shorter than that, however, and you won't receive all the benefits.
Moderate intensity exercise includes walking, biking slowly, gardening, using a wheelchair, and water aerobics.

, Some people may not think of diet as a factor in respiratory health, but being overweight can put an additional strain on the lungs and may restrict breathing. Being underweight also puts you at risk of missing vital nutrients. Ask your doctor whether a healthier, more-balanced diet may help your respiratory condition.Dietary guidelines for Americans include consuming more healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low fat dairy products, lean meats, and seafood. Limit sodium, saturated and trans fatty acids, and simple sugars.

Take medications.,
Try lung therapy.,
Consider surgery.",How to Reverse the Effects of Smoking3," There are a number of medications available that can help reduce the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The medication your doctor recommends will vary, depending on your symptoms and the treatment plan your doctor has devised for you.


Bronchodilators — This class of medications is designed to relax the muscles along your airways to alleviate shortness of breath and chronic coughing. Most bronchodilators are prescribed as an aerosol inhaler, and come in short-acting forms (such as albuterol, levalbuterol, and ipratropium) and long-acting forms (such as tiotropium, salmeterol, formoterol, and arformoterol).Inhaled steroids — These medications involve a form of corticosteroids that are inhaled to reduce inflammation of the airways. Some commonly-prescribed inhaled steroids are fluticasone (Flovent) and budesonide (Pulmicort).Combination inhalers — These medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids into a single inhaler. Some common combination inhalers include Advair, which combines salmeterol and fluticasone, and Symbicort, which combines formoterol and budesonide.Oral steroids — This class of medication is usually prescribed to patients with moderate to severe acute exacerbation of COPD. Oral steroids are usually given in short courses that last around five days.Common oral steroids for COPD exacerbation include methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisolone (Prelone), and prednisone.Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors — This medication helps reduce inflammation of the airways and relaxes the muscles that line the respiratory system. The most common phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor is roflumilast (Daliresp).Theophylline — This medication can help improve breathing in patients suffering from COPD and may help prevent exacerbations of COPD. Theophylline is available in a number of oral forms, including syrup, capsules, and tablets, some of which are extended release pills. Common brand names of Theophylline include Elixophyllin, Norphyl, Pyllocontin, and Quibron-T.Antibiotics — Certain respiratory infections can cause COPD symptoms to worsen. Antibiotics can help treat exacerbations of COPD associated with respiratory infections, while some studies suggest that one particular antibiotic - azithromycin - may actually prevent exacerbations altogether., There are a number of lung therapy options that can help patients suffering from moderate to severe COPD. These therapy options are designed to increase the function of a patient's lungs if COPD has made breathing difficult.


Oxygen therapy — This option involves using a tank or portable unit of supplemental oxygen. Some patients only need supplemental oxygen use during strenuous activities or while sleeping, while others may need supplemental oxygen around the clock, depending on the severity of symptoms. Oxygen therapy is the only COPD treatment option that has been proven to extend the patient's life.Pulmonary rehabilitation programs — This option combines training/education, exercise, nutritional guidance, and counseling. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are designed to reduce the length of hospital stays and increase the patient's quality of life., Surgical options are usually reserved for patients with severe COPD and/or emphysema who have not responded to medication and traditional therapy options. Surgery usually falls into one of two treatment options:


Lung volume reduction surgery involves a surgeon removing small portions of damaged lung tissue, allowing the healthier tissue to expand and work more efficiently. This treatment option may improve a patient's quality of life and could extend a patient's life.Lung transplantation improves the patient's ability to breathe and resume physical activity; however, it is a very serious procedure with many possible complications and side-effects, including the risk of death. There is also a very specific set of criteria which prospective transplant recipients must meet. Talk to your doctor about whether a lung transplant may be right for you."

Remind yourself why you chose abstinence.,
Think of the advantages of abstinence.,
Stay strong during sexually charged situations.,
Seek support.,
Be transparent about your decision and boundaries.,
Find other ways to be intimate.,
Recognize disrespect.,
Masturbate.,
Channel sexual energy into other activities.,
Engage in sensual, but non sexual, activities.",How to Practice Abstinence," It can be difficult to stay abstinent in a sexually driven world. If you feel yourself doubting your decision, try reminding yourself why you chose abstinence to begin with. This can help strengthen your resolve.


People choose abstinence for different reasons. Some people choose to remain abstinent due to religious beliefs. Others simply do not feel ready for the complications of sex. Some people have previously engaged in sexual activity and, for whatever reason, want to stop having sex for a period of time. Whatever your reason, it should be respected if it feels right for you.It can sometimes help to write thoughts out. Periodically journaling the reasons you chose abstinence can help remind yourself that you made the right choice.;
, When you're feeling weak or pressured, remind yourself of all the advantages of abstinence. This can help you feel secure in your decision.


In regards to personal health, abstinence has many benefits. It is the only 100% foolproof method to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. In terms of mental health, abstinence eliminates the anxiety and depression than can accompany having sex too soon or with the wrong person.Abstinence can also strengthen the emotional aspects of a romantic relationship. When you're not focused on the physical aspects of the relationship, this can sometimes result in deeper conversations. You might end up getting to know your partner better by waiting to have sex.Many people also find when they're not so hyper-focused on sexual activity they end up concentrating on their career, school, or outside projects more., Unfortunately, you cannot entirely avoid sex in modern society. Sexually charged movies and television shows are the norm. If you're dating someone, you may occasionally find things getting heavy physical. During such sexually charged moments, remember to stay strong.


If a situation is difficult, it's okay to remove yourself for a moment. If a television show is very sexual, change the channel. If you're making out with your partner and feel tempted, pause for a moment.If you feel tempted to have sex, asking yourself a few questions can help. What will happen if I have sex with this person? Will I really feel good about myself? Is this truly worth breaking my commitment to abstinence? Am I really ready to have sex? Is this person making me feel pressured?, It can be helpful to network with like-minded people to help you stay focused. Seeking out support from others who practice abstinence can help.

Try attending some of these meetings and see if you can exchange phone numbers with fellow churchgoers. You can engage in activities outside of church that can help keep your minds off sex.
There are many forums online where you can discuss abstinence. If you're shy about discussing your decision in person, going online can help. This can also be helpful if you're not necessarily practicing abstinence for religious purposes.

, If you get involved in a romantic relationship, you need to make your boundaries clear. Talk to your partner about why you're choosing to practice abstinence and make your expectations and boundaries clear.


It's important to be as straightforward as possible. Many people do not understand why someone would practice abstinence and how they manage to keep sexual desires in check. Explain to your partner why practicing abstinence is important to you, what reasons you have for doing so, and how abstinence will affect your romantic relationship.There are different levels of abstinence. Some people do not want any physical contact, including kissing and hand-holding. Others allow kissing, making out, and some light touching but no activity that could lead to orgasm. Some people practice an ""everything but"" approach, only abstaining from activities that involve genital to genital contact or penetration. Explain to your partners where your boundaries lie and what is and is not acceptable contact on your terms.Your partner might be unsure how to support you, so talk about what you like to do instead of having sex.

If your partner is being disrespectful, it is not worth your time or energy to stay with this person. Know how to recognize signs of disrespect.


No one should ever pressure you into having sex. If your partner says things like, ""If you loved me, you would sleep with me"" or ""If we're not having sex, people with think there's something wrong with you"" then you're being pressured. If even your partner does not share your views on abstinence, he or she should acknowledge your boundaries without judgment.If you're in a situation where you're being continually pressured, especially in a judgmental way, it's best to end the relationship. You should not stay with someone who does not respect your values., Masturbation can be an easy way to deal with sexual desires without having sex. Regular masturbation can be a healthy activity that can help you stay abstinent.


Masturbation can be good for mental and physical health. People who masturbate regularly tend to be more comfortable with their bodies and have lower stress levels. You will also be more familiar with the workings of your body. This means you're more likely to be able to detect abnormalities in your genitals.People can masturbate with their hands alone via rubbing, touching, or otherwise fondling their genitals. There is no right or wrong way to do so. Simply follow what feels good to you. You can also use toys, such as dildos, to enhance the experience. These can be purchased online or at sex shops.Sexual fantasies can enhance the experience of masturbation.

Use a cellophane wrapper to get smoke rings.",How to Blow Smoke Rings," Keep the smoke in your throat, not just in your mouth. This may take some getting used to. It may cause you to cough.






;
, With your mouth closed, draw your tongue back, keeping it pointing down toward the bottom of your mouth so that the smoke moves away from your lips.








, At the same time, stick your lips out as if you were making an ""ooo"" sound (like in the word 'boot'). The circle should be as big as you can comfortably make it. Don't stress too much - leave room for movement. You will look rather ridiculous to everyone else, until they realize you're about to blow their minds.








, The best way to describe how to do this is by the sound you make when you choke slightly, by contracting your glottis and pushing the air through your lips. You will feel pressure and then a quick burst of smoke, but your vocal chords should not be used. The exhale should only be a guttural whisper, if anything.









Try to push a small amount of air out of your lower throat without taking a breath and without moving your lower jaw. Once you master this technique, the rings should come easier.
Keep your lips steady as you're pushing the small bit of air out of your mouth.
This is the toughest part of blowing smoke rings. Make sure your tongue is far back in your mouth, you have enough smoke to form a ring, and enough breath to push the smoke out.

, As you feel the smoke leaving your lips, push the tongue forward, still keeping it pointing down. Don't bring the tip of your tongue up above your teeth, or it will interfere with the smoke ring. Think of your tongue like a conveyor belt.









At the same time, bring the lower jaw slightly but rapidly upward. Tuck your lips inward slightly, but rapidly.
This will put a ""back-spin"" on the smoke, helping the ring stay tight. This should create a very beautiful, thick ring of smoke.

, These two motions should be the last motions of blowing an O, meaning that they should be the motions that push the O from your lips. The difference between this technique and adding spin is that for this technique, you're pushing your jaw forward; in the spin technique, you're pushing your jaw up.









Try to keep the tip of your tongue placed behind your lower front teeth at the gum line at all time, and try to only push with the middle of your tongue.
The hardest part to master about this technique is the jaw motion. You pretty much have to figure it out on your own.
This technique takes the most practice, but once you master it you will be the master of shooting those O's, and will be capable of shooting O's that seem to continue to drift until disturbed.

, If you quickly curl your lips after you close and open your glottis, the ring will travel faster.









The further in you curl your lips, the faster and farther your smoke ring will go.
Don't curl too much or too soon, however. Timing is everything. If you constrict the opening too soon, you may end up with smaller rings than you want.

, This is considered ""cheating"" by some, but it's an easy and effective way to blow small smoke rings without needing to master the throat technique.









Gather smoke in your mouth, but don't inhale.
Form your lips in a small ""ooo"" shape.
Using your tongue and mouth to blow some smoke out slowly and steadily, flick or tap your cheek repeatedly. For each flick of the cheek, you'll get a mini-ring!
Do this in a steady stream of taps or space the taps out with breaks in between.

, You are basically using the tongue to push smoke out of the mouth without ""blowing"" at all.









Curl your tongue back toward your throat while letting the tip rest on the bottom of the mouth, so that your tongue makes an upside-down ""U"" shape.
Use the flat surface of the tongue to quickly push the smoke out of the mouth. Do this by dragging the tip of the tongue across the bottom of your mouth while keeping the upside down ""U"" intact.
Rings produced this way are small and don't last very long, but are very easy to make.

, An alternate method (e.g. cheating) is to burn a hole in the cellophane wrapper in your cigarette pack. After inhaling smoke, blow it into the hole. Gently tap the wrapper on side without a hole. A smoke ring will appear.

Learn relaxation techniques.When everyone relaxes, everyone benefits.,
Challenge your negative thoughts.",How to Overcome a Fear of Sex," Determine what you are afraid of and challenge it.When it comes to being fearful of sex, you need to know what has caused you to be afraid. Identifying specific fears will help you focus on finding a solution.


Sit down and make a list of the things you fear about sex. For example, you may not know how to approach the subject, you might be afraid of doing something wrong, or you’re embarrassed of how you look naked.
Challenge your fears by listing possible solutions to resolve your fears. For example, if you don’t know how to approach the subject with someone, ask a trusted friend how they do it, or find someone who does it well and model his behavior. Even watching a romantic movie might help.
If you are afraid of doing something wrong, you need to study the subject and figure out what techniques work best for you. Preparation and knowledge will lessen any fear.;
, The structure and function of the human body have been studied for centuries. There are volumes of information you can refer to if you are unaware of some or all parts of the female or male anatomy.


If your fear is related to not knowing enough about a woman’s and man’s external genitalia, then it is time to get educated.The female genitalia includes: the vagina, a tubular organ connecting the genitals with the uterus; the uterus, a hollow muscular organ where a fetus grows during pregnancy; the vulva includes all the visible external aspects (mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, urethra, vaginal vestibule, perineal body); glans, the tip of the clitoris that is a highly sensitive organ.
The male genitalia includes: the penis, cylindrical mass of penile tissue; the testes, oval, glandular organs contained inside the skin pouch called the scrotum; glans, the structure at the tip of the penis.
The four stages of sexual response are: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and refractory period.An orgasm is a genital reflex governed by the nerves in the spinal cord and is experienced differently by women and men.Once you understand the basic structure and function of relevant body parts, you will feel more in command of yourself and your fears about sexual activity.

, Most fears are conquered by devising a plan of action. Overcoming a fear of sex is no exception. Identify what your main objectives are, set up steps to take and follow your plan.


Make a list of the things you fear. Is your fear related to the possible sexual encounter you might have during a date? Therefore, does the thought of asking someone on a date scare you? Are you concerned with looking good, having bad breath, or sweating too much?
Approach your dilemma one step at a time. For example, if you are afraid to ask someone on a date, start by first asking a stranger what time it is. Although you won’t be asking the person on a date or to have a sexual encounter, you will gain experience approaching someone and asking them a question. This is the first step toward your goal.
Working toward a solution will help lessen your fear. Creating a plan of action helps you feel like you can do something to improve your situation.

, To overcome a fear of sex you need to gradually work your way through the process. Research indicates that overcoming a fear is aided when a person faces the fear in an imagined situation or a live experience. Developing a positive habit is the desired goal.Learn how to please yourself. Determine what feels good to you by touching yourself, imagining an interaction with someone, or using sexual accessories designed to arouse.
With a willing participant, build your experience over time in the areas of communicating your feelings, holding hands, kissing, massage, sexual touching and eventually intercourse. Do not pressure yourself into doing too much too soon. This may only add to the fear you are feeling.

, When communicating with someone you care about be kind and caring and show them you are emotionally open. Sex is an emotional experience, so be mindful of this when speaking and when spoken to.


If you are physically or emotionally uncomfortable in any way, tell the person you are with and take the time you need to get to a place of comfort. For example, if you feel rushed or physically ill say, “I’ve got to stop right here. I’m not comfortable.”
Avoid jumping into sexual situations too quickly. The results could be dangerous. You can still be emotionally open with someone and show discretion about how far you will allow yourself to be involved.

, Sexual interactions are supposed to be enjoyable so relax and engage in the excitement of it all. Focusing on having fun will distract you from being fearful.


Lightening the mood during a sexual encounter will allow you to feel free. For example, be playful and silly and laugh at yourself.It will set you both at ease.

, The human body is amazing. Yours is unique and needs to be taken care of so you will have confidence with your sexual abilities. Eating right, getting an appropriate amount of sleep, and exercising will help you maintain great health and a positive sense of yourself.Certain drugsand alcohol will affect your physical functioning. Avoid them to eliminate lingering fear.
If you do have difficulty getting and maintaining an erection, see a doctor who is specifically trained to manage these issues.
Erectile dysfunction is usually attributed to a poor blood supply to the penis. Eating foods that promote good vascular health and following a healthy-heart related plan may help the condition. A diet high in vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fiber, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products is recommended., Placing undue pressure upon yourself does not work to your advantage. If you have a fear of not being able to perform and meet your partner’s needs, then you must adjust your mindset.


Men tend to be competitive about many things in life, which isn’t always healthy.It becomes a problem when it causes you so much stress during a sexual encounter that you are more focused on “winning” than on enjoying each other’s company. Being overly focused on winning indicates you seek high levels of external validation.Shift your thinking toward the sharing aspects of your interaction. This will move your focus from yourself to the experience itself and your partner.
Don’t judge yourself. Your self-worth is not dependent upon your sexual performance. You are an entire person with many positive qualities and abilities. Don’t let one aspect of your life define you.
Write a list of some of your positive attributes, and how they benefit you and the people around you.

, It is a common struggle to figure out how you feel and communicate it clearly to someone. Frustration can set in when you don’t know what you feel. You may be afraid of saying the wrong thing or not saying what you really mean.


Start by writing about the feelings you are having.Writing helps to organize your thoughts about your fears and clarifies what you are feeling. Your writing doesn’t have to be perfect. The important thing to do is to pull your emotions up from your subconscious to acknowledge them, and then you can process them.
If there is something you want to tell someone, rehearse it ahead of time. Visualize yourself meeting with the person and having a good conversation.
Don’t feel pressured to give your feelings a label. You don’t need to give everything a perfect name in order for it to be real. Perhaps you feel a little unsteady and a bit nervous and excited, but a little nauseous at the same time. This may translate to feeling love or infatuation for someone. It can be confusing.

, A woman’s primary concern when engaging in any sexual activities is her safety. Taking precautions will help alleviate your fears toward being emotionally or physically harmed. Whether you have a fear of getting pregnant, of losing your virginity, or your parents finding out, securing your safety will help manage all of them.


You have control over your body. Avoid those things that cause you to lose control like alcohol or drugs.
Make sure you feel comfortable and are ready for sexual activity.
Always make sure someone knows where you are when there is a potential to engage in sexual activity with someone.
Guard against pregnancy by using a form of birth control. The fear of getting pregnant can motivate you to make good choices.

, Competing or comparing yourself to others in a group can be dangerous. Becoming sexually active is a turning point for everyone. You must resist the pressures of trying to fit in or make someone like you by offering sexual favors.


Your sexual development is a very personal and unique part of your life. It is your experience so you must take ownership of it. Don’t allow others to negatively influence your decisions. You must learn to set boundaries with confidence, which will help fight off any fears you have.For example, someone shows you a lot of attention and you end up dating. Your affection grows for the person, but not as fast as the person would like. They say to you, “I’m really interested in a lot of people and I thought we would be having sex by this point. When are we going to have sex? Don’t you like me?”
An effective response would be, “I like you a lot and I’m enjoying the fact that we are getting closer. I appreciate that you’ve been patient with me. However, my choice to have sex with you will never be something I rush into. If you need to date someone else, then I have no other choice but to let you go.”

, As a woman, or anyone, you must be clear about your intentions when faced with a possible sexual encounter. You have the ability to stop an interaction at any time. When you say, “No!” and “Stop” it means “Stop!”Look out for yourself as if you were looking out for your best friend. If you sense danger in any situation, always follow your intuition. Be comfortable with changing your plans, your mind, and those you date. Trust your instincts.
The important thing to remember is you must trust the person you are with so you can make clear, well-informed decisions.

, If you are avoiding sexual contact and the thought of having sex causes you to feel excessive and unreasonable anxiety or panic, you should seek help from a professional therapist. This may be signs of a phobia rather than a normal fear response.The physical symptoms of a phobia include: sweating, shaking, feeling lightheaded, and having difficulty breathing. A counselor can help you manage these symptoms and the condition.
See a therapist if you have sexual abuse in your history, which may hinder your enjoyment of sexual activity. Talking with a counselor and processing those traumas will lead to a positive relationship with others.

, Approaching an intimate situation with a sense of calm will stave off fear, and enhance your enjoyment.


Relaxation techniques include guided imagery, biofeedback, and breathing exercises. These will help you lower the stress and fear you feel. Use these techniques prior to interacting with someone.
Guided imagery involves focusing on calming images and can be done by yourself or with help from a therapist.
Biofeedback is a technique that trains you to lower your heart rate and blood pressure, which are associated with fear.
Breathing exercises help to calm the nervous system associated with the fight-or-flight response, which is triggered when you feel fear.If fear takes a hold of you when you are with someone in an intimate situation, pause and take a minute to breath and tap into the relaxation skills you have learned.

, Your thoughts affect your emotions. There is a tendency to overestimate the negative outcomes before you experience them, and underestimate your ability to cope with and manage a situation. These thoughts are imbalanced and need to be challenged.


For example, you are extremely nervous and afraid that you will throw up on your date when you are kissing. Challenge the thought by saying, “You cannot predict the future and you have never thrown up on anyone. If you feel nauseous excuse yourself and go to the bathroom. You can handle it.”
You are stronger than you think. If you feel you lack adequate coping skills, improve them.For example, take notice of the way you effectively cope with another type of fear in your life and apply the same technique. Also, observe how someone you admire copes with difficult situations. Ask them for suggestions that you can implement.
Use positive self-talk to calm your thoughts and nerves. For example, if you feel your fear, anxiety or stress increase, tell yourself, “You are fine. This is going to be fun. You are not going to be embarrassed. Have a good time.”

Wear a condom.,
Cut down on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.,
Use a topical medication.,
Don't skip foreplay.,
Change positions often.,
Try to distract yourself.,
Take slow, deep breaths.,
Let her be in control.",How to Make Sex Last Longer," Premature ejaculation is as much a physical issue as a mental one. Try not to create a self-fulfilling prophecy by labeling yourself as sexually incompetent in any way. Approaching sex with confidence, self respect, and a positive attitude rather than fear and self-doubt can make all the difference for both you and your partner.;
, Masturbation is perfectly healthy and natural, and doing it regularly can help you build up your stamina, prevent premature ejaculation,and even relieve stress and anxiety. Plus, the more time you spend with yourself, the more familiar you will become with your body so that you can more easily recognize when you get too excited. That way, during sex, you can know when to slow down or change positions before it's too late.

, Men tend to get particularly worked up during their first time with a new woman, especially if this woman is somebody he has been lusting after for a long time. Realize that sometimes it really isn't you, but rather, how attracted to and excited you are about being in bed with her. And that's perfectly okay.


Being in a monogamous relationship is a great way to improve your performance in bed, and the more time you spend with one person, the more comfortable and confident you will feel during sex.

, Lots of men complain that condoms decrease pleasure and sensitivity during sex, but if you're trying to last longer in bed, that might be just what you need. And, of course, there's the added bonus of preventing against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.

, Using these substances in excess may interfere with your ability to control ejaculation., Desensitizing sprays and creams have been used for years to help men last longer but the side effects of sensation loss and partner transference have prevented them from widespread use. There is a new class of topical sprays with absorption technology that enables a mild anesthetic to penetrate the outer layer of penile skin to the nerves below that control ejaculation, providing superior control and good sensation for the man and generally unnoticeable transfer to the woman. There are several products available in the U.S. at the moment.


These are not available in all pharmacies. Search online for ""penis spray"" to find places to order online.

, Studies have shown that couples that indulge in foreplay report having sex for longer than those who don't.Instead of getting right down to business, take some time to cuddle, kiss, touch one another, and so on. The more time you spend on foreplay, the longer you'll be in bed together.


If you get too excited during foreplay, stop her from doing whatever she's doing and focus all of your attention on her instead.

, This can shift your attention. Plus, exploring different sexual positions can make sex more exciting and ensure that both partners are satisfied.


Also, don't be afraid to stop having sex temporarily to focus on her.

, If you find yourself getting too excited during sex, try to distract yourself from how turned on you are by thinking about something completely unrelated to the situation, like work or school. Temporarily diverting your attention can help you relax and slow down.


Whatever you think of, make sure that it's something that doesn't turn you on sexually in any way.

, Many men find that breathing slowly and deeply during sex can help them last longer. This can be attributed to the fact that breathing helps us relax. Try to breathe deep into your belly. Feel it expanding as you inhale. It may also help to hold your breath for two or three seconds before exhaling, slowly. This holding can have a calming, centering effect.

, The person who is in control is usually the one experiencing most of the pleasure; letting her be in control can help decrease some of the sensitivity you feel.

Set a reasonable goal for weight loss.,
Control insulin by cutting out sweets and carbs.,
Help yourself to more protein.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Manage Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)1," Losing weight is often recommended for women who are diagnosed with PCOS. However, you do not need to lose a ton of weight to see improvements in your condition. Even losing 10% of your body weight may help to correct the hormonal issues that are causing your PCOS.For example, if you weigh 250 pounds, then try setting a goal to lose 25 pounds over the course of five months. This is a five pound weight loss per month, which will mean that you will need to lose one to two pounds per week. This is a reasonable, healthy weight loss rate.;
, Those with polycystic ovary syndrome experience increased insulin levels. Insulin is a hormone, and when more of it is present, people feel hungrier sooner and more often, which causes them to eat more and gain weight. It is crucial for those with polycystic ovary syndrome to regulate their weight to avoid the most severe symptoms. Eliminate sweet treats. Most of us enjoy a sweet piece of cake, candy, bread, or pie at least every now and then. Sometimes, it feels difficult to go a day without having some chocolate or cookies. However, the more sugar you eat, the more insulin you will produce. Eat fresh fruit when you need your fix.
Cut down on carbohydrates. Food like white pasta, white bread, potatoes and corn tastes good and can be comforting to eat, but it also heightens insulin levels. Consume multigrain bread, vegetables, or whole wheat pasta instead of high glycemic foods.
Stop drinking soda and other sugary drinks. Pepsi might be your drink of choice, but soft drinks are filled with sugar. Even healthier seeming options like juice contain too much sugar. Choose plain water, water flavored with strawberry or cucumber, seltzer water, or unsweetened ice tea.However, do not switch to diet soda to solve this problem. People who drink diet soda tend to weigh more and consume more calories from solid foods., To help block insulin and to keep your weight on track, eat more meat and legumes. Healthy sources of protein are a good choice when you need a snack, and you should consume protein at every meal. Just don't go overboard!


Prioritize protein. Eating protein-filled food helps fill us up and provides energy. Eating items like peanut butter and other nuts, fish, chicken, pork, red meat, eggs, beans (black beans, lentils, lima beans, etc), and soy counteracts insulin produced by eating other food. Sustaining a more protein-based diet can help you maintain a healthier weight. Consider portion size. After you change your diet, you still have to be aware of how much you eat. Clearly, savoring a 16-ounce steak or three servings of fried fish during Friday dinners won’t help you keep your weight down. It is better to eat smaller portions throughout the day. Read the labels. Sometimes, it might seem like our food choices are healthy, but they aren't. Be aware of how much sodium and sugar are in the food that you eat. Use a fit bit or buy a calorie counter to help you in this endeavor., Exercising boosts the heart rate and helps us lose weight. It can also alleviate PMS symptoms or feelings of anxiety, which also come along with polycystic ovary syndrome. Women with this illness can benefit especially from exercising right after they eat. Figure out what kind of exercise is enjoyable for you and build it into your routine. Using exercise equipment is one option. You can go to the gym and use an elliptical machine, lift weights, ride a stationary bike, and more. If you have a machine at home, that is even more convenient.
Another option is to hike outdoors, which can be more enjoyable for those who like to breathe in the fresh air. Even big cities offer large, wooded parks, so seek out a pleasurable environment! While walking trails, you might see interesting wildlife, too!

Take birth control pills or progesterone to manage your period.,
Use Clomiphene or other hormonal medicine to address infertility.,
Try facial masks or medication for unwanted hair.,
Get acupuncture.",How to Manage Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)2," When your period interferes with your daily life, take action. One common method is to use birth control pills. The different dosages of hormones that they contain can help balance out problems with your hormones. Using progesterone is an alternative that will give similar results for those who do not like birth control pills.Remember to take your birth control pills every day at the same time. If you accidentally skip a dose, do what the directions say.
Administer progesterone as directed by your doctor. You will usually take it for only ten to fourteen days per month. Ask to try a different length of time if it doesn’t seem to work. Be patient when starting these treatments. It will take several months to figure out if they will have positive effects. If you experience severe effects listed as possibilities in the informational brochure, contact your doctor immediately.

, If you desire to start a family but have not been able to conceive, it might because you are not ovulating properly. The illness prevents ovarian follicles from maturing and producing eggs.Clomiphene or similar medications can spur ovulation. You can try metformin alongside the Clomiphene if Clomiphene does not produce results. There are alternatives to Clomiphene if it doesn’t work. Your doctor might prescribe follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) medications. They usually come as injections. As always, you should follow your doctor’s recommendations during this time to avoid complications.

, As a woman, having excess hair is not pleasant to deal with. If constantly shaving or using fading creams becomes a hassle, administering these treatments can help. You can make a face mask with turmeric or eggs to apply to your face. Turmeric is antibacterial and it can stop hair growth. You just need to blend it with equal parts flour and some water. Mixing an egg white with a half tablespoon of corn starch and tablespoon of sugar has a similar effect. Using the drugs Aldactone or Vaniqa will lessen the amount of androgen that your body produces, which will result in less hair growth. You have to use contraception while using medication because spironolactone, an active ingredient, can result in birth defects in children.

Practice radical acceptance.,
Join a support group.,
Seek counseling.,
Learn to meditate.",How to Manage Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)3," Sometimes we become angry when we realize that we can not control something in our lives, like our bodies. Often, we might rebel by doing exactly what we are not supposed to. Instead, we have to accept our circumstances to stay healthy. Don't deny that you have an illness. In order to live a productive life, you must be realistic about your situation. Remind yourself daily that you are not alone. Educate yourself about the illness. Being informed benefits us mentally and emotionally--ignorance is not bliss when it comes to a serious health concern. , Groups for women who have polycystic ovary syndrome exist. Look online to find a group in your area and attend a meeting or two. Making connections with others has many benefits. You will feel better after sharing your experiences, especially if you don’t already know someone else who has the syndrome.
You can also learn a lot from talking with like-minded people, like other tips for treating symptoms.
Strangers are usually be more objective than close friends or family members. You shouldn’t have to worry about judgment while at a support group meeting.

, If you are a private person, seeing a personal counselor is another option. People use therapy for many different reasons. Counseling can be especially helpful for women who experience fertility issues. No audience of strangers will be in the room, listening and looking. This is a plus for those who might feel uncomfortable attending a support group.
You can vent about how you are feeling about having polycystic ovary syndrome.
If you are not sure how to deal with the illness, a counselor can help you formulate an action plan.

Relax.,
Create a peaceful environment.,
Communicate with your partner.,
Take good care of your body.",How to Make Sex Less Painful1," Take some deep breaths, concentrating on having the air go in your nose and out of your mouth. Do a few yoga stretches before going out or spending time with someone. Repeat, “Relax,” to yourself until you can feel the stress slipping away. If you are stressed, you will likely hold your tension in your body and make sex less pleasurable.Sometimes it also helps to give voice to your fears. You might tell your partner, “I’m nervous about this, so I may need to relax more.”;
, Try to have sex in an environment where you can concentrate all of your focus and energy on your partner. Minimize outside noises and distractions. Turn off your cell phone. Make sure that you will not be interrupted. Fostering a calm environment will help you to fully relax and be yourself.You’ll want to think about what type of environment is relaxing to you. Some people prefer candles and soft lighting, whereas others like music on in the background.

, You may think that having a sex conversation with your partner is unromantic, but not talking can be much more detrimental. If you talk before you have sex about what you like, you’ll be far more likely to express your likes/dislikes in bed as well. It also important to know each other’s sexual boundaries.For example, you might say, “I’d really like to start off slow.” Or, “I will relax more if we turn off the lights.”
If you have some sort of health problem, such as endometriosis or erectile dysfunction, it is a good idea to make your partner aware of this as well. Be open and don’t be afraid of rejection. Your partner may be able to brainstorm ways to make sex better for you., You will have better, less painful sex if you eat right, exercise, and get enough sleep. Sex can be similar to a workout in that it might push your body to its limits. If you are not healthy, then your body may respond to sex painfully. Try to eat a balanced diet. Work out at least three times a week. Get at least eight hours of undisturbed sleep a night.Getting healthy and losing weight has also be associated with a decrease in the symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) for women. For men, losing weight can balance out testosterone levels, leading to better sexual performance.

Go slowly.,
Have more sex.,
Engage in foreplay.,
Use lubrication.,
Try out different positions.,
Stop if you need to.,
Avoid any irritants.",How to Make Sex Less Painful2," Take your time with your partner before, during, and after sex. Rushing things will likely cause your stress levels to rise, increasing the possibility of pain. When you are having sex, take your time finding out what gives your partner pleasure and don’t be afraid to express your wishes, too.If sex is painful, there is nothing wrong with stopping and trying again at another point. It is best to avoid the “let’s get this over with” mentality.

, This may sound odd, but engaging in sex more frequently can actually get your body more used to the process, making it less painful as a result. For certain men and women, the sexual organs can suffer from varying degrees of atrophy if not stimulated. Having intercourse prevents this and increases blood flow to the genital region. Being more sexually active, in a safe way, can also lessen some of the fear and stress associated with sex.If increased intercourse is not an option, many people see a lessening of pain if they try masturbation or other sexual practices aside from penetration., Give yourself at least 20-30 minutes for foreplay, as this is the average amount of time that it takes most people to become aroused and prepared for sex. Use this time as an opportunity to make sure that your partner is mentally and physically ready. Experiment with various types of touch to discover what works best for you both.For example, try out different degrees of touch pressure. Intermix soft touches with more forceful caresses.

, As part of foreplay, you may want to apply lubricant to yourself and perhaps your partner as well. Water-based vaginal lubricant can be placed directly on the vagina, vulva, or penis. A few drops is usually sufficient to reduce friction and pain. There are also vaginal moisturizers, which provide wetness and relief for multiple days.Many people find lubrication especially helpful if you are having sex with a condom., Experiment with a variety of sexual positions to see which ones are the most pleasurable, and least painful, for both you and your partner. Side-by-side can be comfortable for some women as it provides more shallow penetration. Both men and women sometimes prefer to assume a top position as it gives more control.To reduce spine pain, medical experts often recommend the missionary position as it allows the person laying down to put a towel or some other soft item under the curvature of their spine for support., If at any point during sex you experience pain and wish to stop, then tell your partner and separate. Don’t feel pressure to continue on just for your partner’s benefit. Communicate how you are feeling and work together to try once more under better conditions., If you notice that you are experiencing redness, itching, or irritation immediately during or after sex then it is possible you’ve been exposed to an irritant. Some people have a latex allergy, which makes them react badly to certain condoms. Some women even have a semen allergy. For both men and women, the use of spermicides or certain lubricants can also cause irritation.If you discover that a certain product causes irritation to your skin, you can always avoid it or find a product alternative. For example, people with a latex allergy often use natural lambskin condoms."

Talk with your doctor.,
Address any hormonal imbalances.,
Treat any infections.,
Enroll in physical therapy.,
Meet with a sex therapist.",How to Make Sex Less Painful3," Make an appointment with your primary care physician or OBGYN. Come prepared with a list of topics that you’d like to discuss. Be prepared to talk about how you’ve experienced pain during sex. Ask them about possible treatments. Depending on the potential diagnosis, your doctor may also order tests or bloodwork.For example, endometriosis is a painful medical condition that can effect women and must be diagnosed by a physician. If left untreated, it can cause a woman a great deal of pain during intercourse., If you are suffering from a lack (or excess) of testosterone, estrogen, or another hormone, this could impact your level of pleasure or pain during sex. Talk with your doctor about possible treatment options to correct any hormonal problems. They may suggest a cream, a medicated ring, oral medications, or a treatment patch.Some of these treatments can be highly successful with up to 75 percent of patients stating that their sexual pain lessened., If you have any type of sexual transmitted disease (STD), make sure to talk with your doctor before engaging in sexual intercourse. Also, seek out treatment if you are suffering from any type of genital infection as it could likely cause dryness and pain during sex.For example, men and women can both suffer from cystitis, which is a bladder infection that can cause pain during intercourse. It is also called a urinary tract infection or UTI. There are various over-the-counter treatments available, however, a more serious infection requires a doctor’s care.

, If you have a prior injury, then working with a physical therapist could help to increase your movement and flexibility. These changes may also lessen your pain during sex. Older persons may find physical therapy helpful as well, especially if they suffer from nerve conditions., You can find a therapist in your area by going to the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) website. A sex therapist will talk with you alone, or with you and your partner, about any concerns regarding your sex life. They might be able to offer exercises or communication tactics to lessen pain during intercourse.If you’ve been sexually assaulted in the past, it is probably a good idea to talk with a counselor. This will help you to find pleasure, instead of pain, from sex."

Inform yourself on state laws.,
Contact your insurance company.,
Add a supplemental policy.,
Consider another insurance plan.",How to Pay for IVF Treatment1," In the US, fifteen states have laws that require insurance coverage for infertility treatments. For information on each states’ respective laws, see http://www.resolve.org/family-building-options/insurance_coverage/state-coverage.html. If you live in any of the following states, you can pay for IVF at least in part with insurance:Arkansas
California
Connecticut
Hawaii
Illinois
Louisiana
Maryland
Massachusetts
Montana
New Jersey
New York
Ohio
Rhode Island
Texas
West Virginia;
, If you carry an insurance policy and are considering IVF, call or visit your insurance company as soon as possible. This can help you understand what IVF treatments are covered and potential out-of-pocket costs. In turn, this information may guide your decision on what type of IVF to pursue.Ask questions about your specific plan, including if it is public or private. Pay particular attention to covered IVF benefits as well as any exclusions or restrictions that may apply.
Let the insurance company know of any information your doctor has given you about potential procedures you may require or can choose. For example, your doctor may decide to try FASTT, which is the Fast Track and Standard Treatment Trial. This reduces the number of IVF cycles and also may decrease cost.Inquire about public service discounts. These are for people such as teachers, firefighters, police officers, or emergency medical technicians. Some plans may also offer discounts to active military and veterans., If your insurance plan doesn’t offer coverage for IVF, ask a representative if the company offers supplemental policies for the procedure. This may allow you to immediately proceed with IVF treatments and benefits for any pregnancy-related medical expenses.Recognize that these policies usually only cover expenses if you obtain them prior to receiving treatments or a pregnancy.
Make sure you are aware of any exclusions and exceptions. For example, there may be a 12-month exclusion of preexisting medical conditions.

, In some cases, especially if your employer is self-insured, your plan may not cover IVF. Ask your employer if it offers other insurance that may include IVF in their coverage. If so, inquire if the other plans offer IVF coverage. Consider switching to one of these or exploring other insurance companies beyond your plan.The following insurance companies include IVF in their coverage:Aetna
Aflac
Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS)
Cigna

Check with your doctor’s office about payment options.,
Apply for IVF scholarship and grant programs.,
Consider a loan.,
Use credit cards.,
Draw on home equity.",How to Pay for IVF Treatment2," Doctors who perform IVF are generally aware of the costs associated with the procedure. Because of this, many doctors’ offices will offer different payment and financing options for IVF. Before committing to a specific IVF program, ask the billing representative at your doctor’s office what types of payment options are available to you beyond insurance.Find out if your doctor’s office offers installment payments for IVF treatment cycles. Some doctors’ offices may even offer low-interest loans for your IVF.Inquire about any discounts your doctor may provide for public service professionals including teachers, firefighters, and military personnel.See if your doctor offers an IVF refund package and if you qualify for it. These ask for a flat fee for 3-6 cycles of IVF and offer a partial refund after just one cycle.

, Different non-profit organizations offer grants and scholarships to individuals who would like IVF. You need to qualify for these programs, which may be regional or national, and demonstrate financial need. The following is a list of some non-profit organizations that offer grants and scholarships for IVF:Angels of Hope Foundation
Baby Quest Foundation
The Cade Foundation
INCIID IVF Scholarships
Pay it Forward Foundation
Sharing Hope Financial Assistance Program

, Personal loans are another option if you want to pay for IVF. A loan can provide you with the necessary funds to cover your IVF expenses and then pay it off through set installments.Meet with a financial advisor if you are considering a loan. The advisor can help you plan for different contingencies with your IVF or possible pregnancy that won’t strap you financially. For example, having a baby can add considerable cost to your life. A loan that looks doable when you start IVF may difficult to pay once you have a baby.
Ask your bank if it offers medical loans. Many banks have unsecured personal loans that you can apply to medical bills.
Talk to your friends and family about loaning you money for IVF. You may find they are interested in helping you defray the costs of IVF.

, If you have good credit and don’t generally carry big balances, consider applying for a credit card or using an available credit line. This can help defray any costs you may incur undergoing IVF. Keep in mind that the interest on credit cards may be higher than personal loans, so you’ll want to ask about monthly payments to ensure you can make timely payments.Negotiate with your credit card company for a lower APR for the period you’ll undergo IVF. You can also ask for an increase on your limit.

, You may own your own home while considering IVF. If you’ve built up equity in it, you may qualify for a home equity loan from your bank. This allows you to use money you’ve already put down on your home towards your IVF treatment. Ask your bank what your options for a home equity loan are.Be aware that taking a second mortgage on your home may also be an option to finance your IVF.

Start a crowdsourcing campaign.,
Throw a donation benefit.,
Take on an additional job.,
Think about downsizing.",How to Pay for IVF Treatment3," Crowdsourcing, or crowdfunding, is a way to raise small amounts of money towards a specific goal. It is becoming an increasingly popular way to defray the costs of IVF treatments, especially because people generally enjoy helping others.Most donors will be family and friends. You may also pick up a few donors you don’t know at all.Crowdfunding may be a good option to pay for your IVF if:


You’re comfortable with everyone—family, friends, the general public—knowing about your infertility struggles.
You’re comfortable asking people you know and don’t know for money
You don’t have enough connections or relationships to raise the money you need

, An older way to raise funds that is similar to crowdfunding is hosting some type of benefit to raise funds for your IVF. Keep in mind that, like crowdsourcing, this brings others into your private life. Consider throwing the following to help defray the costs of IVF if you are comfortable:


Bake sale
Benefit dinner
Benefit race, such as a 5K run/ walk
Selling candy bars

, One of the easiest ways to raise money is find an additional source of income. Finding part time work, doing jobs from home, and asking your employer for extra hours may help you get closer to your goal of paying for IVF more quickly.

, Many people own larger homes than they need or have too many things around the house they don’t use. Take some time to figure out where you can downsize your life to save money for your IVF treatments. This might include getting a smaller home, getting rid of extra cable channels, or trading in your car for a less expensive monthly payment.


Consider selling valuables you don’t use. For example, you may have valuable jewelry or collectibles that sit and gather dust. Use the proceeds from the sale of such items towards your IVF treatments.
Combine all of your savings and put it in an account set up specifically for your IVF.

Eat more organic foods.,
Get more fiber in your diet.,
Know which foods are polyphenols.,
Look for foods containing sulfur.,
Put more cruciferous vegetables in your diet.,
Eat more mushrooms.,
Consume red grapes.,
Drink green tea.,
Consume pomegranates.,
Take the right vitamin supplements.Certain vitamins and minerals can help the body dispose of estrogen.",How to Lower Estrogen Levels1," While pesticides and similar chemicals used in food production do not necessarily produce more estrogen, they do have estrogen-like effects when your body absorbs them. Eating organic food will prevent these chemicals from entering your body., The liver dumps estrogen into its bile acids, and these bile acids pass through your intestines during digestion. Dietary fiber can help eliminate the estrogen found in bile.Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

, Polyphenols are derived by plant sources of food. Current research suggests that they help reduce estrogen levels in the blood.Flax seeds can be especially beneficial. In addition to polyphenols, they also contain lignans, which can counteract the effects of estrogen in the body and interfere with estrogen production. They do contain plant derived estrogens known as ""phytoestrogens,"" however, so you should not eat them in excess.
Other seeds, like chia and sesame, have similarly beneficial properties.
Many unrefined grains also contain large amounts of polyphenols. Some of the best whole grains include wheat, oats, rye, corn, rice, millet, and barley.

, Sulfur can help detoxify the liver by getting rid of substances that cause liver damage.As a result, the liver becomes more productive. Since the liver is responsible for metabolizing and breaking down estrogen in the body, a healthy liver can help decrease estrogen.Sulfuric foods include onions, leafy green vegetables, garlic, egg yolks, and citrus fruits.

, Cruciferous vegetables have high levels of phytochemicals, and these phytochemicals work with the body to help block estrogen production.A few beneficial cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, kale, collard greens, turnips, and rutabagas.

, Many mushrooms help prevent the bodily product an enzyme called ""aromatase."" This enzyme can convert androgen into estrogen. By eating more mushrooms, you can restrict this conversion process and decrease estrogen in the body.Some of the most helpful varieties include shiitake, portobello, crimini, and baby button.

, The skin of a red grape contains a chemical known as ""resveratrol,"" and the seeds contain a chemical called ""proanthocyanidin."" Both of these chemicals have been known to help block the production of estrogen.Since both the seeds and skins have estrogen-blocking properties, you should eat red grapes that still have seeds rather than choosing seedless varieties.

, Green tea contains phytochemicals which may help reduce estrogen production in the body. Research is still in its early stages regarding this notion, but early results appear promising., Pomegranates contain phytochemicals, as well. As noted earlier, phytochemicals are thought to have estrogen-blocking properties.


In addition to eating pomegranates fresh, you can also drink pomegranate juice and juice blends to obtain the same health benefits.

, Dietary supplements should never be completely relied upon, but including them in your routine can still be a wise decision.


Take a 1 mg folic acid supplement and a B-complex vitamin to help improve your liver function. This can be especially helpful if you drink alcohol on a regular or semi-regular basis.
Bacterial imbalance can interfere with the elimination of estrogen from the body, but probiotics help balance your digestive tract. Take a daily probiotic containing 15 billion units. Keep the capsules refrigerated and take one or two twice daily on an empty stomach.
Consider taking a fiber supplement to help boost your intake of dietary fiber.
Taking a standard multivitamin on a daily basis can be a good idea. These supplements contain zinc, magnesium, vitamin B6, and other nutrients, and these nutrients can help break down and eliminate estrogen in the body.

Consume less alcohol.,
Limit your dairy intake.,
Cut down on junk food.,
Avoid unfermented soy products.,
Consume less red meat.",How to Lower Estrogen Levels2," Estrogen is metabolized and filtered by the liver, but high levels of alcohol can decrease liver function. When liver function decreases, estrogen levels can increase.If you have borderline high estrogen levels, limit your alcohol consumption to one glass per day or less. If you are already experiencing estrogen dominance, however, cut alcohol out of your diet completely.

, Roughly 80 percent of estrogens acquired through diet come from cow's milk and dairy products made with cow's milk.Opt for non-dairy milk products, like almond milk or rice milk, instead.


Cows are often milked during pregnancy, when their estrogen levels are highest, which is why cow's milk can contain such high doses of estrogen.
When you do consume dairy, choose helpful dairy sources. Yogurt can be especially beneficial since it contains probiotics.

, Caffeine, fat, and sugar can all increase estrogen levels in the body, so you should limit these foods as much as possible.


For instance, even one cup of regular coffee can increase estrogen levels.Drinking up to four cups a day can raise your estrogen levels by as much as 70 percent., Soy contains plant compounds called ""isoflavones"" that mimic estrogen, so if you have high estrogen levels in your body, consuming unfermented soy can aggravate the estrogen's effects.


Unfermented soy products include tofu and soy milk.

, Red meat can contain hormone additives, and these additives can boost estrogen levels in your body or behave like estrogen in the body.When you do eat meat, look for meat labeled as “organic” or “natural.” Consuming this meat will still cause you to consume the estrogen left over from the animal's natural stores, but you will not consume any abnormally excessive amounts of estrogen this way.

Exercise more often.,
Stress less.,
Try an infrared sauna treatment.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Avoid handling items that could contain toxins.,
Ask your doctor about stopping certain medications.",How to Lower Estrogen Levels3," In particular, moderate to high intensity exercises have the greatest impact on estrogen levels.Try to get 15 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise each day to begin lowering your estrogen quickly.


Research suggests that postmenopausal women should get at least three hours of moderate exercise per week if they want to significantly reduce the amount of estrogen circulating through their bodies.Instead of doing muscle toning exercises, focus more on aerobic exercise, like walking, running, and cycling.
Exercise can also lead to weight loss. Since estrogen can hide out in the body's fat cells, fewer fat cells can mean less estrogen.

, In order to deal with stress, the body burns large amounts of progesterone and creates cortisol, the stress hormone. A by-product of this process is a relative excess of estrogen.It might seem impossible to cut stress out of your life completely, but there are things you could do to try reducing stress in your life. Remove any avoidable yet predictable source of stress you face on a regular basis. To counteract the effects of unavoidable stress, find activities that help you relax—meditation, reading, light exercise, therapy, and so on.

, Infrared sauna treatments are a popular detoxification practice. These treatments are believed to help balance hormones by encouraging fat cells in the body to flush out the estrogen stored there.


During an infrared sauna, infrared radiation safely heats up your skin, causing you to produce more sweat. Sweat cools the body, but it also releases toxins built up in the body, including excess estrogen., Poor sleep habits can reduce the amount of melatonin hormone in your body. Melatonin helps protect your body against estrogen dominanceso decreased melatonin can lead to increased estrogen.


Try to get seven to eight hours of sleep each night.
Keep the room as dark as possible as you sleep. Research often suggests that darkened rooms allow you to sleep more deeply, and a deeper sleep will help you produce more melatonin.

, In particular, certain plastics and cosmetics can contain xenoestrogens, and these estrogens can find their way into your body when you handle them on a regular basis.


Perfumes and perfumed products are one possible threat, and many toiletries contain harmful parabens.Plastic bottles and cups can cause you to consume harmful phthalate.
Metal cans can contain high levels of hormone-altering BPAs.
Ceiling and floor tile glues can contain dangerous carbons.
Gases produced by bleach and strong chemical cleaners can also negatively impact your hormones.

, You should never quit taking any medication without consulting your doctor first. That said, if you are concerned about high estrogen levels in your body, you may want to talk to your doctor about certain medications linked to increased amounts of estrogen and ask if you can limit or avoid them.


Antibiotics can kill or damage the helpful bacteria in your digestive tract. That bacteria helps flush estrogen out of your system, so destroying it can cause estrogen to build up."

If you feel tense when you think about sex or when you and your partner are fooling around, it might be a sign that you should wait. If you have sex when it doesn't feel ""right,"" you may enjoy sex less and become tense during the act.


A lot of people grow up being taught sex is shameful, should be reserved for marriage, and is only to be experienced between a man and a woman.If the idea of sex makes you feel guilty or stressed, maybe you should wait.
It is normal to feel insecure or unconfident about your body. But if you are scared or cannot be naked because of how you look, it might be a sign that you're not quite ready to be with a partner.
Don't feel ashamed of your sexual preferences. Only you can decide who you're attracted to and what type of sex you want.;
, Talking with your partner can establish trust while helping you feel more positive about having sex. A good partner should be considerate of your feelings and willing to help you through the process. If your potential partner pressures you too much or makes you feel uncomfortable, reconsider having sex with them.


Talk about birth control and protection before you have sex. You might say, “I’m on birth control, but you’re still going to use a condom, right?”
Let them know what your fears and expectations are and how you're feeling. You might say, “I’m really nervous about it hurting the first time.”
Tell your partner if there’s something you want to try or something you absolutely don’t want to do. For example, you can tell them, “I don’t mind oral sex, but I’m not really into anal.”
If you’re nervous or anxious, let them know. If they dismiss your feelings, it may be a sign that they do not take your concerns seriously.

, You might feel awkward discussing sex with an adult, but you should at least identify someone you can reach out to for help. This could be a parent, a doctor, nurse, school counselor, or an older sibling. They can give you advice, answer your questions, and provide access to protection. Even if you don't end up talking to them beforehand, you may want to have someone you could contact in case of emergency.

, Understanding your own anatomy can help you feel more confident, especially if your partner is also a virgin. Knowing what goes where, what's normal, and what to expect can help ease your anxiety. Some places you can look include Planned Parenthood, Sex, Etc. and Scarleteen.


Masturbation can help you understand what you enjoy when it comes to sex. Before having sex with a partner, try experimenting with yourself.

, The hymen is a thin membrane that partially covers the vaginal opening. It starts to wear away over time due to a variety of activities, such as sports, tampon usage, menstruation, or normal movement. Many people believe that the hymen breaking is what makes sex painful for virgins, but that’s not necessarily true.


If you're a teenager, there’s a chance only part of your hymen is left. This is normal, especially if you've started having periods. If you want to check, you can see your hymen using a flashlight and a hand mirror.
Light spotting may occur for a few hours after your first time. Some girls won't bleed at all. If you do bleed, it shouldn't be very much. Any bleeding that happens should not be the same level as a period.
Breaking your hymen shouldn't be very painful. Pain during sex is usually caused by friction. This can happen if you are not lubricated or aroused enough.
In some cases, your hymen may not break at all. The hymen may stretch, or it might be large enough that sex does not tear the hymen.

, If you can help your partner ease into you at the correct angle, you'll avoid some potentially painful fumbling. Most vaginas are angled with a forward tilt toward the belly. If you were standing, your vagina would be at a 45-degree angle to the floor.If you use tampons, take note of how you approach inserting a tampon. Try to recreate that same angle when you start penetrative sex.
If you don't use tampons, insert a finger next time you're in the shower. Aim toward your lower back; if that doesn't feel comfortable, shift forward slightly until you find a point that's comfortable.

, Women rarely experience orgasm from penetration alone. Instead, clitoral stimulation usually causes them to orgasm. Oral sex or clitoral stimulation before penetration can relax the muscles.


Try to locate your clitoris before you have sex. You can do this by masturbating or by looking with a mirror and a flashlight. This can help you guide your partner to it during sex, especially if your partner is also a virgin.
Orgasming before penetration may actually help reduce pain during sex. Try to engage in oral sex during foreplay and before penetration. Your partner can also stimulate your clitoris with their fingers or a sex toy.

, If you're constantly worried about getting caught, you might not have much fun. Make it easier on yourself and your partner by choosing a time and place where you won't be disturbed.


Look for privacy, a comfortable surface to lie down on, and a time when you aren't worried about being on a schedule.
Think about whether you're more comfortable having sex at your place or theirs.
If you're in a dorm or if you share a room, you might ask your roommate to give you some time alone that night.

, Loosen up by making the atmosphere stress-free. Clean up any distracting clutter, shut off your phone, and remove anything else that might make you feel nervous or keep you from focusing on your partner.


Dim lighting, soft music, and a warm room temperature can help make you feel safe and comfortable.
Consider taking some time to groom yourself beforehand so that you feel relaxed and confident.

, Make sure you and your partner have openly agreed to have sex. If you're not sure how your partner is feeling, ask before going forward. Just because your partner doesn't say ""no,"" it doesn't mean you have consent.They should respond with a confident, absolute “yes.”


If your partner doesn’t want sex, do not pressure them. If you do not want sex, they should back off when you say no.
Consent also means that you shouldn’t do anything that your partner isn’t enthusiastic about.

, Condoms protect against both pregnancy and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Using protection may help you relax if you are nervous about getting pregnant or a disease. Even if you're on another form of birth control, a condom gives you an extra layer of protection. If your partner refuses to use a condom, you may want to reconsider having sex with them.


There are both male and female condoms available.
The most important thing about condoms is that they fit. Partners should buy a few different types of condoms. Try them on and see what fits best. If your partner has a latex allergy, nitrile condoms are a great alternative.

, Lubricant will ease a lot of the pain by reducing friction. It can also help prevent condoms from breaking during sex. Apply lubricant to your partner's penis or sex toy before they penetrate you.


If you're using latex condoms, do not use an oil-based lubricant. These can weaken the latex and cause the condom to tear or break. Instead, use a silicone- or water-based lube. It is safe to use any type of lube with a nitrile or polyurethane condom.

, Try to enjoy the moment instead of rushing to the finish line. Spend time figuring out what you and your partner both enjoy. Start with kissing, move to making out, and stick to whatever pace feels most comfortable for both of you.


Foreplay can help you relax while increasing arousal. It can also increase your natural lubrication, making it easier for your partner to enter you painlessly.
Remember that you can stop having sex at any point. Consent is active and ongoing. You have the right to stop or withdraw consent at any point you want.

, Don't be afraid to ask for what you need in the moment. If something feels good, let your partner know. If something is causing you pain or discomfort, tell them. They should be willing to do what it takes to make you feel pleasure instead of pain.


If you’re feeling pain, try slowing down, moving more gently, or using more lubrication. For example, if you feel pain, you might say, “Do you mind if we slow down? This is hurting me right now.”
You can ask your partner to try a different position if the one you’re using is uncomfortable. For example, if you are on top of your partner, you can better control the speed and angle of penetration.

, If you have pain or bleeding, deal with it before it becomes too overbearing. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever, clean up any blood, and wear a light pad for a few hours. If you experience extreme pain, you need to talk to a trusted adult or see a health care provider.

Exercise daily.,
Get at least 7 hours of sleep each night.,
De-stress.,
Take herbal supplements.,
Avoid practices that decrease blood flow.",How to Increase Uterine Lining1," Exercising increases the blood flow throughout your body, and that includes blood flow to your uterus.Good blood flow builds a better endometrium. Take at least thirty minutes out of your day to be active – whether you like to swim, run, bike, do yoga, or just take a walk.

If you have a job that requires you to sit still a lot, try to get up and move around for two minutes out of every hour.;
, Stay well rested to keep your hormone levels stable – estrogen and other hormones balance out while you sleep.Try to develop a healthy sleep pattern to ensure you get 7-9 hours of sleep nightly. Try the following to improve your sleep pattern:

Set a specific time to go to bed and wake up each day.
Avoid napping during the day.
Save your bedroom for sleep – don’t watch TV in bed, for instance.
Have a relaxing nighttime routine, like taking a warm bath or giving yourself a hand massage.
Sleep in a cool, dark room.

, Stress and the chemicals it releases can affect your body negatively, including your hormone balance. Manage your stress by taking time each day to relax. Try yoga, meditation, a creative project like writing or painting, aromatherapy, or anything else that relaxes you. If you have a stressful home or work life, try to practice mindfulness., Though these are not scientifically proven to increase uterine thickness, taking certain herbs may help increase your circulation and thus improve blood flow to your uterus, or may amp up your body’s estrogen supply. Many supplements can be found at your pharmacy, health food store, or online (but be sure to buy from a reputable seller). Check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting an herbal supplement – they’re natural, but they can still interact with other medications or medical conditions. Consider the following to boost or balance estrogen levels, or increase circulation:Wild yam
Black cohosh
Dong quai
Licorice
Red clover, Just as you can try practices to increase your blood flow, you should avoid doing anything that minimizes your blood flow. Some of the most common practices that decrease blood flow are:Smoking: Quit smoking! It’s hazardous to your health and decreases blood flow.
Drinking caffeine: Aim to minimize your caffeine to 1 cup per day. Cut back caffeine gradually to avoid withdrawal effects.
Taking decongestants: Allergy and sinus medications that contain phenylepherine or other “vasoconstrictors” narrow blood vessels, so try to use other products without this ingredient.

Visit your doctor.,
Try estrogen therapy.,
Take a vasodilator medication.,
Increase your Vitamin E. Taking vitamin E may improve blood flow to the uterine lining and improve endometrial thickness.,
Take an l-arginine supplement.",How to Increase Uterine Lining2," If you’re having an irregular period or a difficult time getting pregnant, visit your regular doctor or your OB/GYN. There are many reasons this can occur, so have a physical examination to rule out other causes than thin uterine lining. If a thin endometrium is your problem, your doctor will be the best person to help you decide on treatment.

It’s important to determine the cause of your thin endometrium to best treat the condition.

, The first step to increase uterine lining is usually to manipulate your hormones using estrogen therapy.Your doctor may prescribe you a method of birth control that contains estrogen, or give you estrogen in the form of a pill, patch, gel, cream, or spray.Taking estrogen can increase your risk for blood clots, heart disease, and some cancers.Discuss your health history and family history with your doctor.

, Your uterine lining needs good blood flow to grow, so restricted arteries can cause a thin endometrium.Talk to your doctor about whether you can take a medication that expands your blood vessels, called a vasodilator, to improve blood flow to your uterus.

People with certain medical conditions should not take vasodilators, and these medications can cause side effects like fast heartbeat, fluid retention, headache, chest pain, and nausea.Discuss your health history with your doctor before starting any medication.

, Eat foods rich in vitamin E, and talk to your doctor about taking a vitamin E supplement – sometimes called tocopherol.The recommended daily intake of vitamin E is 15mg for women; ask your doctor about higher doses to increase uterine lining – 600mg were given to women in studies.Foods high in vitamin E include:Almonds, pine nuts, hazelnuts, peanuts, and peanut butter
Raw seeds like pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame
Swiss chard, kale, and spinach
Mustard greens, turnip greens, and parsley
Avocado, broccoli, tomato, and olives
Mango, papaya, and kiwi
Wheat germ oil, safflower oil, and corn oil

, There is good scientific evidence that taking an l-arginine supplement helps people with heart trouble and leg pain due to clogged arteries.Because of its ability to expand arteries and improve blood flow, taking l-arginine may help to increase uterine lining.You can get these supplements at your pharmacy or health food store.

There is no set dosing limit for l-arginine, but it can be taken anywhere in the range of 0.5-15mg for different ailments.Studies have used 6 g/day to treat thin uterine lining. Talk to your doctor about dosing and whether this supplement is right for you.

Ask about low-dose aspirin therapy.,
Discuss pentoxifylline with your doctor.,
Research cytokine treatment.",How to Increase Uterine Lining3," Taking low-dose aspirin has been shown to improve some women’s rate of pregnancy, though it’s in question whether this is due to increasing the thickness of the uterine lining.Only take aspirin with your doctor’s approval, after discussing your health history., Pentoxifylline (Trental) is a medication that increases your blood flow. It’s been combined with vitamin E to thicken the uterine lining of women trying to get pregnant.It can make you dizzy and may upset your stomach. Discuss pentoxifylline with your doctor, and be sure to tell them the following:If you’re allergic to caffeine or any drugs
What medications you’re taking, especially any blood-thinners (anticoagulants)
If you have or ever had kidney problems
If you’re trying to get pregnant
If you’re having surgery soon

, If standard practices have failed to help thicken your uterine lining, consider working with a specialist to try a newer medical procedure. Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has improved the endometrium in trials of women preparing for in vitro fertilization. This is a new method that is still being studied, but ask your doctor whether it’s something to consider."

Exercise your PC muscles.,
Masturbate before sex.,
Train with the start-and-stop method.,
Stop having sex for a little while.",How to Last Longer in Bed Naturally1," You want to work on contracting your pubococcygeus (PC) muscle, which is located between your anus and urinary sphincter. To find it, try stopping your flow while peeing. When you get it to stop, that is the muscle you are working. Give yourself some time to tighten and contract the muscle during the day, three sets of 15 contractions, which will make it stronger and give you more confidence to use it if you need to slow down.Consider doing other, similar exercises that work your pelvic muscles, including yoga, kegels, and pilates. These can allow you to strengthen these muscles, and will give you better control over yourself.;
, About an hour or two before sex, take some time to stimulate yourself and ejaculate. It takes men some time to recover between finishing, so doing so a little bit beforehand will help you slow down., Another way to help yourself last longer is to train yourself while masturbating. Get yourself close to finishing, then stop and slowly calm down. Build yourself back up, then calm down again.This technique will help you learn your limits, and how far you can push yourself before the point of no return. Once you know these limits, you will be better able to control yourself before getting to the point where you can’t stop.

, If your problems are related to performance anxiety, it may be helpful to take a little break. Talk to a doctor and your partner about avoiding sex for a set period of time.This doesn’t mean losing intimacy. Use this time without intercourse to focus on other types of sexual play. This will help you learn to create pleasure for both yourself and your partner, taking the pressure away when you get back to having sex.

"
"
Engage in foreplay.,
Change your position.,
Go slower.,
Practice the 7 and 9 technique.,
Try the pause-squeeze technique.",How to Last Longer in Bed Naturally2," Intercourse is usually better for men’s climaxing, but women need other stimuli to get there. Some foreplay before penetration, such as rubbing, petting, kissing, and giving oral sex can help enhance your partner’s pleasure while delaying your gratification., Sometimes you and your partner get into a rhythm or rut in the same positions, which will make you anticipate finishing sooner. Trying a new position in bed can be a distraction, and make you last longer as you think about how it feels.Another way to change is in the middle of sex. If you start to feel close to finishing, stop and switch around to another position.One position to avoid if you are trying to last longer is doggy style. This can be a good position if you want a quick session, but most men will last longer in positions like missionary or girl-on-top., Make yourself last longer by giving yourself time between thrusts, maybe waiting 3 seconds between in and out strokes. Slowly increase over the next 4 to 5 minutes. You don’t need to mimic a jackhammer, as going faster will probably make you finish faster.If you start to feel like you are close, stop thrusting and hold yourself inside your partner until you feel in control again.
Another way to slow yourself down is to focus on other activities. Caress and explore your partner’s body, using your hands and lips to explore.

, Sex experts say that the 7 and 9 technique can help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last longer. Do seven fast in-and-out strokes, followed by nine slow strokes, and repeat for the duration of intercourse., One way for you and your partner to help prevent you from finishing too soon is the pause-squeeze technique, which involves putting pressure on your penis. When you feel almost ready to ejaculate, have your partner squeeze your penis where the head meets the shaft. Hold for several seconds until your urge to ejaculate has passed. Once your partner lets go, wait 30 seconds, then go back to foreplay.You can also try squeezing and pushing other parts of your penis. Make a tight ring with your index finger and thumb around the base of your shaft. This will help maintain blood flow to keep you erect. You can also press the area between your anus and the base of your testicles. Pushing in this area, called the perineum, will prevent flow, and help slow down an early release."
"
Think confidently about yourself and your ability.,
Think about psychological difficulties.,
Talk to your partner.,
Visit a therapist.",How to Last Longer in Bed Naturally3," Anxiety as a tendency to build on itself, meaning that feeling anxious about your performance will make it more likely that you will finish even quicker. Instead, think confidently about your ability to last longer. If you start to feel anxious, stop and take a breath, and think about how you enjoy sex with your partner, rather than your worries over finishing early., Some doctors believe that finishing prematurely may be the result of personal problems or bad habits developed in past experiences, both in your current relationship and in previously ones. By identifying these possible trouble spots, you can better work through them with your partner or a therapist.Some problems from your past include hurrying to climax in order to avoid being discovered, or rushing through sexual encounters to avoid guilt.

, The desire to last longer is usually about increasing the pleasure and intimacy for both of you. If this has only become an issue recently, or with your current partner, it may be a sign of interpersonal difficulties between the two of you. Consider talking with your partner about your relationship and any issues that may have arisen recently.


Talking to your partner may also demonstrate that you have nothing to worry about. Your partner may not find anything wrong with how long you last. At the same time, your partner may also have some ideas for new positions and foreplay that can increase intimacy and passion, as well as the length of time., You can consider counseling to work through relationship or other issues. A counselor can be particularly helpful in terms of reducing stress and overcoming performance anxiety. If you think your problems are relationship-based, you may want to visit the therapist or counselor with your partner.Counseling sessions tend to be most helpful when combined with drug therapy, so they may not always be the most natural course. This, of course, depends on the kind of problems you are having.

Try eating vegetable-based protein and full-fat dairy.,
Sleep at night.,
Cut down your caffeine intake.,
Stop smoking.,
Slow down on the alcohol.,
Slow down on exercise.,
Be wary around chemicals.",How to Induce Ovulation Naturally," Milk thistle is an herb that can detox the liver.In turn, that may help your body process estrogen better. What that means is your hormones may be better balanced, so you may start ovulating more regularly.You can take 80 to 160 milligrams up to 3 times a day. Always ask your doctor if you can take supplements safely.;
, Job's tears has been used in India to induce ovulation. While most evidence is anecdotal, it may help you, too. Make a tea of the leaves by steeping them in hot water. You can also take the seeds as a supplement, which may also help induce ovulation., Chasteberry may help increase your chances of ovulating, as some women find it beneficial. It likely works by telling your body to produce more luteinizing hormone, which in turn promotes ovulation.Try taking 1,000 milligrams once a day in the morning. You shouldn't take this drug if you're also taking birth control pills or hormones.

, For this drug, you'll only take it on days 5 through 14 of your cycle. Some women find it helpful for ovulation. Try 750 milligrams once a day, just on the days when you're near ovulation., Many women have luck using Chinese herbs to help induce ovulation. You should be able to find a Chinese herbal mixture specifically for fertility at Chinese herb stores. Look for ingredients like Dang Gui, Gan Cao, Bai Shao, and Chuan Xiong., If needles don't bother you, acupuncture may help with ovulation. In some women, it lowers the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) when it is too high. For instance, if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), your FSH level might be too high, which in turn can mess up your cycle and how you ovulate.Don't worry. The needles used in acupuncture are very small, and most people don't find them painful.

, You may have heard your doctor drone on about maintaining a healthy weight, but you may not know your weight can affect ovulation and fertility. This rule applies both if your overweight and if you're underweight. Aim for a BMI between 20 and 27.If you don't know your BMI, ask your doctor, or use an online calculator where you put in information like your height, weight, and age.Eating a healthy diet, full of fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy can help you lose weight if you need to and may also help your fertility., Some women have luck eating some vegetable-based protein (such as nuts and beans) in place of meat-based protein to increase the chances of ovulation. Others find eating at least one serving of full-fat dairy a day helped increase their chances., If possible, stick to sleeping at night. If you have a job that puts you on the night shift, see if you can switch to the day shift. Sleeping during the day may throw your hormones off-balance, which in turn may mess up your ovulation. Plus, most people get better sleep at night.Getting enough sleep (7 to 8 hours) may also be helpful.

, You don't have to skip that morning cup of Joe that jolts you into your day. However, if you're downing more than 200 milligrams in a day, it could be affecting your fertility and ovulation.For reference, a typical 8-ounce cup of coffee has anywhere from 95 milligrams to 165 milligrams, while black tea ranges from 25 milligrams to 48 milligrams., You may have been looking for a reason to quit, and here's the perfect one. Smoking can decrease your fertility overall, including ovulation. So put out that cigarette, and ask for help. Quitting is always easier with help!Support groups can help, as can letting your friends and family know that you're quitting. They can help you when you're feeling restless and need something to do besides smoking.

, You probably don't need to give up alcohol altogether, but you should skip drinking binges. A glass of wine every now and then is fine, but chugging shots and beers on Friday night is probably not going to do you any favors when it comes to ovulation.It's also a good idea to avoid recreational drugs altogether, such as marijuana and cocaine.

, Don't get too excited here. You still need to exercise. But when you exercise too hard, it can affect your ovulation, which is especially true for professional athletes. To increase your chances of ovulating, you shouldn't exercise more than 5 hours each week but talk to your doctor about what's best for you., Exposure to some chemicals, such as herbicides, pesticides, and chemicals in manufacturing jobs, may affect your ovulation. Try to limit your exposure to any chemicals that could possibly have a negative effect on your ovulation.Also, look for BPA-free plastics for foods and liquids.

Reduce or eliminate processed foods and switch to a diet low in fats, and high in protein. Eat many vegetables and whole grains, and buy organic foods when possible. Drink plenty of water. Anything that is beneficial to your overall health is also beneficial to your little mini-me's.;
, These nutrients can lower sperm defects and increase sperm motility. It is as easy as including an orange for dessert! A single 8-ounce (230 ml) glass of fresh orange juice contains about 124 milligrams of vitamin C — a full day's supply.

, It's associated with increased semen volume, sperm count, and testosterone levels. Take in about 11mg daily, which you can get by eating walnuts, beans, oysters, beef, and chicken.

, Amino acids, traces of which can be found in meats, fruits, and vegetables, are believed to increase sperm count and keep the sperm from clumping. Amino acids that you can incorporate into your diet include:


L-Carnitine, which can be found in red meat and milk
L-Arginine, which can be found in nuts, sesame seeds, and eggs
L-Lysine, which can be found in dairy and cheeses

, Folic acid (Vitamin B9) may contribute to an increase for semen. The 400 micrograms daily are found in cereals, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and orange juice.

, If you do spend more time in the sun, be sure to lather up with some sunscreen to prevent damage from harmful rays and possible melanoma.

, Allicin, an organosulfur compound, increases sperm volume by optimizing blood flow to your sexual organs, creating millions of happier sperm. Find new and interesting dishes to add to your garlic repertoire, or beast it and act like a real man by adding a clove or two of raw garlic to your vegetable smoothie in the morning.

, If you want your sperm to be brimming with healthy little apples of your eye, consider incorporating more of the following foodsinto your diet:

Take note.",How to Increase Sperm Volume2," Certain lifestyle habits, which stress your body and immune system, will lead to a lower sperm count. If you are trying to make a baby, it's best to refrain from smoking, drugs (except prescription drugs — check with your doctor on this one), and alcohol in moderation.

, Not literally, but make sure your testicles are not jammed up against your body. Heat will kill the little guys, so switch to boxers and give them some breathing room. If there's a reason that men are born with testicles on the outside of their body, it's for them to stay nice and cool.

, Bicycle seats are notorious for reducing sperm count, and if you think about it for a moment, you will realize why. The pressure, the jostling, the bouncing — none of these are what sperm enjoy. Switch to the car or the bus while you're in sperm production mode, and your workers will respond with higher production.

, Yes, it's conducive to the right mood, but while you're making moony eyes, they're succumbing to heatstroke. Leave the tubbing for relaxation afterwards.

, Stress kills, and while you may be able to handle it for a while, your sperm is not nearly so rugged. Stress can interfere with the hormones needed to assist in sperm production. Given any kind of emotional (or physical) abuse, and they'll wriggle off to that great scrotum in the sky, never to return.

, Being too large — or too small — can affect hormonal balance. Too much estrogen or too little testosterone will have a negative impact on your sperm count. So hit the gym before you hit the sack, and find new and interesting ways to keep yourself motivated, so you don't give up on your weight loss mission before it starts.

, While they may help you bulk up your muscles, your un-muscular testicles will shrink. Regardless of sperm count issues, who wants that? Anabolic steroids are harmful to your overall health.

, Your body does most of the good production work while you sleep — and that includes sperm production. Get a full 8 hours of sleep every night when you're working on upping your sperm count...

, PC muscle exercises are used by men not only to last longer, but also to increase the volume of their sperm. There are a lot of PC muscle exercises that you can do to both satisfy your partner and give your progeny the best shot at success.

, Lubricants, while helpful for the process, may be harmful for the results. That's because lubricants, including saliva, lotions, and jellies, can interfere with sperm movement. If you need to, try using vegetable oil, peanut oil, or a lubricant such as PreSeed, which may not harm your sperm.

, Toxic chemicals and radiation can cause permanent damage to sperm. If you regularly work with toxic chemicals, be sure to wear protective covering (gloves, masks, etc.) so you limit exposure to your skin. Avoid areas that you know produce too much of radiation, and only opt for medical procedures involving radiation if necessary.

, All the above advice will not only help you increase the quantity of sperm, it will also improve the quality. Keep them healthy, active, and ready for the journey to come, and with any luck, one of them will reward you by becoming a baby!

Look for swelling.,
Feel for a hydrocele.,
Pay attention to any difficulty walking that you experience.,
Monitor any increase in swelling as time goes on.,
Be aware of any pain you feel while urinating.",How to Know if You Have Hydrocele1," Stand in front of the mirror and look at your scrotum. If you have a hydrocele, at least one side of your scrotum will be larger than it normally is.If you are trying to determine if an infant is suffering from a hydrocele, the procedure will be similar. Look for swelling in the testicles. The swelling may be on either or both sides of the testicles.;
, Often, a hydrocele will feel like a fluid-filled sac inside the scrotum. Gently grasp your swollen testicle and see if you can feel this balloon-like sac in your scrotum.Typically, a hydrocele will not feel painful. If, when touching your scrotum, you experience pain, contact your doctor as it could indicate something more serious.
If an infant has a swollen testicle, you can identify a hydrocele by gently feeling the scrotum. Inside the scrotum, you will feel the testicle, and if there is a hydrocele, you will feel a second lump that feels like a soft, fluid-filled sac. In infants, this sac could be as small as a peanut.Your doctor will do a physical examination and order an ultrasound to diagnose a hydrocele. Your doctor may also perform the flashlight test. If the mass trans-illuminates under exposure to a flashlight, then it is a hydrocele. If it doesn’t then it may be something more serious like a mass or hernia.

, The more your scrotum swells, the more likely it is that you will have a hard time walking.Men with this issue have described the feeling as a dragging sensation, like something heavy was tied to their testicles.This is because gravity pulls your scrotum down, but because there is fluid in it that wasn’t there for most of your life, it will feel heavier than normal.


You might also experience this dragging sensation when you stand up after you have been lying or sitting down for a while.

, If you do not begin treatment for the hydrocele, your scrotum will continue to swell. If this happens, you might find it hard to put on your regular pants, instead opting to wear baggier pants so that no pressure is put on your swollen scrotum.


If you believe you might have a hydrocele, it is best to have a doctor determine the cause of the problem. Sometimes, a hydrocele is an indication of a hernia, which needs to be treated by a doctor., Normally, you won’t feel any pain while urinating if you have a hydrocele. However, if your hydrocele is caused by an infection in the epididymis and testis (which is referred to as epididymal orchitis) you will most likely feel pain when you go to the bathroom. You should talk to a doctor right away if you begin experiencing this pain."

Understand what causes hydroceles in adult men.,
Be aware that hernias can cause hydroceles.,
Know that filariasis can cause a type of hydrocele.,
Visit a doctor.",How to Know if You Have Hydrocele2," Men can have hydroceles for many reasons, the three most common of which are inflammation, infection (such as a sexually transmitted infection), or injury to one or both of their testicles. It can also be caused by injury or infection in the epididymis (a coil-like tube at the back of the testicles which is responsible for the maturation, storage and transport of sperm).Sometimes, a hydrocele can also be formed if your tunica vaginalis (the membrane-like covering that covers your testes) collects too much fluid without being able to get rid of it.
To differentiate hydrocele from other testicular pathology, such as cancer or hernia, shine a flashlight on the scrotum and see if the scrotum transilluminates (allows light to pass through the mass). To do this, dim the lights and shine a bright flashlight at the scrotum.If the scrotum transilluminates, then the mass is a hydrocele.

, A hernia can cause a hydrocele. However, this form of hydrocele generally presents itself as swelling higher up in the scrotum. To put it in perspective, this sort of swelling is about 2 to 4 centimeter (0.8 to 1.6 in) from the base of the scrotum.A hernia occurs when an organ protrudes through the tissue that normally contains it.In the case of a hydrocele, it is not uncommon for a piece of the intestine to protrude through the abdominal wall into the scrotum and is known as an inguinal hernia.

, Filariasis is a tropical disease that is caused by filarial worms get into a person’s lymph vessels. These worms are also the cause of elephantiasis. Instead of abdomen fluid, these worms cause a hydrocele to form that is actually filled with cholesterol and can be referred to as a chylocele.If you live in the United States and have never visited Asia, Africa, a Western Pacific Island or any part of the Caribbean or South American, then you do not need to worry about this. However, if you live in any of these places or have spent time in these areas prior to your hydrocele development, you should visit a doctor as soon as possible.

, If you have a hydrocele, it is generally best to visit a doctor because a hydrocele could indicate more serious problems.Before your appointment, write down any recent injuries around the genital area that have occurred, any symptoms you have had (e.g. pain or difficulty walking), any medications you are taking, any inflammatory conditions of the scrotum, and when the hydrocele appeared.

Testicles develop in a fetus’s abdomen, very close to the kidneys, which later descend into the scrotum through a tunnel known as the inguinal canal. When the testicles descend, they are preceded by a sac that’s formed from the lining of the abdomen (this is called the processus vaginalis).The processus vaginalis normally closes above the testicles, which prevents fluid from entering. If it doesn’t close properly, a hydrocele can form.
Hydroceles result from a reaction to testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, or trauma. These conditions are ruled out by physical examination and ultrasound.

, A communicating hydrocele means that the sac around the testicles (the process vaginalis) remains open, rather than closing up like it's supposed to. When it remains open, it allows fluid to get into the scrotum, creating the hydrocele.While the sac remains open, fluid can flow back and forth from the abdomen to the scrotum which means that the size of the scrotum will get larger and smaller throughout the day.

, A non-communicating hydrocele forms when the testicles descend as they should with the sac (the processus vaginalis) closing up around them. However, the fluid that goes into the sac with the testicles doesn’t get absorbed by your child’s body, so it gets trapped in the scrotum and forms a hydrocele.This type of hydrocele usually disappears within the first year of a child’s life. However, in an older child, it could indicate a more serious problem, and should be seen by a doctor. If your child was born with a non-communicating hydrocele that doesn’t disappear within one year, ask your child’s doctor to check the hydrocele again.

, Although it is usually nothing to worry about, if an infant has a hydrocele that your doctor has not already addressed, you should talk to them about the hydrocele, especially if the baby is over one year old. This is because it could indicate a more serious problem.Take note of when you first noticed the hydrocele, whether or not the child is experiencing any pain, and anything else that could be related to the hydrocele.
A majority of the hydroceles resolve in newborns by one year of age. Surgical intervention is warranted in those that do not resolve after one year, those that are communicating hydroceles, and those that are idiopathic hydroceles that are symptomatic.

Cut back on eating processed foods high in sodium and refined sugar, and eat more whole foods on a daily basis.;
, Being overweight or obese can result in hormonal imbalance and have adverse effects on your fertility. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine whether you’re considered medically overweight or obese, and take steps immediately to lose weight and achieve a healthy, normal body mass index (BMI).

, Exercise is associated with a number of health benefits, and can help improve sperm motility by regulating hormones and contributing to weight loss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that American adults engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, accompanied by strength-training sessions at least two times per week., Stress can suppress and decrease sexual function, and can result in major hormonal imbalance when experienced long-term. Take steps to manage and reduce stress in your life as much as possible, and practice deep breathing and other activities that help you relax in times of stress.

, Certain chemicals and toxins released into the atmosphere by everyday products and equipment can increase your risk for fertility problems and decrease sperm motility. Stop using or consuming the following products that can be harmful to sperm motility:


Plastic kitchenware products that contain bisphenol A (BPA).
Bleached paper products such as white coffee filters, toilet paper, and napkins.
Chlorinated tap water and bleach.
Foods that have been treated with or contain pesticides, herbicides, preservatives, and other man-made ingredients.
Synthetic cosmetics, toiletries, and deodorants.
Animal food products that contain synthetic hormones, such as chicken, beef, pork, and conventional dairy products such as cow’s milk.
Tobacco products and secondhand smoke.

, If you’re unable to get the daily recommended amount of nutrients and vitamins needed to improve good sperm health through food and multivitamins, consult with your healthcare provider about supplementation. Vitamin C, zinc, arginine, essential fatty acids, chromium, selenium, copper, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, and B-complex vitamins are all nutrients that have been shown to increase sperm motility in men., Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and chlamydia can worsen fertility and sperm motility. Protect your sexual health by using condoms or by staying monogamous with an uninfected partner to lower your risk for STDs., Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol on a regular basis can inhibit sperm motility and result in hormonal imbalance. Stop drinking alcohol, or consult with your healthcare provider to get recommendations on the amount of alcohol you can drink safely without affecting your fertility.

, Certain medications such as calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, anti-androgens, anabolic steroids, chemotherapy drugs, and radiation treatments can all result in problems with fertility. If you are currently taking medications that affect sperm motility, speak to your health care provider about alternate treatments that won’t contribute to worsened sperm health."

Take it slow.,
Change it up.,
Take breaks.,
Focus on foreplay.,
Use thicker protection.,
Try a desensitizing cream.",How to Improve Sexual Stamina1," Sex doesn't have to be fast and furious. Keep your movements slow and steady and let stimulation build gradually. Instead of being forceful, tease and titillate your partner by holding back and varying the angle, speed and deepness of penetration. When both partners are ready you can speed up together for an explosive finish.


One variation of this is called the ""7 and 9"" technique: keep yourself (and potentially your partner) stimulated without going over the edge of climax by alternating between seven fast strokes and nine slow strokes.;
, One of the best ways to keep your energy up, prevent cramps and avoid premature ejaculation is to change positions, speeds and acts more frequently. When you feel yourself approaching orgasm, switch to a new position or stop to give your partner some manual or oral pleasure. Along with helping you last longer, this will give you a more interesting and varied sexual experience.

, If you feel yourself getting too close to climax, or just running out of steam, just stop for a few minutes. You can use this time to enjoy foreplay, talk dirty, or switch to stimulating your partner manually or orally. When you've had a chance to cool down, dive back in for another round of intercourse.

, Penetrative intercourse isn't the be-all and end-all of sex. You can give your partner a longer experience by taking the time to have great foreplay. Kissing, touching, pillow talk, and the use of toys or restraints can all make for awesome, memorable sex. Give your partner a lot oral and manual stimulation to get them ahead of you—or even get them to climax one or more times before penetration. If you make the most of several or all of the activities in your sexual toolbox, a few minutes of intercourse may be all either partner needs—or wants—to be satisfied.

, While some argue that there is little noticeable difference between different condoms, many men and women swear using thicker condoms can reduce sensitivity and let them hold off orgasm longer. Using lube in conjunction with a condom has also been shown to help men last longer., Many sex stores and sexual health retailers sell creams that can be applied to the penis to numb sensations during sex, thus allowing men to hold off their climax longer. Of course stopping to put on a chemical cream isn't the sexiest thing you can do in bed, so this method may be best saved for comfortable and committed sexual relationships.Look for a cream that absorbs into your skin to prevent numbing your partner as well.

Eat right.,
Exercise.,
Stay stress free.,
Practice.",How to Improve Sexual Stamina2," Lack of sexual stamina, for both men and women, can be a symptom of larger problems with your health and diet. To have a great sex life, eat healthy foods and maintain a healthy weight.


Avoid foods that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, as these can clog your arteries and reduce blood flow. Good blood flow is vital to having the best sexual experience., Good sex can be hard, tiring work! Like any physical activity, your stamina in bed can be improved by staying fit. Shoot for 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least five days a week, plus strength training twice a week. Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, will keep you healthy, promote good blood flow and give you the energy to have great sex. Plus exercise can improve your body image and make you a more confident lover.

, Stress can make it hard to stay focused, aroused and happy during sex—and it can constrict the blood flow necessary for healthy sex. To improve stamina and enjoyment, both men and women should reduce stress in their life—or at least learn to leave it outside the bedroom.

, As with any activity, practice makes perfect. Have more sex with your partner using the techniques above and soon enough your stamina and control over your orgasm will improve and come more naturally.


Masturbation is also a good way to train yourself to control your climax. Practice getting close to orgasm but stopping right before. Repeat several times before you finish. This will help you learn to notice when you are at the edge of climax, and control yourself when you get there. You don't have to do this every time you masturbate, but occasionally challenging yourself to see how long you can last can be fun and helpful.
Masturbating too often in the same way, however, can train your body to only respond to certain kinds of stimulation—which can be troublesome when you want to reach your climax during intercourse. Be sure to vary your routine: switching hands, using lube, trying sex toys, and exploring different kinds of mental and visual stimulation.

"
"
Don't worry.,
Think about something else.",How to Improve Sexual Stamina3," One of the most common causes of premature ejaculation in men is nervousness and anxiety over the quality of one's performance.The best thing to do is relax and focus on enjoying the closeness with your partner. Remember that sex is about intimacy as much as pleasure, and great sex comes from chemistry much more than stamina or skill. If you find yourself getting stressed or ""in your head,"" take a deep breath and spend a moment reconnecting with your partner.

, The classic way that men, and some women, use to control the timing of their orgasm is to concentrate on some mundane topic while having sex. Put the pleasure you are receiving to the back of your mind, and try doing a few basic math problems in your head until you are finally ready to climax.


Avoid thinking about topics or images that stress you out or turn you off. These can cause you to lose your arousal during sex, instead of simply letting you extend it. Instead try to think about something more abstract, such as visualizing geometric shapes or recalling the lyrics to a favorite song.
Don't extend your stamina at the expense of being present with your partner. Long sex can be dull for both of you if you spend the whole time with your head in the clouds. Use this technique sparingly and instead focus on engaging and being active with your partner.

Review the side effects of prescribed medications.",How to Increase Sperm Count Naturally," Whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and sources of lean protein contain vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients your body needs to function optimally. More specifically, studies have found that healthy fats, oysters, and foods rich in vitamin C, vitamin B12, and folate are most effective at increasing sperm count naturally.Avoid consuming processed foods and foods that contain artificial additives, including preservatives. These types of foods lack the nutrients your body needs to produce high, healthy sperm count.;
, Sperm and semen are mostly comprised of water, which means lack of water can lead to dehydration and lower sperm count. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water per day or more if you exercise, and swap out sodas, coffee, and sugary fruit juices for water.

, Man-made chemicals such as pesticides, plastics, and artificial additives in food can cause your body to produce more estrogen and throw your hormones off balance -- resulting in low sperm count. Avoid using plasticware for food storage, stop drinking chlorinated tap water, stop consuming animal products that contain hormones, and stop using synthetic deodorants and toiletries.

, Evidence has shown that exercise helps increase sperm count naturally by reducing stress and anxiety, and by increasing blood flow. Exercise also helps regulate hormones and allows you to maintain an ideal body weight. Aim for at least 45 minutes of exercise five days per week, or consult with a professional fitness trainer who can recommend the best routine based on your current fitness level.

, Relaxing in a hot bath, wearing tight underwear, using a warm laptop, and sitting down for long periods of time can elevate the temperature of your testes and negatively affect sperm count., Herbs such as Korean ginseng, nutmeg, ginkgo biloba extract, saw palmetto berry, and elk antler velvet contain natural properties that can boost sperm count.

, Being overweight or obese can drastically lower sperm count, since excess body fat decreases testosterone levels. Plus, excess fat can lead to warmer temperatures near your groin and testes. Maintain a healthy body weight by exercising regularly, practicing good nutrition, and getting more sleep.

, Sleep is your body’s time to repair itself, and leads to the further production of sperm. Start going to bed earlier, and make changes to your sleeping environment as needed to get quality sleep without interruptions. Wash your bed sheets often, replace your mattress, buy earplugs or blackout curtains, or listen to soothing music before bedtime to improve your chances for quality sleep.

, Ejaculation is a normal, healthy process for the male body, and helps promote high testosterone, high sperm production, and a healthy sex drive., Smoking inhibits blood flow, and lowers the levels of a protein called protamine 2, which is vital for high sperm count. Stop smoking as soon as you can, and consult with your healthcare provider about smoking cessation programs if you need help quitting., When you’re under physical or emotional stress, the stress hormone cortisol disrupts your natural hormonal balance and lowers the reproductive hormones responsible for managing sperm count. Stress can also have a negative impact on sex drive. Find new ways to manage or reduce stress more effectively, and eliminate stressors from your life, if possible. For example, find a new job you love, start exercising regularly, or spend more time with people who make you feel happy and positive.

, Low sperm count is a common side effect of many over-the-counter medicines and prescription medications. Consult with your healthcare provider about natural, alternative treatments that won’t lower sperm count. For example, if you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, talk to your doctor about the possibility of exercising and eating healthier to improve your condition, versus taking medications that can inhibit sperm production."

Take a baseline, or keep a count, of how many cigarettes you smoke in a day. You can use a calendar, notebook, journal, poster board, or anything that helps you track it consistently. As you track your consumption, try to notice if there are any patterns.


For example, you might notice that on Wednesdays you tend to smoke 5-8 more cigarettes than the rest of the week. What is going on on Wednesdays? Maybe you have a stressful weekly meeting on Wednesdays that wind you up, and you smoke to relieve the anxiety.;
, Set a goal once you have tracked how many cigarettes you typically smoke in a day. Since quitting cold turkey (cutting out smoking completely) is bound to be stressful, difficult, and may lead to a higher rate of relapse, start by limiting your smoking. You may try going from a pack a day, 20 cigarettes, to 15 a day.Only you can decide what is the right amount to cut down to, but a good start may be to cut down by a quarter. For example, if you smoke 16 a day, go to 12. Or go from 12 to 8.

, If you are going to allow yourself five cigarettes a day, decide when you will smoke them. This removes the option of smoking a cigarette when you are feeling bored or have nothing else to do.Instead, you have designated smoking times to keep you accountable.


For example, you might smoke one in the morning, two at work, one in the evening, and one before bed.

, It may be hard to give up the instant gratification of smoking, especially if there's no immediate reward for cutting back. You need to create a system of immediate rewards and consequences. So, if you smoke 2 more cigarettes in a day than you had allowed yourself to, there should be a consequence. Choose consequences that will benefit you in some way.


For example, for every additional cigarette you smoke, tell yourself you have to do 10 minutes of stretching, put a dollar in a jar, clean the bathroom, or journal for an extra 10 minutes. While this is supposed to serve somewhat as a punishment, at least you will have worked in some way to make up for the lapse in discipline., Reward yourself when you meet or exceed your goals. This will make you more likely to continue cutting back. Rewards don't need to be tangible things. You could remind yourself that you're investing in your healthy future and that's a reward in and of itself.For example, if your goal was to smoke no more than 8 cigarettes a day and you only smoked 5, you might reward yourself with a glass of wine, 20 minutes of playing your favorite video game, or free time. Choose something that you enjoy, but don't necessarily have access to all the time., This will create a progress report. You could even graph your cigarette consumption in order to see the peaks and troughs. Here are a few things to consider keeping track of when you're monitoring your smoking habits:Triggers: Watch for what factors trigger higher rates of smoking.
Cost: Track how much money you spend on cigarettes every week. If you're saving money during the week, start putting it aside. After a few weeks, use the money to buy yourself a reward.
Consequences/Rewards: Notice if certain intervention plans (like increasing or decreasing consequences and rewards) are working or not. This way you can change them to make cutting back more effective.

, You may want to limit time around social groups that revolve around smoking. Instead, find new places and activities to enjoy.If you enjoy having a few drinks and smoking on the patio at a local bar, you might find it hard to sit on the patio and not smoke. In this case, try moving inside where smoking is not allowed. This will add a level of inconvenience to smoking since you’ll have to leave the group you are with to go outside.


Give yourself the rule: no smoking in the car. Smoke before or after the car ride. Make smoking as inconvenient and uncomfortable as possible., While this isn't an overwhelming change, changing brands may help you reduce your nicotine intake. For example, if you smoke Marlboro Red 100’s, try switching to shorts or to a more “natural” brand of cigarettes like Sherman’s. Do not let the word “natural” make you think these cigarettes are safe. They are most definitely cigarettes which still contain nicotine. Look for cigarettes based on their nicotine content, which are generally:low-nicotine: filtered cigarettes with the words ""Ultra Light""
medium nicotine: filtered cigarettes with the words ""Light"" or ""Mild""
high nicotine: filtered or unfiltered cigarettes that don't say ""Light"" or ""Ultra Light""

, Another way to reduce cigarette smoking is by smoking a quarter or half of a cigarette. Then wait until your next cigarette break to smoke the second half or quarter.This way, you smoke as often as you normally do, but only half a cigarette at a time. You still get to take your smoking breaks, but it cuts your cigarette consumption in half.

, If you tend to chain smoke in certain settings like a bar or while sitting outside chatting with friends, try setting a timer. It can be easy to lose track and just light another cigarette when you are having a good time. After each cigarette, set a timer on your phone for a time limit of your choosing. Wait until the timer goes off before smoking another cigarette.


As time goes on, try to increase the amount of time in between cigarettes. For example, if you set the timer for 20 minutes, push yourself to wait an extra 2 minutes. If you and your friend are both trying to cut down, you can make it into a small competitive game on who can wait longer., Sometimes it is the oral stimulation that needs to be satisfied in addition to the nicotine craving. Carry things like breath mints, gum, mouthwash sprays, small hard candy, sunflower seeds, or other small (ideally healthy) snacks for whenever you feel the urge to smoke.Avoid high sugar or fattening treats that will just fill you up. Make sure not to use treats as an oral substitute for the long-term., Tell those around you that you are working on this goal. This can create a good social support network to help you reduce your intake. They can also keep you accountable by asking you how you are doing with your goal. If you have friends that smoke, let them know you are trying to cut down so they do not tempt you.You may even inspire your friends or family to cut down as well. Consider referring some of your closer friends and family to this website to help them help you: http://smokefree.gov/social-support., A therapist will help you work through issues and stressors that caused you to smoke in the first place. You can work with a therapist in an individual or group setting. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy can help you learn to deal with stress and make you feel more confident about quitting smoking.You can search The National Association of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists database for certified therapists. Your general practitioner may also be able to recommend a therapist. Be sure to find out about any fees that aren't covered by insurance in advance., Stress is a common trigger for cigarette smoking. While it's impossible to completely avoid stress, setting up a coping strategy will help prevent stress smoking.If you start to feel stressed out and crave something to relax you, try replacing smoking with one of the following:


A short conversation with a friend
10 minutes to yourself to sit quietly and meditate or stretch
A small walk around the block, office, park, or building
Journal writing for 10 minutes
Watching a funny video
Exercising, which can improve your health and help you counter the weight gain that can sometimes come with cigarette cessation.

, Social support can reduce smoking, but in the end it is up to you. Sticking with it is one of the hardest parts and setbacks will occur. The important thing is to not completely give up when you have those lapses in discipline. It happens to everyone. You are learning to live your life without a habit that is a central part of your day, and is often associated with so many areas of your life throughout your day. Learning to cut down takes persistence, patience, consistency, and a lot of self-kindness.Keep tracking, even if you relapse. Keep implementing bigger rewards and consequences as time goes on.

, Once you've started limiting and reducing your cigarette consumption, you may find that you are ready to quit entirely. You might want to join a support group where you can talk about your cravings and how to reduce them. You could also try incorporating one of the following:


Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): This includes nicotine inhalers, oral medications, patches, and gums. They deliver the nicotine without the act of smoking.Don't use NRT if you are still smoking, since they can cause a toxic increase in nicotine levels. If you are trying to cut down on smoking, but are not necessarily ready to quit, NRT may not be the best option for you.E-Cigarettes: Electronic cigarettes may help you reduce or quit smoking.While E-cigs simulate the puffing of smoking, which may help wean people from traditional cigarettes, it may actually replace smoking instead of wean people off smoking. Though e-cigs might be less toxic than traditional cigarettes, there is limited research about their safety. Caution should be taken when using an e-cig as it tends to create the perception that it is a safe alternative.

Throw away all of your smoking paraphernalia.,
Get a dedicated accountability partner.,
Avoid temptation and tempting situations.,
Identify and avoid behavioral triggers.,
Track your rewards.,
Avoid substances that will weaken your resolve.",How to Prevent Smoking Relapse," While it's possible to quit smoking for good without having to throw away all of your smoking-related objects, it can be immensely difficult when you are constantly reminded of the pleasures of smoking. At the very least, throw away every cigarette you own; it's much harder to relapse when you can't just reach for a cigarette nearby.;
, The power of accountability is very strong when it comes to breaking addictions. Find someone who is trustworthy and wants to see you succeed in breaking your smoking habits. Ask them to hold you accountable by calling you once a day, discussing your struggles with addiction, and keeping your morale high.


At certain times during your recovery period, you will feel strong symptoms of withdrawal and you will feel an overwhelming urge to smoke a cigarette. During these times, call your accountability partner and talk it out with them. The support of a friend is important and can be the difference between relapsing and not.

, Typically, this means that you should stay away from situations where other people will be smoking. Seeing other people enjoy smoking may evoke a desire to join them, and it can be difficult to decline if someone offers you a cigarette.

, For many smokers, stress is the primary trigger for smoking relapse. When you are stressed, you must consciously keep yourself from relieving that stress with a cigarette. Instead, replace the behavioral response with a new one, such as going for a run or eating a handful of cashews.

, Take conscious note of how differently you perceive the world now that you are recovering from smoking addiction. Can you smell better? Can you taste a broader range of tastes? Do you feel healthier and more energetic? Keep track of how much money you haven't spent on cigarettes since quitting and treat yourself to a reward occasionally.

, For example, alcohol is known to reduce inhibition and willpower. Substances that alter the mind can be highly counterproductive when it comes to addiction recovery and smoking relapse prevention, so they should be avoided until you have fully recovered.

Avoid nicotine triggers.,
Distract yourself.,
Delay and regulate your urges.,
Use relaxation techniques.,
Make time for a workout.",How to Keep Smoking Systematically Without Getting Addicted1," Many smokers find that they experience cravings whenever they are in situations or places where they smoke most often.If you tend to smoke at parties, bars, or around a particular group of friends, and you want to temper your smoking habits, it may be best to avoid those triggers until a day when you're ready to smoke.


The first step in avoiding triggers is to identify what your triggers are.Think about when you most often smoke, and compare that place/scenario with your frequency of cravings between cigarettes.
If you absolutely cannot avoid your biggest triggers, have a plan in place to avoid smoking on ""off"" days. Give yourself permission to leave early if necessary, and arm yourself with distractions to keep you from smoking.;
, One of the best ways to avoid giving in to your cravings, especially if you find yourself in places or situations that trigger the urge to smoke, is to give yourself adequate distractions. For some, that may mean something to satisfy an oral fixation. For others, it may require something to keep the hands busy.Identify what activities suppress your cravings most effectively. Do you feel the need to put something in your mouth, hold something in your hand, or some combination of the two?If you crave the oral fixation that comes with smoking, try chewing gum or sucking on a hard candy or lozenge. Some smokers also find it very satisfying to chew on something crunchy, like sunflower seeds, to help stave off a nicotine craving.If you find yourself craving something to do with your hands, try carrying a pen and paper around. You can twirl the pen between your fingers, or doodle/draw to help distract you from the cravings.If you feel you need both the hand occupation and oral fixation, try carrying around a bundle of toothpicks/tea tree sticks, straws, or lollipops. Many former smokers (and current smokers who cannot smoke, for example while at work) turn to toothpicks, straws, and lollipops as a means of satisfying both the behavioral and oral components of cigarette cravings., If you find yourself absolutely craving a cigarette on a day you don't want to smoke, promise yourself you'll wait 10 minutes before reaching for a pack. In that time, do something distracting. Try going for a walk or reading something engrossing to distract your mind, and use a physical replacement (like a toothpick or lollipop) to satisfy the habitual components of smoking. You can also squeeze a stress ball to help manage any anxiety that accompanies your cravings.If you absolutely must give in to your craving, then you may want to subtract that cigarette from a day you were planning to allow yourself to smoke later in the week. For example, if you're too stressed out on a Wednesday at work and you give in to your craving, then skip the situations or groups of friends who would trigger a craving on Friday or Saturday. That way you're still keeping yourself below a weekly minimum.

, If you find your social smoking habits turning into bad cravings whenever you're stressed, try using relaxation techniques to break your stress patterns. There are many relaxation techniques that smokers find useful, including deep-breathing, meditation, muscle relaxation, and yoga.In deep breathing, the goal is to breathe from your diaphragm (below your rib cage) to produce a slow, steady, deep inhalation and exhalation.Meditation is used to calm the mind and focus attention away from stressful thoughts and feelings. Most people who meditate begin by focusing on their breath, taking slow and deep breaths in and out. Some practitioners also use a repeated word or phrase (called a mantra) or practice visualization to imagine a place or time that is peaceful and serene.Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and subsequently relaxing each group of muscles progressively, from one end of the body to the other. This can help alleviate muscle tension and quell stressful or anxious thoughts and feelings.Yoga combines stretches and postures with controlled, meditative breathing to help relax the mind and body., Studies have shown that 30 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity can actually quell a nicotine craving.If you're able to get outside when a craving strikes, go for a run, a long walk, or a bike ride. If you're at work, try some low-intensity workout options like squats, lunges, pushups, or walking up/down several flights of stairs."

Know when to cut yourself off.",How to Keep Smoking Systematically Without Getting Addicted2," Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is widely considered a successful means of dealing with intense cravings.There are many over-the-counter NRT products available, and according to a decades-long study by the Food and Drug Administration, combining NRT products shows no significant health threat.Nicotine replacement patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges are all common NRT products that have been shown to be effective in treating nicotine cravings.Stronger NRT products are available with a doctor's prescription. These include medications, such as bupropion (Zyban) and varenicline (Chantix).Unlike over-the-counter NRT products, these prescription medications are best used on their own, rather than in combination with other products, unless your doctor gives you express approval to combine NRT products. Talk to your doctor if you think prescription-strength NRT products may be right for you.

, Whether you're trying to quit altogether, or just trying to break a too-frequent smoking habit down into what you view as a more-manageable social habit, having a support system can be a valuable aid. If you know of other friends or relatives who are going through the same withdrawal cravings, call or text one another, or get together to go for a long walk or run. If you don't know anyone who's actively trying to quit or reduce their smoking frequency, you can join an online support group.Find online support groups by searching online for smoke cessation support groups. Many long-term members have gone through what you're going through, and can likely offer support or advice on how to manage your cravings., E-cigarettes, also called vape pens, are a non-combustible alternative to smoking cigarettes. These products typically contain a flavor component and nicotine, although some e-cigarette cartridges also come in nicotine-free varieties.While e-cigarettes are not necessarily safe, they do allow smokers to avoid inhaling actual smoke while managing (and, ideally, reducing) the amount of nicotine being consumed on a day-to-day basis., If you're having a hard time breaking your nicotine habit, it may be helpful to go to public places, such as restaurants and certain parks, where smoking is prohibited. Being around other non-smokers may be inspiring, and if nothing else you know that you will be incapable of lighting up while you're in that location., It's okay if you slip up once in a while and smoke on an ""off"" day. But it's important to recognize that this is akin to taking a cheat day on a diet. You can't keep indulging day after day if you want to avoid becoming a chain-smoker. The important thing is to absolutely cut yourself off after one single cigarette, if you must have one.Try reinforcing your own imposed limit by only carrying one or two single cigarettes on you at any given time. You can store it in a hard-box cigarette pack that is otherwise empty, or purchase a small metal cigarette case.
An even better strategy would be to avoid bringing cigarettes with you when you leave the house on ""off"" days. That way, if you do submit to your cravings, you know you'll only be able to smoke a cigarette if someone is willing to give you one of theirs.

Learn the effects of tobacco.,
Understand social smoking.,
Determine if you are addicted.,
Consider seeing a doctor.",How to Keep Smoking Systematically Without Getting Addicted3," Tobacco contains many, many chemicals, the most addictive of which is nicotine. Nicotine has been shown to be as addictive a drug as heroin or cocaine.Low levels of nicotine consumption create a slightly euphoric feeling due to the release of dopamine and the minor adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of smoking. Nicotine also increases the resting heart rate, lowers skin temperatures, and reduces blood flow in the body's extremities.Smoking is known to cause cancer, as well as strokes, coronary heart disease, blood clots, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has also been shown to harm virtually every organ in the body.Smoking is highly addictive. Many people recognize the harmful effects smoking causes on the body, but are incapable of quitting., Many self-avowed social smokers claim that they are not addicted, and can quit any time they want. However, on a chemical level, even social smokers' brains become sensitized to nicotine. Brain scans have shown an increase in the development and density of dendrites in the parts of the brain associated with addiction.Studies have shown that even beginner smokers experience a drastic reduction in the number of days they can go through without experiencing cravings, which suggests that even casual/social smoking is often the beginning of full-fledged addiction., If you still consider yourself a social/casual smoker without any real risk of addiction, you may already be addicted. Psychologists and medical professionals have compiled a checklist that addresses smoking habits which may be useful in assessing your own smoking habits. Any ""yes"" answers to any of the following questions suggests to medical professionals that addiction has already started:


Have you ever tried to quit but could not?Do you find yourself smoking because it is difficult to quit?Do you now or have you ever felt like you were addicted to tobacco/nicotine?Do you ever experience strong, irresistible cravings to smoke?Have you ever felt that you desperately needed a cigarette?Do you find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places or situations where you know you're not supposed to smoke?When you haven't smoked for a few days, do you find it difficult to concentrate?After not smoking for a while, do you feel more irritable?After not smoking for a while, do you feel an urgent need to smoke?When you haven't smoked for a few days, do you ever feel nervous, restless, or anxious?, If you're concerned about your level or frequency of smoking, or if you've tried to quit several times and haven't been successful, you may want to consider talking to your doctor. A medical professional will be able to help you develop a treatment plan to manage both the physical and behavioral aspects of your addiction/dependence, and such treatment plans are often highly successful."

Think about if you want to quit smoking.,
Determine why you want to quit.,
Be prepared for nicotine-withdrawal symptoms.",How to Quit Smoking1," Nicotine is incredibly addictive and it will take determination to quit. Ask yourself if a life without smoking is more appealing than continuing your life as a smoker.If the answer is yes, have a clear reason for wanting to quit. This way, when abstaining becomes difficult you can be clear about your very important reason to quit.


Consider how smoking affects these areas of your life: your health, your appearance, your lifestyle, and your loved ones.Ask yourself if these areas would benefit from you quitting.;
, Make a list of all the reasons why you want to quit. This will help you become clear about your decision to quit. You'll want to refer to this list later, if you're tempted to smoke.


For example, your list might say something like: I want to quit smoking so I can run and keep up with my son during soccer practice, have more energy, be alive to see my youngest grandchild get married, or save money.

, Cigarettes are highly effective at delivering nicotine throughout your body.When you stop smoking, you might experience increased cravings, anxiety, depression, headaches, feeling tense or restless, increased appetite and weight gain, and problems concentrating.Realize that it may take more than one attempt to stop smoking.

Choose a date for when your plan will start.,
Pick a method.,
Prepare for cravings.",How to Quit Smoking2," Committing to a start date adds structure to your plan. For example you might choose an important day such as a birthday or holiday, or just pick a date you like.


Pick a date within the next 2 weeks. This gives you time to prepare and start on a day that isn't stressful, important, would otherwise lead you to smoke., Decide which method you would want to use, like quitting cold turkey, or slowing/reducing your use.Quitting cold turkey means that you completely stop smoking without looking back. Reducing your use means smoking less and less until you've stopped. If you pick reducing your means, be specific about when and by how much you will reduce your use. For example, it might be simple like saying, ""I will reduce my use by one cigarette every two days.""


You'll have a better chance of success if you combine counseling and medication with stopping, regardless of which method you choose., Have a plan in advance for when cravings strike. You might try hand-to-mouth. This describes the action of moving your hand to your mouth for smoking. Have a replacement to fulfill this need. Try snacking on low-calorie snacks, like raisins, popcorn, or pretzels, when this urge comes up.You might try exercising to combat cravings. Go for a walk, clean the kitchen, or do some yoga.

"
Prepare the night before quitting.,
Ask for support.,
Know your triggers.,
Be committed to not smoking.",How to Quit Smoking3," Wash your bedding and clothes to get rid of cigarette smells. You should also get rid of any ashtrays, cigarettes, and lighters from your house. Make sure to get plenty of sleep, since this will help lower your stress.Remind yourself of your plan and carry a written version with you, or keep it on your phone. You may also want to re-read the list of reasons why you want to quit.

, Your family and friends can be extra support in your cessation journey. Let them know your goal and ask them to help you by not smoking around you or offering you a cigarette. You can also ask for their encouragement and to remind you of your specific goals when temptation is difficult.Remember to take quitting one day at a time. Remind yourself that this is a process and not an event.

, Many people find that certain situations trigger the desire to smoke. You might want a cigarette with your cup of coffee, for instance, or you might want to smoke when you're trying to solve a problem at work. Identify places where it may be difficult not to smoke and have a plan of what you'll do in those specific places. For example, you should have an automatic response for a cigarette offer: “No thank you, but I will have another tea” or “ No - I am trying to quit.”Control stress. Stress can be a pitfall when trying to quit smoking. Use techniques such as deep breathing, exercise, and down time to help thwart stress.

, Continue your plan even if you have bumps in the road. If you have a relapse and smoke for an entire day, be sure to be gentle and forgiving with yourself. Accept that the day was tough, remind yourself that quitting is a long, hard journey, and get back on your plan the next day.


Try to avoid relapsing as much as possible. But if you do, recommit as soon as you can to quitting smoking. Learn from your experience and try to cope better in the future."

Consider using e-cigarettes or nicotine filters.,
Get professional help.,
Take Bupropion.,
Use Chantix.,
Try nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).",How to Quit Smoking4," Recent studies have suggested that using e-cigarettes while you quit smoking can help you reduce or quit smoking.Other studies recommend caution when using e-cigarettes since the amount of nicotine varies, the same chemicals as those in cigarettes are still being delivered, and they may re-activate the habit of smoking., Behavioral therapy combined with medication therapy can improve your chances of successfully quitting.If you've tried quitting on your own and are still struggling, think about getting professional help. Your doctor can talk to you about medication therapy.


Therapists can also help you through the process of quitting. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help change your thoughts and attitudes about smoking. Therapists can also teach coping skills or new ways to think about quitting., This medication doesn't actually have nicotine, but it does help reduce the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Bupropion could increase your chances of cessation by 69 percent.Usually, you'll want to start taking bupropion 1 to 2 weeks before you stop smoking. It's normally prescribed in one or two 150mg tablets per day.


Side effects include: dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, agitation, irritability, tiredness, indigestion and headaches as side effects.

, This medication curbs nicotine receptors in the brain, which makes smoking less pleasurable. It also reduces withdrawal symptoms. You should start taking Chantix one week before quitting. Be sure to take it with meals. Take Chantix for 12 weeks. Side effects include: headaches, nausea, vomiting, trouble sleeping, unusual dreams, gas, and changes in taste.But it could double your chances of quitting.Your doctor will have you increase your dose over time.

Drink lots of fluids, especially water.,
Take a hot shower or bath once or twice a day.,
Sleep with your head elevated.,
Try a facial steam.,
Do a chest rub.,
Take Mucinex.,
Avoid taking cough medicine.",How to Eliminate Chest Congestion Caused by Quitting Smoking1," Drinking water will help your body to combat the congestion by thinning the mucus in your lungs and make it easier to cough up the mucus. It will also keep your body hydrated.Tobacco smoke slows the movement of the tiny hairs (known as cilia) that line our lungs and help to remove mucus. When you stop smoking, these hairs become more active and start to clear away the mucus built up in your lungs. This can result in increased coughing for a few weeks after you first quit.Drinking orange juice and other natural fruit juices will provide your body with the vitamins and minerals it needs to combat congestion.
Avoid alcohol, coffee, and sodas which can contribute to dehydration as much as possible.;
, Dry air can irritate your lungs and increase your coughing fits. The steam produced from a hot shower or bath can moisten the air passages in your lungs and thin out the mucus., Keep your head angled at 15 degrees by placing one or two pillows directly underneath your head. This will minimize mucus draining into your throat which causes coughing at night., Facial steamers produce similar results outside the shower, directing the steam from hot water directly into your airways and lungs. Pour six cups of hot (almost boiling) water into a bowl. Make a tent over your head with a bath or hand towel. Place your nose and mouth over the bowl and inhale deeply.


Add three to four drop of eucalyptus oil to the water. Eucalyptus oil has both antibacterial and analgesic properties and acts as an expectorant, loosening phlegm that causes coughing.Add a few drops of peppermint oil to the steam to benefit from its soothing menthol agent.
Professional facial steamers are also available at your local drugstore.

, Chest rubs, such as Vicks Vaporub, can help alleviate feelings of chest congestion via its menthol properties (the active agent in peppermint). Menthol can also reduce feelings of shortness of breath. Although the benefits from these products can be largely psychological, they can help alleviate the symptoms (but not the cause) of chest congestion.Never apply the rub directly under your nose or used on infants or children under the age of 2. The active ingredient in many chest rubs, camphor, can be toxic when ingested., If you don't have any aversion to a pill-based solution, Mucinex will significantly reduce any chest congestion you may suffer from. The medication thins and loosens mucus in the airways, clearing congestion, and making breathing easier.Mucinex is designed for temporary relief of congestion and cold-like symptoms. It's important to consult your doctor before you use it to treat smoking-induced congestion or coughing.

, Coughing will help to loosen the phlegm from your lungs and will help you recover from chest congestion. Allow your body to cough, and stay away from over-the-counter cough medicines."

Ask your doctor about treatment for “smoker’s lung”.,
Avoid any exposure to cigarette or cigar smoke.,
Exercise on a regular basis.,
Buy a humidifier or vaporizer.",How to Eliminate Chest Congestion Caused by Quitting Smoking2," Although increased feelings of congestion are typical in the first few weeks after you stop smoking, be aware that any smoking habit increases your risk of “smoker’s lung”, a catch-all term for chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are associated with a reduction of airflow due to lung damage. Both conditions are associated with coughing and feelings of breathlessness.Individuals with smoker's lung experience a combination of symptoms similar to having chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These include chronic coughing, breathlessness, and mucus in your lungs.Although treatment for these two conditions may be minor, it’s important to talk to your doctor after quitting smoking about your likelihood of contracting either of these conditions.
Your doctor may recommend a chest X-ray or a CT scan to exclude other possibilities.
A lung function test or a blood test may also be necessary to determine other contributors to your condition.

, You should also wear a mask when you are working with strong fumes like paint or household cleaners with strong fumes.If possible, stay indoors on high air pollution days.
Stay away from wood stoves and kerosene heaters, which also can emit irritating fumes or smoke.
If cold air aggravates your cough, wear a face mask before you go outside, particularly during the winter., It’s important to keep your lungs and cardiovascular system in good working order. Your body already begins the repair process as soon as you quit smoking. The more you exercise, particularly after you quit smoking, the more you will help your lungs gain back the capacity they lost while you were smoking.A study examining the effects of quitting smoking found some physical improvements after just a week. Eleven young men who smoked about a pack a day for three and a half years were subjected to several tests while on a stationary bike before quitting, and then a week later. The study showed considerably increase in oxygen concentration in the lungs and an extension of exercise time.

, Having a humidifier or vaporizer in your bedroom while you sleep can help you keep hydrated at night and will also help to loosen mucus. Keep the filter clean and the humidifier will minimize the amount of congestion-causing dust in the air.Keep the vaporizer and humidifier clean. Every two to three days, clean the filter using a mixture of bleach and water (two tablespoons of bleach per one quart of water). Run the machine until dry (approximately 40 minutes) in a well-ventilated area, away from your bedroom."

Gargle warm salt water.,
Drink warm lemon juice and honey.,
Add ginger to your diet.,
Drink peppermint tea.",How to Eliminate Chest Congestion Caused by Quitting Smoking3," The coughing that comes from chest congestion can make your throat scratchy or sore. A saline (i.e. a salty) solution draws excess fluid from inflamed tissues in the throat, soothing them temporarily.Dissolve ¼-1/2 teaspoons of salt in an eight ounce glass of warm (not too hot!) water. Gargle for 15-20 seconds and spit out the water., The combination of honey and lemon may help to soothe your throat and help with chest congestion as well. Add honey and lemon juice to hot water or have a teaspoon of honey by itself to soothe your throat., Ginger root is a natural anti-inflammatory and may soothe your irritated lungs. Drink ginger tea and add ginger root (not crystallized ginger) to recipes like soups and stir fries. Ginger candies can be an easy way to suppress coughing. For an easy ginger tea, thinly slice a thumb-sized piece of ginger and simmer it in hot water for approximately 15 minutes. Add a bit of honey for further throat and chest relief., Like ginger, peppermint is a natural expectorant and can help to thin mucus and break up phlegm. Its main active agent, menthol, is a good decongestant and is found in a number of over the counter treatments for chest congestion.Adding peppermint to your diet, such as drinking peppermint tea, can help alleviate basic symptoms of chest congestion.

Understand the pros and cons of quitting cold turkey.,
Make a game plan.,
Manage your stress.",How to Quit Smoking Cold Turkey1," Quitting cold turkey means deciding to quit smoking completely without the help of nicotine replacement therapy or drugs. This requires perseverance and independence. Only 3-10% of people have been able to successfully quit smoking cold turkey because of the drastic change this makes in their lives. Before you try quitting cold turkey, you should understand the advantages and disadvantages of the process.Advantages:

If you have to quit because you have a serious health problem as a result of your smoking, quitting cold turkey will be the quickest way to improve your health or to keep it from further deteriorating. You will also be more motivated to do it on your own if you have a serious health risk.
You may feel more pain, but you'll feel it for a shorter amount of time. Instead of spending months or even a year dealing with medication and nicotine therapy and slowly weaning your body off nicotine, you will be able to conquer your addiction more quickly if you do succeed.



Disadvantages:

You may experience intense and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, such as depression, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety.
You have less of a chance of success if you quit cold turkey than if you try to use a combination of other methods.

;
, Making a game plan will help you be more firm about your decision to quit, and will make you more committed to the process. You should pick a day on your calendar for starting to quit, and mark off every day that you have successfully gone without smoking. Pick a time of your week or month that will be the most stress-free, where you'll be less likely to break down and want a cigarette.


Know your triggers. Write down the triggers that lead you to smoking, whether it's drinking whisky, going to parties, or even listening to jazz. Decide how you can avoid them.
Keep reminding yourself why you want to quit. Once you start your plan, keep telling yourself that you want to quit for health reasons, for your family, and for your friends. You can even write a motivational note to yourself and keep it in your wallet.
Remember that the first few days are the hardest. Factor this into your game plan. Reward yourself for getting through your first few days, or first few weeks, of quitting cold turkey.
Keep a journal where you record your thoughts and feelings throughout the process. Make a plan to write in the journal at least once a day so you feel more in touch with how your mind and body are feeling.

, If you manage your stress, you will be much less likely to keep smoking. You may even be using smoking as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, so it's important to find other ways of dealing with your stress so you're not tempted to relapse. Here are some great ways to manage your stress so your mind feels sound while you're trying to quit:


Reflect. Write down all of the factors in your life that are leading to stress and figure out how you can minimize them. If you can eliminate or reduce any sources of stress before you start trying to quit, the process will be much easier.
Do activities that calm you down. Try meditation, yoga, taking long walks, or listening to soothing music before bed.
Get lots of rest. You will feel much more capable of dealing with stressful situations if you go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, and give your body enough time to sleep.
Open up to a friend about your feelings. You will feel much more at ease if you don't feel so alone in your decision to quit smoking.

"
"
Keep your body active.,
Be socially active.,
Avoid temptation.,
Find a new hobby or interest.",How to Quit Smoking Cold Turkey2," If you want to quit smoking, you have to keep your body active so that you have less time to think about indulging in a craving. Keeping your body active can not only keep you feel healthier, but will help you replace your smoking routine with other routines. Here's what to do:


Keep your mouth active. Drink lots of water, tea, juice, or anything to keep your mind occupied. Chew gum or suck on mints when you need to.
Keep your hands busy. Squeeze a stress-relieving ball, doodle, play with your phone, or find another way to keep your hands busy so you don't end up reaching for a cigarette.
Get some exercise. If you don't have an exercise routine, pick one up. Working out for just 30 minutes a day can make your body and mind feel more fit and relaxed.
Go for walks. This is a great thing to do, especially when you have a craving.

, If you're trying to quit smoking, it's not the time to hole up alone in your room, or you'll find it much harder to keep your mind off of having another cigarette. Take this as the opportunity to spend more time with your friends and family, and you'll not only be distracted from smoking, but you'll be happier.Accept more invitations. Take this as an opportunity to go to more events, even if you've avoided them in the past.
Invite a friend out for coffee, a walk, or a drink. Turn an acquaintance or a casual friend into a closer friend by taking the time to chat. Try to invite them to an activity that won't lead to one of your triggers.
When you hang out with friends and family, open up about how you're trying to quit. This will make you feel less alone and more supported.
Do something fun that involves activity. Go to a yoga class with a friend, go out dancing, or invite a friend for a hike or a trip to the beach to go swimming.
Remember to avoid temptation while you're being socially active. Don't go to parties where everyone is smoking or spend all of your time with your friends who are die-hard smokers, because that will make you much more likely to smoke. Find new ways to be socially active if you need to.

, This is a must. Once you know your trigger points, it's important to avoid any situations that will lead you into a relapse, or which will make it almost impossible for you to do anything but think about smoking. Here's how to do it:Try to avoid hanging out with other smokers as much as you can. Of course, if one of your best friends is a smoker, just have a serious conversation about it, and try to minimize your time around the friend when s/he is actually smoking.
Avoid the places where you used to buy cigarettes. If you can't go to your usual grocery store or drive by the convenience store where you buy your cigarettes without wanting to buy a pack, avoid your usual route and find new stores.
Avoid situations where you tend to smoke. If you always smoke when you hang outside the mall, go to a certain restaurant, or go out to clubs, try to cut those situations out of your routine.

, Finding a new healthy ""addiction"" to replace your smoking habit can help you refocus your energies and be more excited about your new routine instead of feeling like you're just slogging through your days without smoking. Here are some great hobbies or interests to pursue:


Do something with your hands. Try writing a short story or a poem, or take a pottery or art class.
Try running. If you set a goal to run a 5K or even a 10K, you'll be so focused on your new training plan that you won't have time to think about smoking all the time.

Be adventurous. Try hiking or mountain biking. Do something completely out of your comfort zone that will take your mind off cigarettes.
Find a new love for food. Though you shouldn't replace your cigarette cravings with food cravings, you should take the time to appreciate food and to maybe even learn how to cook. Notice how much better everything tastes now that you're not smoking.

"
"
Reflect after the relapse.,
Resume your routine.,
Know when to try other methods for quitting.",How to Quit Smoking Cold Turkey3," After you've had a relapse, whether it was just bumming one cigarette at a party or smoking an entire pack during a rough day, it's time to sit back and ask yourself why it happened. Understanding why you had a relapse is the key to preventing future relapses. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:


Did you have a relapse because you were feeling stressed? If so, you should think more about how you can minimize your stress, or to avoid particularly stressful situations. For example, if you had a cigarette because of a stressful day at work, find a way to deal with another stressful day at work, such as having ice cream or watching your favorite movie after work instead.
Did you have a relapse because you were in a situation that made you want to smoke? If you had a cigarette at your friend Beth's party because you associate her parties with having a nice cool smoke on the back porch, then you should either avoid her parties for a while or come equipped with gum, a dessert, or a game plan for beating the craving.
What were you feeling right before you relapsed? Recognizing those feelings can help you fight them in the future.

, This is an important point. Just because you had one cigarette or relapsed for a day doesn't mean you should think you're a failure and give up completely. Don't use the relapse as an excuse to go back to smoking. Just because you had a moment of weakness doesn't mean that you're a weak person and that you don't have the skills to quit.


Just do what you've been doing. If you've been trying to quit for a while, then your body will be craving cigarettes less than it normally would, even if you've had a relapse.
Be extra vigilant after the relapse. For the week after the relapse, try harder than ever to stay busy and active, to avoid temptation, and to manage your stress.

, There's a reason only 3 -10% of people can successfully quit smoking cold turkey. It's really hard. If you've been trying to quit cold turkey for months or even years but always relapse or even fall into long periods when you resume your regular smoking routine, then cold turkey may not be the best method for you. Here are some other great methods to try:Behavioral therapy. A behavioral therapist will help you find your triggers, provide support, and can help you decide the best way to quit.
Nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, and sprays are ways of giving your body nicotine without the tobacco. This is a good way of weaning your body off off nicotine instead of quitting all at once.
Medication. See your doctor about getting a prescription for a medicine that will help you quit smoking.
Combination treatments. Behavioral therapy, replacement therapy or medication, and ample support from friends and family can be the best way to ensure that you will truly quit smoking for good.

Compromise if she decides quitting smoking is not an option. If she refuses to quit, at the very least, encourage her to cut back on the amount of cigarettes she smokes, or encourage her to smoke outside.

, The quit date should be realistic but no longer than two weeks away. This will give your grandma time to prepare, but not be so far off that she forgets to decrease her cigarette intake. Tell her to mark it on her calendar.

By erasing all evidence and reminders that she used to smoke, it will be that much easier for your grandma to stay away from tobacco and cigarettes.

, Cigarettes are addictive, and quitting takes tremendous strength and willpower.Encourage her not to smoke. Comment upon and remind her of her progress.

The cervix is the passage that connects the vagina to the uterus, and any changes in its lining may suggest HPV infection.;
, This test is typically administered by a gynecologist (although it can be performed by any physician) with the help of an assistant.


The doctor inserts a thin, duck-bill shaped instrument called the ""speculum"" inside the vagina to hold it open.
A small brush (which looks similar to a mascara brush) or small spatula is inserted into the opening and brushed against the cervix in order to pick up cells.
The brush is then stirred into a preservative fluid or spread onto a slide and examined under a microscope to look for abnormal, or ""pre-cancerous"" cells.

, The test is sometimes uncomfortable, but it shouldn't cause pain. Usually the most uncomfortable part is the initial insertion of the speculum. It is also a brief test, usually less than a minute, although the doctor may need a few extra moments to get a clear view of the cervix.

Consider how smoking affects various important areas of your life: your health, your appearance, your lifestyle, and your loved ones. Ask yourself whether these areas would benefit from you quitting.For example, your list might say something like: I want to quit smoking so I can run and keep up with my son during soccer practice, have more energy, be alive to see my youngest grandchild get married, and save money.;
, Throw away your cigarettes. Wash your bedding and clothes to get rid of cigarette smells. Dispose of any ashtrays, cigarettes, and lighters that are hanging around your house. Make a commitment to yourself: you will not smoke another cigarette.


Remind yourself of your plan and carry a written version with you, or keep it on your phone. You may also want to re-read the list of reasons why you want to quit.
If you aren't prepared to quit cold-turkey, consider tapering off gradually. Fewer cigarettes are still (somewhat) better for you than more cigarettes.

, Cigarettes are highly effective at delivering nicotine throughout your body. When you stop smoking, you might experience increased cravings, anxiety, depression, headaches, feeling tense or restless, increased appetite and weight gain, and problems concentrating.


Realize that it may take more than one attempt to stop smoking. About 45 million Americans use some form of nicotine, and only 5 percent of users are able to quit on their first try.Try to avoid relapsing as much as possible. But if you do, recommit as soon as you can to quitting smoking. Learn from your experience and try to cope better in the future.
If you have a relapse and smoke for an entire day, be sure to be gentle and forgiving with yourself. Accept that the day was tough, remind yourself that quitting is a long, hard journey, and get back on your plan the next day.

, Your family and friends can help you stick to your commitment. Let them know your goal, and ask them to help you by not smoking around you or offering you a cigarette. Ask for their support and encouragement. Ask them to remind you of your specific goals when temptation is difficult.

, Many people find that certain situations trigger the desire to smoke. You might want a cigarette with your cup of coffee, for instance, or you might want to smoke when you're trying to solve a problem at work. Identify places where it may be difficult not to smoke, and have a plan for what you'll do in those specific places. If possible, avoid those places.


Practice an automatic response for a cigarette offer: “No thank you, but I will have another tea” or “No thanks–I'm trying to quit.”
Control stress. Stress can be a pitfall when trying to quit smoking. Use techniques such as deep breathing, exercise, and down time to help thwart stress. Make sure to get plenty of sleep, since this will help lower your stress.

, These apps provide a platform to help you track your cravings and moods, identify your smoking triggers, record your progress toward achieving your goals, and stay strong in stressful times. Search for ""quit-smoking apps"", read descriptions and reviews, and choose a program that meets your needs., Recent studies have suggested that using e-cigarettes while you quit smoking can help you reduce or quit smoking. Other studies recommend caution when using e-cigarettes since the amount of nicotine varies, the same chemicals as those in cigarettes are still being delivered, and they may re-activate the habit of smoking., Behavioral therapy combined with medication therapy can improve your chances of successfully quitting. If you've tried quitting on your own and are still struggling, think about getting professional help. Your doctor can talk to you about medication therapy.Therapists can also help you through the process of quitting.

Consider asking for help.,
Consider spending more time with friends who don't smoke.,
Don't keep cigarettes around.,
Distract your mind with productive activities.",How to Avoid Smoking2," Whether you're trying to quit smoking, or trying to keep from developing a habit, you might need to ask a parent or sibling, a teacher, or a non-smoking friend to help keep you in check. Ask this person to keep an eye on you and tell you if you're engaging in dangerous behavior. Ask if you can message or call this person in the event that you're having trouble resisting peer pressure. Don't be afraid to actually use this resource: smoking is highly addictive, and you might need all the help that you can get.

, If you are really serious about avoiding a smoking habit, then you might want to avoid people who habitually smoke. You can always keep saying no, but you will still run the risk of inhaling secondhand smoke as long as you spend time with smokers. If you don't want to cut these people out of your life, try stepping away from them when they smoke--or asking them to take their cigarettes outside.


When you breathe secondhand smoke, you ingest all of the toxic, cancer-causing chemicals that waft into the air when cigarettes burn. You can inhale secondhand smoke by breathing ""mainstream smoke"" (the smoke that smokers exhale) as well as ""sidestream smoke"" (the smoke from the lighted end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar).If you get used to being around people that smoke, you may gradually lighten up your attitude toward smoking--and you may be more likely to relapse. If you're constantly listening to people tell you that smoking is okay, your perspective may begin to sway.
It isn't easy to leave friends behind, but it may be the right choice if you want to put your health first. Be honest with your friends. Say, ""I'm not comfortable with you guys pressuring me to smoke, and I'm afraid that if I keep hanging out with you I might actually start smoking. I'm going to take some time to get my priorities straight.""

, Get rid of any un-smoked cigarettes that you own, and don't buy any new cigarettes. As long as you keep cigarettes around, you are acknowledging that smoking is a possibility. When you get rid of your cigarettes, you go a long way toward removing yourself from the possibility, and you make smoking much easier to avoid.


It may be tempting to tell yourself, ""I'll just smoke the rest of this pack, so that it doesn't go to waste, and then I won't buy any more. I'll quit once I finish these cigarettes."" Some people may be able to follow through with this sort of plan, but it's safest not to tempt yourself. The ""just one more pack"" mentality can stretch into years of continued smoking.
You can throw the whole pack away for dramatic effect, or you can give the cigarettes away to someone else if you're uncomfortable with the waste. The important thing is that you get the smokes away from yourself as soon as possible.

, Develop habits and hobbies that reinforce your commitment to avoiding smoking, and try to involve yourself in communities that actively discourage smoking. Whenever you get the urge to smoke, channel that energy into something else: go to the gym, or pick up an instrument, or take a walk to clear your head. It's easy to let smoking a cigarette become your first impulse--so try to break this habit.


Build a regular exercise routine, whether you're running, hiking, playing sports, or going to the gym. The more work you put into your health and physical fitness, the less likely you will be to want to tear it down.
Join a hiking group, a sports team, or any group of active, outdoorsy people. Many active groups hold a stigma against smoking, especially during the group activities--so you can use this stigma to keep yourself from getting tempted to smoke.

Just say no.,
Avoid secondhand smoke.,
Read about the dangers of smoking.",How to Avoid Smoking3," If you spend time around people who smoke, there's a good chance that they'll offer you a cigarette at some point. If you don't want to smoke, just say so, and most people will respect you for sticking to your principles. If anyone tries to pressure you into smoking, don't give them any consideration--just keep saying no, and they'll eventually stop bothering you.


If people don't respect your decision to avoid smoking, chances are that on some level they're jealous of your discipline. They may try to convince you to try it: ""One little cigarette won't kill you..."" If you're really interested in trying a cigarette, it's okay to experiment and figure out what you do and don't enjoy--but don't light one up just because you think people will judge you otherwise.
Some people are able to smoke the occasional cigarette without letting the habit spiral into a full-blown, pack-a-day addiction, but it's hard to tell which type of smoker you'll be without actually dancing with addiction. If you have an addictive personality--if you have trouble controlling your consumption of things like soda, coffee, alcohol, or sweets--there's a good chance that this will extend to smoking., Sidestream smoke--the smoke that wafts from the burning tip of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar--has higher concentrations of toxic, cancer-causing agents (carcinogens) than the ""mainstream smoke"" that smokers inhale. Secondhand smoke can be nearly, if not equally, as bad for your health as smoking. What's more, if you're trying to quit, the sight of other people smoking might sorely tempt you. If you have friends or family who smoke, and you don't want to cut them out of your life, politely ask them to go outside or step away from you when they smoke.

, Constantly remind yourself how harmful a smoking habit can be, and you may find that the research reinforces your resolve to avoid smoking. Quitting smoking can add years to your life, and it greatly reduces your risk for various smoking-related diseases.Consider passing the information along to friends and loved ones who habitually smoke--but don't preach, merely aim to inform.


Cigarettes contain carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemicals, and when you smoke, you inhale those chemicals directly into your body. Most cases of lung cancer stem from habitual smoking.
Smoking causes strokes and coronary heart disease, which are the leading causes of death in the United States. Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can show early signs of cardiovascular disease.Smoking causes most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. If you have asthma, tobacco can trigger an attack and make your symptoms worse.

That way, you can be prepared for any questions your girlfriend may have. Plus, you'll need to know that information for yourself anyway. Your doctor may have handouts on the STD, or you can find reliable information on certain websites, such as the Mayo Clinic or the Cleveland Clinic. You can also find reliable information on the website for the Center for Disease Control at http://www.cdc.gov/std/healthcomm/the-facts.htm., First of all, it's the right thing to do. Even if you're using protection, your girlfriend is at risk for catching your STD. Also, it could be illegal in your state to withhold that information.In addition, once you're treated, you could catch the disease again if your partner has it., You are probably going to be nervous when you start the conversation. Take some time to write out the main points you want to say, then practice saying them. Working on what you want to say will help take some of the stress out of the situation.

, That is, put yourself in her shoes. If she told you she had an STD, how would you feel? Thinking through the emotions can help you be more sensitive when you do have the conversation.For instance, you might feel hurt or angry. You may also feel resentful at your girlfriend for bringing it into the relationship.

, Your girlfriend shouldn't be busy doing something else while you're trying to have a conversation. Wait until she can give you her full attention. If you're not sure when a good time is, simply ask when you can have a conversation with her about something important.

, You don't want to have this conversation in a public place. You are divulging sensitive information, and your girlfriend may get emotional. Stick to a place where you'll both be comfortable and where other people can't overhear you. Also, make sure you minimize distractions.However, don't pick a location or time that is too intimate; that is, you don't want to be on your way to having sex when you stop to tell her. You should definitely tell her before you get too intimate., Don't try to obscure what you're trying to say. Just go ahead and say it, making sure to do so in a sensitive way.For instance, you could say, ""I wanted to talk to you because I received news about my health that affects both of us. I have herpes, which is a sexually transmitted disease.""
It's also important to talk about who you got the disease from if you already know. If you're not exclusive, you may have gotten the disease from someone else. If you are exclusive, it's possible you caught the disease from your girlfriend, so you need to bring it up in the conversation.It's also possible you've had it for awhile, even before you got together with your girlfriend, as STDs may not always show symptoms right away or ever., If you think it's likely you passed the disease to her, it's appropriate to apologize. Tell her your sorry for bringing that into the relationship., If you did your homework, now is the time to use that information. For example, if you know the disease is curable, it's a good time to bring it up. If you have other information that may help her sort out what she's thinking, talk a little about it.Some information that may be helpful to add is how the disease is spread and how it looks when it shows symptoms., Once you've had your say, give her some time to react. She's going to want to talk about it and ask questions. Let her get through what she has to say without interrupting her.Encourage her to speak her mind. You could ask her how she's feeling or if she has anything she wants to ask you., Information like you're delivering can be overwhelming. Your girlfriend may need some time to think. If she looks like she does or she says she does, that's the time to give her some space.


For example, you could say, ""I know this news is hard to hear. If you need some time alone to think, I understand that. I just wanted to let you know so we could be safe and so that you could be tested.""

, In the time she's had to think, she may have more questions. Check back in with her within a day or so. She's also had time to research the disease herself. See if she has anything else she wants to ask you., Even if she needs space, you need to emphasize the fact that she needs to get tested. Encourage her to do so when you first talk, but don't be afraid to ask her if she's done so the next time you talk to her., Now that you have an STD, you need to practice safer sex while you still have it. You may want to abstain from vaginal and anal sex altogether if you're having a flare up. You can also use a condom or dental dams to practice safer sex.In place of vaginal and anal sex, you can kiss, fondle, and use sex toys, as long as you don't pass them back and forth."

This will help you prepare to answer any questions your partner may have about herpes as well as any questions you may have about the virus.


Genital herpes is a common infection that is usually transmitted through sexual contact, or direct contact with an infected blister or sore. It can also be caused by HSV-1, the virus that causes cold sores on your lips and face, through oral or genital contact.The virus can be transmitted when no symptoms are present on the person you had sexual contact with, and often goes undetected and undiagnosed. In fact, about 80% of the US population already has HSV-1 and got it sometime during their childhood from being kissed by a parent, friend, or relative.
Genital herpes is very treatable, and is not life-threatening. Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of catching genital herpes, regardless of their gender, race, or social class.HSV-2 infection is usually passed on during vaginal or anal sex. HSV-1 is usually transmitted by oral sex (mouth to genital contact).;
, This is also important information to have for your peace of mind and for your partner’s peace of mind. Most herpes cases are treated with antiviral drugs. Drug therapy is not a cure, but it can make living with herpes easier.Initial treatment: If you have symptoms such as sores and swelling when you’re first diagnosed with herpes, your doctor will give you a brief course (7 to 10 days) of antiviral therapy to relieve the symptoms or prevent them from getting worse.
Intermittent treatment: Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug for you to keep on hand in case you have another flare-up. You can take the pills for two to five days as soon as you notice sores or other symptoms of an outbreak. The sores will heal and disappear on their own, but taking the drugs will speed up the process.
Suppressive treatment: If you have outbreaks often, you can ask your doctor for an antiviral drug you can take every day. Anyone who has more than six outbreaks a year should use suppressive therapy, which can reduce the number of outbreaks by 70% to 80%. Many people who take antiviral drugs every day have no outbreaks.

, While genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, sleeping with someone who has herpes does not mean you will are going to automatically get herpes. Most people who have herpes are shedding the disease only a small percent of the time.In fact there are many sexually active couples where one partner has herpes and one partner does not have the disease.Being aware of having the virus and letting any sexual partners know about your diagnosis is a big step to preventing the spread of virus to others.

, Invite your partner over for dinner at your place or go for a long walk in a park. You are going to have an intimate and personal conversation with your partner, so pick an environment where you will both feel safe and comfortable enough to have a serious talk., Avoid telling your partner right before you are both about to get into bed or be intimate with each other. If you have been dating your partner for awhile, and are at the point where you are both thinking about being intimate, its important to tell your partner about the herpes first. Not only is this a way to practice safe sex, it will also keep your relationship open and honest.Even if you are in a casual relationship, your partner deserves to know the facts before you have sex. If you aren’t comfortable enough to tell your partner about your STI, you likely aren’t ready to have sex with them.
If you have already been intimate with your partner, avoid having sex again until you tell him that you have herpes. It can be very scary to tell your partner about having herpes. The stigma of herpes being disgusting or gross often freaks out both the person who has herpes and the person on the receiving end of the conversation. But herpes can also act as a relationship tester. If your partner is not willing to try to work with you and find ways to deal with your diagnosis, he may not be someone you want to be with, for years down the road or for one night., Go for a non-threatening way to start the conversation, such as:


“I really enjoy being with you, and I’m really happy we’re becoming more intimate. I have something to tell you. Can we talk right now?”
“When two people get along as well as we do, I think we owe it to each other to be honest. So I’d like to talk to you about a condition I have.”
“I feel like I can trust you and be honest with you. I'd like to talk to you about something.”

, Keep the conversation simple and positive.


For example: “I found out two years ago that I have herpes. Luckily, it’s treatable and manageable. Can we talk about what this means for us?”Use “sexually transmitted infection” or STI, instead of “sexually transmitted disease” or STD. Though they mean the same thing, “disease” sounds like you are consistently having symptoms or outbreaks. But “infection” sounds like something that can be managed.

, Remember that your partner will be looking to you to lead the conversation. Rather than appear ashamed or traumatized by your diagnosis, stay calm and provide the facts about herpes.Assure your partner that herpes is a very common virus that most adults in the US already have in their system. For most people who have genital herpes, symptoms don’t show up, are infrequent, or mistaken for something else. About 80-90% of people who have herpes don’t even know they have it. So you are just someone who happens to know you have herpes.

, Tell your partner about any medication you take to manage the symptoms and recurrence of herpes.Talk about safe sex practices you and your partner can do to keep the disease in check. Always using a condom when having sex. The risk of herpes is reduced by 50% if you use condoms. You should also avoid sexual intercourse when you have a cold sore to prevent the spread of the virus.
Explain to your partner that the symptoms of genital herpes, such as sores and irritation, may reappear from time to time. This is because once you get the herpes virus, it remains in your body. Most of the time, it remains inactive. Each individual is different, some people never have a recurrence and some many have recurrences several times a year.Certain events or situations can trigger recurrences. So let your partner know if there are certain triggers for you, such as stress at work or home, fatigue, insomnia, and menstruation (if you are a woman).

, Remain open to any questions your partner may have. If asked, go into detail about your treatment and your current approach to safe sex.You can also tell your partner to research herpes on their own. It may help them to process the information if they do some of their own research online to better understand the virus.

, No matter how your partner reacts, negatively, or positively, try to be flexible and open. Remember that it likely took you time to adjust to your diagnosis. So give your partner some space to process the conversation.Keep in mind some partners may react negatively no matter what you say or how you say it. Their reaction is not a reflection on you and you are not responsible for their reaction. If your partner is not able to accept your diagnosis, try to be accepting of their reaction and take it as a sign that maybe they aren’t the person for you.
The majority of partners react well and appreciate your honesty. Many couples can be functional and sexually active, despite a herpes diagnosis.

, If you both agree to certain precautions, the chances of spreading herpes to your partner are very small. Having genital herpes does not mean you need to abstain from having sex.Always use a condom when you have sex. Most couples choose to avoid genital skin to skin contact during an active episode of herpes, as this is when the chances of spreading the virus are higher.
If you have open sores on your buttocks, thighs or mouth, these can be just as contagious as ones on your genital area. You and your partner should avoid direct contact with any sores on your bodies during sex.
Avoid oral sex if you or your partner have a cold sore anywhere on your body.
You cannot catch genital herpes by sharing cups, towels or bathwater, or from toilet seats. Even during a herpes outbreak, you should only avoid skin to skin contact with parts of your partner’s body that have sores. You can still cuddle, share a bed, and kiss your partner.

Just make sure that you are consulting reliable, research-based sources and not just relying on random things people have posted on the internet. Doing this can help you maintain perspective about your diagnosis.Talk to your support team about what emotions and feelings you should expect. You can ask, “What are some of the common feelings that people with a diagnosis experience?”
Learn about the signs that you may not be coping with your diagnosis well. You might say, “How can I overcome these feelings and stay positive?”

, If you are newly diagnosed, or even if you were diagnosed sometime ago, you may have some difficulty accepting your HIV status.Denying that you have HIV can cause you additional problems, though. For example, if you avoid seeking treatment and doing things to maintain your health because you won’t admit you have HIV it can affect your physical health. It can also make it extremely difficult for you to maintain a positive attitude when you aren’t being honest with yourself about your HIV status.


When you find yourself thinking, “This can’t be happening to me,” you can try telling yourself, “I have HIV. I can manage it and still have a happy fulfilling life with it.”
Writing, “I am HIV positive and I can live with it” is one way to help you accept your diagnosis. This can make the words and the situation concrete and real to you. Practice saying this out loud to those closest to you who are aware of your diagnosis. You can also practice saying this in the mirror.

, You may have some resentment and anger toward yourself or someone else about having HIV. This is normal and can be a common feeling about your diagnosis.Allowing these feelings to grow, however, can stop you from properly managing your HIV and cause problems in your relationships with other people.

Talk to someone you trust about your feelings. For example, you can tell your therapist, “I’m feeling angry about having HIV and need some help working through it.” Be sure to discuss the stages of grief with your therapist as well, and keep in mind that they are not the same for everyone.

, Your HIV diagnosis may have raised concerns about your quality of life now and in the future. You may feel anxious or nervous about how you will handle treatment, maintain your health, or develop and maintain your relationships. You can keep anxiety from overwhelming you and keep a positive outlook by doing things one regular basis to relax and calm yourself.


If you feel an anxiety attack coming or notice you feel nervous, take a brief break from the situation and do some deep breathing to calm yourself. For example, if you're starting to feel anxious as you make a list of your medications, take a break and go for a walk. Focus on your breathing during your walk then go back to the list feeling calmer.
Write down the specific things that are concerning you and brainstorm solutions to the challenges you’re experiencing. For example, you might write: telling people, the stigma, and keeping my stress down. Then think about how you can address each one.
Share your concerns with someone close to you. Sometimes talking to someone you trust can help you keep things in perspective and lower your anxiety.

, Being grateful is one way you can balance any negativity you may be feeling and stay positive about life after your HIV diagnosis.Take the time to think about and express the things that you’re grateful for whether they are large or small.


Tell the people that you care about that you appreciate them. For example, you might pick one person a day to tell how much they man to you.
Keep a gratitude journal and each day write down two to three things you’re grateful for.

, It is important that you do not have sex with your partner until they understand that you have an STD. Even if you use protection, you should inform them before you engage in sex.

If you have been diagnosed after you have started seeing someone but before you have had sex, you should let them know within a few days of your diagnosis.
If you have just been diagnosed and you have already had sex with them, let them know before you sleep together again.

, You should have the conversation in a private, quiet area with no distractions. You can call your partner and ask them to meet up to talk about something. Try to sound calm when you do this. If you sound nervous or upset, they may become anxious.You can say, ""Can we meet up soon at my place or yours? I have something I want to tell you.""

, You need to be honest and direct when you tell them that you have an STD. Do not talk around the issue or use euphemisms.

For example, you might say, “Herpes can’t be cured, but I am managing my symptoms with medication. Sometimes I will get flares for a few weeks, but symptoms are usually gone for months at a time.”
Encourage your partner to ask questions if they have them. You can say, “I want to make sure that you understand my condition completely. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have.” Even if they don’t have questions right away, they may come up with them over time.
Encourage your partner to discuss the matter with their doctor or health care provider, as well. They may be able to provide more comprehensive information in a less stressful environment.

, If you have already had sex with your new partner, you should let them know that they need to be tested. Even if you used protection, it is a good precaution. This will let them know if know if they have an STD themselves.

You can say, “You should get tested as soon as possible for HIV as I may have put you at risk.” If you feel comfortable in your relationship, you may even offer to accompany them.

, Your partner may decide to no longer see you. If this is the case, try not to take it personally. While it can hurt, understand that there are many people out there who do not mind if their partner has an STD.

Remember that your STD does not define you as a person. If the person broke up with you for this reason, it does not mean that they are rejecting you. They have just made the decision that they do not want to risk contracting an STD themselves., Many people do not mind if their partner has an STD. If your partner wants to stay with you, you should make sure that you do not infect them. Always protect yourselves during sex.

Seek adequate prenatal care if you're pregnant.",How to Recognize Syphilis Symptoms," Once you understand how people pass syphilis to one another, you can figure out whether you're at risk. The disease is transferred from one person to another through contact with a syphilis sore. These sores may appear externally on the penis and outer vaginal area, or internally in the vaginal canal, anus, and rectum. They may also be present on the lips and inside the mouth.


If you've had vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone infected with the disease, you are at risk of contracting syphilis.
However, you need to come into direct contact with an infected lesion.Syphilis cannot be spread by shared eating utensils, toilet seats, doorknobs, hot tubs or swimming pools.
Men who have sex with men (MSM) are significantly more likely to contract syphilis, with 75% of reported new syphilis cases in 2013. It's especially important to use safer sex practices if you are a man who has sex with men.;
, The early stages of the disease do not have significant noticeable symptoms, and many people don't even know that they have syphilis.Even if carriers do notice sores and symptoms, they may not recognize them as an STD, and may leave them untreated for long periods of time. Because the minor sores can progress gradually from 1-20 years after the initial infection, carriers may unknowingly pass the disease on to others., Syphilis has 3 stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary/late stage. The primary stage usually begins about 3 weeks after the first exposure to a syphilis sore. However, symptoms might begin to appear anywhere between 10 and 90 days after exposure.The primary stage of syphilis most often begins with the appearance of a painless sore called a “chancre,” which is small, hard, circular, and painless. Although there is usually just one sore, there may be more.
The sore appears where the disease entered the body. Common infection sites include the mouth, genitals, and anus.The sore will heal on its own in 4 to 8 weeks, and won't leave a scar. However, this does not mean that the syphilis is gone. Without proper treatment, the infection simply moves on to the second stage.

, The secondary stage of syphilis usually begins 4 to 8 weeks after the initial infection, and lasts between 1 and 3 months.This stage begins with a ""maculopapular rash"" on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. This type of rash doesn't usually itch, but causes rough, reddish brown spots on the skin.Other rashes with a slightly different appearance may show up on other parts of the body at this time. People usually either don't notice these rashes or assume they have other causes. This usually results in delayed treatment of their actual cause.


Other symptoms eventually appear in this stage as well. They too are sometimes mistaken for other problems, such as the flu or stress.
These symptoms include: fatigue, muscle aches, fever, sore throat, headaches, swollen lymph glands, patchy hair loss, and weight loss.About a third of those who don't get treatment during the secondary syphilis stage will develop latent or tertiary syphilis.The latent stage is the symptom-less period that precedes the appearance of tertiary stage symptoms.

, The latent stage begins when the symptoms of stages 1 and 2 disappear. The syphilis bacteria is still in the body, but there are no longer any signs or symptoms of the disease. This stage can last for years. However, about a third of those who go untreated during the latent stage will develop the tertiary stage of syphilis, which has severe symptoms. Tertiary stage syphilis may not show itself until 10 to 40 years after the initial infection.Tertiary stage syphilis can see damage to the brain, heart, eyes, liver, bones, and joints. This damage may be serious enough to cause death.
Other symptoms of the tertiary stage include difficulty with muscle movement, numbness, paralysis, progressive blindness, and dementia., If a pregnant woman has syphilis, she can transfer disease-causing bacteria to the unborn child through the placenta. Proper prenatal care should help prepare your doctor for any complications. The most common symptoms seen in babies born with syphilis include:Intermittent fevers
Enlarged spleen and liver (Hepatosplenomegaly)
Swollen lymph nodes
Chronic sneezing or runny nose with no apparent allergic cause (persistent rhinitis)
Maculopapular rashes on the palms and soles

, If you think you've come into contact with a syphilis sore, see a doctor immediately. Also see a doctor if you notice any unusual discharge, sores, or rashes, particularly in the genital area.

, The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) strongly recommends that people in ""at-risk"" populations get tested for syphilis yearly, even if they don’t have symptoms.However, research has shown that if you're not “at risk,” there's no benefit to regular syphilis screening. In fact, it can lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment and anxiety.You fall into the “at risk” category if:


You engage in casual sex
You have a sexual partner who's tested positive for syphilis
You have HIV
You are a pregnant woman
You are a man who has sexual contact with men

, The most efficient way to test for syphilis is through a test for syphilis antibodies in the blood. The syphilis test is inexpensive and easy to perform; you can have it done at a doctor's office or public health clinic. The clinicians will use one of the following methods to look for syphilis antibodies in your blood:


Nontreponemal tests: These tests are ideal for screening purposes, and are about 70% accurate. If the test has a positive result, the doctor will confirm the diagnosis with a treponemal test.Treponemal tests: These tests for antibodies are more specific, and are used for confirmation rather than screening.
Some clinicians test for syphilis by taking a sample from a suspected syphilis sore. They inspect the sample under a specialized microscope to look for treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes syphilis.All patients should be tested for HIV infection. , Syphilis is relatively simple to treat and cure with proper medical attention. The earlier the syphilis is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat; if treated within a year, a single dose of penicillin can completely cure the disease. Antibiotics can be very effective in early syphilis infection, but may have less of an effect in late syphilis.People who've had the disease longer than a year may need multiple doses of antibiotics. Patients with latent or tertiary phase syphilis will likely need 3 doses per week.Let your doctor know if you are allergic to penicillin. He or she will likely recommend a 2-week treatment of doxycycline or tetracycline instead. Note that these alternatives may not be suitable for pregnant women, due to the risk of birth defects.If pregnancy is an issue, your doctor will discuss additional treatment options with you.

, Penicillin, doxycycline, and tetracycline work by killing the syphilis bacteria and eliminating it from the body. No home remedies or over-the-counter medications will work. Only a physician can prescribe the drug dosage necessary to cure the disease.


Although the medications will cure syphilis, they cannot repair damage that's already been done.
Note that testing and treatment is similar for babies.

, After you've completed your treatment, your doctor will repeat the nontreponemal tests every 3 months. This will allow him or her to monitor your response to treatment. If the test results don't show improvement within 6 months, this could suggest inadequate treatment or a recurrent infection that needs to be dealt with., It's extremely important that you don't have sex while still undergoing treatment — especially with new partners. Until your sores have healed and a physician has declared you syphilis-free, you risk passing it to someone else.You should also notify all previous sexual partners of your diagnosis, so they can also be tested and treated for syphilis.

, Wearing condoms during vaginal, anal, or oral sex can reduce the risk of contracting syphilis. However, the sore or site of infection must be completely covered by the condom.Always use a condom with new sexual partners, as they may not even know whether they have syphilis — especially if there are no visible sores.


Be aware that you may still contract syphilis if the sore is not completely covered by the condom.
It's preferable to use dental dams for oral sex with women, as they usually cover a larger area than condoms that have been cut open. However, if you don't have a dental dam, you can cut open a male condom and use it instead.
Latex and polyurethane condoms offer equal protection against STDs and HIV. ""Natural"" or ""lambskin"" condoms do not adequately protect against STDs.Use a new condom for each sex act. Don't reuse condoms, even for different types of penetration (vaginal, anal, oral) in the same sexual interaction.Use water-based lubricants with latex condoms. Oil-based lubes such as petroleum jelly, mineral oil, or body lotion can weaken the latex and make you more likely to contract an STD., You can't guarantee that casual sexual partners aren't carrying STDs. As such, it's best to abstain from casual sex. If you know for a fact that your partner has syphilis, you should avoid sexual contact with them entirely, even if they are wearing a condom.The safest option is to be in a monogamous, long-term relationship with a partner who has tested negative for syphilis and other STDs.

, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise against the excessive use of alcohol and drugs. These substances can increase a person's likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior, which would place you in the ""at risk"" category., It is very important that pregnant women receive good prenatal care, which involves tests for syphilis. Healthcare professionals and the USPSTF recommend that all pregnant women get screened because syphilis can pass from a mother to her developing baby, causing serious illness and often death.Babies who contract syphilis from their mothers are much more likely to be underweight, premature, or even stillborn.
Even if the child is born without symptoms, untreated babies can develop serious health issues within a matter of weeks. These issues include deafness, cataracts, seizures, and potentially death.
This can be avoided if the mother is tested for syphilis throughout the pregnancy and at the time of delivery. If the test comes back positive, both mother and baby can be treated."

Watch for unusual discharge.,
Notice any burning or swelling.,
Pay attention to itching.,
Be aware that the majority of men infected with trichomoniasis have no symptoms.",How to Recognize Trichomoniasis Symptoms (Men)1," One of the most common symptoms of trichomoniasis in men is unusual discharge from the penis. Take stock of any unusual discharge you notice.


You may notice some yellowish discharge coming from the penis, although it may also be grayish. Any unusual or unexplained discharge may be a sign of an STD.;
, The other symptoms of trichomoniasis in men include burning, pain, or swelling in the genitals. If you have any such symptoms, you may be infected.


You may notice burning after urination or ejaculation. Some men with trichomoniasis may also have difficulty urinating or ejaculating.There may be some mild swelling of the scrotum as well. If anything looks or feels unusual, you should seek medical care.Keep in mind that these symptoms can indicate problems other than an STD as well, which may require a full medical evaluation in addition to STD testing.

, Another symptom of trichomoniasis is mild to severe itching around or on the penis. If you notice any unusual itching, seek medical evaluation. Itching can be a symptom of a number of STDs in addition to trichomoniasis, so it's important to get unusual itching evaluated., The vast majority of anyone infected with trichomoniasis will have no symptoms. However, men are far less likely than women to experience symptoms. About 70% of infected people experience no symptoms at all, so you should get tested for STDs regularly even if things seem fine."
"
Ask sexual partners about their status, if possible.,
Review your sexual history.,
Consider whether you've previously had trichomoniasis.",How to Recognize Trichomoniasis Symptoms (Men)2," If you have regular contact with past sexual partners, ask them about their status. This may be awkward, but the best way to know if you're at risk is knowing whether previous partners have experienced symptoms of or tested positive for trichomoniasis. It is a highly contagious STD., Certain behaviors put you at increased risk for trichomoniasis. You may be at increased risk if any of the following are true for you:


You've had multiple sexual partners.
You have a history of having other sexually transmitted infections.
You have had unprotected sex with a partner whose STD status you do not know., If you've previously had an outbreak of trichomoniasis, even if it was successfully treated, you're at increased risk of developing the disease again. Review any medical documents you've saved and look over your test results to see if you've ever tested positive for trichomoniasis."
"
Get an STD test.,
Seek treatment.,
Prevent outbreaks in the future.",How to Recognize Trichomoniasis Symptoms (Men)3," You should see a doctor if you believe you're at risk for trichomoniasis. He or she can perform a routine STD test to check for the condition.Your health care provider will take a swab of your urethra and send it to a lab for testing. It may be painful to urinate after a swab is taken. It may take a few days before results are ready and may even take up to a week if the lab is busy.Many labs can perform a urine test for multiple common STDs, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis.
As the symptoms of many other common STDs are similar to those of trichomoniasis, it's a good idea to get a full panel test. Also, if you're worried you're at risk because you've had unprotected sex you'll be at risk for other infections as well. You should wait two to three weeks after a sexual encounter before getting tested, however, as it will take a while for viruses to be detectable., Medical treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. It can be cured with a single dose of prescription antibiotics that are taken orally. Ask your doctor about medication. Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours after receiving treatment., About 1 in 5 people get infected with trichomoniasis again within three months of treatment. Make sure you know how to prevent outbreaks in the future.


Use a latex condom if you have sex with a new partner. While condoms do not completely eliminate the risk of STDs they do dramatically reduce it.Make sure you wait until all symptoms of a previous infection pass before having sex again.Talk to your partner about STDs. It's a good idea for both of you to get tested together before engaging in sexual activity."

Talk to your doctor or visit a health clinic to get tested.,
Note any difficulty with urination and any unusual discharge.,
Pay attention to rashes and sores.,
Observe flu-like symptoms.,
Check for swollen glands and a fever.,
Determine if you are experiencing fatigue.,
Identify abnormal itching.,
See your doctor.,
Follow instructions for treating your infection.,
Do everything you can to prevent the spread of STDs.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of a STD (for Teens)," Some STDs have no symptoms and can only be detected and diagnosed with a test. If you are concerned about STDs, the best thing to do is to get tested. Most states have laws that allow anyone over the age of 13 to get tested for STDs without parental consent. To find out more about getting tested for STDs, you can either talk with your family doctor or visit a health clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.Some common types of STD tests include:


Urine test. Your doctor may request a urine sample to determine whether you have chlamydia and gonorrhea, the two most common STDs. You will urinate in a cup and then the doctor will send the cup to the lab for tests..
Blood sample. A blood sample can show whether you have syphilis, herpes, HIV, and hepatitis infections.A health care worker will prick you with a needle to take some blood and run the tests.
Pap smear. For women who do not show symptoms, this is the only way to detect human papillomavirus. If your pap smear shows unusual changes, a DNA test can reveal HPV. This test is only available for women.There is currently no reliable way to test HPV in men.Swab test. A swab of an infected area can determine if you have trichomoniasis. Your healthcare provider will take a swab of cotton and rub it on the infected area, and send it to the lab for tests. Since only 30% of people with trichomoniasis develop symptoms, getting tested is often the only way of knowing if you have it.Swab tests can also be used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea as well as herpes.;
, The color, texture, and smell of discharge can help identify the STD contracted as well as pain during urination. Only you know your body, but if you think you are experiencing unusual discharge or urination, that could be a sign of:



Gonorrhea in females and males with increased discharge from genitals (usually white, yellow, or greenish) or burning sensation during urination.Women may also experience menstrual irregularities and swelling of the vulva. Four out of five women and one out of 10 men who have gonorrhea do not have symptoms.Trichomoniasis may be present in both females and males with burning urination or in females with unusual vaginal odor and discharge (clear, white, or yellowish).However, about 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms.Chlamydia may be present in females and males with discharge or painful urination.Women may also experience abdominal pain and the urge to urinate more than usual. Just keep in mind that 70-95% of women and 90% of men who have chlamydia will not exhibit symptoms.Bacterial vaginosis in women with milky discharge and a fishy odor.

, Rashes and sores in specific parts of the body may indicate that you have an STD. Pay extra close attention to any rashes or sores on your genitals or mouth, as these are more commonly associated with STDs. If you experience an outbreak of some kind, see a doctor or visit a health clinic as soon as possible to get a diagnosis.


Painless sores may indicate that either a male or female has contracted syphilis in its primary stage. These sores (called chancres) usually appear near the genital areas and are and they can appear about three weeks to 90 days after infection.Painful blisters or sores in genital areas or the mouth may indicate that either and male or female has contracted herpes. These blisters can appear as early as two days after contraction and last one to two weeks.Genital warts can indicate that either a male or female has contracted human papilloma virus. They usually appear as a small bump or groups of bumps in the genital area. They can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like a cauliflower.HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and nearly all sexually active people get infected with HPV at some point in their lives.. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own, but when it doesn't, certain types of HPV can cause cervical cancer in women., Some STDs are difficult to recognize because the symptoms are similar to the common flu. They include: a cough or sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, the chills, fatigue, nausea and/or diarrhea, a headache, or a fever.If you are experiencing flu-like symptoms, talk to your doctor to find out if you have the flu or if you might have an STD.


For example, exhibiting flu-like symptoms after sex can be indicative of syphilis or HIV in either men or women., Sometimes STDs can cause swollen glands and a fever. For example, if your glands are tender or feel painful when you press on them and you are experiencing a fever, it may be a sign of the herpes virus.Most often, the glands are swollen near the site of infection, and the glands in the groin area are often swollen with genital infections.


If you do have herpes, your symptoms will likely appear two to 20 days after infection., There are many reasons that you may be experiencing fatigue. However, if you are experiencing fatigue in combination with a loss of appetite, joint pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or jaundice, it may be a sign that you have contracted hepatitis B.About one out of two adults who have hepatitis never have symptoms, but if they do appear, they will occur between 6 weeks and 6 months after infection., Some STDs may cause you to feel an itching or burning sensation in your genital region, so take note if you experience this symptom. For example, itching or irritation in the penis could be a sign of trichomoniasis in men or bacterial vaginosis in women. Chlamydia can also cause itching, especially of the anal area


If trichomoniasis symptoms develop, they will occur in three to 28 days..
If bacterial vaginosis symptoms develop, they will occur anywhere from 12 hours to five days.Bacterial vaginosis can also be contracted through other means besides sexual contact (such as using a copper coil as a contraception means, smoking, or taking frequent bubble baths), therefore there is debate on whether it should be classified as an STD., If you suspect that you have a sexually transmitted disease, make an appointment with your doctor right away or visit a health clinic. Prompt treatment of STDs is crucial to help prevent long-term effects from disease and spreading it to others. When left untreated, some STDS can cause serious long-term health problems including hair loss, arthritis, infertility, birth defects, cancer, and rarely, even death., Some STDs can be treated with antibiotics while others cannot be cured at all. Regardless of your situation, it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions for how to cure or manage your condition. If you receive a diagnosis for an STD, your doctor will advise you on your treatment options and give you information on how to avoid spreading your STD to other people.Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to treat your condition or at least to lessen the severity of your symptoms.
There is no cure for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, or herpes. However, there are treatments available to help mitigate symptoms.

, There are several ways to decrease your chances of contracting an STD infection. Make sure that you choose the method that works best with your lifestyle. The methods you can use to help prevent contraction of an STD include:Abstain. The only sure way to ensure that you do not contract an STD is to abstain from oral, vaginal, and anal sex.
Use protection. If you do engage in sexual activities, use a latex condom to minimize the possibility of contracting an STD.
Be monogamous. One of the most reliable ways to avoid STDs is to be in a mutually monogamous relationship. Have an open conversation with any partner about whether they have been tested before engaging in any activities.
Get vaccinated. For hepatitis B and HPV, you can be vaccinated. This helps ensure that you will not contract the diseases even if you do come into contact with them during sex. The hepatitis B vaccination is usually administer to infants at birth, but be sure to check. The HPV vaccination consists of 3-dose series of shots and will protect against the most common forms of HPV.

Monitor your vaginal discharge.,
Recognize abnormal genital symptoms.,
Do not ignore painful or unpleasant sexual intercourse or urination.,
Recognize when you are at risk of getting STI/STDs.,
Test if you have trichomoniasis by collecting cell samples from your vagina.,
Take antibiotics prescribed to you by your doctor.,
Schedule routine check ups to ensure your sexual health.,
Practice safe sex.,
Alert any sexual partners to your infection.",How to Recognize Trichomoniasis Symptoms (Women)," Abnormal discharge will look greenish-yellow and frothy. A strong odour is also a sign of abnormal discharge. For most women, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal and can range from being clear to milky white.Trichomoniasis is spread through contact with vaginal discharge which happens most often during vaginal intercourse. However, non-sexual transmission can sometimes occur from using items like douche nozzles, moist wash cloths, or toilet seats that aren't washed sufficiently. Fortunately, the parasite can only last up to 24 hours outside of the body.;
, Trichomoniasis can cause redness, burning, and itching sensations at the genitals in some infected individuals. These symptoms may indicate a possible trichomoniasis infection or that of another STI.


Trichomoniasis causes irritation within the vaginal canal or vulvar.
Vaginal irritation can be normal if the irritation only lasts for a few days or gets better after treatment. However, if irritation persists or gets worse, it's best to talk to your doctor about it and get it properly diagnosed and treated.

, Trichomoniasis can cause inflammation and soreness in the genitals that can make intercourse uncomfortable. See a physician if you experience these symptoms, and do not participate in intercourse until you have been tested for STIs or STDs.


Avoid all forms of sexual intercourse including anal and oral sex until you've been tested and cleared.
You should also inform your sexual partner or partners if you suspect you have an STI/STD and encourage them to also get tested and treated. Some clinics will help you inform your partners anonymously by giving them a contact slip that lets them know they have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection. It won't have your name on it and it won't necessarily tell them what the infection is., With any sexual activity, there is always a risk of being infected by an STI. In some circumstances, you are more likely to receive an STI and knowing about these situations can help you and your health care professional decide if you need to get tested. You will probably need to be tested if:


You have had unprotected sex with a new partner.
You or your partner has had unprotected sex with others.
Your partner tells you they have a sexually transmitted disease.
You are pregnant or planning to be pregnant.
Your doctor or nurse notices abnormal vaginal discharge or your cervix is red and inflamed.

, Your doctor or health care provider will ask to collect vaginal cell tissue or discharge from your vagina by using a cotton swab. Sometimes the swab may look like a plastic loop rather than a cotton tip. The tool is wiped over parts of the body that could be infected such as inside your vagina or around it. This is often painless with only a bit of discomfort.


Your doctor might be able to immediately examine the sample under a microscope and let you know your results right away. Or you may have to wait a week to 10 days for your results. During this waiting period, be sure to avoid any sexual activity so you don't spread an infection if you have one.
Blood tests and cervical screening tests don't test for trichomoniasis. Be sure to ask specifically for a trichomoniasis or STI test.

, After your test comes back positive, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat trichomoniasis. At times, your doctor might even prescribe medication to you before your tests come in just in case. Your doctor will most likely prescribe you an oral antibiotic called metronidazole (Flagyl) which stops the growth of bacteria and protozoa (trichomoniasis is a protozoan parasite). Side effects include dizziness, headache, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, constipation, changes in taste, and dry mouth. It can also cause your urine to come out darker in colour.Be sure to notify your doctor if you're planning to or may be pregnant. Metronidazole is safe for pregnant women.
Contact your doctor if your side effects persist or worsen to a point where it disrupts your day to day life.
Tell your doctor immediately or go to an emergency clinic if you experience seizures, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet, or mood or mental changes.

, It is always important to get routine check ups from your doctor or health care professional, even if you don't think you have any STIs. Remember, only 30% of trichomoniasis infected individuals show signs of infection. The other 70% never display any symptoms.


If left untreated, trichomoniasis can increase your chances of getting HIV or increase the likelihood of transmitting HIV to your sexual partners.
Trichomoniasis in pregnant women can cause premature ruptures of membranes that protect the baby and cause early delivery.

, If you are not involved in a mutually monogamous relationship with an individual free of STDs, always use a latex condom (male and female) to help avoid contracting sexually transmitted conditions. Some more methods of protection include:


Using condoms when engaging in oral, anal, and vaginal sex.
Avoiding sharing sex toys. If you do share them, wash them or cover then with a new condom anytime anyone new uses it.

, Notify sexual partners with whom you have had unprotected intercourse or direct genital contact so that they can be tested and treated if necessary.


Some clinics will help you inform your partners anonymously by giving them a contact slip that lets them know they have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection. It won't have your name on it and it won't necessarily tell them what the infection is but will urge them to get tested.

Look for itchy lesions.,
Notice other physical symptoms.,
Watch for a change to blistering sores.,
Take note of improvements.,
Learn the different types.,
Receive laboratory confirmation from your doctor.,
Take valacyclovir (Valtrex).,
Try acyclovir (Zovirax).Although valacyclovir is the most current medication for herpes, you can also try an older medicine that is not used as much anymore.,
Ask your doctor about famciclovir (Famvir).,
Try home remedies.",How to Recognize Herpes," The main way that you will be able to tell if you have genital herpes is through the lesions that appear on your genital area. These present approximately 6 days after infection. HSV-1 lesions will usually appear on or in the mouth. HSV-2 lesions will appear on the thighs, buttocks, rectum, and perineum. If you are female, they will present on the vulva, labia, internal vaginal entrance, and cervix, while they appear on the glands of the penis and shaft and inside the urethra if you are male.


There will likely look like a clustering of red sores on the affected area at first.They are described as painful with burning and itching in the first hours to days after they present. .;
, The onset of the lesions will likely be accompanied by other physical symptoms as well. You may suffer from headache, fatigue, fever, and swelling of the lymph nodes of the genital region (these nodes are located above and to the sides of your genitals).You may also get other viral symptoms since your body is trying to fight off the herpes virus..


These include flu-like symptoms such as fever, general aches and pains, and overall discomfort., The itchy, burning lesions will start to change hours to days after they appear, depending on your particular case. They will change from the burning, itchy lesions into blistering, oozing sores. They will start to form patches or rows and start secreting a pus-like substance.


This liquid is typically straw-colored with streaks of blood in it. .

, Eventually, the sores will begin to crust over. Not too long after this phase, the skin around the sores will begin the heal and grow new, non-irritated skin. They should heal without scar formation. The time frame of this stage depends on the severity of your outbreak.


These symptoms are indicative of the first initial outbreak. These symptoms are always worse and more severe than other outbreaks. The first outbreak can last anywhere from 2-6 weeks. Any subsequent outbreaks last, on average, about 1 week. , There are two different kinds of viruses that are considered herpes. The HSV-1 is the virus that is responsible for cold sores, although it can also cause genital herpes.HSV-2 is the primary virus that is responsible for genital herpes. There are many more cases of HSV-1 than HSV-2; about 65% of people in the U.S. have been infected with HSV-1, often during childhood.Many people that have herpes are not aware that they have it, especially since it causes no symptoms outside of an outbreak of lesions. Because of this, there are hundreds of thousands of new cases of herpes in the US alone each year, and about 80% of people infected with HSV-2 do not show symptoms.The most direct way to spread herpes is through contact with the lesions or the secretions that contain the virus. However, it is possible to spread herpes outside of an outbreak when the virus is shed from the seemingly uninfected skin.This shedding does decrease as time passes since your first infection, reducing up to 70% after 10 years., If you think you may have lesions or sores from herpes, you need to get medical tests done in order to be sure. The Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test is the standard way of testing for the herpes virus. This test copies your DNA from a blood sample (or from a lesion or spinal fluid). This DNA is tested to reveal whether you are infected with HSV, and which strain of the virus you have.You may also have a viral culture performed.During this test, your doctor will swab one of your lesions and place the sample in a Petri dish. This test takes a little time because the virus has to have time to grow. Once virus growth is achieved, your doctor will examine it to determine which form of the virus you have.This test takes more time and is often less accurate than the PCR., There is no cure for herpes, but you can do some things to help shorten the length of your outbreaks. As soon as you think you may be having an outbreak, you should see your doctor to get some medication. After your official diagnosis, most doctors will provide you with a prescription to have on hand so you can start treatment right away. Valacyclovir is one commonly prescribed medication.If it is your first outbreak, you should start taking it within 48 hours of your first symptoms and take it for 10 days. The dosage will depend on the patient, so you should follow your doctor's instructions.In general, the dosage is 1000mg twice a day for 10 days for the first outbreak. For subsequent outbreaks, the general dosage is 500mg twice a day for 3 days.
If you suffer from frequent outbreaks, which means you have more than 9 a year, you can use valacyclovir as a method of suppression therapy. This means you use the drug to help you stop getting outbreaks instead of taking it at the first sign of an outbreak. If this is your situation, take it as your doctor recommends. The general dose is 500mg twice a day, every day.
Initial symptoms begin as a mild stinging and itching in the region which will progress to blisters within hours to days. Start taking your medication at the first signs of that tingling, burning or itching., This is due to the frequency of the dosing schedule, which causes a decrease in the patient's compliance. However, it is often much cheaper than valacyclovir. As with other medications, the dosage will differ depending on the patient, so you should take it exactly as your doctor prescribes.If you are prescribed this medicine during your first episode, in general you will take 200mg orally 5 times a day, while awake, for 10 days. If you are suffering a recurrent episode, you should take 200mg orally 2-5 times a day, while awake, for 5 days (or up to a year).
You can also get acyclovir as a cream. It is not nearly as effective as oral therapy, but it may assist the healing process in any oral lesions. Apply cream every 3 hours while awake for one week., Like the other herpes medications, it is best to ask your doctor for a prescription for famciclovir within 48 hours after your symptoms begin.The dosage is different for each patient, so you should always take it in compliance with your doctor's recommendation.The general dose to treat an outbreak is 1000mg twice a day for one day. The general dose for suppressing a recurrent outbreak is 250mg twice a day for up to a year.
In general, you will take a tablet twice a day for one day to treat a recurrent outbreak. To keep outbreaks from recurring, your doctor may suggest you take it twice a day for up to a year., There are multiple home remedies you can try to help with your herpes breakouts. Lysine is an amino acid that has been proven to help with outbreaks, especially oral ones. You should take 1000mg of lysine 3 times a day. You can also get more lysine from your diet by eating lysine-rich foods such as fish, chicken, eggs, and potatoes.You can also take aspirin to help with your outbreaks, but talk to you doctor before starting an aspirin regimen. One of its active ingredients, willow bark, helps repress the virus. Take 325mg once a day.
You can also apply lemon balm directly to your lesions. It may provide modest improvement when applied to lesions 4 times a day until your lesions start healing.Kind of like the Zovirax cream, you can buy a topical zinc cream that may help. Apply the cream with zinc oxide in it daily to your herpetic lesions to promote healing. You can also rub aloe vera gel onto the lesions to help promote healing and stimulate new skin growth."

Look for warts as a symptom of low-risk HPV.,
Learn about high-risk HPV detection.,
Screen for other cancers.",How to Recognize HPV in Women (Human Papillomavirus)1," The most evident symptom of a low-risk HPV infection is genital warts. These warts may appear as small raised bumps, flat lesions, or small protrusions from the skin. These warts tend to be grouped, and can show within days or weeks of infection.In women, genital warts are most often seen on the vulva and labia, but may also occur around the anus, in the vagina, or on the cervix.
Low-risk HPV strains may also lead to some lesions around the cervix, but generally speaking will not lead to cancerous cell development.;
, High-risk HPV rarely has any associated symptoms unless it has progressed to an advanced stage of cancer. This is why it is important to get an annual pelvic exam from your OB-GYN, who may be able to detect problems before they advance to a cancerous or pre-cancerous level. Symptoms of advanced-stage HPV that may be causing cervical cancer include:Irregular bleeding or spotting between periods or after sexual intercourse.
Irregular menstrual cycles.
Fatigue.
Weight loss or loss of appetite.
Back, leg, or pelvic pain.
A single swollen leg.
Vaginal discomfort.
Odorous discharge from the vagina.

, High-risk HPV most commonly causes cervical cancer, but it has also been linked to cancer of the vulva, anus, and throat.These cancers can be detected early if you get regular medical examinations, which is why it is important to get regular screenings.


On exposed areas, such as the vulva or around the anus, swipe a flat palm over the area to check for lumps that may indicate genital warts.
If you believe you have been exposed to HPV at any point, alert both your OB-GYN and your general practitioner, and ask them to screen you for any potential cancers associated with HPV.

Get tested to determine the type of HPV.,
Consider whether you have sexually transmitted HPV.,
Evaluate your risks.",How to Recognize HPV in Women (Human Papillomavirus)2," There are upwards of 100 different viruses that are considered a form of HPV. Of those 100+ strains, around 40 of them are sexually transmitted, while around 60 of them cause warts on areas such as the hands and feet.Non-sexually transmitted HPV usually enters your body through skin-to-skin contact, entering through cuts or abrasions on the skin, and will manifest as warts around the area of infection
Sexually transmitted HPV enters the body through direct genital contact, or from skin-to-genital contact. HPV infections around the mouth or in the upper respiratory system may also occur from oral sex. These may manifest as warts, or may have no symptoms. Only a test from your doctor can properly diagnose sexually-transmitted HPV.

, Sexually transmitted strains of HPV are generally broken down into two broad categories: high risk and low risk HPV. About 40 types of HPV are transmitted by direct contact with a mucus membrane, such as those around the genital area. These types are the most likely to be spread through sexual contact.
High-risk HPV viruses are those that are sexually transmitted and are at a higher risk for developing into a serious health risk, such as cancer. High-risk HPV strains include HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, and a couple other strains. The strains responsible for most cervical cancer development are 16 and 18, which are screened for most commonly since they cause about 70% of cervical cancers. Medical testing is necessary to see if you have high-risk HPV.
Low-risk HPV strains include HPV 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 53, 54, 61, 72, 73, and 81. HPV 6 and 11 are the most common forms of low-risk HPV, and are the HPV strains most commonly associated with genital warts. Rarely do low-risk strains lead to cancer, so they are not part of routine screening.

, Certain factor can increase a woman’s chance of contracting HPV. Those who have had multiple sexual partners, a weakened immune system from HIV, immune disorders, or cancer treatment, and those who engage in unprotected sex may all be at a higher risk for sexually-transmitted HPV.Aligning with a risk factor does not mean that a woman has or does not have HPV. It is simply an indicator that she is more likely to be exposed.

Get a Pap test.,
Ask for an HPV test along with your pap test.,
Get any warts screened.,
Talk to your doctor at your annual checkup.",How to Recognize HPV in Women (Human Papillomavirus)3," Pap tests are the primary method for a doctor to check for cervical cancer or precancerous changes to the cervix. If a Pap test comes back irregular, the doctor may opt to perform an HPV DNA test to see if the Pap sample tests positive for HPV.However, some doctors also perform both tests together.


Pap tests are recommended every three years for women under the age of 65 whose previous Paps have come back normal. If you receive an irregular Pap result, your doctor will advise you on a good testing schedule.

, HPV tests are may not be given as part of a routine exam for women, but many doctors perform both tests together. You can request an HPV test along with your pap test if you believe you have reason to worry. Samples for an HPV test are collected the same way as those for a Pap test, by swabbing the cervix.HPV tests are generally only recommended for women age 30 or over, and thus a doctor may not recommend one for younger patients.
HPV is common in young women, and most strains are cleared up by a healthy immune system before any symptoms or complications can occur. Subsequently, your doctor may recommend another screening method, such as a Pap test, to see if there is any need for concern or further testing.
At this point, HPV tests have only been effectively developed for women. Thus, a woman cannot ask a male partner to get screened for HPV in order to assess their risk.

, If you notice any warts, lesions, or lumps around your genital area, contact your doctor immediately. Set up an appointment to have the doctor look at any warts or suspicious symptoms as soon as possible.


Genital warts often go away on their own, and depending upon your specific symptoms your doctor may recommend careful monitoring and no further treatment.
If your doctor does recommend treatment, they may opt for topical treatments or freezing the warts. Ask your doctor if your treatment can be applied at home, or if it must be done by a medical professional.
If you receive treatment for genital warts, ask your doctor, “What should I do to prevent infection in this area and minimize risk of future warts?”, Be sure to talk with your doctor about any concerns you have about HPV. Part of a well woman exam is also an examination of the vulva, vagina, and anal area. If you are concerned that you are at risk for HPV infections, then let your doctor know so that these areas can be examined too.

Use a condom.,
Get vaccinated.,
Discuss sexual history.",How to Recognize HPV in Women (Human Papillomavirus)4," When used correctly, condoms are 97% effective against most sexually transmitted infections. Use a condom any time you have vaginal or anal intercourse, and opt for protection such as a dental dam during oral sex. To properly put on a condom:Inspect the wrapper for any cuts, holes, or punctures, and look for the expiration date. Do not use an expired condom or one that appears to be damaged.
Carefully open the wrapper to ensure that the latex of the condom does not tear.
Remove the condom and pinch the tip before rolling down the shaft of the penis.
While still pinching the tip of the condom with one hand, line the condom up with the head of the penis and use your other other hand to roll the condom down the shaft of the penis to its base.
Dispose of a used condom by tying off the open end and placing in a waste receptacle.

, Vaccines that guard against certain high-risk strains of HPV are now readily available to women and boys. It is recommended that girls get the vaccine between ages 11 and 12, but it may be administered at any point between ages 9 and 26.Boys can get the vaccine at ages 11 or 12, or up to age 21.


The vaccine is ideally administered before a girl or woman becomes sexually active, but may still benefit sexually active young women.
HPV vaccines are generally given as a course of three shots over six months.

, Whenever you begin having sex with a new partner, have an open and honest discussion about your sexual history with your partner. Talk about what types of testing and screening you’ve had recently, and how many sexual encounters you have had since your last test or examination.Take the time to discuss your sexual history before you begin having sex with a new partner.
Do not be afraid to ask them specific questions such as, “Have you noticed any symptoms that may be related to HPV such as warts?” and, “How many sexual partners have you had?”
Do respect a person’s decision to not share information with you if they do not want to, but also understand that you are under no obligation to have sex with anyone and may choose to not engage in intercourse if you cannot get the information you need to feel comfortable consenting.

Wait at least seven days after completing treatment to have sex again.",How to Recognize Gonorrhea Symptoms," 50% of women may have no symptoms at all. Nine out of every ten men will likely experience symptoms. Painful urination, genital discharge and general abdominal/pelvic pain are obvious symptoms of gonorrhea that affect both men and women., You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Direct contact is key. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can also give the infection to her baby during childbirth.Take preventative steps to halt gonorrhea. Prevent Gonorrhea by using condoms, dental dams, or limiting the number of sexual partners you have.

, Gonorrhea can have numerous complication. In women, gonorrhea may cause Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). This can happen when the infection spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes. If untreated, PID can cause chronic pelvic pain and tubal pregnancies. PID can even damage the reproductive organs and make it hard for a woman to have a baby. Gonorrhea can also make it easier for women to contract an HIV infection. Gonorrhea in men can lead to permanent painful urination., Gonorrhea is not a disease that you can cure with home remedies or sanitation. If you are sexually active or suspect that you've been with someone who has contracted gonorrhea, you should consult your doctor immediately., The most common symptom in both men and women with gonorrhea is painful/burning urination. This sensation may disappear on its own, but is often painful enough to send men to the doctor., In both men and women, gonorrhea produces a yellowish-greenish, thick discharge from the genitals. It is a secretion produced by the bacteria itself. In women this secretion can also be accompanied by bleeding between periods. It is the body’s way of expelling the foreign agent.Any unusual vaginal discharge should be examined by a doctor.

, This could be a sign of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) — a common symptom of gonorrhea in women. If you have PID, you might also experience fevers greater than or equal to 101 Fahrenheit. 750,000 cases of PID are diagnosed annually. 10% of those with PID face infertility., In both men and women, gonorrhea can cause general inflammation of one’s genitals.


Women may experience swelling, redness, or soreness of the vulva (the opening of the vagina).In men, gonorrhea can lead to swollen testicles and an inflamed prostate gland., In both women and men who practice anal sex, gonorrhea can produce anal discharge and painful bowel movements. Frequent and persistent diarrhea can accompany anal gonorrhea. See your doctor immediately, if you experience these symptoms., Gonococcal pharyngitis or gonorrhea of the mouth produces sore throat, discomfort while swallowing, general redness, and whitish/yellowish discharge. The symptoms are the same for men and women. People with oral gonorrhea usually do not transmit the disease to others, but it is possible through direct contact with the back of the mouth. Kissing does not normally transmit the disease. Contact between the pharynx and body parts/objects can lead to transmission.Most people with oral gonorrhea often mistake their condition for strep throat or the common cold. Only after visiting the doctor do they discover that they have oral gonorrhea.

, If you are a woman and you have reason to suspect you may be at risk for gonorrhea, get tested. Many women who are infected do not have any symptoms, or symptoms so non-specific as to be mistaken for other conditions.


Gonorrhea requires medical treatment. If left untreated, it can cause numerous serious health problems, including chronic pain and infertility in both men and women. Eventually, untreated gonorrhea can be spread to the blood and joints, which can be a life-threatening condition.

, Your medical provider will take a urine sample or will swab your cervix, vagina, rectum, urethra, or throat — wherever gonorrhea is suspected. There are several tests that can be done, all of which look for the neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria.If you are giving a urine sample, be sure not to urinate for at least 2 hours prior to the test. You want to make sure that the bacteria hasn’t been flushed out before taking the test. Most tests can be completed in a couple of days.

, In some cases, gonorrhea can have lasting effects. Women may experience cervicitis, tubo-ovarian abscesses, or even ectopic pregnancies.Men may face continued pain along their epididymis (the duct that connects the testicles to the vas deferens) for up to six weeks after initial infection. , The standard treatment for gonorrhea is a 250 mg injection of ceftriaxone along with 1g of azithromycin, which is taken orally. A 400mg single dose of cefixime may be given along with 1g of azithromycin if ceftriaxone is not available.Since some strains of gonorrhea have become resistant to these medicines, you may receive additional antibiotics to treat gonorrhea.
You will need to get tested for gonorrhea again in about four weeks to determine if the treatment worked or if you need to be treated with another type of medicine. You will also need to be retested every time you change sexual partners.

, You want to be certain that the disease has cleared your system to avoid further transmission."

It may even wake you up at night., You may also feel this pain around but not actually in your testicles., Pain or discharge from the rectum is also associated with chlamydia. Your infection may be based in the rectum or could have spread from the penis., This is another potential symptom of chlamydia that can infect and then inflame the epidydimis, causing testicular pain and swelling.Be sure to tell your doctor if you are having pain in your testicles."

These behaviors include oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex.Abstinence is a good choice for some people but is not realistic or desirable for many people, however. If abstinence is not an option, there are many ways to reduce your risk of infection.
Note that abstinence-only education is usually less effective than more comprehensive forms of sex education. Even if you plan to be abstinent for a time, it is good to educate yourself about safe sex practices should you find yourself in that situation.;
, The safest kind of sexual activity is sexual activity with only one partner as long as this partner also remains monogamous. Be sure that both you and your partner have been tested for STDs before having sex. If neither of you is infected and you both remain monogamous, your risk for infection is very low., The fewer sex partners you have, the lower your risk is for contracting an STD. You might also want to consider how many sex partners your own sex partners have had. The fewer people they have had sex with, the lower your risk of contracting an STD., Before having sex with someone, make sure they have been thoroughly screened by a doctor for STDs.Most STDs can be tested for, and many of these can be treated. If your partner tests positive for an STD, refrain from having sex until after his treatment. You can resume sexual activity with a partner after his doctor says that it is safe to do so.


If your partner says they have been tested, ask for which diseases. Often people are only checked for gonorrhea and chlamydia, not HIV, hepatitis, or herpes.
Be aware that the Human Papilloma Virus (or HPV) cannot be tested for in men., Communication is key when it comes to protecting yourself against an STD. Be open about your own sexual health and history, and make sure that your sexual partners show you the same respect. Do not have sex with someone who is uncommunicative or angry about sexual health discussions: safe sex requires the active consent of both partners., Drinking alcohol reduces inhibitions. This may lead you to make bad decisions, such as not using protection, that you would not make when you are sober.Alcohol and drugs also increase the risk of condom failure because you are less likely to use it correctly.Make sure you are sober enough to make healthy choices during sex.

, Drugs, much like alcohol, can reduce inhibitions and lead to bad decisions or condom failure. Injectable drugs can also spread certain STDs, because bodily fluids are exchanged if needles are shared.


AIDS and hepatitis have been known to spread through needle sharing.

, Before engaging in sexual activity, make sure that you and your partner agree on what constitutes safe sex.If you are only willing to have sex using a condom, make that clear to your partner. Support each other in your desires to remain healthy in a sexual relationship.

, Some STDs, such as genital herpes, are more likely to spread when symptoms are visible. If a potential sexual partner has open sores, rash, or discharge, she might have an STD and that STD may be more likely to spread.If you see something suspicious, refrain from sex until your partner can be seen by a doctor.

, Oral, anal, and vaginal sex can all spread STDs.While oral sex with a condom has the lowest risk of transmission, there is no 100% ""safe"" sex. You can, however, protect yourself to lower risks of STD a great deal.

, Forms of protection such as male condoms, female condoms, and dental dams greatly reduce risk of STD infection. There is always some slight risk, however.Talk to your doctor if you have questions about the effectiveness of sex protection.

, Some forms of STD prevention also help prevent pregnancy, such as male condoms; however, there are many forms of birth control that have no impact whatsoever on STD transmission. Remember that any nonbarrier form of birth control, such as hormonal birth control, IUDs, or spermicide, will not prevent the spread of STDs.

, Most condoms are made of latex and are effective at preventing STDs; however, there are some condoms (that are often labeled as ""natural"") that are made out of other materials such as sheepskin. These non-latex condoms might prevent pregnancy but not the spread of STDs. To be safe, be sure that your condoms explicitly say ""disease protection"" on the packaging., Condoms are very effective and reliable, so long as they are used correctly. They can be purchased at most drug and grocery stores, sex shops, or obtained for free at some hospitals and clinics. Use condoms every time you engage in sexual activity: they only work if used consistently.


Male condoms fit on the penis and are put on before engaging in penetrative sex. They work for vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Open the package carefully (not with your teeth or a pair of scissors), place it so that the rolled up edges are facing away from the person wearing it, pinch the tip, and carefully roll it on. Inspect it for tears or holes and if you feel it break at any time, pull out immediately. Also, use lubricant to keep it from tearing due to friction. When the act is completed, pull out (while holding the condom on) before the erection is lost and carefully dispose of the condom. Absolutely do not reuse a condom.Female condoms are also available. Female condoms can be inserted by the woman before intercourse and fit inside the vagina, just below the cervix. Female condoms are inserted much like a tampon.They are harder to find but are usually carried by hospitals and clinics. Female condoms can be made out of latex or out of polyurethane material. Female condoms are particularly useful for women who wish to be responsible for their own forms of birth control or STD prevention. Polyurethane female condoms can be used by those who are allergic to latex or for those who wish to use oil-based lubricants., Never ""double up"" on condom use. For example, men should not wear more than one male condom at a time. And a male condom and female condom should never be used at the same time during sex. Using more than one condom during sex increases the likelihood of condom tears and breakages, making them much less safe than a single condom used correctly., Check the expiration date on the condom package. Only use condoms that have not expired: an expired condom is more likely to fail during use.

, Condoms are less likely to fail when they are stored in cool, dry places such as a dresser drawer. Condoms that are stored in hot or sunny places such as a car or wallet will need to be replaced frequently to ensure that they do not tear during use.

, Dental dams are latex sheets used to protect against STDs like herpes when performing oral sex on a vulva, penis, or an anus. They help protect your vulnerable mouth tissues from infection. Dental dams can be purchased anywhere where condoms are sold. In a pinch, non-microwavable plastic wrap or a condom that has been sliced open might work., Use latex gloves for manual stimulation. This will protect you and your partner if there are cuts on the hands that you are unaware of, as these can also harbor infections. They can also be used as a makeshift dental dam.

, Also use protection on any sexual devices or sex toys that you share with others, such as dildos or anal beads. Many STDs can be spread by unsanitary devices. Clean and disinfect these toys after each use. Condoms can be used on dildos and vibrators as well. Use a new, fresh condom with each use and with each separate partner. Many sex toys also provide proper cleaning instructions that you can follow.

, Oil-based lubricants such as mineral oils or petroleum jelly can lead to tearing and failure in latex condoms and dental dams. Only use a water-based lubricant. Most lubricants will state on the label whether or not they are suitable for use with condoms or dental dams.Some condoms have lubricant already on the condom., There are vaccinations available for a few diseases that can be passed sexually. These include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and the human papillomavirus (or HPV). Talk to your doctor about getting yourself or your child vaccinated at the recommended age in order to protect sexual health.It is recommended that infants receive the Hepatitis A and B vaccines and that children who are 11 or 12 years old receive the HPV vaccine; however, adults who have never been vaccinated can talk to their doctors about getting these vaccines.The HPV vaccine is not approved for people over age 26.

, Some studies show that men who have been circumcised are at a lower risk of STD infection, including HIV infection. If you are a man at a higher risk of STD contraction, consider male circumcision to lower your chances of infection., Truvada is a new drug that helps reduce the likelihood of contracting HIV. If you are in a high-risk group for contracting HIV, talk to your doctor about Truvada. For example, if you have a partner who is HIV positive or if you are a sex worker, Truvada can help protect your health.Note that Truvada is not sufficient to prevent HIV infection alone. Always use condoms when having sex with an HIV positive partner, even if you are also taking Truvada.

, Douching (or using chemical and soaps to wash out the vagina) removes important bacteria that can help prevent the spread of STDs. The bacteria in your mucus membranes are useful protectors against STDs, and you want to keep your good bacteria healthy., Not all STDs are symptomatic; however, there are some indicators that you or your partner might have contracted an STD and should see a doctor. Common symptoms include:Sores and bumps around the vagina, penis, or rectum
Pain while urinating
Pain during sex
Unusual or foul-smelling discharge from the vagina or penis
Unusual vaginal bleeding

, Do not avoid doctors if you are worried about an STD. Many STDs are treatable and even fully curable, if caught early. Be honest and open with your doctors, and inquire about your treatment options., While everyone should get tested frequently for STDs, there are certain demographic groups who should be tested more frequently. These include:Pregnant women or women who are trying to become pregnant
People who have HIV — they are more susceptible to contracting other STDs
People who have sex with HIV-positive partners
Men who have sex with men
Sexually active women under the age of 25 — they require more frequent chlamydia tests
Sexually active women over the age of 21 — they require HPV tests
People born between 1945 and 1965 — they are at higher risk for Hepatitis C
People who have multiple partners, have a single partner who sleeps with multiple partners, use prostitution services, use certain drugs, have unprotected sex, have a history of STDs or STIs, or had a parent with certain STDs when they were born are all at higher risk, Get yourself tested every three to six months if you are at high risk and every one to three years if you are at low risk. Anyone who is sexually active is at risk, so even if you are in a monogamous relationship it is a good idea to get tested every few years. In protecting yourself and dealing with the problem before it is spread to others, you reduce the risk of STDs spreading in the general population. You protect everyone by protecting yourself. Testing can be done in doctor's office, a local clinic or via a lab-certified at-home testing service, such as myLABBox.com.


Testing is especially important when you have a new sexual partner.Tests are available for HIV, syphilis, herpes, trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and hepatitis B., Your doctor will usually test for STDs by giving you a physical exam and testing your blood and urine. If you have genital sores or discharge, these fluids might also be tested for STDs., Encourage your partner to get tested as well. Emphasize that this is the best decision to keep both of you safe. This does not mean that you do not trust them or have not been trustworthy yourself. It is simply a smart decision

, If you cannot afford to get tested or you do not have health insurance, seek free testing services if you are concerned you may have contracted an STD. There are multiple places to find free testing services. Some good resources to consult about finding a free testing service include:


Your local public health department
Planned Parenthood
Your school or church
Community clinics
The Internet
A local hospital

, There is no shame in getting tested for an STD. You are making a good, smart health decision for yourself and everyone around you by getting tested. If everyone got tested frequently, STDs would be much less common. You should be proud that you are doing your part to protect your community., HPV in men cannot be tested for, for example. Even if your doctor gives you a clean bill of health, it is still a good idea to use condoms during sex., If your doctor tells you that it is not safe for you to have sex, follow those instructions. For example, people with genital herpes should not have sex in the middle of an outbreak. Only resume sex when your doctor says that it is safe to do so.You should not have sex until you and your partner have completed treatment for any STDs.

, If STD testing reveals an infection, notify your current and previous sexual partners so that they can get tested as well. If you do not want to notify them in person, some public health clinics provide an anonymous service to notify people who might have been exposed to an STD."

Note vaginal discharge.,
Pay attention to pain.,
Check for bleeding after sexual intercourse.,
Tell your doctor about rectal pain, bleeding, or discharge.",How to Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms (for Women)1," If you experience unusual vaginal discharge, this may be a sign of chlamydia infection or another STI.Signs that vaginal discharge is abnormal may include a different or unpleasant smell, a darker color, or a texture you've never experienced before.
If you suspect that your vaginal discharge is abnormal, consult your doctor, gynaecologist, or other health professional for testing and treatment.
Bloody discharge between periods can also be a sign of chlamydia.;
, Pain during urination and/or pain during intercourse could be a sign of a chlamydia infection.If you experience pain or extreme discomfort during sex, refrain from intercourse until you can be examined by a health professional. Chlamydia infections can cause pain during vaginal intercourse for some women.
Burning pain during urination usually indicates some sort of infection, from a yeast infection to an STI. Seek medical treatment at once.

, Some women experience minor bleeding after vaginal intercourse, and this symptom is sometimes associated with female chlamydia., Bleeding, pain, and/or discharge from the rectum are symptoms of chlamydia. If you have vaginal chlamydia, the infection could have spread to the anus. If you engage in anal sex, the infection could be based in the rectum."
"
Watch for lower back, abdominal, and general pelvic pain.,
Monitor a sore throat.,
Watch for nausea or fever.",How to Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms (for Men)2," These aches, also known as reactive arthritis, can indicate that a chlamydia infection.Approximately one percent of men with urethritis will develop reactive arthritis, and approximately one-third of these patients have the complete reactive arthritis triad (RAT) formerly referred to as Reiter syndrome (arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis).Scrotal pain and swelling is the most common. If left untreated, as the chlamydia progresses, you will have a feeling of fullness in your abdomen, caused by infection in the epididymus, that leads to these other lower body aches.

, If you recently engaged in oral sex and have a sore throat, you could have contracted chlamydia from your partner this way, even if he wasn’t showing any symptoms.Transmission of chlamydia is possible from penis-to-mouth, as well as through vaginal and anal sex.

, Men with chlamydia may develop a fever and become nauseated, especially if the infection has spread to the ureters.A fever is generally anything higher than 37.3C or 99F.

"
Know if you are at risk.,
Don't wait for symptoms to occur.,
Get tested.,
Have treatment right away.",How to Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms (for Men)3," People who are sexually active, especially having unprotected sex and with multiple partners, are at risk for contracting chlamydia. Chlamydia is caused by the bacteria ‘’Chlamydia trachomatis’’ and is contracted through vaginal, oral, or anal sex when mucous membranes come in contact with the bacteria. Anyone who is sexually active should get regular STI tests, including testing for chlamydia.You are at higher risk if you have had unprotected sex with someone who has chlamydia or another STI. Chlamydia can be prevented by using latex condoms and dental dams.
Younger sexually active people are at higher risk.
Men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of getting chlamydia.
You are at higher risk if you have been diagnosed with other STIs.
Transmission through oral sex is less likely than vaginal or anal sex. Mouth-to-vagina or mouth-to-anus transmission is not known to occur but mouth-to-penis and penis-to-mouth is definitely possible., It is possible to have a latent infection and not know it, so it is a good idea to get tested regularly, especially if you have unprotected sex.Men who go untreated may develop a condition known as nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), which is an infection of the urethra (the tube that men pass urine through). Men may also get epididymitis, which is an infection of the epididymis, which is the tube that carries sperm away from the testes.
Chlamydia can damage a woman’s body even if she isn’t experiencing any symptoms. Untreated infections cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can eventually lead to scarring and infertility for your female partner. This is the main reason why screening is important.
If symptoms do occur, they usually appear within 1-3 weeks after infection.
Even if you are not symptomatic, if your partner discloses that she has chlamydia, get tested immediately.

, Contact a local health clinic, your doctor, a Planned Parenthood clinic, or other agency that offers STI testing. In many cases testing is free.Testing usually occurs in one of two ways. A swab from an infected genital area may be taken and analyzed. For men, this means a cotton swab is inserted into the tip of the penis or into the rectum. However, a urine sample may also be taken, and this is more commonly used because it has been shown to be as effective as using a swab., If you get tested and do have chlamydia, the treatment is usually a prescription for oral antibiotics, particularly azithromycin or doxycycline. If the antibiotics are taken fully as directed, the infection should clear up in a week or two. For more advanced chlamydia, intravenous antibiotics may be administered.If you have chlamydia, your partner should also be tested and you both need to be treated to avoid re-infecting each other. Sex should be put on hold during this time.
People with chlamydia often also have gonorrhea and thus will often be automatically treated for this second STI as well, because treating it is actually cheaper than testing for it."
"
Watch for mild and slowly progressing lower back, abdominal, and pelvic aches.,
Seek help for a sore throat.,
Monitor nausea and fevers.",How to Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms (for Women)2," Women may also experience higher back pain similar to kidney tenderness. These aches may indicate that a chlamydia infection has spread from the cervix to the fallopian tubes.As the chlamydia progresses, your lower abdomen may be tender to gentle pressure.

, If you have a sore throat and have recently engaged in oral sex, you could have contracted chlamydia from your partner in this way, even if he was without symptoms.


Penis-to-mouth transmission of chlamydia is one of the possible means of transmission of this infection.

, Women with chlamydia will often develop a fever and become nauseated, particularly if the infection has already spread to the fallopian tubes.Anything higher than 37.3C or 99F is considered a fever.

Know your risks for chlamydia.,
Get tested before symptoms occur.,
Have one of two types of tests.,
Get treated immediately.",How to Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms (for Women)3," If you have oral, vaginal, or anal sex and have multiple partners and/or unprotected sex, you are at risk of contracting chlamydia. Chlamydia is transmitted when the bacteria ‘’Chlamydia trachomatis’’ comes in contact with your mucous membranes. Anyone who is sexually active should get annual STI tests, including testing for chlamydia.You should also get tested after every new sexual partner.


You are at higher risk for chlamydia if you have unprotected sex, as your partner might have chlamydia or another STI. These infections can be prevented by using latex condoms and dental dams.
You are at higher risk if you have been diagnosed with other STIs.
Younger people are at a higher risk of contracting chlamydia.
Since men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of getting chlamydia, be sure to talk to your male partner and make sure your partner is not having sex with anyone other than you.
Mouth-to-vagina and mouth-to-anus transmission is not known to occur. Mouth-to-penis and penis-to-mouth transmission is definitely possible, though transmission through oral sex is less likely than via vaginal or anal sex.

, Chlamydia does not cause symptoms in 75% of infected women. Chlamydia could be damaging your body even if you haven't experienced any symptoms. Untreated infections cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can eventually lead to scarring and infertility.When symptoms do occur, they usually arise 1-3 weeks after infection.
Get tested immediately if your partner discloses that he has chlamydia.

, A swab from an infected genital area can be taken and analyzed. For women, this means a swab of your cervix, vagina, or rectum and, for your male partner, a swab is inserted into the tip of the urethra or rectum. A urine sample may also be taken.Ask your doctor or visit a local health clinic, Planned Parenthood, or other agency that offers STI testing. In many cases testing is free., If you do get diagnosed with chlamydia, treatment via oral antibiotics, particularly azithromycin and doxycycline, will be offered to you. If you take the full course of antibiotics as directed, the infection should be gone in a week or two. For more advanced chlamydia, you may need IV antibiotics.


If you have chlamydia, your partner should also be tested and on treatment so you can avoid re-infecting each other. All sex should be put on hold until treatment is finished.
Many people with chlamydia also have gonorrhea, so your doctor may put you on treatment for this infection as well. The cost of treating gonorrhea is cheaper than running the lab tests for it, so you might be put on this treatment without being tested."

Wear sparkly see-through sweaters over shirts. Pouffe-like sleeves are also big among the Bratz dolls. A vest is also super cool when it's spruced up with some bling.

, These are especially nice with rhinestones, appliques, and jewels. It's best if they are skorts, or you wear appropriate leggings.skirts


Wear tight mini-skirts. These are a staple part of the Bratz' wardrobe. If you can't wear mini-skirts, then wear leggings. They're warm and so cute! Tights under mini-skirts in the winter are awesome.
Gorgeous fancy skirts look amazing for parties.

, Jeans are super-cute with heels. Bratz dolls are into bell-bottom jeans, but skinny jeans tucked into boots are also super-fab. Jean shorts are also good over leggings. You can spruce up some old jeans with some cool bling.


Buy cute jeans with rhinestones and other appliques.

, Always wear high heels and boots. If you're not allowed to wear high heels then just wear flats, wedges, square heels or boots. Sparkly flip-flops are also acceptable.


You can do any kind of heel-Converse heels, boot heels, whatever you like. If you can't wear heels, then certainly wear flats, Converse, or no-heel boots.

, Accessories and bling are very important to the Bratz dolls. Go ahead and wear sparkly earrings, necklaces, and bracelets all at once.


Long earrings are a must. (If you don't have your ears pierced, you can get snap-ons or magnetic).
Wear one comfy choker, and two to three long necklaces.
Bracelets are also important. Wear lots of them (especially with short sleeves).
Bangles and charm bracelets are best.

, Get ones with neon colors, eye-popping color combos, and cool animal prints. Claire's Accessories is a good spot to shop for this look.color

, These are warm yet stylish. They are best in winter, when it is practical. However, during other seasons you can wear just one as a fab fashion accessory. You can also make them. Cut off the feet of some cool knee socks, and cut places for your thumbs. Ta da! you can also add bling like rhinestones, jewels, and buttons.

, No Bratz doll would ever be caught without her purse. Go to a thrift store and pick out something you like. Always have an emergency makeup kit, your cell, and emergency cash in your purse.

, The Bratz wear sparkly eyeshadow and mascara. Use lots of super sparkly and shiny lip gloss. Apply a blush, but remember you want the focus to be on the eyes and lips.

, Liquid eye liner works best, but normal is also great.

, Don't use mascara. Use fake lashes or nothing at all. Mascara can damage you lashes.

, Use a little, but only if you need it. The focus should be on the eyes and lips.

, For a true Bratz doll look, you need to go overboard on the lips. Use lots of super-shiny gloss over a hot pink or purple lipstick. (Don't use lip liner!)

, They either wear ponytails coming out from the tippy-top of their head or loose hair. Crimp your hair, add highlights to your hair, curl it, etc. If it's short, straighten it and clip in extensions. Use sparkly barrettes, scrunchies and bobby pins.


Choose a high ponytail. This is a good Bratz hairstyle.

, Most Bratz dolls wear their hair loose., If you're allowed, do two streaks. One on each side of the head, in the very front by the face.

, Wear jumpers either on their own, or over a t-shirt. Gwen has a navy, tank jumper, which is best worn over the white t-shirt. Look out for other smart, thin, close fitting sweaters, preferably with v-shaped, or wide necklines.

, Gwen favors skirts over trousers, but if you feel better in trousers, try black or dark denim skinny jeans. Get a couple of skirts - straight or pencil style, in either denim or corduroy. These should come to just above the knee. For colour, think dark blues and browns. If you want something a little more playful, try a looser, purple cotton skirt, a little shorter than the others.

, Try to favor socks over tights (Although feel free to wear skin colored tights under your socks, if you feel more comfortable). Find several pairs of black socks that come to either just below or just above your knee. These can be decorated with lace, or buttons if you like.

, Find a good pair of knee high leather boots, in either black or tan. These should have a low heel, and be either pull on or zip up. If you want something more suitable to warmer weather, try black ballet pumps or ankle boots.

, In the last scene of the film, Gwen is seen wearing a straight-style, dark blue dress with navy, velvet polka dots. she wears this with a cardigan in a similar colour. This could be more suitable for formal occasions.

, Try to find a knee length mac, in either beige or dark green, and wear it left open. If you like you could try to find a waist length, long sleeved woolen jacket, with a flat, curved collar.

, Gwen does not wear much jewellery, apart from maybe a small pair of stud earrings. However, she is very well prepared for cold weather, look out for a beige cable knit hat, and matching finger less gloves. You could also try to find a white cotton scarf with blue polka dots.

, Find a brown leather backpack, similar to that which Gwen uses for school.

, Straighten your hair. Either wear a plain black headband, or if your hair is long, tie it into a mid-high ponytail. Use a red ribbon to make a bow around the base of the ponytail.

, Wear light make up, a touch of mascara, brown eyeliner and pinkish blush is all that is needed. If you like, you could also wear a little lipstick similar to your natural lip shade.

Get the right type of clothing.,
To be like Isaac Newton, change your behavior.,
To look more like Isaac Newton, you have to look very serious.,
Be left handed, or try.,
Now you will look somewhat similar to this man wearing an Isaac Newton costume.

",How to Cosplay Isaac Newton," Look at pictures of Sir Isaac Newton and study his face carefully.;
, If you have natural wavy hair, you're in luck you don't need to use the iron curlers or straighteners. Skip this step.

, Skip this step if your hair is naturally brown, gray, or white. This step is optional since there are a few pictures of Isaac Newton with blonde or black hair. If your hair is red, dye it brown, gray or white.

, Sir Isaac Newton wore: Egg white blouse- crumbled. Black haired over coat that went down to his shin. Hairy gray pants that went down to the top of his ankle. You must wear something similar to the 1700s fashion. Wear a buttoned coat, get a powdered wig (optional), wear black buckle shoes, a white ruffled shirt, long white stockings up to your knees, and shorts up to your knees.

, In the earlier part of his life, Newton was a deeply introverted character and fiercely protective of his privacy. Even in his maturity, having become rich, famous, laden with honors and internationally acclaimed as one of the world's foremost thinkers, he remained deeply insecure, given to fits of depression and outbursts of violent temper. The term “darkness” can be applied to much of Newton's personality. Adjectives that have been used to describe facets of his personality include “remote”, “lonely”, “secretive”, “introverted”, “melancholic”, “humorless”, “puritanical”, “cruel”, “vindictive” and, perhaps worst of all, “unforgiving”.

, Don't laugh or smile and don't be mean to others. Draw a line in the middle of your chin for a dimple. Isaac Newton has a dimple on his chin.

, Isaac Newton was left handed.

Remember your values.",How to Cosplay Barbie," Though Barbie is an adult, she has inspired children for decades. You’d never see her drunk, with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, or even swearing. Limit your vices by quitting smoking or drinking if necessary. Be nice, set a bit of time aside to volunteer for a good cause, and always have a cheerful attitude and a smile.;
, Barbie wears mostly eye shadow, mascara, and blush, so you might even be able to get away with a more natural look.


Set your face with a translucent powder.
Wear mascara, which is key to the Barbie look; apply fake eyelashes if you want to. Wear feminine eyeshadow colours like pink, light blue, purple, etc. Eyeliner is purely optional, though you can brighten your eyes by applying white eyeliner in your water line. Just remember to never get stuck in the black eyeliner rut. Experiment with colors; navy blue, for example, looks amazing with any skin tone.
Barbie has a tiny nose, so it's important to contour your nose: apply a neutral brown colour and lightly run the brush along the sides of your nose. Get rid of the hard edges with a fan brush.
For your lips, apply a good moisturizing lip balm, then apply a pink lipstick or lipgloss. Once you have done this, get your concealer and, using a brush, make perfectly shaped lips: outline your lips in concealer (the harder the edge, the better), accentuate the cupid's bow, and blend the concealer in.
Barbie also had a brand at Mac; these products are specifically in Barbie shades and colours and even come in cute packaging.
Even out your skin with a nice foundation. Flawless skin is a must.
True Barbie girls never forget blush. Make sure it's a natural color (pinks, reds, maroons); Bronzes, browns, and golds always look good on brown skin tones and make fairer skin look tan. Soft, sultry, full lips pull the look altogether.

, Brush your teeth and tongue twice per day; also, take a bath/shower once a day, every day. Always wash your face.

, It always needs to stay clean and neat. Lots of body and shine are a must, but avoid letting it become greasy. If you have curls, style them; having perfectly straight blonde hair isn’t a requirement, as Barbie has had every possible kind of hairstyle (including a bald head to help de-stigmatize chemotherapy patients).

, Barbie may be plastic, but remember that that's what makes her perfect: she has even, unblemished skin. Don't forget to apply daily.

, Use fake nails, gels, or acrylics or, if your nails are long enough, get a French manicure. For a classic Barbie look, paint your nails pink. A baby pink is a great look.

, Barbie isn't mean; she is friendly, kind, and caring. Personality is the key to success if you want to be like Barbie. Make conversation, smile, compliment others, and have confidence in yourself. Confidence can be displayed by the way you talk, walk or appear, so make sure you look approachable and have great posture as well.

, Barbie has been a tennis player, Olympic star, Baywatch babe, and an ice skater. She's physically fit and you can be too. Although Barbie is famous for being super skinny, this is not her most important trait: confidence is key – and a Barbie who takes care of her body will feel more confident about it.

, There’s nothing Barbie hasn’t tried her hand at; she even ran for president in 2004.Ask your boss for a raise, try to get into an Ivy League school, start your own business, and follow your dreams.

, Barbie has been a fashion icon for over five decades and there’s almost nothing she hasn’t tried on at some point. Children grow up not only mixing and match her outfits, but also sewing her their own designs. Be stylish and experiment with all kinds of clothes, especially if they’re not what you’d usually wear. Look in both high- and low-fashion magazines for inspiration. Don’t forget accessories like earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and belts.

, Barbie has no fear of going out and talking to people. Develop self-esteem, get more friends, and have faith in yourself.

, Be sure you always have something to do by making plans with friends; whenever people ask you if you did anything interesting over the weekend, you should always have an exciting answer. Also, being busy with actual activities makes you less beholden to the emptiness of a life driven by fashion or other ""poverties of ambition"" much maligned by today's political power-brokers.

, The most important thing is to be yourself, feel good and happy, and not trying to be something or someone that you are not.

You will only build a following if people think you have something new and special to offer in the way of style inspiration. So try to just be yourself!
, You don't have to avoid the big fashion house names, but a Tumblr girls' style is all about seeming eclectic and not accessible, not spending the most money.

, Tumblr girls are known for the way they mix and match stuff, sometimes opposite and purposefully clashing ways. Don't be afraid to follow trends from other styles-- from hip-hop to hipster, retro to runway.

,, Try to wear clothes and accessories that aren't in every girl's closet. Thrift-shopping can help you find some amazing and unique things —and usually pretty cheap. Most Tumblr girls have a unique or retro touch to their look for this reason. Small boutiques can also offer designs that will set you apart from the usual mall styles.

, Tumblr girls are always on top of every trend in fashion. Keep an eye on what other popular profiles are wearing and try to add in some fresh elements into your own looks—without looking like a copycat. Once in a while, try something weird and daring. Something that other Tumblr girls haven't done. If you have enough followers, it might just catch on.

, Don't just show off your summer party dresses, Tumblr girls have great looks for every occasion and every season. Learn how to look stylish and unique even in big winter coats or a simple bikini. And dress with the seasons! Know what's in style for the season.

, Tumblr girls are each unique and fresh, but there are some that tend to be popular. Start with these to put yourself in the Tumblr girl crowd, and then branch out with your own unique touches. Some items in the Tumblr girl look include:Highwaisted shorts or pants






Oversized tank tops






Plaid shirts






Sleeveless button-downs
Shirts with fringe
Crop tops






Toms or Converse shoes






Thick rimmed glasses

, Every girl is different, but Tumblr girls usually look like they are wearing very little makeup—nude lips, especially. This makes it like like they are normal, casual, relaxed people just having fun, and confident in themselves and how they look.The exception is the eyes. Tumblr girls tend to have very prominent eyes, which means eyeliner and plenty of mascara—sometimes fake eyelashes, but not noticeably fake. Make sure that your eye makeup is prominent, but not super crazy, because then you will look like you have dead eyes.
Don't be afraid to change it up. Once you develop a natural makeup look, you can make a photo pop with bright lipstick.

, There is no one hair style that all Tumblr girls have. They can be blonde, brunette or redhead. Their hair can be very short or very long. It does have to look styled, however.


Change your hair frequently. One of the secrets to keeping your look fresh and cute to a big audience on Tumblr is to change your hair style a lot. Do something new every few months, either changing the color, letting it grow out, cutting it short, or buzzing it on the side. Changing your hair will make your old outfits seem new.
If you have long hair, style it in different ways. The messy bun is a Tumblr CLASSIC, as are hair bows. Try curling it, wearing it to the side, or just braiding it.
If you do prefer to keep a single hairstyle without changing it, let it change and refine over time. Don't keep the same hair.

, Once you've got your own look, your work isn't done. Tumblr girls ALWAYS seem to take their pictures in beautiful, photogenic places. Make sure your room is decorated in a fun and fresh way that goes with your style and personality. Find photogenic places outside around your neighborhood or town that you can go to take your photos. Natural lighting is very important to a lot of Tumblr girl photography, so make sure the outside places you go compliment your style as well.

, Successful Tumblr girls do a little more than just camera-phone selfies. Buy a decent DSLR camera and a tripod and learn how to use them well.


Consider investing in some professional camera lighting. If you are going to be taking some of your photos inside, having better lighting can make all the difference.

, This is the essence of being a Tumblr girl. Your photos need to be cute and flawless, but at the same time look like you have a semi-normal and accessible life.


Use natural light. Go outside or find a sunny room in your house to take your photos. You can take some inside shots too, but don't ever use light that is going to blow out your complexion unless you can correct it in Photoshop.
Find unique settings. It isn't just the outfits that make them so popular: Tumblr girls always seem to be out and about in interesting places. Check out the most photogenic places in town, from parks to old buildings, from graffiti-covered train tracks to your friend's pool. Even just a wooden fence or a brick wall can make a photo pop.
Try different poses. Don't just stand there: mix it up with smiles, grins, glares, dance moves, gang signs, and so on.
Bring in other characters. If you have friends who want to get in on the Tumblr style action, let them join you in some of your photos. Involve your pets, too. Nothing says ""Tumblr"" like a cute girl in a cute dress with a cute dog.

, There's no getting around it: the proper application of Photoshop, or occasionally some other photo-editing software, will improve your photos and let you touch up your own skin and features to achieve that flawless Tumblr girl look. Tumblr girls never seem to have red-eye in their photos, do they? That's because they use Photoshop. Just be careful: when used poorly it will be painfully obvious that your pictures are Photoshopped.


Try different filters to make your photos look more scenic. Filters have become very popular recently with the explosion of services like Instagram. Play around with retro looks, especially for outside shots. Just don't go overboard! The filters can't make up for mediocre style or photography.

, You have your style, and some great photos. It's time to show the world! Go to Tumblr.com and start a new account. Then work to make your page unique and expressive of your persona.


Give it a memorable and catchy name, or just use your own name if it is easy enough to remember.

Chose a theme. Find one that matches your style, if you can, but picking something fairly minimal will let your content take center-stage. Choose one that showcases photos, not text, such as one of the three-columned themes that lets you scroll infinitely without having to click on to a new page.
Customize your theme. Add a logo and change up the colors or fonts if you like.
Add music. Some people will find this annoying, but it can really set the a tone for your photos, especially if you pick a song that most people don't know.

, The best way to get followers on Tumblr is to be active and engaging with other people. Find other users whose style or photos you like and follow them, re-blog their pictures, favorite their posts, and ask them questions. You'll be surprised how many followers you'll get without having to promote your blog off Tumblr at all.

, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are all good places to post your content. Build followings on these networks to drive new people to your blog.

Put on the music: Tecktonik is danced to forms of electro, like dirty, progressive, or new beat; many do it to house electro, too.,
Make big movements with your arms.,
Swivel your feet from side to side.,
Go over and around your head.,
Cross your arms in different ways.,

Get the haircut.,
Get accessorized.",How to Dance Tecktonik," But stay in the electro house area because it would be weird to tecktonik to happy hardcore, wouldn't it? You could try it, but then you might be at a loss at the club!


Need some ideas? DJ Ivan Flash, Marc De Siau, DJ Milok and Tecktologic are good artists to start with. You can also look for remixes of popular hit songs -- the Black Eyed Peas, David Guetta, and Bastille are just a few examples of artists that have picked up on the electro-remix bandwagon.;
, Tecktonik is a dance that's about 80% am movement and 20% feet movement.And while there are a few standard moves, anything that's sharp, reminiscent of vogue-ing and hip hop, and, most importantly, on beat will make you look like a pro on the dance floor.


Some describe it as like a windmill or your body being like a rubber band. Others might describe it as a very eccentric way of directing traffic -- but whatever image you choose, you can see that it's intense, dramatic, and all over the place in a very systematic, patterned manner. You arm might shoot directly up on a downbeat, jab at to your sides, and then make circles above your head. It's crazy, but it also makes sense with the music.

, Electro music goes pretty fast, so keep your feet moving with each beat. Move both your heels followed by both sets of toes side to side, back and forth. Then, when you start getting comfortable, you can add in some crosses and some weight shifts.


And even kicks. Start by bringing up your foot to your butt, winding up for the kick. Then bring your leg out, foot swiftly jutting in front of you and plant it on the ground. You can do this several times in succession, all the while keeping your hands moving swiftly, too.

, One of the signature moves of Tecktonik is sweeping your forearm in front of your head and bringing it around and out to the side. Kind of like you have serious fringe in front of your face that you're sweeping away rhythmically.


More often than not, your arms will be somewhere around your shoulders, jutting out to your sides, above your head, or spinning on circles near your neck. From any one of these points, take your left or right hand, point your fingers down, and sweep it in a circling motion around the opposite side of your head.

, A common Tecktonik move is crossing your hands at your wrists and orbiting them around each other, in a twirling motion. You can also circle your forearms and weave them in and out of each other in elaborate, hard-to-follow patterns. Many keep one arm around the core and shoot out the other to the sides, in front, or above them, accentuating the downbeats in the music.


Make sure to work on all planes; that is, low, medium, and high; to the right, to the center, and to the left. Switch it up! The more varied your dance, the less repetitive (and more impressive) it is.

, While Tecktonik does have fairly standard moves, it's ultimately up to you to add to it your own sense of style and rhythm. Take the basics -- structured yet intense arm movements and light-on-your-feet swivels -- and run with them. As long as you're feeling that beat you'll be ready for anything.


Experiment with working on different levels for your entire body. Bring your torso down, your knees up, and get crafty and moving. Come up with intricate patterns for you arms, entwining your wrists, playing with the angles of your elbows, and going in fast and slo-motion. It's up to you!

, Go to clubs, raves, electronic music festivals, and other electronic music gigs to dance at. Meet other ""Tecktonikers"" and start dancing in public. You and a group of friends can start jamming anywhere, even if it's just in a filled parking lot, at the mall, school, and any other crowded place. Just try it and have fun!

, The general style of this -- and there definitely is one -- is skinny jeans and bright, fluorescent shirts. If skinny jeans aren't your style, you could also wear cargo pants, UFO pants, or even leg warmers with gators. Anything that glows is good, too.


Tecktonik is an actual brand name, now. You can get sued for using it without running it through the company!So if you're in serious doubt over what to wear, buy the trademarked clothes!
Remember, true Tecktonikers aren't too picky with clothes and aren't very into fashion; most just want to dance and have a good time.

, For girls, put your hair down. It doesn't have to be short or long, but just keep off the top of your head because most Tecktonik moves are up close to your head, a ponytail could offset your style. For guys, the look is a mullet-mohawk combo. That means it's long in the back, short on the sides, and gelled up in the front. Does it get any better?


If your job or the 'rents wouldn't approve of the mohawk, get a buzz cut, faux hawk, or Emo style.

, In addition to the skinny jeans and fluorescent tees, don't forget bracelets! Lots and lots of bracelets. They can go halfway up your forearm if you want. And if they glow, even better.


Seriously, glowing. Check out any rave that has Tecktonik music and get your glow on with glowsticks and body paint. The brighter the better!

Recognize the benefits of short naps.,
Find a secret place to nap.,
Sit in the back of the room.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Maintain good posture.,
Find an ally.,
Recognize the power and danger of microsleeping.",How to Fall Asleep with Your Eyes Open1," Falling asleep for even just 10 minutes can help improve your energy, concentration, memory, and focus. Indeed, napping should be considered an asset in improving productivity. Consider building naptime explicitly into your schedule so that you can maximize your potential at work or school.Taking a longer nap is not recommended, since it increases your likelihood of being noticed without providing the maximum benefit. Try to keep your naps to just a few minutes in length when you are at work or school.;
, In an ideal scenario, you will be able to nap in complete privacy, so that your colleagues and bosses do not realize that you are napping. Find an out-of-the-way location where you can stretch out and close your eyes for just a few minutes.If you can, see if you might be able to nap in the following places:


Your office
Your car
A bathroom
A seldom-used storage room

, You don't always have the option of napping in private. If you have to go to work or school exhausted, try to get a seat toward the back of the room, away from the speaker or teacher. Give yourself some space to rest without getting caught. As long as you remain at the back of the room, it is unlikely that someone will notice that your eyes are closed., If you feel yourself begin to nod off at work or school, put on a pair of sunglasses. Not only will you be able to sleep more effectively in a dark environment, but it will be less likely that you will be noticed. Nobody will realize that your eyes are closed.If you do not have a pair of sunglasses, consider wearing a hat or cap that you can pull over your eyes during key moments.

, One of the giveaways that you are sleeping isn't your eyes at all: it is your body language. A slumped posture with a slack jaw, open palms, and open mouth is much more likely to draw attention to your nap than your eyes. When you fall asleep in public, rest your elbow on the desk in front of you and bend your arm 90 degrees. Then prop your head up on your closed fist. This will help keep your head upright and will disguise your nap., If you are forced to nap among your colleagues or fellow students, enlist a friend who can assist you if you are in danger of being noticed. Your ally might wake you up if your name is called or nudge you when everybody is moving their seats. Be sure to return the favor if your ally also wants to take a secret nap every now and again.

, Microsleep is a condition when your brain falls asleep while you are in the middle of a task such as driving or working. Your eyes might remain open during this period even though your brain is not functioning normally. This condition can be powerful, since nobody will realize that you are asleep, and your eyes might indeed remain open. However, this is also a dangerous condition, especially if you are driving a vehicle or operating machinery. If you find yourself losing a few minutes of time, you might be experiencing microsleeps.Microsleeps are more likely to occur if you experience a prolonged period of poor sleep.They are also more common among those who work second or third shifts.
You cannot intentionally microsleep; they are caused by chronic sleeplessness and exhaustion.

Recognize the benefits of meditation.,
Recognize that meditation can mimic, but not fully replace, sleep.,
Tell yourself that meditation can be done with your eyes open.,
Find a dark, quiet place to practice meditation techniques.,
Get comfortable.,
Practice focusing on two sets of objects at once.,
Breathe deeply.,
Integrate open-eye meditation into everyday life.",How to Fall Asleep with Your Eyes Open2," Meditation can improve your focus, concentration, energy, and overall happiness. Meditation can also significantly reduce your stress levels. Studies also demonstrate that those who practice any kind of daily meditation are generally more optimistic about life., Moreover, meditation can allow your brain to cycle between beta waves (when you are awake) and alpha waves (the stage that immediately precedes sleep).By meditating, you are not replacing your sleep cycle. However, you are giving your brain the rest periods it needs in order to be fully awake during your beta cycles. Only 10-15 minutes of meditation can provide this positive, sleep-like benefit.Those who meditate regularly do not need to sleep as often as those who do not meditate.This is one of the reasons why many people find it easy to fall asleep immediately after meditating: your brain is primed to fall asleep. Meditation is not the same thing as sleep, however.Meditation can also be used to correct sleep disturbances for this reason., Many people expect that meditation requires closed eyes. However, there are methods for meditating that do not require you to close off your vision. Indeed, some people report feeling particularly rejuvenated and refreshed after an open-eye meditation experience.This type of meditation is particularly useful for those who have to integrate meditation into their public transit commute, workday, or school day: you can meditate without being noticed. All you need is a place to sit and a few minutes of time in which you can meditate.

, If possible, choose a dark, quiet, calm place to practice your open-eye meditation. When you become more advanced, you will be able to meditate in the middle of a busy classroom. But to begin with, try a dimly lit space in your home. Close the blinds and turn off your devices in order to eliminate as many distractions as possible., Keep your back upright but loose. Sit comfortably. Many people enjoy sitting in the lotus position to meditate. However, you are free to meditate in whatever way keeps your body relaxed. Just be sure that you maintain a good, non-slumping posture. You can sit on a chair, kneel, or even lie down if you prefer. Keep your hands loose and open, resting in your lap.Some people find that incense or scented candles can help them relax and focus. Feel free to try this as you begin to practice open-eye meditation., You will not be able to meditate with open eyes right away. To build up your open-eye meditation skills, begin by practicing having each of your eyes focus on a different object. Choose one object to your left to focus on and one object on your right to focus on. Try to maintain this dual focus for as long as you can, even if it's just a few seconds.


Your brain will be so focused on the visual information that all other distractions and mental noise will begin to disappear, allowing you to achieve a restful, relaxed meditative state.
Gradually increase the time you spend focusing on these two sets of objects. If you want to challenge yourself, you might also try turning your head while keeping the image of these two objects in your mind.
Soon you will begin noticing other objects in the room that are in front of you. Be aware of these objects, but do not let them distract you. For example, you might be awed by a beautiful beam of light in your home. However, you do not want to think about the dusty shelf you have to clean that you just saw. Dismiss such worries from your mind.

, Once you have gotten used to focusing on two sets of objects at once, begin to integrate deep breathing exercises into your meditation. Breathe in through your nose for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, and then release slowly through your mouth. While you might have to explicitly time yourself as a beginner, your goal is to make deep breathing automatic eventually so that you no longer have to ""count"" inside your head.

, Once you have mastered the art of open-eye meditation in a calm, controlled environment, you can begin to bring it into your daily life. It will be challenging to do so at first, but you must be patient and forgiving with yourself. Let your body be a source of calmness and relaxation even while the world around you is chaotic and distracting. Soon, you will be able to achieve a restful, focused state with your eyes open when you are at work, school, or on the bus.

Divide your worries into things you have already dealt with and things that you have a plan for dealing with. While you write, imagine that you are physically removing all these worries from your mind and placing them on the paper. This will help you put your worries away at the end of the day.Try not to leave any of your worries completely unresolved. If you can't deal with them before bed, make a simple plan for when and how you will deal with them so that you won't have to think about it while you are lying in bed.
If you worry about things that you cannot solve or influence, like global warming or your children’s well being on a school trip, write those down as well and tell yourself that you are discarding them as you write them down.
Do not write in your journal right before bedtime. You want to give your mind a bit of time to relax and forget about the worries that you have written down.You can also try keeping track of your daily habits, including foods you ate and the amount of exercise you got, in your journal.

, If your mind is racing with anxieties or obsessive thoughts, sometimes the best thing to do is to acknowledge their existence and actively work to dismiss them. The next time you find yourself worrying about something for no reason, take control by telling yourself that it is an obsessive thought and encouraging yourself to rise above it. Then distract your mind from the thought by finding a task or another thought to occupy yourself with.It may help if you repeat a mantra to yourself. Try something like: ""I am having an obsessive thought about _____. There is no need for me to worry about _____, so I will think about _____ instead.
It may also help to take a moment to analyze your worries and think about all of the reasons why they are not productive things to worry about. You can try incorporating something like ""It is not worth my time to worry about _____ because _____"" into your mantra.If you encounter a legitimate worry that genuinely requires action, focus your energy on brainstorming possible solutions to the problem, instead of ruminating about all of the bad things that might happen. Once you have come up with a solution, tell yourself, ""I no longer need to worry about _____ because I have made a plan for dealing with it."", If you are worrying about the uncertainty of the future, try repeating the worry to yourself several times. As you do so, tell yourself that you don't know what will happen in the future, and that you're okay with that uncertainty. Eventually your mind will become more comfortable with the thought you are having and will move on to other thoughts., Your worries may stem in part from your resistance to showing other emotions, such as anger or sadness. Don't be afraid to talk about your feelings, or to cry when you feel sad. Releasing your emotions like this will help you feel much better!While it's important to acknowledge your emotions, it's also important not to allow yourself to dwell on negative feelings, as this can lead to more anxiety.

, While it is important to get adequate sleep, it is also important to recognize that one poor night of sleep will not cause you any harm.

You can also focus on an everyday object and attempt to describe it to yourself in vivid detail.
Focus all of your attention on the natural rhythm of your breath and try to visualize your breath entering and exiting each part of your body.
Busy your brain by trying to think of as many items that fit into a certain category as possible. For example, you could attempt to name all animals whose name starts with the letter A., If you have been lying in bed for a long time and are unable to fall asleep, it's better to get up than to lie there worrying. Try moving to a different room and engaging in a relaxing activity, such as knitting or reading, until you feel tired.

, Some people find it helpful to take a warm shower, bath, or sauna before bed. This triggers your body's natural response to cool itself, which will help you fall asleep.Try using soothing aromatic bath oils such as lavender.
It is also important to wear comfortable pajamas that are made of a material that will wick moisture away from your body, like cotton. This will help keep you comfortable throughout the night., For the best sleeping conditions, your room should be cool, dark, and quiet. You can use a fan or white noise machine to help drown out outside noises if you like.You should also make sure your mattress, bedding, and pillow are comfortable. Some people respond well to keeping the bed area tidy, too. Make your bed with a set of new or freshly washed plain matching bed sheets. In choosing the bedding go for a quiet colour, without any patterns, and for natural, skin friendly fibers. A fresh, tidy and comfortable bed would encourage sleep or at least make your tossing and turning less irksome.

, If you never do other activities in your bed, your brain will associate it with sleep, which should make it easier for you to fall asleep when you are there. Avoid activities like watching television, working, and using your phone in your bed.It's best not to perform these activities in your bedroom at all, but if you must, sit in a chair or on a sofa instead of on the bed.
Remove all non-sleep-related items from the immediate vicinity of the bed. This means plates, magazines, your laptop, etc. Reduce the items on the night table to a few vitals: an alarm clock, a reading lamp, one book, a glass of water.

Knowing which position you tend to sleep in is important for picking the correct pillow., Although you may already have a pretty good idea about your preferred position, it is good to take a few nights to confirm it.


When you are getting ready to fall asleep, spend a few minutes on your back, on your side, and on your stomach. See which one feels the most comfortable for you. If you spend half an hour on your stomach and you haven’t fallen asleep, it’s probably not your preferred position.
Try to be aware of the position you are in when you wake up in the morning. Write down the position you woke up in so you can compare over a few days.

, Now that you have spent time thinking about and discovering your preferred sleeping position, it’s time to decide. This is an important decision, as it will guide you to your perfect pillow.


If you are a stomach sleeper, you will need a soft, fairly flat pillow, or you may not need any pillow at all. Having a soft pillow will allow your neck to stay more in line with your spine.
If you are a back sleeper, look for a medium thick pillow. You don’t want it to be too thick, or it will push your head too far forward. You also don’t want it to be too soft, or your head will simply sink down to the mattress. In this case, you may want a pillow which is thicker and firmer on the bottom, to provide a bit of neck support.

Side sleepers will need a thicker, firmer pillow to help support the neck.
If you find that you are a mixed sleeper and you find many positions comfortable throughout the night, look for a pillow that is of medium thickness, and a bit softer so that it can be used comfortably in different positions

, There are many types of pillows, and each type has different things to offer.


Consider any medical issues you have. If you have asthma, allergies, or chronic neck pain, you may need a particular filling.
Consider the cost. Some pillow fillings tend to be more expensive than others.

, These pillows are typically made from the inner plumage of geese or ducks and can be filled according to your preference.


More firmness, or loft, suits side sleepers while less loft is better for back or stomach sleepers.
They can last up to 10 years and are resilient and breathable because they are made of a natural material.
Be aware that there is a difference between a down pillow and a feather pillow. Down is very light and soft, and is usually located underneath the harder, stronger feathers, which protect the bird from the elements.A feather pillow will likely be harder, and there is a chance that some of the feather quills could poke through the fabric, particularly in cheaper feather pillows.
Although there is no scientific evidence that down or feather pillows exacerbate allergies or asthma,some people prefer to avoid them.
You might wish to avoid down/feather pillows for ethical reasons, or due to asthma or allergies. In this case, there are synthetic versions available.

, A wool or cotton pillow might be particularly suitable for you if you suffer from severe allergies, as these pillows are not susceptible to dust mites or mold.Be aware that these pillows tend to be quite firm, so they may not be the most suitable for stomach sleepers.
If you are a stomach sleeper, but you also want a pillow that is hypoallergenic, you may be able to find a very thin wool or cotton pillow.

, These pillows are made from the sap of rubber trees, making it elastic and resilient.


These pillows are good for allergy sufferers, as they are mold resistant.
They tend to be cooler than memory foam and can form to fit your head and neck.
Latex pillows come in all shapes and sizes. Consistencies vary as well, some use shredded material while others are made of solid cores.
They do not offer as much ‘give’ as a memory foam pillow and can be quite heavy, and expensive., These pillows are made of polyurethane, which is then mixed with additional chemicals.


Memory foam pillows come in all shapes and sizes including an S-shaped version.
They provide good support, especially if you have neck, jaw, or shoulder problems.
They are long lasting and are good at forming to the contours of your head and neck.
High density is best in order to avoid the material breaking down.
Be aware that this material can make you hot, as it doesn't ""breathe.""
If you tend to move around a lot, these pillows may be uncomfortable since they take a bit of time to mold into different shapes.A new memory foam pillow may have an unpleasant odor which will go away after a short while.

, Certain sleeping habits and health conditions may mean that a ""normal"" pillow may not be your best choice. However, be aware that while a specialty pillow might be helpful for you, there is not much research to back up claims the manufacturer might make,and they can be quite expensive.


A positional pillow is a lower case n-shaped pillow that claims to help those with sleep apnea stay in the ideal position. The pillow also claims to help reduce tossing and turning throughout the night.Cervical pillows provide extra firmness in the lower part of the pillow in order to provide support for the neck.The claim is that these pillows will help reduce neck tension and headaches, however, there has not been sufficient research to back up this claim.
Anti-snore pillows claim to help position the head so that the airways remain open by lifting the chin away from the chest.Cool pillows are designed to include fillings that absorb head heat in order to keep you feeling cool.Although they can be used by anyone who wishes to keep cool at night, they may be particularly suitable for someone suffering from hot flashes.
Oxygen pillows are designed to promote the circulation of air, which is meant to help you breathe more freely and deeply while you sleep.While some claim this has helped relieve pain, doctors are not sure how or whether or not this technology actually works., After determining what type of pillow you think might be right for you, look around online. Read reviews for different pillows before going shopping, especially if you are thinking of buying a special pillow, such as an anti-snoring or cooling pillow, which can be expensive, and may not do what it claims to do.

, The best pillow for you may not be the most expensive one. Try out different pillows in different price ranges.

, Many stores that sell pillows also sell mattresses. If you can, take the pillow and lie down with it for a few minutes to try it out. This will give you a more realistic idea of whether the pillow is right for you or not.

, If you are unable to lie down with a pillow, try standing next to a wall in your favorite sleeping position. Place the pillow against the wall. If the pillow you are testing works with your body, your neck should be aligned with your spine.It may be difficult to tell on your own if your neck is not aligned, so bring a friend along to help you.

, Some stores, such as Ikea,offer the opportunity to return your pillow if you are not happy with it. Before purchasing a pillow, ask about the return policy.

Whether you pulled an all-nighter or are suffering from insomnia, your first idea in the morning may be to get some strong coffee to help you power through the day. This is OK. Just don’t over do it.Caffeine from coffee, tea, or energy drinks will give you a real, short-term energy boost. It will make you feel more awake and alert.
Caffeine counteracts the build-up of sleep hormones in your brain, but only to a point. You won’t get much benefit after the second or third cup of coffee. Instead, you’ll get jittery.
Try not to drink caffeine after about 4 pm, as it can interfere with your sleep later that night.;
, Your body on little sleep will crave simple carbs. Don’t listen to it! Simple carbohydrates and sugars will give you a quick boost followed by an insulin crash, making you feel sleepy later on.Instead, try to eat whole grains, protein, and some fruit. Aim for foods that give a steady energy supply and keep your blood sugar stable.
Make sure to stay hydrated, too. Drink water or eat foods with high water content, like vegetables and fleshy fruit.
You might be tempted by an energy drink, which will give you a fast shot of sugar and caffeine. However, the high is usually followed by a big crash. Check the sugar content if you go this route and try to pick a low-sugar or sugar free label.

, You may need to refresh your mind more often the day after a rough night. A little rest will pay dividends, so take breaks throughout the day whenever you feel the need. It will improve your attention and concentration.Take a walk outside, for example. The light exercise and natural light should recharge your brain.
Exercise is great for the sleep-deprived. Just take it easy. You’re more likely to get injured if you exercise while fatigued.
Try a cat-nap, too. A short snooze of no more than 25 minutes will leave you feeling energized. More than that and you can wake up groggy.

, By the end of the afternoon, you’ll probably feel completely beat. Should you go to bed early? The answer is no. Hitting the sack at 8 pm instead of your normal 10:30 pm can actually disrupt your sleep patterns even more.Use moderation. It’s OK to add a bit more time to either end of your night’s sleep, but don’t overdo it. Try to wait until about an hour before your normal bed time to retire for the night, for example.
Limit your sleep-in to two hours or less the next morning. If you usually get seven hours of sleep, go for nine.

, Most importantly, be safe. Don’t do anything while drowsy that could be risky. Be smart, use common sense, and keep others around you out of harm’s way.Don’t drive or use heavy machinery if you are tired and sleepy.
Be particularly careful in the early afternoon – this is when people feel the most drowsy during the day.
If you can’t stay off the roads, try to carpool, use transit, or take a power-nap immediately before you drive. Go without sunglasses, too, as natural light makes you feel more energetic.

, Without 8 to 10 hours of solid sleep, you’re likely to feel tired and muddle-headed during the day. Try to start a routine to get yourself on track: go to bed and get up at the same time each and every day.You might plan to get to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am, for 8 hours of sleep, for example. Or, maybe you’ll try to get 9 hours by going to bed at 9 pm and waking up at 6 am.
Either way, don’t stay up too late. Chances are that you have to get up in the morning for work or school. A late night will mean cutting into your overall sleep time.

, One key to getting into a regular sleep schedule is letting your body know when it’s day and when it’s night. This involves giving your body cues to wake up in the morning, and vice versa.For example, make sure that it’s dark when you sleep. Have the lights off.
Light helps to restart your body in the morning, on the other hand. Open the blinds, go outside for a few minutes, or at least turn on the lights when you wake up.
A little bit of light activity will also help rouse you in the morning. Walk around your room or house for a few minutes or do some light stretches.

, Ensure that you get to bed at a reasonable hour, but also make sure you get up! Sleeping in will do you no favors when it comes to having a regular bed time. In fact, it will reset your sleep schedule.Try waking up the first day at your target time, say 7 am. Go to bed the next night at 11 pm.
You might not feel tired at 11 pm, at first, and that is OK. If you keep getting up at the same hour, your body will slowly adjust and in a few days you should be ready to hit the sack at 11 pm.
Stick to your wake-up time no matter what, even on mornings when you’ve lost sleep.

, It might be hard to get into your new sleep schedule at first – use an alarm clock to enforce your wake-up time. Alarms can even help you slowly adjust to the new schedule. Here’s how it works:Set your alarm for a wake-up time. Say your goal is 6:30 am. At first, set your alarm for 7 am. Then, shave off a couple of minutes each day until you get to your target. It will only take 2 weeks to shave off a half hour.
Don’t ride the snooze button. You may love the snooze button, but it’s actually hurting your sleep. Snoozing makes your body think it’s still time for sleeping rather than for waking up – this is called “sleep inertia” and it makes you feel groggy., Organize your bedroom so that you can maximize your relaxation and sleep. You can do this with basic design elements – colors, lighting, and furnishing – but also with things like temperature.


Some people believe that certain colors promote rest. Try yellows and soft blues, for example, which are supposed to help you relax. Stay away from red and purple hues, which stimulate the mind.Furnish your bed with soft pillows and other downy blankets or comforters. Try using the same sleep-inducing colors for them.

, Did you know that the air temperature in a room can affect your sleep? The best temperatures for sound rest are between 65 and 72 degrees F. Set your thermostat for this happy median.Decrease the amount of light that filters into your bedroom, too. Turn off the lights at night, but also close the blinds and curtains. Consider investing in a pair of heavy-duty blackout curtains.Get rid of or drown out noise, as well. Start wearing earplugs to eliminate sounds that disturb you. Or, consider drowning out the noise with low-level sound, from a white noise generator or soft, ambient music.

, Devices like television, phones, iPads, computers, and other electronics are addictive and may keep you up later than you want. There’s more to it than just that, though. They may also be chemically keeping you awake. Banish them from your sleep kingdom!Electronic devices have backlit screens that suppress your body’s production of a hormone called “melatonin,” which helps us sleep.
Unplug or power down your devices at least one or two hours before you go to bed.

, You’ll be ready to nod off more readily if you help your body with relaxing, calming rituals. These activities should speed the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness. Aim for a ritual that lasts at least an hour.Try taking a warm shower. If you have access to one, a short dip in a Jacuzzi tub can be very peaceful.
You might also lay down and read a good book for a half hour. Find one that you like but that’s enough of a challenge to make your eyelids droop.
Dim the lighting to let your body know that bedtime is approaching. A lower wattage bulb works well, as does candle light. Just be careful – don’t nod off with a candle burning unattended.

, Coffee, tea, and energy drinks all have the stimulant caffeine. Caffeine is a drug that makes you more alert, but it can disrupt your sleep. It also stays in your system for hours. That cup of coffee you have every day at 5 pm? It could be keeping you up.Try to avoid ingesting caffeine after about 2 or 3 pm.
If you need a little pick-me-up in the late afternoon or evening, try lightly steeped black tea or green tea. Both have much less caffeine than coffee.
Another tip is to “cut” your coffee in the afternoon with ½ or ¾ decaffeinated coffee. You’ll still get the taste, but suffer less later.

, Like caffeine, alcohol is a drug that can disrupt your sleep patterns. Alcohol is a depressant, and some people think that a glass of wine or two helps them fall asleep. In fact, it’s actually reducing the quality of your sleep.You get less deep and restorative sleep when you drink before bed, especially of the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) kind you need to dream.
Sleepers under the influence of alcohol also tend to wake up more often and are more tired the following day.
If you like a beverage before bed, consider sipping on some hot cocoa or chamomile tea. The warmth can make you drowsy.
Warm milk is another classic, sleep-inducing beverage., You’ve heard it before. You have to exercise to be fit and maintain a healthy weight. But exercise is also great when it comes to sleep. In fact, studies show that as little as two 20-minute workouts per week can help the quality of your sleep.For the most part, more is merrier when it comes to exercise. Try an aerobic exercise like walking, running, biking, or swimming.
Exercising will boost your mood, metabolism, and whole system. However, avoid doing it too close to bedtime. Those boosts might also sabotage your night’s sleep.

, For some people, a late night snack helps with sleep – it keeps them from waking up hungry in the middle of the night or early in the morning. But everything in moderation. Eat a small meal or snack or drink some tea if you get hungry at night, just don’t overdo it.


Make sure your late-night beverage is soothing and caffeine-free, as said.
Don’t eat large portions or heavy foods. High-fat or large meals take a lot of work for the body to digest. All the rumblings might keep you up and alert.

, As a last resort, talk to your doctor if you are constantly losing sleep. She’ll be able to work with you to figure out a plan and can even prescribe something to help.


You might have to do a sleep study. This involves spending the night sleeping at a medical facility, hooked up to electrodes, where experts can measure your body functions and brain waves.
Your doctor could recommend melatonin. This come as a pill supplement and does not need a prescription. It’s quite safe.Your doctor could also prescribe a sleep aid like Ambien or Lunesta. Be aware that some prescription aids are habit-forming or cause grogginess.
Talk with your doctor about possible side-effects. As always, only take medication that has been prescribed to you.

Understand why you want to be more comfortable in the dark.,
Begin in a place you know well, such as your own bedroom.,
Start off slowly by removing artificial light.,
Use natural light.,
Learn to be comfortable with shadows.,
Begin moving around at night, instead of just lying in bed.,
And finally, learn to appreciate the beauty of darkness itself.",How to Enjoy Darkness or the Night," Is it because you are just afraid of the dark, or one of the numerous other possible reasons? Realizing your true intentions and confronting your fears does wonders for the mind and spirit.;
, This will help you be less afraid, and gives you a sense of security.

, If you sleep with a nite-lite, turn it off for a while, longer every night, until you don't need it. Nix computer monitors, always-luminous clocks, fishtank lights, and TV screens.

, Leave your shades open; the moon can be surprisingly bright, if you have no other light source, and even an empty sky casts a gentle glow. Exterior lights from cars and streetlamps are fine as well.

, A shadow is merely an absence of light, not a creature or a black hole. Moving shadows from headlights are somewhat harder to deal with, but are still immaterial, and thus nothing to be feared.

, Start with your room, and then progress to walking around your entire house, just exploring. When you're ready, take on places like the basement and other such areas. Eventually, try going outside if it's feasible. Just be careful not to get hurt.


Also, combine this with normal night-time activities like walking to the bathroom or going back to your room after a movie, just don't turn on any lights.

, Very few things compare to the lustre of the full moon, or the dynamic flow of shadows cast by passing cars. Sounds of the night are also much more interesting, because our brains are not used to them. Take in everything around you, and see the beauty of a world that no one else knows.

Have a positive mental attitude and keep your stress level low.,
Consider, but do not overly rely on, special foods and supplements that claim to increase your libido.,
Consider the under-appreciated psychological component of sex drive.,
Prepare for intimacy.,
Find out which scenarios spark magic for you and your partner.,
Seek the help of a sex therapist, if necessary.,
Be patient.,
Understand the role of testosterone in regulating long-term sex drive for both women and men.,
Use strength and resistance training to boost testosterone levels.",How to Increase Libido," If you feel good and self confident you may feel more sexual and attractive to your partner.


Prolonged stress can lead to a diminished interest in sex.For people who work stressful jobs, or those with a long commute (we all know how stressful traffic can be), a pinched sex drive is often the result.
Men and women react differently to stressful situations. For men, sex is often a release of stressful energy; for women, stress makes sex anathema or beside the point.Understand the different reactions between the sexes and talk with your partner about engineering the right, non-stressful time for sex.;
, Natural supplements can help increase blood flow and sometimes help fight vaginal dryness.


Some natural supplements that may increase libido include: vitamin E, zinc, vitamin C, arginine, vitamin A, vitamin C, Octacosanol, Beta-carotene, vitamin B6, and vitamin B complex. These nutrients may help to boost sperm count, improve sperm motility, enhance prostate gland function, increase testosterone production and create a healthier nervous system.
Some foods that may increase libido include: Celery, raw oysters, bananas, avocado, nuts, mangoes, peaches, strawberries, eggs, liver, figs, garlic, pumpkin and chocolate.
Certain foods and natural supplements such as these may add much needed nutrients and minerals to your diet, but they are unlikely to make a bigger impact on your sex drive and sexual performance as:

(1) a healthy, nutritious diet with plenty of lean protein, and a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables (particularly dark green leafy vegetables such as kale or spinach);
(2) possibly daily vitamin and nutrient supplements to address any dietary deficiencies;
(3) regular exercise (enough to make you sweat) and resistance training; and
(4) reaching and maintaining a healthy body fat %.



, Sexual desire can often be triggered, or dampened, by environmental stimuli.


To avoid ruining the mood, remove the following types of items from your bedroom:

Photos of your parents or children (which people sometimes feel are ""staring"" at them). The same goes for pets who like to hang out on or by your bed.
Stacks of papers, books, and work-related files (and clutter more generally).


To help set the mood:

Select lighting that can be dimmed or light candles. A soft, low-watt, full-spectrum bulb provides the most favorable lighting.
Let some fresh air into your room and use incense, essential oils, or lightly scented candles to create pleasant smells (go for subtle smells - spraying cologne or perfume into the air can sometimes be too intense and overpowering).



, If you are planning a romantic evening with someone, and hope to get him/her ""in the mood"":


Coffee and chocolate are both great to eat beforehand. Both foods are considered aphrodisiacs because they produce positive mood states, release endorphins, provide energy (caffeine), and increase physical endurance.
Wine and other forms of alcoholic drinks may help people to relax, though only a small amount is recommended. High consumption can result in impotence in men. Excessive consumption can cause the person to pass out, or lose awareness of the situation. In both these situations, no consent can be given and any sexual advances will either be considered unlawful sexual conduct, or rape.

, Sexual desire tends to be associated with different scenarios for different people.


You do not need to recreate every detail from those scenes. With a little imaginative, improvisational role-playing, you can incorporate one or two key elements from the scene - such as a costume or a prop - and create a scenario that is likely to liven the mood.
Sometimes it is better to take a more understated approach if you are new to role-playing with a partner. Often, just the hint of something someone finds particularly exciting can be enough to enhance his/her experience.

, If you are experiencing sexual problems that prevent you from desiring, initiating, or enjoying sex, consider whether these issues may be psychological in origin. If you think they may be, seek help from a sex therapist.


Sex therapists often treat individuals for issues like impotence or loss of sexual pleasure that may spring from an underlying and possibly undiagnosed depression.
Sex therapists provide talk therapy to individuals and couples, and often assign them ""homework"" to help them take steps at home to regain normal levels of sexual functioning.
For example, sex therapists may encourage a couple to explore different ways to be intimate with each other without having intercourse, to help rebuild trust and a feeling of mutual acceptance and non-judgement in bed. The basic idea underlying most of these types of ""homework assignments"" is that sex has become an experience associated with stress, pressure, and disappointment, and thus you need to learn to re-associate sharing intimacy with having fun, mutual acceptance, exploring, and giving each other pleasure.

, If you have a partner who is being treated for lost interest in and enjoyment in sex, or for issues relating to sexual performance, be patient and realize that treatment can take several months or more to be effective:


If you are just starting to date someone who is experiencing these issues, you are under no obligation to continue dating him/her. Everyone has the right seek sexually satisfying relationships, and to end a relationship because they are sexually incompatible with someone, or for any other reason. If you think you will leave the person eventually if there is not notable improvement, you may hurt him/her less, and be less likely to give him/her a complex by leaving now, versus later.
If instead, you are in a long-term, committed relationship with someone, a sexual therapist may be able to give you tips on how to help you remove some of the pressure and judgement your partner may feel when you try to have sex. If your partner's difficulties originate from past trauma, s/he may need to see a therapist on his/her own as well.

,


Women's libido, and interest in initiating sex, responds to testosterone supplements, for example, which have been approved in Europe but are still undergoing testing by the FDA in the United States.Men are also commonly given testosterone supplements by their doctors to treat abnormally low testosterone levels, increase libido, and improve sexual performance. Both men and women's natural testosterone production tends to naturally decline with age, but the decline can be accelerated by smoking, heavy drinking, and gaining excess amounts of body fat while being physically inactive.
Men's testosterone levels naturally peak in the early morning hours, so if you and your partner have been experiencing difficulty having sex - or if your male partner's interest in having sex has been waning lately - try having sex in the morning. Make sure you have enough time before work to enjoy yourselves, though, since thoughts of being late to work could dampen the mood.

, This should have a more dramatic impact on sex drive and sexual performance than nearly any other type of treatment.


The most effective method to boost testosterone - and thus long-term libido - in both men and women is to begin strength and resistance training to build muscle mass. Whenever you break down and rebuild muscles by lifting weights, or doing resistance training exercises like pushups, you create a spike in testosterone production that lasts for many hours.
Both men and women report increased interest in, and enjoyment of sex, when they regularly engage in vigorous exercise that results in the tearing down and re-building of muscle, and thus stimulation of the production of testosterone.
Often, a spike in testosterone and sex drive can be noticed immediately during or after a workout. For many couples, working out together can become a stimulating experience that gets them in the mood.
When combined with a healthy, nutritious diet that includes plenty of lean protein, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, strength and resistance training can help men and women lose excess body fat (which tends to dampen testosterone production, when at overweight to obese levels).
Vigorous strength and resistance training are complimentary to a good sex life for reasons beyond boosting testosterone and libido in both men and women:

They increase performance, range of motion, and endurance;
Boost mood, confidence, and energy levels;
And help you look (and feel) younger and more attractive.

Turn off all electronics.,
Make your bedroom cool, quiet, and comfy.,
Set your alarm.,
Find a comfortable sleep position.,
Close your eyes and visualize a field with a long fence.,
Picture a herd of sheep in a field.,
Begin to count the sheep.,
Do deep breathing as you count the sheep.,
Do laying meditation and deep breathing.,
Try muscle clenching and releasing exercises.,
Wear a sleep mask and ear plugs to bed.,
Listen to music or to a sleep sound machine.,
Consider taking sleeping pills.,
Avoid over-the-counter medications that can cause insomnia and sleep issues.",How to Count Sheep," To prepare your body and brain for bed, you should switch off all electronics such as your phone, your computer, or your television. The light that emits from the screens on these electronics can stimulate your brain and reduce your brain’s ability to produce melatonin, a substance that helps you to sleep. You should also avoid bringing any electronics into your bed with you, as it may be more difficult to shut them off or block them out when you are trying to sleep.


Rather than go on your phone or your computer when you are lying in bed, choose to do a relaxing activity that does not involve electronics. For example, reading a good book, writing in your journal, or talking quietly to your partner.;
, Create a comfortable atmosphere to encourage sleep by ensuring your bedroom is not too hot and not near any loud noises. Use heavy curtains or shades to block out the light from your windows and cover any electronics in your room with a blanket so the light does not create a glow in your room.


You can also use a sleep mask to cover your eyes and block out the light. Layer your bed with blankets and sheets so you can shed layers as you get hot at night and so your body does not overheat.

, Make sure you set any alarms before you get into bed so you do not have to get up once you are settled. You should try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every night so your body gets used to your sleep schedule and you are not overly tired during the day.


If your sleep schedule is not consistent, you can fix your sleep schedule by noting if you are overly tired in the morning or if you oversleep and making small adjustments to your sleep schedule over a period of time. You will need to give your internal clock time to get used to your new sleep schedule, but as long as you commit to going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day and night, your sleep schedule should gradually become more regular.

, Some people like to sleep on their backs or stomachs and some people prefer sleeping on their left or right side. If you have a tendency to snore, you should avoid sleeping on your back or your stomach, as this can restrict your airways and lead to snoring. However, you should choose a sleep position that you find comfortable and natural, as this will likely allow you to get the best sleep.


If your natural sleep position is on your back, you should use pillows to raise your head and ensure you have a comfortable, supportive mattress. If you are pregnant, you should sleep on your left side with a body pillow and several other pillows to make sure your sleep position is healthy for your child and comfortable for you.

, This field is the spot where the sheep graze. The field could be very green, with lots of grass. The fence may be white or another color of your choosing.


You may also want to picture the sky and the area surrounding the field, such as trees, a country road, and clouds hovering above the field.

, These are the sheep you are going to count as a way to help you fall asleep. Often, sheep are depicted as white with curly hair, four legs, and a tail.

, Once you have a herd of sheep in the field, start to count each one, beginning from “1”. You may want to picture the sheep jumping over the fence in the field and count each sheep as it jumps, or you may simply count the sheep at random.


There is debate that this method of counting sheep encourages sleep, as it forces you to use your brain to count the sheep and keep track of them as they jump over the fence. Simply counting the sheep in the field may be a more effective way to help you fall asleep., Linking your breathing as you count the sheep could be a way to relax your body and ready yourself for sleep. As you count each sheep, take a deep breath in through your nose and as you move on to the next sheep, take a deep breath out through your nose. Continue to do this, making sure you inhale and exhale deeply as you count the sheep., If you can't seem to get to sleep by counting sheep, you may want to try doing a meditation exercise that uses deep breathing as you lay on your back in bed. This can help to calm and relax you into a deep sleep.


Start by inhaling and exhaling deeply through your nose, breathing from your diaphragm, which is just under your ribs. As you inhale, think about relaxing all your muscles, from head to toe. As you exhale, imagine you are sinking deeper into your bed.
Continue to do this, breathing deeply in and out. You may also want to imagine a calm, relaxing scene like a falling waterfall or a tropical beach to help calm your mind and body for rest.

, These exercises can help your body to relax and help you get to sleep faster. Clenching and releasing your muscles can act as a form of meditation.


Begin by clenching your upper body, including your neck, your fingers, your hands, your arms, and your abdominals. Then, clench your lower body, including your legs, your feet, and your toes.
Inhale as you clench all your muscles. Then, exhale and slowly release all of your muscles, relaxing your entire body. You should feel a sense of peace and calm as you release your muscles into your bed.

, If you struggle with distractions around you at night, you may want to block out any light from the windows with a sleep mask. You can use a thin scarf or buy a sleep mask from your local drugstore.


You may also want to use ear plugs to block out any noise around you. You can find soft, comfortable ear plugs at your local drugstore.

, If you are struggling to fall asleep, you may want to try to do a relaxing, quiet activity like listening to ambient music with headphones while you lay in bed. You can look up sleep mixes online that are designed to help your brain relax or create your own music mix using some of your favorite slow jams.


Sleep sound machines are designed to help you get a full night's rest by using sleep sounds that you can customize to fit your ideal ambient sounds. Many of these machines have a loop cycle so the sleep sounds last all night long and continue to block out any outside noise that may keep you awake., Sleeping pills can help you to fall sleep if counting sheep does not work and if you are struggling to get a good night's sleep. However, sleeping pills should only be a temporary solution to insomnia and restless sleep. Sleeping pills can often make your sleep issues work in the long term.You should only use sleeping pills for short term situations, such as to recover from jet lag or from a medical procedure. You should avoid using sleeping pills on a regular basis, as you may end up dependent on sleeping pills to get to sleep every night.

, The side effects of several over-the-counter medications can have adverse effects on your sleep pattern.Common medications that can disturb your sleep include:Nasal decongestants.
Cold and allergy medications containing an antihistamine.
Aspirin and other headache medications.
Pain relievers that contain caffeine.
Try to reduce your dosage or avoid taking these medications completely. You can also try alternative methods to treat your medical issues so you do not have to take over-the-counter medications.

Keep it simple.,
Only use permanent messages.,
Use appropriate design principles.,
Avoid clipart.,
Enlist help to create an effective design.,
Use the right kind of paper, color and ink.",How to Design an Effective Business Card1," Traditional business cards should not be cluttered or difficult to understand. Most professional business cards use a traditional design for a reason: because it conveys the important information directly.Avoid using elaborate or overly decorative designs that may make it difficult to understand the information on the card.
Provide your name, your title, the company name, and contact information. You may also want to include something specific to your industry if it is obscure or if you have a specialization.
An example of how to list your information could be:


John Smith
Vice President of Marketing
(555) 555-5555
123 Electric Avenue
Boston, MA 02108
;
, Avoid using gimmicks or slogans that may change often on your business cards so you can use them for a long period of time. Short term promotions or gimmicks can make it so you can no longer use a business card after the promotion is over or your sales gimmick changes.Only include information that is pertinent to helping people get in touch with you.
Rely on yourself to sell people on contacting you instead of novelties in your business card.

, There are common principles of design utilized in most traditional business cards that your card should adhere to in order to be pleasing to the eye as well as informative. Borders, color usage and text size can make a business card design successful or illegible based on your use of the principles of design.Maintain at least a five millimeter border around the outer perimeter of the business card.
Stick to a two color design such as egg white card stock and black ink.
Ensure your text is large enough to be easily readable.

, Instead of clipart, consider simply including the business’s logo if you want to add images. Avoid the use of clipart as it may make your card look unprofessional or poorly designed. Clip art often looks cheap and can diminish the credibility your business card conveys.Only use imagery on your business card if it will help reinforce your business’s brand.

, If aesthetic design isn't one of your strong suits, there are a number of options available that can help you create a business card that is both effective and pleasing to the eye.If you have the budget, enlisting the services of a professional designer can help you ensure your business cards adhere to all of the appropriate principles of design.
Ask your printer if they can recommend a designer, or look for one with good reviews on websites like Yelp.com or AngiesList.com.Many printing companies offer a variety of templates that you can use with effective designs. Templates offer tried and tested designs that are common in traditional business cards.

, Once you design your business card you will need to address the materials you want it made out of with the printer. Make sure you support a strong design with good choices on the finish of your card.Most business cards should be printed on 80-pound cover stock paper.
Choose between smooth, linen and laid finishes for your card. Smooth is the most common choice but linen or laid can both give your card a textile feel that may be appropriate for your design. Make sure your printer chooses ink that does not bleed on the finish of your choosing.
There are many shades of white and off-white for card stock, as well as many colors of ink to choose from. Black or grey inks are the most common and appropriate but selective use of colors can draw attention to specific areas of your business card if that compliments your design.

Utilize the back of your business card.,
Put holes in your cards.,
Use unusual materials.,
Make a business card with alternate uses.,
Use a QR code.,
Include the necessary information.,
Keep your budget in mind.",How to Design an Effective Business Card2," Most traditional business cards are printed on one side with the back side left completely blank. One creative way to make your business card stand out is to use the back of the card as well as the front.You may want to include a picture, image or photograph that is related to your business or position on the back of the card.
The back of your card could serve as a place to list services or products that your business offers.
Printing on two sides costs more than one, so take that into account when budgeting.

, Many printers can use the die-cut process to cut holes in your cards in order to make your business card functional or unique. You can die cut a business card to give it a different shape, or to make the interior of the card stand out.You can cut holes that fit the size of a typical rolodex to make your cards more practical for some people. However, most people use an electronic version of a rolodex instead.
Cutting holes through the middle of the card may be a good novelty for certain products and services. A company that specializes in replacing windows may want to have a hole cut through it with a design that makes it seem like a broken window.
Dies are expensive to create but become more economical based on the number of business cards you order.

, Another way to make your business card stand out is to have your card’s information printed on unusual materials. There are many different kinds of materials you may want to have business cards printed on, but be aware of the cost associated with each.You may want to print your card on thin wood or metal. These would be the most expensive options but offer a significant “wow” factor.
Tech companies may want to use plastic that resembles a computer chip for their business cards,
Different materials can make your card stand out visually but also by touch when someone is looking for your card among other business cards they have collected.

, Using different materials or the die-cut method can allow you to create business cards that serve a number of purposes. You may want to die cut slits that permit your card to be folded into something or have your information printed on materials that serve other purposes.You could cut your card to be foldable into something that holds smart phones or office supplies like a pen or pencil.
You may want to have the information printed directly onto things like keychains or even pet treats a person could give their animal. The business card will go away when it’s fed to a pet, but the card would certainly leave an impression.

, QR codes are comprised of black and white squares and can be read by various devices such as smart phones. QR codes often contain website addresses, so when a person scans the QR code on your business card it takes them to a specific website.You may want to include a QR code on the back of your business card that takes people to your company’s website.
If you work by commission or need to maintain personal relationships with customers or clients you may want to use a QR code that takes people to a form they can use to contact you.

, Even non-traditional business cards must contain all the necessary information to help someone reach you. Make sure your name, title, and contact information is easily read and understood regardless of design and materials used in printing your business cards.Different inks may be necessary to keep your information clearly visible on different materials.
Make sure the design elements don’t clutter the card so much that it’s hard to find the information someone needs to contact you.

, Make sure that the card you design is something you can order in quantity and re-order when you need to. Non-traditional cards can be extremely costly to design and produce so you should make sure you can afford to have as many of the cards made as you need.The more complex the design of your business card, the higher the cost to produce them will likely be.
Ask your printer to keep any dies or special materials they create to produce your cards to reduce the cost of having new ones printed in the future.
There is no need to spend a ton on business cards, especially since the information on most business cards is transferred to an electronic version.

Use latex condoms.,
Consider using a female condom.,
Use a dental dam for oral sex.,
Try a lubricant.,
Find other ways to be intimate.,
Try low-risk activities.",How to Have Safer Sex1," Male condoms should be used for any kind of sex, including vaginal, anal, and oral contact. The male latex condom is easy to use, efficient and cheap. It is also widely available for free at Planned Parenthood locations, other counseling services, and many schools. Consistently and correctly using latex condoms during sexual intercourse can reduce the risk of STIs and pregnancy with up to 99% reliability.


If you’re allergic to latex, you can also use polyurethane condoms, which offer some protection against STIs. Natural or lambskin condoms offer reliable protection against pregnancy, but the material isn’t fine enough to prevent the transmission of some infections, making them less reliable for that purpose.
Make sure to properly place the condom on the erect penis. Doing this together can create a more intimate experience.
Remember, both partners are responsible for safe sex. If you are sexually active, you should always have a supply of condoms on hand. Make sure to regularly check the expiration date, too.
Condoms do not typically break when used properly; however, if the condom rips or tears during intercourse, make sure that both partners get tested within 10 days.;
, Female condoms can be used for vaginal penetrative sex. They are effective against most STIs and can help reduce the chances of pregnancy. Though the failure rate is higher than with hormonal contraception, female condoms can be very effective when used in combination with other protection.You should never use a female and male condom at the same time. That can cause friction that will tear one or both of the condoms, making them ineffective.
Make sure to carefully read the instructions on the packaging. You want to ensure that you properly insert the female condom.
You will insert the female condom in a similar manner as inserting a tampon. The penis should be inside the female condom during intercourse.
It is unlikely that the female condom will break if used correctly; however, if there is a tear, make sure to visit your physician to get tested within 10 days.

, Dental dams are latex sheets, or condoms that have been cut open to form squares. When used correctly, dental dams have been proven to reduce the risk of passing blood and other fluids to the mouth from the genitals. These are effective in preventing STIs and HIV. You can use them when performing oral sex on both the vulva and the anus.Make sure the latex doesn’t have any holes, tears, or other damage. Rinse off any cornstarch if necessary, as this can promote vaginal infection. Cover the genitalia or anus while performing oral sex.
Never switch back and forth between the vagina and anus without first replacing the dental dam. Discard after use.

, While friction can be a pleasurable feeling during sex, it can also heighten the risk of infection. Friction is often the cause of broken condoms or dental dams. To prevent too much friction, try using a lubricant during intercourse.Make sure to read the ingredients on the package. Don't use an oil-based lube on a latex condom. It will break down the latex.
Instead, choose an water-based lubricant. Silicon-based lubes are also a good choice. You can also use lubricants to make dental dams more supple and less likely to tear.

, You and your partner can engage in sexual activities that carry absolutely no risk. Be creative and explore new ways to turn each other on. You can use words and fantasies to arouse one another. Some no risk sexual acts include:Phone sex or sexting
Mutual masturbation
Cyber sex

, Anal and vaginal intercourse are considered “high risk” sexual activities. The risk of infection when having intercourse anally is greater because the skin of the anus is thinner, making infection and disease transmission more of a possibility. Likewise, sexually transmitted diseases and infections are transmittable between the mouth and the genitals, making unprotected oral sex also a risky behavior. You can still be intimate without engaging in intercourse. Talk to your partner about trying out some new sexual activities. You could try:Deep kissing
Fondling
Experimenting with sex toys such as dildos or vibrators.

Keep sex toys clean. Always wash them between uses, and never use one that you're not sure is clean. A weak solution of disinfectant in a bowl of water is a cheaper option.
Rinse the toys well and be sure to dry them before storing them in a sealed bag in a clean and dry environment. Do not share sex toys with partners you aren't fluid-bonded with since you can spread infections this way.

Get tested regularly.,
Learn specific symptoms.,
Get vaccinated.,
Get treated.,
Ask about high-risk sex.",How to Have Safer Sex2," Go to your doctor or a free clinic regularly to get screened for HIV and other STIs. Get tested together with a monogamous partner before deciding to stop using protection. You should continue to get tested regularly even when you are in a relationship, to be on the safe side. It is better to get tested than to unknowingly be infected with an STI.Ask your partner to go with you if you're nervous. It's not lame to request that your partner do this enthusiastically and willingly.
If your partner doesn't want to go together, ask them to go on their own and share the results with you. You can try saying, ""I respect your need for privacy. But please remember that this effects both of our bodies and health. We need to share this information with each other.""
If your partner is not willing to practice safe sex, find another partner., Educating yourself can help keep you safe. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to boost your knowledge. Take some time to learn about different STIs. You can learn about methods of contraction, and symptoms. Your doctor is one of your best resources. Ask your doctor for some information or look at a reputable website.For example, you should know that one of the most common STIs, chlamydia, often has no symptoms. For that reason, it is often unknowingly passed to others. Ask your doctor to test for all STIs before you sleep with a new partner.
Genital warts are another common STI. These warts are easily spread by skin-to-skin contact. The flesh-colored bumps may look similar to cauliflower. Your doctor can help you find the best treatment plan.
Many STIs don’t have visible symptoms; however, if you see any abnormalities on your partner’s genitalia, you should avoid having sex until they have visited the doctor.
Know your body. If you notice any changes in your body, visible or not, don't hesitate to contact your doctor. You're always better safe than sorry.

, One of the best ways to prevent certain STIs is by getting vaccinated. There are currently vaccines that can be used to prevent hepatitis A and B, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Talk to your doctor about whether these vaccines are right for you.Females between the age of nine and 26 should be given the HPV vaccine. It is given in three doses over six months. The CDC states that this vaccine is safe for all women between those ages. The HPV vaccine is also recommended for boys, given at age 11 – 12 years
The CDC recommends the Hepatitis A vaccine for all children, men who engage in intercourse with other men, and illegal drug users.
There are many populations who should receive the Hepatitis B vaccine. These groups include:

Children under 19 who have not previously been vaccinated
Intravenous drug users
Men who have sex with men
Individuals with HIV or chronic liver disease



, Part of having safe and responsible sex is making sure that you are not passing a disease to your partner. If you have contracted an STI, you need to make sure that you receive the proper medical treatment. If you receive a negative diagnosis, ask your doctor about the best treatment option for you.For example, maybe you learn that you have contracted gonorrhea. Your doctor will prescribe a course of antibiotics as a treatment.
For this, and any infection, make sure to take the medicine exactly as instructed. Ask your doctor if you have any questions, or are concerned about side effects.
Tell your partner. You need to say, ""I need you to know that I was recently tested for STIs. I have gonorrhea. You need to get tested as soon as possible.""

, You might find yourself in a situation where you want to knowingly engage in high-risk sex. For example, maybe your partner was previously diagnosed with HIV. Talk to your doctor before engaging in sexual activity.Ask a lot of questions. You can say, ""My partner is HIV-positive. What extra steps can we take to make sure that I remain negative?""
Keep the lines of communication open. If you or your partner have questions, make sure to ask.
It is possible to have a healthy and happy sex life with someone who has tested positive. You just need to make sure that safety is always part of your routine.

Try the pill.,
Consider alternative hormone therapies.,
Use barrier contraception.,
Know your options.",How to Have Safer Sex3," Hormonal contraception methods regulate a woman’s fertility cycles to prevent pregnancy. The most common type of hormonal birth control is often referred to as ""the pill"" and is taken orally every day. When taken correctly and regularly, hormonal birth control is 99% effective. If you're interested in hormonal birth control, talk to your gynecologist or general care provider about a prescription.Always take hormonal birth control correctly. Hormonal birth control is incredibly effective, but only when taken properly and consistently. You need to take your pill at the same time each day, and avoid smoking, which can increase your blood-pressure and other cause dangerous health concerns.
Pay attention to how your body responds to the hormones, and discuss any concerns. It sometimes takes some experimenting to get the right medication.
Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to take your pill and do it at the same time each day.

, Other hormonal methods are also available and quite reliable, up to 99% effective. Hormonal patches, the NuvaRing, and implants can last for weeks or several years and are quite effective.


The Depo-Provera shot is another option, administered every few months. Intrauterine devices/systems (IUDs or IUSs) are also options to consider.
Use both birth control and condoms to reduce the risk of pregnancy and STIs. Using other kinds of contraceptives in addition to condoms is the best way to practice the safest kind of sex. You can have fun with your partner in a more worry-free environment.

, The following methods offer no protection against the transmission of HIV and other sexually-transmitted diseases, but are somewhat effective at preventing pregnancy. Diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, and cervical caps are placed over the cervix and should be used together with a spermicidal gel. These methods of contraception are typically worn for at least six hours after intercourse.


At most, these methods are about 90% effective, on average, making them somewhat less reliable than other methods of birth control. The fact that they offer no protection against STIs and are typically more difficult to obtain than condoms makes them a less recommended, but still a useful method.Ask your doctor to fit you for a diaphragm. You can purchase sponges at most drug stores. Make sure to follow the directions very carefully.

, If you are a female who is sexually active, it is possible that you could inadvertently become pregnant. Part of having safe sex is knowing what you will do if you have an unplanned pregnancy. Think ahead and know where you can find resources.Be aware that the counselors at Planned Parenthood can talk to you about options that include terminating or continuing with your pregnancy.
Talk to your partner. If you are in a serious relationship, say, ""What would we do if we became pregnant?""
Make use of emergency contraception. Drugs like Plan-B, Next Choice, and ella can decrease the possibility of pregnancy after unprotected sex when no contraceptive is used. Most don’t require a prescription, though some do have age limits that vary depending on the country and state.

Be monogamous.,
Always take time to talk with your partners before and after sex.,
Put your safety first.,
Protect your emotions.,
Figure out if you are ready for sex.",How to Have Safer Sex4," Monogamy means being in an exclusive relationship with only one sexual partner. Monogamy can help you to reduce the risk of contracting STIs. If you are going to be sexually active, consider being monogamous.Make sure that your relationship is mutually monogamous, which means you are both committed to only having sex with each other.
Trust is a big part of monogamy. Make sure that you and your partner are open and honest with each other about your sexual activity — past and present.

, Each time you enter into a new sexual relationship, it's important to take time to talk to your partner before jumping between the sheets. Be honest about your own sexual experiences and your own desire to practice safe sex. If your partner doesn't want to practice safe sex, or isn't forthright with you about their sexual history and experiences, don't have sex with them.You don't need to have the ""numbers"" talk, necessarily, but you do need to find out if your partner has regularly engaged in risky sexual behaviors. Get tested together before you decide to have sex.
Have consensual sex. Make sure your partner is capable of consenting to sex and that both people in the relationship agree to the sexual activity each and every time.
Consenting once doesn't mean consenting to future sexual encounters, and likewise consenting to one activity in no way suggests the consent of another. Never assume consent.

, Avoid mixing drugs and alcohol with sex. Having sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol is never a safe idea. Your safe sex practices can be compromised and less effective if you're drunk/high and you might misread the other person's signals or they might misread your signals, potentially resulting in non-consensual sex.If you go to parties and want to get drunk or use drugs, it's safest to be with friends. Look out for one another.
Don't share drinks. Don't accept a drink from someone you don't know. Keep your hand over the top of drink and keep it with you at all times — don't leave it sitting exposed if you go to the bathroom. Being mindful of your safety can help you avoid falling victim to ""date rape drugs.""
Common date rape drugs are rohypnol (roofies), GHB, and ketamine. Common symptoms include dizziness, confusion, and difficulty with motor skills.
Get medical care if you suspect you have been drugged.

, No one has the right to pressure you into having sex. This applies to intercourse, but also other forms of sexual activity. If you feel uncomfortable, remove yourself from the situation.Common pressuring tactics include threatening a break up or trying to influence you with drugs or alcohol.
You can say, “I don’t feel comfortable. Please stop.”
You can also say, “I was really enjoying kissing you. I’d like to keep things on that level.”

, Whether you are a virgin or just starting a new relationship, you might be nervous to have sex with someone new. That’s perfectly normal. It’s a good idea to take a self-assessment. Reflecting on your feelings can help you decide if you’re ready to take the next step.Ask yourself a series of questions. For example, are you prepared to talk to your healthcare provider about your sexual activity?
Additionally, you should ask yourself if you feel comfortable discussing intimacy with your partner. Moreover, do you feel comfortable saying that you don’t want to have sex?
If you can’t confidently answer “yes” to these questions, it might be a good idea to hold off on having sex. Remember, every relationship moves at its own pace.

Aim to get at least 5 GCSE's at grade A-C, in English, Maths and science.,
Go to college after this and study A-levels, a science subject or health subject would be better than say studying French which isn't relevant to midwifery.,
Try to get some work experience in a caring environment like a nursing home, or on a maternity ward.,
When applying to uni make sure you personal statement really shines.,
If you get accepted at your uni.",How to Get Into Midwifery,";
, You will need either 3 A levels and 5 GCSE's at grade A-C including maths, science and english, or an access to HE course if you are a mature student with no recent qualifications. Access to health course is the same as having just over 3 A levels.

, Universities like their students to have a little work experience.

, This is what will make you stand out from the rest of the applicants. Tell them why you want to be a midwife, what you have to offer, and any work experience you might have. Try to make your personal statement worth reading. But don't ramble on about your favourite TV show or your favourite food as they will not want to know.

Many couples have pursued surrogacy in India and have been able to have a child with the parents own genetic material, or with the assistance of a donor egg, and the help of an Indian surrogate (There must be a genetic link to one parent).,Contact surrogacy clinics in India

,
Ask questions and investigate.,
Review the costs of surrogacy - in India they are typically US$25,000 to US$35,000 .,
Confirm the price of medication & treatment.,
Be clear on what is a priority for your family?,
Forward the relevant medical information - At a minimum this will include a sperm analysis & culture and a STD screen as well as a note from your doctor confirming why you are needing to undertake surrogacy.,
Schedule a time to begin your treatment.,
Plan your travel to India - Please be aware that currently to undertake surrogacy in India you must apply for and travel on a Medical visa.,
Prior to any treatment, on your first meeting with your treating doctor, discuss with the doctor how many embryos you are wanting to transfer.,
On the day of egg collection, if you are using your own eggs, you will have minor surgery.,
If you are successful, Congratulations.,
Picking up your baby.",How to Decide on Surrogacy in India,";
,, Don't rely on one point of view. Look for a clinic that has experience with working with International clients. Do they have clients who will share their story? Is there a wrap around clinic ( from initial enquiry to going home?).Is there evidence of babies going home with this clinic? Can clients communicate easily with each other? Is your fertility specialist trained in this field? Are there people in India to assist you or are you left to fend for yourself? Use Indian surrogacy forums to get different opinions and viewpoints.
, Get a full itemized lists of all costs for both a successful and an unsuccessful attempt. Is there a staggered payment process? What is included in their package? Also ask about additional costs (for instance, neonatal intensive care costs if the baby is born pre-mature) that are not covered by the quotation you receive. Always look at the evidence, is you are being told consistent with what you have read? If you are offered inclusive packages, ask what is not included? How many babies have gone home on these packages?

, Often medication and treatment is much cheaper in India. If it is cheaper in India, you may choose to do the entire IVF cycle in India, thereby spending more time in India, but spending less money.

, Are you looking at using donor eggs - does the clinic you are reviewing have Indian and Non - Indian donors? Are you sending embryos to India? Can the clinic you are looking at assist you with this? If you are using your own eggs, check out the facilities and make sure that the doctor you have speaking to is the doctor who will be with you and doing your treatment.

, If you are sending embryos, you must be able to show that a STD screen has occurred at the time of conception, if you are using your own eggs, more detailed information will be required from your treating specialist. You'll have to prepay some fees, likely via bank transfer as it is likely that surrogate preparation and or egg donor preparation will happen prior to your arrival.

, If you are using your own eggs, it is likely that some of your treatment can occur at home, with egg collection in India. If you are using donor eggs, then your treatment time frame will be guided by when egg collection happens for your egg donor.

, If you are using donor eggs, or sending embryos from your home country you will only need to spend 3- 5 day in India. If you are using your own eggs, you will spend 5- 15 days in India.

, Most reputable clinics will only allow up to four embryos, but this will depend on the quality of the embryos. While this can increases the odds of a successful pregnancy, it also increases the odds of a multiple pregnancy. This is a very personal decision, but be aware that under the current laws gestational surrogates can only carry twins and a higher order pregnancy will result in a foetal reduction.

, Don't plan on doing much else that day - it is a relatively short procedure that does not require an overnight hospital stay. If you are using donor eggs, you may be required to supply a fresh sperm sample. Your fertility specialist should be able to provide you with a summary of how many eggs were collected; how many eggs fertilized; what embryos developed, the grading of your embryos and what was transferred to your gestational surrogate. You should also be provided with a date for your pregnancy test..

, You should be aware that as with any IVF process, this is a journey, on average it takes most clients up to three attempts to get and stay pregnant. Now you are pregnant, what is your clinics communication strategy? How do they keep in touch with you? What tests are undertaken? When to scans happen? What happens if things go wrong? These are questions that you should know the answers to before proceeding with treatment .

, By the time this has happened, you should be aware of what the requirements are for your particular country and embassy to get citizenship and a passport for your baby. For most countries this requires a DNA test to confirm the genetic link to one parent by a DNA service approved by your Embassy. Irrespective of whether you use your own genetic material or donor eggs, both parents names will be on the birth certificate . Your clinic should have someone who is able to walk you though this process. For most countries this process takes between 2- 4 weeks.

These agents are often recommended by healthcare providers to help with pain associated with menstrual discomfort and uterine fibroids.


Use caution not to exceed the recommended dosage and watch for side effects mentioned in the product literature.
If you experience difficult and painful periods, start the acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen a few days before your period starts. This may help to further reduce some of the discomfort.;
, If your pain and discomfort is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, you may be anemic. Your doctor can do simple blood tests to determine if your iron level is below normal. Over-the-counter iron supplements can help restore your iron level back to normal.


Common symptoms of anemia caused by excessive blood loss include fatigue and weakness, pale skin, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, headaches, cold hands and feet, and shortness of breath and chest pain in some cases., Stronger pain medications and anti-inflammatory agents are available with a prescription and can help make the symptoms more manageable. In some cases, prescription medications can help to slow the growth of some types of uterine fibroids.

, Low-dose oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, as well as progesterone injections, have been successfully used to help with fibroid pain and may be an option for you. Low-dose birth control pills contain smaller amounts of estrogen so they do not cause the fibroids to grow, plus they help to control the menstrual flow during periods.


Studies have shown that some women may experience a decrease in fibroid size after receiving a shot of Depo-Provera, whereas others may experience an increase in fibroid size., Drugs classed as gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists can help to shrink fibroids. These drugs are given by injection, nasal spray, or implanted device. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists are commonly used prior to surgery to help reduce the size of the fibroids.


Side effects such as thinning of the bones prevent these products from being used long term. Other common side effects include hot flashes, depression, insomnia, decreased sex drive, joint pain, and the absence of monthly periods. Once the drug is stopped, the fibroids quickly grow back.

, There are some factors beyond your control that put you at greater risk of developing fibroids as well as some factors that you can control. Consider these factors as you begin to make adjustments to your lifestyle. Factors that may increase your risk of developing or experiencing a worsening of uterine fibroids include:eating a lot of red meat and few vegetables
drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
having a mother or sister who also has fibroids
starting your period at a young age
having African-American decent

, Warmth can help to improve blood flow and help your muscles to relax. Use a heating pad or warm compress on your lower abdomen to reduce pain from uterine fibroids. Remove the heating pad about every ten minutes to allow your skin to cool down.Taking a warm bath may also help with pain relief., Lying down and resting can relieve pressure that may be contributing to the pain. When resting on your back, place a pillow beneath your knees to help take pressure away from your lower back area.Other techniques include deep breathing and relaxing your muscles. Some relaxation techniques work best after learning the basics from an instructor. These include yoga, biofeedback, and visualization., The foods you eat can make a difference in slowing the growth of fibroids. Much of the research on diet is observational but may prove helpful in some people.Two commonly recommended dietary changes that may help include increasing daily servings of dairy products, and decreasing daily intake of foods high in sugar and carbohydrates. Maintaining a healthy weight can also help to control the pain experienced from uterine fibroids., Treat the pain if it is manageable, watch for worsening, and wait. Fibroids will naturally begin to shrink after you go through menopause and your levels of estrogen decrease. Most women experience no pain from fibroids after menopause.Much of the time, if one fibroid is present, others are also growing. Talk to your doctor about symptoms, specific to you, that need to be closely monitored., Pursuing a medical procedure may be the best approach to getting rid of the pain you experience from fibroids, but clearly understand the risks involved before you proceed., Before you decide what to do, get a second, or even third, opinion from another gynecologist, surgeon, or interventional radiologist. Interventional radiologists are experts in reviewing and interpreting imaging results. They can review imaging studies already performed and provide an additional opinion on surgical and out-patient procedure options., This procedure is performed while the patient is awake but sedated. The procedure is not a painful procedure, but there is significant pain for 24-48 hours after the procedure.A uterine fibroid embolization involves inserting a catheter into your femoral artery through a small incision in the thigh. Small particles are inserted into the catheter and delivered to the site of the fibroid. The goal of the procedure is to disrupt the blood supply to the fibroid causing it to shrink. This outpatient, non-invasive procedure is relatively new, has a good rate of success, but may not be appropriate for everyone., Endometrial ablation is a procedure that removes or destroys the lining of the uterus. This type of procedure is often performed as an outpatient surgery in a physician’s office. Some of the methods used to perform this procedure include using a laser, wire loops, boiling water, electric current, microwaves, or freezing. Pregnancy is not possible after this procedure. While this surgery may work well for older women, there is a higher failure rate for younger women who have this procedure. The risks associated with this procedure include:perforation or tearing of the uterus
burns to the uterus or bowels
excess fluid in the lungs
blockage in the artery that leads to the lungs (pulmonary embolism)

, Although it is not widely available, this procedure may be a good choice if you are hoping to preserve your fertility, have many large fibroids, or excess scar tissue makes other procedures more risky.This procedure is a non-invasive, outpatient procedure. The procedure uses high intensity ultrasound waves to destroy the fibroids. Real time magnetic resonance imaging is used to guide the procedure.Risks of this procedure include:burns on your abdomen
tissue damage
pain from nerve stimulation
blood clots

, A myomectomy is a surgical procedure that removes fibroids without removing other healthy tissue of the uterus. Pregnancy is possible after this surgical procedure. The level of surgical intervention depends on the severity of the fibroid condition. Risks associated with having a myomectomy include:losing large amounts of blood
developing scar tissue
an increased risk of certain complications during childbirth (if you become pregnant after the procedure)
the need for an emergency hysterectomy

, A hysterectomy is the surgical intervention of removing the uterus. Removing the uterus guarantees removal of the fibroids growing inside, but pregnancy is not possible after this procedure. The level of surgical intervention, again, depends on the details of the person, the problems experienced, and the severity of the fibroid condition. Recovery from invasive hysterectomy procedures may take several weeks. Be aware that there are several risks associated with hysterectomy including:blood clots
infection
excessive bleeding
adverse reactions to anesthesia
structural damage, such as to your urinary tract, bladder, rectum or other pelvic structures
earlier onset of menopause
death (this is rare, but it is still a risk)

, Myolysis is not often used to treat uterine fibroids, but it is another option that you can discuss with your doctor. This procedure targets fibroid tissue only. During the procedure, the surgeon uses a laparoscope to guide the surgery, and introduces an electrical current or extreme cold to destroy the fibroid tissue. Be aware that myolysis may not be a good option if you want to preserve your fertility., These are newer procedures that are available but are not yet considered standards of therapy. Radiofrequency ablation uses heat applied externally to shrink the fibroids. Anti-hormonal drug therapies involves the use of drugs to provide symptom relief without the side effects seen with other drug therapies, like thinning of the bones.

Address problems with a low libido.",How to Diagnose Sexual Dysfunction Disorder," While most everyone experiences nights of not being “in the mood”, disorders occur when problems occur regularly and impact the experience of sex. Think about when the problems occur and how they influence the experience of sex. The following are 4 different types of disorders:Desire disorder: This occurs when you have little or no interest in sex for an ongoing amount of time. For women, things like contraceptives can greatly lower or eliminate desire.Arousal disorder: Arousal disorder occurs when you want to have sex, yet your body does not respond.

Orgasm disorder: Your body and emotions may be engaged in sexual activity, yet you are unable to climax, which can leave you feeling frustrated.

Pain disorder: Pain disorder occurs when any part of sexual activity is painful, particularly intercourse.;
, A lack of orgasm is called anorgasmia. Your provider may ask you questions about psychological and emotional factors that may cause anorgasmia, such as sexual inhibition, lack of experience, feelings of guilt or anxiety, or a history of sexual trauma or abuse. Some medications or chronic diseases can cause problems with arousal and orgasm.Sometimes anorgasmia can be helped with sufficient stimulation.

, Stress if often a major culprit for sexual dysfunction. However, medical and psychological factors may affect sexual satisfaction. Diagnoses such as diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, and hormone imbalances can also cause sexual dysfunction.Medication side-effects, drugs, and alcohol can also influence sex.If you’re above the age of 65, the likelihood of experiencing lower sexual response is increased., There are some sexual problems that can result from psychological causes. These can include having poor body image, mood disorders, relationship problems, or past sexual trauma.Psychological causes can result in a lowered libido, decreased desire or arousal, failure to achieve orgasm, or a lack of sensitivity in the genitals.

, Factors such as inadequate sex education, religious beliefs, culturally held shame about sex, or fatigue from family or work can contribute to sexual dissatisfaction.Beliefs taught in childhood, cultural norms, and gender roles can influence a person’s sex life.


Think about how any beliefs you were taught in your upbringing affect your sex life. Were you taught that sex was “bad” or that you should be ashamed of your body? These factors can influence sexual satisfaction.

, If the sexual problems cause you, your partner, or the relationship distress, make an appointment with your healthcare provider.Talk about the problems and remember that your healthcare provider is there to help you. Be as specific as possible, noting what is causing problems, when it occurs, how frequently it occurs, and if there is pain involved.


While you may feel embarrassed to discuss these things with your provider, remember that you are seeking help and that there are treatments available.

, At your appointment, you may take certain tests, receive a physical examination, and be asked specific questions. During the physical examination, the provider may do a pelvic exam. You may also provide a Pap test to check for cancer or a precancerous condition.Your provider may ask you questions related to your attitudes toward sex, any past traumatic history, relationship problems, or problems with alcohol or drugs.

, Lots of factors can influence sexual desire in women. Ask your provider to perform tests to check for any medical causes of dysfunction. For a low libido, check for low estrogen levels and low testosterone. You may also check for high blood pressure, thyroid problems, and diabetes.Other women-specific causes can include breastfeeding, hormonal changes after childbirth, and menopause.

, Women may experience problems such as diminished blood flow to the genitals, problems with the pelvic floor muscles, vaginal trauma, spinal cord injury, or genital mutilation that can interfere with sexual satisfaction. These problems can lead to vaginal dryness, decreased libido, and severe pain during sexual activity.Many of these problems can be examined by a medical provider.
If you take medications, ask your provider whether the medications can affect libido or sexual satisfaction.

, Vaginismus and Dyspareunia are diagnoses given for pain during sexual activity. Vaginismus involves involuntary spasms that interfere with penetration.It can result from fear or inexperience with sex, or result from a traumatic experience. Dyspareunia involves pain during intercourse. Dyspareunia can be caused by endometriosis, ovarian cysts, vaginal inflammation, or from scar tissue., Some women experience difficulty lubricating. A woman’s ability to lubricate may change in response to breastfeeding or menopause. If a woman is anxious about sex or expecting sex to be painful, these thoughts can influence lubrication as well.Think about when difficulties arise. What thoughts or feelings surround the lack of lubrication? How do you (and your partner) respond?

, When diagnosing sexual dysfunction, the provider may do an examination and ask you questions to get a better understanding of your problems.Your provider may check testosterone levels, which are primary in understanding men’s sexual health.

Some possible causes of ED include improper blood flow, a nerve disorder, penis injury, some chronic diseases, and some medications. Over time, ED can cause stress and anxiety.


ED is associated with some medical diagnoses, such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, spinal cord compression and pituitary tumors., Some men struggle with premature ejaculation (PE), which occurs when before or immediately after penetration. Some factors influencing PE include stress, depression, history of sexual repression, and low self-confidence.Some people may be unable to ejaculate at all. Some possible causes include medications (like certain antidepressants), sexual anxiety, or a history of sexual trauma.Sometimes, deeply held religious beliefs can interfere with sexual satisfaction.

Identify the difference between night terrors and nightmares.,
Spot the signs and symptoms of night terrors.,
See a pediatrician to rule out other problems.,
Recognize that there is usually no medical treatment.,
Put your child to bed earlier.,
Avoid trying to wake your child.,
Make the environment safe to prevent injury.,
Consult a sleep specialist if night terrors continue.,
Keep track of your child’s night terrors.,
Look for causes of emotional tension or stress.,
Stay active during day.,
Create a consistent bedtime routine.,
Examine your child’s diet.",How to Cope with Toddler Night Terrors," Night terrors may frequently be confused with nightmares, but the two are unique. Being able to distinguish the difference between the two can help you understand how to manage and prevent them.Nightmares happen during the rapid eye movements (REM) phase of sleep, which usually occur during the later stages before a child wakes up. The child will be frightened when he or she wakes, and may be reluctant to return to sleep.
Night terrors occur during deeper phases of sleep, which usually take place in the first several hours. Although the child appears to be terrified, he or she won’t respond to comforting and won’t remember the incident in the morning. He or she may easily fall back asleep.;
, There is little understanding of what causes night terrors. However, these disturbances tend to be associated with fever, sleep deprivation, certain medications, and stressful life events.Signs that your child is experiencing a night terror may include:Being aggressive (e.g. hitting, kicking, etc.)
Being difficult to awaken (or being confused upon awakening)
Being inconsolable
Breathing heavily
Getting out of bed and walking/running around the house
Having a racing pulse
Staring wide-eyed
Sweating
Thrashing about in bed

, Mention your child’s night terrors during a routine wellness exam. During this visit, your doctor may conduct a physical exam and obtain a history of your child’s medical status and sleep habits. If your pediatrician suspects a more serious condition is causing night terrors, your child may have to undergo testing, such as an electroencephalogram to study brain activity or a sleep study to check for sleep apnea.If your doctor thinks your child’s sleep disruption is the result of night terrors, there may not be any additional testing.

, Your doctor may provide you with some lifestyle changes, such as modifying your child’s sleep routine, to deal with night terrors. Night terrors aren’t usually a cause for concern or a sign of a medical problem, so there won’t be any medical treatment to relieve them.However, if there is an associated medical problem, such as sleep apnea, then treatment for the underlying problem may be recommended.


On the bright side, night terrors may only last a few weeks from when they first start and your child will eventually outgrow them.

, Because night terrors may be influenced by stress or emotional tension in the household, you will want to take measures to care for yourself while they are happening. These disturbances generally upset parents more than children, so it may help to put your child to bed earlier in the evening. That way, if night terrors occur, it won’t affect your own sleep and cause more stress.


For example, aim to put your toddler down to sleep around 7:00pm (or earlier). Since most night terrors occur during the first 2 to 3 hours of sleep, you can set your own bedtime for around 10:30 or 11:00. That way you won’t be startled awake by your child’s terrified screams.
This strategy ensures that you and your child get adequate sleep. Plus, putting your child down earlier may actually help reduce night terrors since these episodes can be related to sleep deprivation., It’s understandable to be so frightened by your child’s screaming and thrashing that you try to wake him or her up. However, children experiencing night terrors may be difficult to wake and may experience agitation or disorientation if they do wake. Just wait it out. A night terror can last from 1 to 30 minutes, but most last for just a few minutes., Ensure safety during night terrors by clearing your child’s bedroom floor of any objects that he or she may step on or trip over. Shut the door so your child cannot get out and fall down stairs or wander around too far. Put potentially dangerous items or products out of reach.


Be as proactive as you can to keep your child secure during night terrors. Although these precautions won't prevent night terrors from happening, they will decrease the odds of your child getting hurt during the episode., Most night terrors fade over a span of weeks. If your child’s night terrors occur frequently and do not seem to diminish, you may need a referral to see a specialist.


You may also need professional help if the terrors are significantly disrupting your own sleep or family life, if your child is getting injured or injuring someone else, or if night terrors continue beyond adolescence. Contact your doctor if any of these situations apply to you., One way to prevent your child’s night terrors is to start keeping track of when they usually occur. Start keeping a log of each time your toddler wakes due to a sleep terror. If you notice that there is a pattern in the time that your child usually has night terrors, you can begin waking your child about 15 minutes before they usually occur and then keep your child awake for a few minutes.For example, you could gently wake your child and take them to use the bathroom or to get a drink of water.

, Reducing stress or emotional tension that contributes to sleep disruption is generally the best course of action to eliminate night terrors. Problems at school or with family life can lead to your toddler’s night terrors. Consult with a therapist or counselor to discuss coping mechanisms or ways to relieve stress for your child and your family.


For example, if you and your spouse have been fighting, your child may have picked up on the tension even if he or she was not present during a disagreement. Aim to address the underlying causes of stress to minimize night terror episodes., If your child is not getting enough physical activity, it could reflect on his or her sleep habits. When a child gets adequate activity during the day, he or she usually falls asleep faster, stays asleep longer and enjoys a better quality of life upon awakening.


Get plenty of stimulating exercise throughout the day (reduce activity in the hours right before bed) in order to boost your child’s chances of getting a good night’s sleep., Establish a regular, calming routine to prepare your child for a restful night. This sets the tone for better quality, peaceful sleep. Shut off the television and games a few hours before sleep time. Create a sleep routine that includes activities like a warm bath and storytime.Also, ensure that your child’s sleep environment is comfortable and safe. Turn down the temperature a bit. Give him or her a favorite stuffed animal for extra protection. Dim the lights to invite sleepiness.

, Your child’s nutrition could be causing sleep disruption, too. What your child eats during the day—and right before bed—can have a major impact on energy levels and sleep quality. Avoid giving your child caffeine or sugary foods or drinks, which can have them overly stimulated at bedtime.


Instead aim for sleep-inducing, healthy snacks, such as piece of whole-wheat toast with peanut butter, a glass of milk and an oatmeal raisin cookie, or blueberry yogurt with granola. These foods provide complex carbohydrates along with the amino acid tryptophan to promote better sleep."

Schedule an appointment with a doctor after a year of actively trying to conceive without becoming pregnant.",How to Get Fertility Treatments1," A doctor will evaluate the lifestyle and sexual habits of the couple. The doctor may recommend changes in sexual habits, and the couple will enter a period of trial and error to see if their infertility can be resolved without invasive treatments. The couple may also undergo testing to determine if there is a physical cause for the infertility.


Women who have not menstruated in six months or are older than 30 should consider scheduling an appointment to receive a diagnosis of infertility as soon as they suspect they are having trouble conceiving.
Men with a history of testicular or prostate issues or a known low sperm count, and women with a history of recurring miscarriages, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, pelvic pain or unusual menstrual cycles should consult a doctor before they begin trying to conceive.;

Consult with your doctor to determine the necessary tests for finding the cause of infertility.",How to Get Fertility Treatments2," The doctor may recommend both partners be tested depending on each person’s medical history. A medical history evaluation can also help the doctor prioritize tests based on the most likely cause of infertility.


Men may undergo a general physical examination as well as an ultrasound examination to ensure the sexual organs are functioning correctly. A doctor will likely order a semen analysis which will determine the number and quality of sperm. A blood test to evaluate hormone levels may also be recommended.
Like men, women may also undergo physical and ultrasound examinations and hormone testing, as well as other testing that is specific to female reproduction. A hysterosalpingography is a test in which the doctor injects fluid into the uterus and then uses an X-ray to determine if the fluid proceeds to the fallopian tubes without encountering a blockage. A doctor may recommend a laparoscopy, which is typically an outpatient procedure performed under general anesthesia. A laparoscopy allows the doctor to see the uterus and fallopian tubes with a tiny fiber-optic telescope. Genetic testing may also give some insight into what is causing the infertility.

"
"
Devise a treatment plan with your doctor, starting with the least invasive treatment first.",How to Get Fertility Treatments3,"


Fertility drugs that help hormone levels get back on track are available for both men and women. Often, doctors recommend hormone therapy when the cause for infertility is unknown, even after testing. Hormone therapy may also be used in conjunction with another treatment.
For patients with blockages and scarring within the reproductive system, surgery can provide a permanent resolution. Surgery may also be recommended for patients with fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis or genetic defects.
Artificial insemination could be the solution to unexplained infertility. Injecting a concentrated amount of sperm directly into the uterus during ovulation is a simple fertility treatment when there is no known medical reason that is preventing the couple from conceiving.
If less invasive fertility treatments fail, artificial reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization and zygote intrafallopian transfer, can take over for biology. For men with low sperm count or low sperm motility, introcytoplasmic sperm injection allows the doctor to inject sperm directly into harvested mature eggs. In some instances, the woman is not producing viable eggs, in which case an egg donor is needed.
For men with issues such as premature ejaculation or impotence, medication can help address these problems and increase the couple’s chance of becoming pregnant.
A wide variety of fertility drugs are available to help women who aren’t ovulating on their own. In some cases, the doctor may prescribe medication that stimulates the ovaries to produce mature eggs.

See your gynecologist if you have monthly cramping but no period.,
Talk to your doctor if you haven't gotten your period by age 14 to 16.,
Talk to your doctor if you grow breasts and body hair but don't get your period.,
Visit your doctor if sexual intercourse is painful or impossible.There are a number of reasons this could be, but one of them is an imperforate hymen.

,
Have a pelvic exam to get diagnosed.",How to Deal with Having an Imperforate Hymen1," Imperforate hymens are often diagnosed in newborn babies, but if not you might not notice a problem until you get your first period. If you have an imperforate hymen you will not have a normal period because the hymen is blocking the blood from coming out of the vagina. You will still have menstrual cramps, though, so if you have abdominal pain every month but no period you should get checked.You might also have other symptoms like back pain, difficulty urinating, or constipation.
Some girls will be able to feel a hard mass in the lower abdomen below the belly button, which is the menstrual blood stuck in the uterus.;
, Girls get their first period at a younger age now than girls used to in the past. The average age for first periods in the United States, for example, is 12 to 13 years old.Guidelines recommend seeing a gynecologist if you have not gotten your first period by age 14 1/2 to 16 1/2African-American girls often mature faster and get their periods a year earlier, whereas Caucasian girls tend toward the older end of that range., Other than going by age, you can watch for signs that your body is changing with puberty. Two big things that indicate puberty are needing your first real bra and getting armpit and/or pubic hair. At this point you will probably start your period within 3 to 6 months if you haven’t already. If you don’t get your period within two years of these changes, see your doctor.A ""real"" bra means one with a cup size attached to it, like 34B, as opposed to small, medium, or large.

,, During a pelvic exam, your doctor will have you lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet in supports called stirrups. The doctor will assess your vagina by looking and feeling.


If it looks like you have an imperforate hymen, your doctor might do a test called a pelvic ultrasound to make sure there aren't any other problems causing your symptoms.Ultrasounds don’t hurt, it’s similar to how we look at babies in the womb!

, Your doctor might put a small ring in the opening so that it doesn't close up after surgery. If not, dilators are used to keep the incision open after the procedure. A dilator is a small tampon-like object that you place in the vagina for about 15 minutes every day while you're recovering., Don’t be surprised to see some more dark, thick, old blood coming out of your vagina for several days to a week after the procedure. This is normal and safe. You might also have mild cramps during this time., You can take Ibuprofen, Aspirin or Aleve for cramping. You doctor might also give you a jelly with pain-relieving lidocaine in it. You can apply this lightly to the area of your vagina if you’re sore, and a few minutes before you have to pee.It’s okay to take a bath while recovering. It might feel soothing and will help keep the area clean. Use a hair dryer on the cool setting to dry the sore area and avoid the scratchiness of a towel.After surgery, your doctor may also prescribe a topical estrogen cream for you to use to help the area heal and prevent scar tissue from forming.

, At this visit your healthcare provider will check the area for signs of inflammation or infection. He or she can also answer any questions you have., Fever, bad pain that isn’t helped by medicine, and pus are signs of infection, and you should seek care immediately., You might know this if the dilator will not go in or it hurts a lot when you try."

Write, blog, or chat with others online.",How to Deal with Having an Imperforate Hymen3," Once your imperforate hymen has been surgically repaired there should be no long term problems. Your vagina will function normally, you will have normal periods and be able to use tampons, and you will be able to have sexual intercourse. Having a history of an imperforate hymen will not make it harder to have children in the future., Having a hymen doesn't mean someone is a ""virgin."" Some girls are born without a hymen. Yes, the hymen can stretch or tear during sex, but this can also happen when using tampons, during sports, or during some medical procedures.Don’t feel like having the surgery takes away your virginity or changes who you are.

, While procedures that make only a small cut in the hymen to “preserve virginity” may exist, the opening often closes up again causing unnecessary pain and the need to repeat the procedure. Cultural views about virginity and how the hymen should look should be discussed with your doctor, but should not stop you from getting the appropriate surgery., It might feel difficult to discuss sex with your partner if you're in an intimate relationship, but it will help to let him or her know that the pain and trouble you're having with sex is normal for your condition and can be fixed.


Talking to friends and family can help relieve stress about the condition or the surgery. You can always ask loved ones to go to the doctor with you to better understand your condition.
Remember that having an imperforate hymen wasn't caused by anything you did or your mom did during pregnancy. It just happens, and isn't that uncommon!

, Since there are lots of young ladies out there with the same condition, it might help to read about their experience or share your own.

Analyze the choices that you have.,
Consider your personal beliefs and emotions.,
Consider practical issues.,
Talk to someone whom you trust.,
Speak with a medical doctor.,
Understand the effects of the decision.,
Be aware of your risk factors.",How to Deal With Abortion1," In order to make an informed decision you first need to think about the different options you have. Know that people who chose an abortion versus another type of option, fare about the same in general in terms of psychological outcome.Write down or think about your options. For example, you can choose to: parent, put the child up for adoption (open or closed), sign over guardianship to a family member or someone close to you, or you can terminate your pregnancy. Weigh your situation with these options.
Write down the pros and cons of each, including practical issues and your own emotions.;
, Some people cannot stand the idea of abortion, some are ambivalent, and others believe it is a human right. You may be anywhere along the spectrum. It is also important to consider your own feelings towards being a parent. Your thoughts and feelings are important.Do you have strong religious views about abortion?
How do you feel about other people who have abortions?
Do you feel ready to be a parent?
If you keep the pregnancy, would you want to be able to see the baby?
Would you be okay with people knowing, and potentially judging you, if you aborted the pregnancy?

, Envision different futures for yourself: one in which you keep the pregnancy and the baby, one in which you carry the pregnancy and then put the baby up for adoption, one in which you terminate the pregnancy, et cetera.Can you afford to have a child?
What would be your future, and your family's future, if you had a child?
Are you willing to tell a parent or go before a judge if your state requires it?
Can you psychologically handle an abortion? Could you handle it with extra support?
Can you psychologically handle being pregnant?

, Support will help you weigh your options and prepare for whatever choice you want.Support helps you feel more confident in your ability to deal with the situation.Whether it’s a parent, a friend, a mentor, a clergy member, or a counselor, you need someone to be able to turn to for comfort and support.


Get support from your partner, if you have one.
Get support from parents if possible.
You do not need to people who aren’t supportive. Individuals who try to get support from people who are not supportive have more psychological distress.(If you are 18 or over, you are not obligated to tell anyone.)Find support elsewhere if you do not get it from your partner or parents. Try talking to friends or siblings.

, If you found out you are pregnant by using an at-home pregnancy test, you may want to confirm you are pregnant by seeing a doctor. If you haven’t decided on whether or not you want to terminate the pregnancy, you can learn more information to help you make your decision.


Ask a lot of questions at your initial appointment.
Every Planned Parenthood has staff members trained to discuss your concerns., People who have an easier time making the decision, who are content with the choice, and who terminate unwanted pregnancies, show an easier time dealing with the abortion process.Take time to think about it. A hasty decision may be one you regret.Take time to weigh the options and settle on what you think is best.

, Abortion is a largely safe procedure, with only about 1% of people experiencing complications.Most people do not experience significant psychological consequences following an abortion, but a few do.The risk of psychological harm increases when there are other stressors or mental health issues that exist.


Know your mental health history. If you have a history of emotional problems, you may have a harder time dealing with an unwanted pregnancy or abortion.
Identify other stressors in your life. If you have low financial ability, you may have a more difficult time dealing with the effects of an abortion.
Understand your support network. If you have experienced domestic or partner violence, or do not have an adequate support system, you also may have a more difficult time.
Personality characteristics can also influence the psychological outcome of an abortion. Individuals who do not have healthy ways of coping may experience more distress."

Be firm and direct.The best way to deal with being pressured to have sex is to tell the person to stop in a clear, direct way, whether its a stranger or someone you know.Doing this makes it plain that you don’t want to have sex and want them to quit pressuring you right now.,
Say ‘no’ with your body language.,
Leave the situation.",How to Deal With Being Pressured to Have Sex1,"


Avoid phrases like, “I don’t know about this” or “Maybe we shouldn’t”. Your meaning can be misinterpreted.
You might say, ""When I say no, I mean it. Don't keep asking me or trying to change my mind. If or when I am willing, I'll let you know.
With a spouse or partner you could try, ""When you ask me to have sex so often, I feel pressured and uncomfortable. Please stop.""
If they keep pushing, keep saying ‘no’. This is called the ""broken record"" technique. The person can't continue pressing without looking like an enormous jerk.;
, Sometimes your words can say one thing, but your body language says something different. Communicate that you want them to stop pressuring you to have sex by using your tone of voice, posture, and other non-verbal cues.Telling them and making sure your actions match your words will make your message clear.


Stand up (or sit up) straight and tall. Hold your head up and relax your shoulders. This posture will increase your confidence.
If you need to, take a step or two back to put some physical space between you and the person.
Look the person in the eyes. Without smiling, speak using a clear, calm, firm voice.

, In some cases, even when you firmly say ‘no’ with your words and actions, the person doesn’t stop pressuring you. In these cases, deal with the pressure by leaving the situation as quickly as you can.Leaving, even if only for a minute or two, can lower the intensity of the moment and give the other person a chance to think about what they’re doing.


Excuse yourself to the bathroom or to get a bottle of water. If you go back to the situation, keep some physical distance between you and the person.
Lying isn’t usually recommended. However, if it is the only way for you to get away from someone that won’t stop pressuring you for sex, then lie.
You might glance at your phone and then say, “I have to go. My mom just texted me to come home.”

Apply pressure to your breasts.,
Put on a cardigan or jacket.,
Keep an extra blouse in your bag.,
Use an absorbent material.,
Try a plastic milk collection cup.",How to Cope With Leaking Milk1," While you may worry that applying pressure could make the milk come out faster, strategically applying pressure over your nipples when you feel your breasts engorging can help prevent the leaking from happening.Crossing your arms over your chest should allow you to apply the correct amount of pressure.
Plan to express your milk soon after it comes in. Applying pressure is a temporary solution.;
, While you’re breastfeeding, carry a cardigan, jacket, or other layering piece with you so that you can easily hide any spontaneous leaks.If you are going to work, plan your outfit to include your layering piece.

, You may not always be able to prevent leakage, so keep an extra top with you in case of emergencies.Most people won’t notice you’ve changed your clothes.


If you have an extra bra, keep that in your bag as well because your bra will also be soaked.

, While a nursing pad would be the best option, any material that soaks up the extra milk will be helpful in coping with the unexpected leak. Place a nursing pad, cloth, or even folded up napkins into your bra to soak up the milk. Change it out frequently to avoid having it soak through your clothes.

, If leaking is a consistent problem for you, you may find that a plastic milk collection cup, such as a Milkies Milk-Saver, is a great choice for you. These cups collect the milk as it leaks, so you are both protected from leak stains and are able to use the leaked milk."

Talk with your partner.,
Set limits.,
Use humor.,
Be honest about money.,
Talking with your doctor and nurses.,
Lean on family and friends.",How to Create a Positive in Vitro Fertilization Experience1," If you are completing IVF with a partner, it is important to maintain the solid foundation of your relationship. Consider your opinions on everything, from which doctor you work with, to the number of eggs to be transplanted. Talk, but also listen actively. Ask questions and speak up (respectfully) if you disagree with something.


Maintaining open communication will be especially helpful if you must make difficult decisions, such as if you must consider selective fetal reduction (a process in which the number of embryos are reduced to prevent multiple pregnancies). Ask your partner, “How do you feel about reduction at this moment? How do you think you will feel about it five years from now, or 10 years?”
Ask for your partner’s thoughts and feelings. You might say, “What does your heart tell you? What does your head tell you?” Then answer the same questions for them.;
, Spend a maximum of 20 minutes each day discussing IVF with your partner. Anything else that needs to be said can wait until tomorrow. Don’t let IVF take over every aspect of your life.Before you even start the process, decide when you will need to stop if it is not successful. Knowing that the process will have an end point can help you get through the rough times and give it your all.


It is important to emphasize the positive. As part of your 20 minutes, state at least one of your hopes for the future. For example, “I hope we get to buy little baby booties.”
Ask your partner, “How many traditional IVF cycles should we undergo?” or, “How many months do you think we can handle this emotionally?”, While sitting in the waiting room, tell a silly joke or chuckle about something goofy that your partner did in the past. After a round of appointments, go see a funny movie or a stand up comic to celebrate. Laughter reduces pain awareness and enhances quality of life.See if you can find something funny about the process. For example, the time requirements of IVF injections may result in you getting one in an odd location, such as an elevator. Say, “Well that was a memorable elevator ride!”, Sit down with your partner and create a clear budget showing money coming in and going out, prior to the IVF process. Then, see what monies you can realistically allocate. Investigate what, if any, treatments your insurance will cover.


Cutting down on expenses, taking on additional employment, or even liquidating investments are some revenue-generating options.
A single IVF treatment can cost between $12,000 to $17,000. Keep in mind that many people require multiple cycles to be successful., Frequent, face-to-face interactions with the medical team are important. You will likely be interacting with nurses more often than you see the doctor, so take the time to get to know the nurses and establish a positive relationship. Before you even arrive, write down a list of your most critical questions and concerns. Prioritize the questions and make it your goal to get five of the most important ones answered. If you feel unsatisfied at the end of the current appointment, make another one just for discussion.


Keep your queries specific and direct. Instead of asking, “What should I do after implantation?”, you might say, “Should I rest after implantation and, if so, for how long?”
Don’t be afraid to reach out to the medical team via email or the phone. If you did not get your questions answered in person, type them up and send them, flagging the email as “Important.”
Patients are only usually able to speak for 12 seconds before being interrupted by their physician. So, be assertive and re-direct the conversation back to you by stating, “Can we pause for a moment and address the questions that I prepared?”, Give you friends and family a good idea as to your appointment schedule and request volunteers to accompany you. Even if they stay in the waiting room, you will want support for many of your meetings with doctors, ultrasound technicians, etc.


If you are expecting a phone call with news about the results of your implantation, for example, ask a close friend to spend that day with you (if your partner is not available). You will want someone there to celebrate with or to comfort you if things didn't go as planned.
Getting assistance from people close to you also gives you an opportunity to educate them about the process of IVF. You might say, “Would you like to come speak to the doctor with me?” This will also decrease the likelihood of them saying hurtful things out of ignorance."

Limit your number of sexual partners.,
Take time to talk and get tested.,
Use condoms the right way.",How to Prevent Syphilis1," If you are sexually active, you can prevent syphilis by limiting your number of sexual partners. Your risk of contracting syphilis goes up with the number of sexual partners you have. Sexually active people who have only one partner in a monogamous relationship are safest, as long as neither partner has sex with anyone else. For some people, however, this might be unrealistic. Therefore, try to limit your number of sexual partners. f you have more than one sex partner, your risk of STIs (including syphilis) increases. The more partners you have, the greater the risk.Practicing abstinence will reduce your chances of getting syphilis to nearly zero.;
, The sex conversation is always an uncomfortable conversation, but it is one of the best ways to avoid contracting STIs (or STDs), like syphilis. Before you engage in sexual activity with a new partner, take time to talk with them about your sexual history, as well as their sexual history. You can make the conversation less awkward and accusatory by initiating the conversation and offering to relate your sexual history first.


You can initiate the conversation by saying, “Hey, I am really attracted to you, and I would like to take our relationship to the next level. Before we venture down this path, however, I would like to tell you about my sexual history and the last time I got tested.” Tell them about your sexual history, and ask them about theirs. Then suggest that you both get tested before having sex.
Your partner might be resistant and respond with something like, “I haven't been tested, but I know I don't have any diseases.” You can respond by telling them, “Some people don’t even know they have an STI, like syphilis, because symptoms can be dormant. This doesn't mean I don't trust you or I think you are lying to me, but there's no way to really know for sure unless you are tested.”, It is important to use condoms when engaging in sexual activities. What is more important, though, is knowing how to use condoms the right way. Every time you engage in sex, use a condom.


Here is a guide to using male condoms the right way:Check the package and make sure it is intact, and look for an expiration date before using the condom. Do not use the condom if it is past the expiration date, as the latex can degrade and weaken, making the condom more likely to break.
Ensure that the condom does not have any tears or defects.
Store your condoms in a cool, dry place. Do not store them in your wallet for long periods of time; the heat and friction can damage them.
Only use latex or polyurethane condoms. Do not use lamb skin condoms.
To prevent breakage, use lubricants that are water-based or silicone-based. Oil lubricants, i.e., baby oil, petroleum jelly, cooking oil, can cause the condom to break.
When putting the condom on, leave space at the end of the penis to collect semen.
Do not use more than one condom at a time or reuse a condom.


Here is a guide to using female condoms the right way:Check the package and make sure it is intact and look for an expiration date.
Carefully open the package to avoid tearing the condom. Make sure there are no tears or other defects.
The condom will have one open end and one closed end. Squeeze sides of inner ring of the closed side together with your thumb and forefinger and insert into your vagina. It is similar to using a tampon.
Use your finger to push the inner ring up as far as possible until it rests against your cervix — you may not feel it. Make sure the condom is not twisted and the open, outer ring is outside your vagina.
To remove, gently twist and pull the condom out of your vagina.
Store condoms in a cool, dry place.
Never reuse a condom and do not use both a male and female condom at the same time.

Focus on your work.,
Avoid warm spaces.",How to Cope With Leaking Milk3," Because leaking milk is often caused by overly full breasts, nursing your baby prevents leakage by reducing the pressure caused by the milk.Additionally, milk leakage often stops after the baby has gotten used to breastfeeding, which requires frequent opportunities for your baby to nurse.Nurse your baby before your breasts get full to avoid leakage.It takes time for your body to get used to how much milk your baby needs, so frequent feedings will help your body make that adjustment.

Do you fear needles or other procedures?If waiting rooms are a problem for you, plan to arrive at the very last minute and communicate this plan to the front desk staff. You could say, “I get really anxious sitting in this room, do you mind if I do all of the paperwork via email beforehand?” In the future ask for morning appointments when the wait is typically shorter.

If, for example, you have a poor response to the ovulation medication-what will be your next step? Will you consider an alternative medication? Planning provides a positive outlet for your energy while giving you back some of the control.When planning for different outcomes, it may be a good idea to discuss your options with a fertility support group, either online or in person. They will have been through many of the same experiences and can provide you with fresh options.

, IVF is not the only way to create a family. Research options outside of fertility treatments, such as adoption, child-free living, or continuing to push for natural conception. Knowing the different possibilities will help you to keep looking forward."

Do not abuse alcohol or drugs.,
Avoid partners with high-risk behaviors.,
Do not engage in high-risk sexual behaviors.",How to Prevent Syphilis2," Abusing alcohol and drugs can impair your judgment and make you forget the promises you made to yourself about having safer sex.Try to control your alcohol and drug intake by limiting yourself to one drink per hour and by drinking water while you drink alcohol.

, Try to identify and avoid engaging in sexual activities with partners who have a history of sexual behaviors that put them at risk of contracting an STI, like syphilis. These are people who engage in intravenous drug use, unprotected oral, anal, or vaginal sex, sex with prostitutes, a person who has multiple sex partners, and someone who exchanges sex for money or drugs., Try to avoid high-risk sexual behaviors like oral, anal, or vaginal sex without barriers such as condoms or dental dams. Always follow safer sex practices, especially if you are having sex with a partner for the first time.Engage in sexual activities that have a low risk of spreading an STI. These sexual activities are kissing, fondling, body-to-body rubbing or “dry humping,” oral sex with the use of a condom or a dental dam, and playing with sex toys.If using sex toys, remember to thoroughly clean your sex toys before and after use. You can also use condoms with your sex toys for added protection.
Sexual activities that do not spread STIs are masturbation, mutual masturbation, online or “cybersex,” phone sex, and sharing fantasies."

Recognize syphilis symptoms.,
Get routine blood tests.,
Don’t use home remedies or over-the-counter drugs.",How to Prevent Syphilis3," You can prevent syphilis transmission by recognizing the symptoms. Syphilis symptoms include skin ulcers, lesions, and rashes inside or around your genital area. Ulcers and lesions can also pop up around the mouth and lips or inside your mouth.Rashes found on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet are also symptoms. Additionally, you might develop a fever, swollen glands, a sore throat, and feel tired and weak., Unfortunately, if you have caught syphilis or if you had syphilis previously and it has relapsed, you might not know because symptoms do not always surface. Ensure that you do not have syphilis by getting tested for it, either by your usual healthcare provider or a local clinic that tests for STIs.If you are at risk for an infection, it is recommended that you get tested at least once a year, if not twice a year. Also, it is recommended that you get tested with each new partner., If caught in its early stages, syphilis can be cured with the right medicine, usually with penicillin G. Home remedies and over-the-counter drugs do not cure syphilis.Once treated, it is recommended that you abstain from all sexual activities for seven days or until your sores are healed to prevent contracting syphilis or transmitting it to other partners."

Be aware of how HPV is transmitted.,
Get vaccinated.,
Prevent HPV.,
Understand that you may have only one lifetime sex partner and still have HPV.,
Know that there is no conventional test to determine if you have HPV.",How to Prevent HPV Infection (Human Papillomavirus Infection)," HPV infections occur most commonly through vaginal or anal sex, but can be transmitted via any genital contact.


Many people infected with HPV are asymptomatic (show no symptoms); it is possible to have gone for years without sexual activity and still be infected with HPV. This lack of knowledge means that is is possible for people to unknowingly pass the infection on to others.
In very rare cases a pregnant woman with HPV may transfer the infection to her baby during delivery. If this happens, the baby may suffer from warts in the throat or larynx. This condition is known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP).;
, If you are a female there is a vaccine, Gardasil, that can prevent 4 types of HPV infections, including the infections that cause most cervical cancers. The vaccine is recommended for the following groups:


Girls 11-12 years of age who have not been previously exposed to HPV.
Girls and women 13-26 years of age who have not been vaccinated or who have not completed the vaccine series.

, The following are ways to prevent HPV:


The surest way to avoid HPV is to refrain from sexual activity.
For those who are sexually active, using a condom properly and consistently can lower the risk.
Maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has had few or no past sex partners.
Limit your number of sex partners.
Choose your sex partners carefully.

, Around 50% of sexually active men and women will have HPV infection at some time in their lives.

, However, testing for the diseases caused by HPV is very important. Be tested for the following:


Genital warts. These appear as small bumps or clusters of bumps in the genital area. For females these warts appear on the vulva, in the vicinity of the vagina or anus, thighs, and on the cervix. For males they will appear on the penis, scrotum, thighs, or groin. The warts may appear within a few weeks to a month after having had sexual contact with an infected partner. They may not appear at all. These warts will not turn into cancer, but if left untreated they could multiply in number.
Cervical cancer. Unfortunately, cervical cancer cannot be detected until it is considerably advanced. This makes it all the more important for women to be tested regularly. The Pap test can recognize pre-cancerous changes so that they can be removed before cancer develops.
Less common HPV-related cancers. Cancers of the vagina and penis may not have signs or symptoms until they are well advanced. The same is equal for cancers of the anus and vulva. There are no approved tests to find early signs of penile or anal cancer.

Combat the symptoms.",How to Prevent Herpes," As mentioned, there are two types of herpes simplex virus, known as HSV-1 and HSV-2. Generally speaking, HSV-1 is the cause of oral herpes (roughly 80% of the time), and HSV-2 causes genital herpes (also about 80%).HSV-1 and HSV-2 are both spread by the transmission of infected fluids through skin-to-skin contact. You can get herpes when blisters are present and when sores are not present.Genital herpes is considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD) because fluid exchange during vaginal, anal, or oral sex is the primary mode of transmission. Oral herpes most commonly spreads through kissing, or sharing utensils or drinkware.
It is estimated that one-in-six Americans age 14-49 have genital herpes.;
, The most common sign of a genital herpes infection is a cluster of reddish sores in or near the genital area. These sores or lesions eventually blister, break (sometimes resulting in oozing), and scab over before disappearing.Oral herpes lesions, which typically form around or in the mouth, are often called “cold sores.” These are not the same as canker sores, which only form inside the mouth and are not caused by HSV.After the initial outbreak, which usually occurs within several days of infection, the symptoms will disappear and recur, often with decreasing frequency and intensity. Flu-like symptoms can also accompany the lesions, especially during the initial outbreak.

, There is no current cure for herpes, and the virus often remains within an infected body for life. It can remain dormant for months or years and then recur without warning.Outbreaks may be triggered by stress, fever, sunlight, or trauma, among other causes.


Some people with herpes never display any symptoms, while many experience only mild, infrequent symptoms.
Herpes should not be brushed aside as insignificant, however. Pregnant women with genital herpes, for example, run a greater risk of miscarriage and can spread neonatal herpes, which can occasionally prove deadly, to their unborn children.
Pregnant women who have herpes may need to take an antiviral medication during pregnancy to prevent transmission. If you have a herpes outbreak during labor, then a cesarean section would be performed to prevent transmission to the baby.Additionally, herpes skin lesions break and bleed more easily than healthy skin, making the spread of HIV during sexual activity more likely.

, As with any STD, abstaining from sexual activity is the most effective way to prevent genital herpes. Barring that, limiting your number of sexual partners reduces the likelihood of transmission.You can consider a reduced risk of contracting an STD as one benefit of engaging in long-term, monogamous sexual relationships.
Of course, honesty within the monogamous relationship, and taking protective measures as needed, are important in preventing the transmission of herpes as well.

, Not surprisingly, most people are not eager to discuss herpes with prospective or new sexual partners. Getting past the stigmas and fears, however, and engaging in an honest discussion about STDs, is essential to protecting against transmission either to or from you.


If you know you have herpes, consider it your responsibility to inform your partners, even if this means engaging in an awkward conversation. Likewise, take it upon yourself to ask your partners if they have or may have herpes.
If you are concerned that you may have herpes, talk to your doctor about taking a simple blood test that can confirm or refute your suspicion.Genital herpes can spread even when symptoms are not present, so it is best to err on the side of caution. If it is even remotely possible that you or your partner has herpes, assume it to be so and take protective measures.In fact, the protective measures recommended for preventing herpes transmission are good habits under all circumstances.

, Herpes is most likely to be transmitted when an infected person is symptomatic with the tell-tale blisters. It is therefore imperative to avoid sexual activity during these flare-ups of the infection.The same principle holds true for avoiding kissing and sharing of utensils, drinkware, etc., during breakouts of oral herpes. For more information specific to dealing with oral herpes, click over to How to Live with Herpes.
During breakouts in particular, any skin-to-skin contact in the “risk area” carries an increased risk of transmission, as any miniscule crack or opening in the skin is enough of an open door for the virus to enter. For genital herpes, the risk area corresponds to the area of the body covered by a pair of boxer shorts., As with any STD, using a condom properly every time is essential to reducing the likelihood of transmitting herpes during sexual activity. Only condoms made of latex or polyurethane, and properly employed, are effective at preventing transmission of herpes or other STDs.If you or your partner has or may have herpes, you should use a condom every time, regardless of whether one of you is symptomatic at the time. Remember, herpes can still be transmitted even without symptoms.From opening the package to disposing of the used condom, proper technique and care to ensure proper coverage and avoid breakage or leakage is the key to preventing transmission. Consult How to Use a Condom for detailed instructions.
To prevent the spread of herpes during oral sex, males should wear condoms and females should employ ""dental dams,"" which are essentially rectangular sheets of latex. These can be purchased as-is, or made by cutting open a male condom or even a latex glove., Never attempt to reuse a condom, obviously, but also take care to clean and protect any sex toys, such as vibrators, you use or share.Clean items carefully and thoroughly with soap and warm water after every use, and especially before sharing them.
Cover items with condoms or similar forms of protection.

, Even though there is no cure for herpes, there are treatments available that can moderate or shorten breakouts, when transmission is more likely.


Several antiviral medications are available to combat genital herpes. Talk to your doctor about which is right for you and when to take it. You may be advised to take the medication consistently, or only during breakouts. Remember, however, that none of these medications can cure herpes.For more information on common herpes treatments, see How to Treat Herpes.
A 2004 study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that, in cases where one partner had genital herpes, the transmission rate was reduced from 4% to 0.4% with the combination of: 1) abstaining from sex when symptomatic; 2) using a condom every time; and 3) taking the antiviral Valtrex daily.Therefore, with proper precautions taken, the transmission of genital herpes from an infected partner to a non-infected one can most often be prevented. The keys, as always when dealing with herpes, are honesty, abstinence during symptoms, and proper protection.

Be aware of how you can’t contract gonorrhea.",How to Prevent Gonorrhea," Abstaining from sex is the only surefire way to prevent gonorrhea, but it’s not the most practical solution. Using condoms every time you have any sexual contact can reduce your risk of getting gonorrhea.If you have only one sex partner and don’t normally use condoms, wear or have your partner wear one if either one of you is undergoing treatment for gonorrhea. This can help prevent accidental transmission of the disease.;
, Your significantly increase your risk of getting gonorrhea by having sex with multiple partners.Limit the number of people with whom you have sex to minimize your risk of getting the disease.


If you or your partner isn’t faithful, this can increase your risk of gonorrhea, especially if you do not use any protection.Communicating openly with your partner or partners may help prevent gonorrhea. Ask your partner(s) if they’ve been tested for the disease—and other sexually transmitted diseases.Being infected with gonorrhea and engaging in sex with multiple partners can significantly increase your risk of contracting other sexually transmitted diseases.If you or your partner is unsure of their history or if they’re uninfected, abstain from having sex until you can be tested.

, Putting on condoms properly can reduce you and your partner’s risk for getting gonorrhea. Make sure condoms haven’t expired or are damaged as well.Make sure to put on the condom before you have any genital contact, opening the package carefully—not with your teeth or fingernails.Place the tip of the rolled up condom over the erect penis, pulling back the foreskin if you are not circumcised.Squeeze the tip of the condom to remove any air.Roll the condom down the length of the penis and remove any air bubbles that appear.For female condoms, carefully open the package and insert it into your vagina by squeezing the ring at the closed end of the pouch.Push the ring up into your vagina as far as it will go using your index finger.Don’t use male and female condoms simultaneously.Any shared sexual device, like dildos, should also have a condom. Disinfect and clean devices frequently and use protection every time.

, A dental dam is a sheet of latex that you can use as a barrier during oral sex. Follow the same rules for opening dental dams as you would use for opening a condom. Open the dental dam carefully. Do not use your teeth or nails. Only use water-based lubricants with dental dams, too. Do not use oils like baby oil or petroleum jelly. Also, make sure that you always use a new dental dam every time you have oral sex.To use the dental dam, place it over the vaginal or anal opening prior to starting oral sex. After you are finished, throw the dental dam away.
If you do not have a dental dam, you can also cut off the tip and down one side of a condom to create a latex sheet. This sheet can be used the same way as a dental dam.

, If you have or suspect you have gonorrhea, don’t touch your eyes after touching genitalia or your rectum. This can spread the disease to your eyes and cause an infection., Seeing your doctor and getting tested regularly for gonorrhea is important to maintaining not only your overall well-being, but also the health of your genitalia.Your doctor may discover gonorrhea during your regular exam and prescribe treatment for you., If your doctor discovers gonorrhea, it’s important that you finish the entire course of medications she prescribes. Stopping treatment can increase your risk of a recurrence of gonorrhea.Gonorrhea is most often treated with a combination of an injection and oral antibiotics, in part because of the emergence of drug resistant strains and the frequency of co-infection with chlamydia., It is possible to spread gonorrhea to your unborn baby if you are infected. If you are pregnant and infected with gonorrhea, speak to your doctor as soon as possible to take measures that can minimize the risk of transmitting the disease to your baby during delivery.Most babies born to mothers who have gonorrhea are treated after birth with a medication in their eyes to prevent infection., If you want to engage in sex after being diagnosed with gonorrhea, it’s safest to wait until after you’ve finished your course of treatment and, possibly, wait until your partner completes treatment if they were also positive. This can help ensure that you don’t spread the disease to your partner.You should wait seven days after finishing medications for gonorrhea to have sex again., Gonorrhea presents itself with different symptoms and can occur on different parts of your body. Learning the symptoms of gonorrhea can help you identify them and get treatment for the disease.You can get gonorrhea infections in your genitalia, rectum, eyes, throat, and possibly even in your joints.Most women have no or mild symptoms of gonorrhea, and they may seem like a bladder or vaginal infection.The most common symptoms of gonorrhea include: a burning sensation when urinating, discharge from the penis or increased vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding between periods.Infections in the rectum may cause no symptoms in both men and women, but you may experience discharge, anal itching, soreness, bleeding, or painful bowel movements.Gonorrhea of the eyes may cause sensitivity to light and you may notice a pus-like discharge from one or both eyes.Gonorrhea of the throat may be accompanied by a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck., If you have any symptoms of gonorrhea or suspect exposure, consult your doctor as soon as possible. She can confirm the disease and prescribe a course of treatment.Your doctor will likely examine your genitals for symptoms and signs of gonorrhea. She may also perform lab or urine tests to confirm this diagnosis.The most common medications used to treat gonorrhea are an injection of ceftriaxone given in conjunction with an oral antibiotic such as azithromycin or doxycycline.Your partner should also get tested for gonorrhea. The treatment is the same for both partners if a diagnosis is concerned., If you don’t see a doctor and get treatment for gonorrhea, you increase your risk for serious health conditions. Knowing the risks of not getting treatment may influence your decision to see your doctor and get treatment.Untreated gonorrhea can cause infertility in both men and women.Gonorrhea can increase your risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV/ AIDS.Untreated gonorrhea can cause an infection that spreads to the rest of your body, including your joints and bloodstream.If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, not getting treatment can increase the risk of blindness, sores on the scalp, and other infections in your baby., Just as you should know how to prevent gonorrhea, you should also know how you can’t get the disease. You cannot get gonorrhea from toilet seats or shaking hands with someone."

Communicate!",How to Prevent HIV Infection," There's a lot of misinformation about how the disease is spread, so educate yourself in order to protect yourself. HIV is transmitted when infected blood, breast milk, semen, or vaginal secretions come in contact with broken skin or mucous membranes (i.e., mouth, nose, vagina, rectum, penis opening). HIV can be transmitted through unprotected vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse, as well by blood-blood contact and contact with bodily fluids.


This means that you can usually kiss safely (as long as there are not existing cuts or sores and you don't give each other any), as well as safely touch and have normal daily interactions with someone with HIV.
Do not assume that someone who is asymptomatic does not have HIV. People can have HIV for many years before developing AIDS, and any infected person can transmit the virus.;
, The first thing you should do is stop abusing alcohol and drugs. These substances, while fun, impair your judgement and make you more likely to make bad decisions or put you in a situation where the decision is not yours. Certain drugs, like intravenous drugs, can also make you more likely to contract HIV by exposing you at a much higher rate.

, Already having STDs and STIs puts you at a higher risk for getting HIV. The infections weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to contracting HIV when you are exposed. This is why you should treat these problems, as well as normal health problems like yeast infections, immediately if you suspect you may have them. You can also get vaccinated against certain STD/Is like Hep A and B, if you are at high risk.

, Needles and syringes can easily carry HIV from one person to another. Never use recreational drugs which use needles and never use any needles not given to you by your doctor. If you have problems with addiction to these drugs, get help for addiction and find out if your area has a needle exchange program to help keep you and others safe.

, If you're male and having sex with women, circumcision can greatly lower your risk of contracting HIV. Having sex with a circumcised male does not protect you if you are a woman, however, and circumcision seems to offer no significant benefit in male-male sex. If you are not already circumcised, you can get circumcised as an adult if you choose to.

, If you do expose yourself to HIV, seek medical attention immediately. If treated within 72 hours (and the sooner the better), you may be able to prevent the HIV infection from permanently settling down in your body through Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (or PEP) treatment . PEP is not a 100% guarantee, with studies showing the highest risk of failure with those treated 55 hours or more after exposure and males who received penetrative anal sex., You never know who has HIV, since there is no stereotype, and someone may not even know if he or she is infected, so the best policy is to always be careful. Avoid touching other people's blood if at all possible and also avoid contact with the other bodily fluids that can spread HIV. These fluids include :


Semen (cum) and pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum)
Vaginal fluids
Rectal (anal) mucous
Breast milk
Amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and synovial fluid (usually only exposed if you work in a medical field)

, If you become pregnant and you're worried that you may have HIV, get tested and seek medical help immediately. It is possible to prevent the spread of the infection to your child, but you'll need a doctor's help to do it.


For example, a C section will be crucial in protecting your child., As always, if you have a medical problem or questions, you should ask a doctor! If you don't have a doctor or medical insurance, most areas have free or low-cost clinic and many government programs exist to help you find help. Research what's available in your area.

, Frequent testing can help both you and your sexual partner stay safe. Protecting each other if you're at risk or in a new relationship is something that good sexual partners do! Since some partners may lie about getting tested or what the results were, the safest bet is to get tested together.

, Only engage in unprotected sex if you are in a mutually monogamous relationship in which both you and your partner are uninfected by HIV or any other STD. This is the most important part of preventing HIV. Protected sex will go the furthest to protect you and your partner if one of you is at risk or has contracted an HIV infection. Of course, it's easy to say ""just this one time"" to skipping protection but all it takes is one time: be on the safe side and insist on protection! Your options include:


Male condoms
Female condoms
Dental dams (can be used for female-female, male-female, and male-male sex!)

, Lube may not seem like it can prevent HIV but it can actually help a lot! When you're using condoms, you put yourself at serious risk if the condom breaks. The best way to prevent condom breakage is by reducing the stress on the condom...with lube! Always use water based lube, as other lubes can degrade the latex of the condom and put you at risk.


Lube is especially important with anal sex, since it not only protects your body from tears but also protects the condom, as anal sex is more stressful on condoms that vaginal sex.

, Condoms may seem tricky, but correct usage is easy to learn. With the right attitude, you can even make condom use really sexy! Correct condom use is crucial to preventing HIV infections, since a broken or incorrectly used condom is about as good as using no condom at all.


Store your condoms correctly: out of direct sunlight, in a cool, dry place.
You'll also want to look out for an expiration date (don't worry if you see MFG after a date, since this means it's the manufacture date).
Open the package carefully with your hands and not your teeth.
Put it on the right way the first time. Place the condom with the bubble at the center pointing up, or so that the roll is on top. If you touch the condom to your penis in the other direction first, throw it away and get a new one, as it could be contaminated and spread the disease.
Pinch and roll to put it on. Gently pinch the bubble with your non-dominant hand and then roll the condom down the shaft of the penis with your dominant hand. This pinch is important, as it makes room for the ejaculate in the condom.
Be careful after sex too. Hold the base of the condom in place when you pull out. Immediately take it off (carefully!) and throw it away. Clean up to prevent your fluids from spreading.

, The best prevention is abstinence, of course, but abstaining tends to not be very realistic in the long run. The only form of sexual intercourse that does not carry a risk of HIV infection is in a mutually monogamous partnership in which both members are uninfected and do not expose themselves outside of sex. Stay with one person and get tested for HIV together every few years if you want to be sure you're safe!


Even if you are completely monogamous, you or your partner may accidentally be exposed, possibly without even knowing it. This is why it's a good idea to get tested together, even after you've been together for a while.

, If you have sex toys that both you and your partner use, it's a good idea to practice safe sex with those as well. Keep them clean, use condoms on them, and clean them between anal and vaginal use, as well as between use by different people.

, Talk with your partner about your sexual and drug abuse history. Let them understand that this is important to you and that you won't pass judgement. Create a relationship of open communication, so that you never feel like you have to hide information from each other that might put you at risk (like cheating or use of prostitutes). Talking with each other and being honest are great ways to protect each other.

Abstain from or limit sexual activity.,
Use condoms.,
Use sex toys safely.,
Don’t douche.,
Get regular checks for sexually transmitted diseases.,
Recognize how chlamydia is not transmitted.,
Identify symptoms of chlamydia.,
Avoid serious complications.,
Go to a doctor to get treatment if you think you might have chlamydia.",How to Prevent Chlamydia," The only sure-fire way to avoid getting chlamydia is to not have sex. Chlamydia is transmitted during unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. The more people you have sexual contact with, the more likely you are to come in contact with someone who has chlamydia.If someone is infected with chlamydia, the bacteria will be in their semen or vaginal fluids even if they are not symptomatic.
This means that it may also be possible to catch the infection if you get infected bodily fluids on your hands and then transfer it to your genitals or inside your body.;
, Condoms won’t completely eliminate your risk, but they will greatly reduce it. However, the condoms must be latex or polyurethane.Put the condom on correctly. Pinch the tip of the condom and hold it while you unroll the condom over the entire length of the penis. There should be space at the tip to catch semen during ejaculation.
After sex, remove the condom carefully to avoid spilling the semen.
If you perform oral sex on a woman, use a dental dam. This is a small piece of latex which will greatly reduce the risk of disease transmission. You can also use a split open male condom for this purpose.To avoid infection, you must also use condoms during anal sex.
Put on a condom or dam as soon as sexual activity starts.
If the condom breaks during sex, your risk of infection increases.

, If you share toys, you can spread chlamydia and other sexually transmitted diseases. In order to prevent this, the toys must be:Sterilized between users.
Or covered with a new latex or polyurethane condom for each user.

, Douching disrupts the natural, healthy bacterial community in the vagina and may make women more vulnerable to infections.Douching will not prevent pregnancy or the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

, This is particularly important if you are not using protection, have many partners, are younger than 25, or are pregnant.The prevalence of chlamydia is highest in young people. It is estimated that 1:20 sexually active females under the age of 25 has chlamydia. If you are at high risk, your doctor may suggest yearly screening.
Pregnant women can pass chlamydia to their children during childbirth, so it is important for pregnant women to get tested, especially if she or her partner might be infected.
Chlamydia can usually be detected through a urine test or a swab test. For women the cervix is swabbed, for men, the urethra or anus.

, You will not catch chlamydia by:Kissing
Sharing towels
Sitting on a toilet seat

, Not everyone gets symptoms, but if you do, it may start about a month after you are exposed. Symptoms include:


Pain or burning when urinating
Abdominal pain
A discharge coming from the vagina, penis, or rectum
Women may experience pain or bleeding after sex or between periods. Men may have pain in their testicles.
Heavier bleeding during menstruation
Your symptoms may stop after a while. This does not mean the infection is gone.

, If you think you might have been exposed to chlamydia, get tested. If it goes untreated, it can lead to fertility problems for both men and women and increase the risk of acquiring HIV.Both sexes can get sexually acquired reactive arthritis from chlamydia. This is a painful inflammation of the joints, eyes and/or urethra. Most people’s symptoms go away after a few months, but this does not mean that the chlamydia is gone.
Men can get chlamydia infections in their testicles and in the passages through which the sperm travels. This can reduce fertility.
Women can get chlamydia in the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, causing pain and fertility problems. This can be a cause of pelvic inflammatory disease and can increase the risk of life threatening ectopic pregnancy in the future.
Chlamydia can also be dangerous for unborn babies. It increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature birth. If it is transmitted from the mother to the baby during birth, the child may get it as a lung or eye infection.

, Chlamydia can be very effectively treated with antibiotics. Over 95% of people who follow through with their treatment get rid of the infection.Your doctor may prescribe azithromycin, doxycycline, or erythromycin. Take the whole course of antibiotics to make sure the infection is fully wiped out.
Don’t have sex, even with a condom, until both you and any possibly infected partners have finished the treatment. If you had a one-day course of antibiotics, you may still need to wait a week to be sure you have fully cleared the infection.
Get retested after finishing the treatment if your symptoms don’t go away, you didn’t take the medications as instructed, you had sex before you finished the treatment, or you are pregnant.

Join a support group.",How to Make Peace with Herpes1," Accepting that you have herpes will allow you to move forward.Studies have shown that people with herpes who use an acceptance coping style have a better quality of life.Acceptance coping means accepting that your herpes is real and it is something that you have to address. Acceptance is an ongoing process that takes time. Many people will refuse to acknowledge that they actually have herpes or will continue to live as though they do not have herpes. This denial will only make things more difficult for you. If you know you have herpes and do not inform a sexual partner, this can not only hurt your relationship, but there may be legal ramifications as well: you can be sued for negligence or personal injury if you.Herpes is nothing to be ashamed of, but you need to be honest with your partners so they can make an informed decision and protect their own health.
Write down or verbalize any negative feelings and thoughts you have about having herpes. Then, challenge where those negative feelings are coming from and replace them with more positive thoughts. Focus on the present. Do not think of the worst case scenario or dwell in your negative emotions.Instead of saying, ""My life is over because I have herpes,"" try saying, ""I am living right now, even though I have herpes,"" or, ""I am many things. Having herpes is only one part of my life."";
, You will have to make some changes to your life that may be difficult at first, but know that your life does not have to change dramatically. You can still do everything that you had planned to do. You may have to take medication every day and deal with an outbreak every once in a while, but you can mostly continue your life as normal.Continue to live the life you had before you were diagnosed. Make sure that you spend time doing things that you enjoy and make time for your family and friends.

You are still the same person you were before you were diagnosed. People that care for you will not stop just because you have herpes.
It may take time before you are comfortable talking to another person about your diagnosis. Have the conversation when you are ready.

, Herpes is a very common virus in the United States.Most people that have herpes have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. You probably know people who have herpes. Know that you are not alone.

, You will go through a variety of emotions after you are diagnosed with herpes. Many people are in disbelief, angry, resentful, ashamed, or embarrassed.These feelings are normal, but it is important for you to address and work through them. Holding on to negative emotions can cause stress, which can make your outbreaks worse and more painful.You would never be upset with yourself for catching a cold or getting the flu. Anyone could contract herpes, and you should not beat yourself up about it. You are not a stupid person, and herpes does not have to define your life.
Try thinking of how you would talk to your friend if they told you they were diagnosed with herpes. Forgive yourself and treat yourself with kindness.
Write down exactly what you want to forgive yourself for to work through your anger. Cut up or burn this letter to symbolize that you are letting all of it go., It is normal for you to be upset with the person that gave you herpes and wonder if the person knew that they had it.Most people with herpes do not know that they have it. Forgiveness is about you and not the other person. Holding on to anger and resentment will only hurt you and not the other person. You have to make the choice to forgive the person.


Acknowledge any anger or resentment you feel. Talk about it or write it down. Try writing a letter to the person who gave you herpes to process your feelings and then burn the letter.The burning of the letter is symbolic of you letting the anger and resentment go.
If you are having trouble with forgiveness, you should seek help from a therapist to work through your feelings.

, If you are not able to handle the emotional impact of herpes on your own, you should go see a therapist or a counselor. Cognitive behavioral stress management, progressive muscle relaxation, and group therapy have been found to be helpful for managing herpes.Professional therapy can help you feel less lonely and improve your mood. Group therapy will also allow you to meet other people who have herpes.
Cognitive behavioral stress management will help you focus on how your thoughts effect your emotions and behaviors. Participating in this type of therapy can help you feel less depressed and can improve your body's immune function., A support group is a safe place for you to talk about your feelings and learn from other people who are living with herpes.Support groups can be found online and in person. Ask your doctor if they know of any support groups. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has a hotline that can connect you with counselors and information."

Understand your increased risk, if you're female.",How to Know If You Have Herpes," There are two types of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), HSV-1 and HSV-2. Both can be considered genital herpes, since both types can be spread to the genitals. However, HSV-2 is far more common on the genitals. HSV-1 is the strain most common on the lips and mouth, but it can be spread through oral sex, just like HSV-2.There are ways to effectively treat the symptoms of both strains when they happen, though there is no cure.


Treatment is an important part of managing the disease. If you don't treat genital herpes, you may spread the disease to others (including your baby, if you're pregnant), experience bladder inflammation, notice rectal inflammation and in severe cases, get meningitis.;
, While it may take a while for the first outbreak to appear, it's usually worse than outbreaks that come later. You may not know that you've been exposed to the disease, so pay particular attention to any symptoms you start to develop. General flu symptoms are signs of the infection. These might include fever, muscle aches, decreased appetite and fatigue. See a doctor if you think you're experiencing your first herpes outbreak.It may be difficult for some people to realize they've been exposed since it can take so long for symptoms to show up. Or, the because the disease can be spread through people that don't show obvious symptoms of herpes.

, After you've had sexual contact, pay attention to any redness or itching on your genitals or around your mouth. You may also notice tingling and hot skin at the affected area. A few days later, you may also see a rash or outbreak of herpes on your skin.You should also be aware of some external factors that may contribute to the outbreak after infection. These can include:Trauma, stress, or menses. These can release cortisol, adrenaline, and other stress hormones or dramatically change the levels of hormones in your body. Any of these may lower your body’s ability to fight infection. This gives the herpes virus an opportunity to become an outbreak.
Burning and itching before an outbreak (known as a prodrome). Reducing the itching and burning as herpes is on the verge of breaking out can speed up the outbreak. Scratching once the outbreak has happened can lead to more outbreaks and spread the virus.
Sunlight and fever. Sunlight exposes your body to ultraviolet radiation which can irritate the skin and compromise the underlying cells, giving an opportunity for a herpes outbreak. A fever or cold compromises your immune system so your body can't suppress the infection, which leads to an outbreak.

, You may notice small blisters (bulla or vesicles) appear approximately 6 to 48 hours after other symptoms emerge.If the blisters break open and become ulcers, you'll see that they're filled with straw-colored liquid. Look for more blisters on the lips, mouth, eyes, tongue and other parts of your body. You may feel a tingling sensation in the area before a blister appears. However you may have no blisters or symptoms at all.


On women, blisters can appear on the labia, vagina, anus, cervix, buttocks and thighs. Ulcers usually heal within 7 to 14 days.
On men, blisters generally appear on the scrotum, penis, buttocks and thighs.

, During an outbreak, urinating can be very painful. If you're having trouble emptying your bladder during an outbreak, as some women report, get medical attention.Women should also look for non-specific vaginal discharge (any unnatural or unusual discharge that you're not used to). It may be clear, white, or off-white pale and may also have an odor, although this is different from woman to woman.


Keep in mind that vaginal discharge is not a diagnosing symptom for herpes, but it is a possible symptom that, along with other symptoms, may help diagnose herpes., It's important to know that routine STD tests do not test for herpes, so you will need to specifically ask for a herpes test. If you're currently experiencing an outbreak, the doctor can conduct a swab test, where a sterile swab is dabbed gently on the sore and sent to a lab for testing. Your doctor can use the culture to test for herpes. Your initial tests might include lab and imaging tests. If you are not having an outbreak, you will need a blood test. However this test is best administered 3-4 months after exposure to herpes, since it tests for antibodies (your immune system's response to infection). Usually the diagnosis is through a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based swab test. A synthetic swab is rubbed vigorously over abnormal skin, placed in a liquid and sent to the lab. Then, using specialized laboratory techniques, the sample is amplified many times to see if the patient has herpes.
In some cases you doctor could do a herpes type-specific antibody test. This test uses an antibody to specifically target and determine whether the infection is HSV-1 or HSV-2. 50% of infected individuals usually test positive within 3 weeks after infection. If you've been infected for more than 16 weeks, this test will almost always prove positive.
Your doctor may also consider a PCR swab of lesion test. A sterile swab is used to vigorously swab the base of the lesion— applying enough pressure to collect epithelial cells without causing bleeding—and collect vesicular fluid. This is then sent to the lab for diagnosis.

, If you test positive for herpes, your doctor will prescribe medications help to suppress the virus and its symptoms. Medication also reduces the risk of spreading the herpes simplex virus to others. Start treatment immediately or as soon as possible and take them according to your doctor's directions. Antiviral herpes medications include:Acyclovir. This is a first-line drug for genital lesions or frequent lesions on the labia from herpes. It can also be used topically to treat inflammation on eyes infected with herpes. Acyclovir is considered fairly safe in pregnant and nursing women and it's also used for pediatric cases.
Penciclovir. This is a cream that is used as a first-line medication to treat oral lesions topically.
Valacyclovir. This is a first-line medication used to treat primary and recurrent genital herpes.
Foscarnet. This is considered a second-line medication and is used when there is a resistance to the preferred first-line medication acyclovir. This can happen in immunocompromised individuals suffering from a systemic herpes infection., Read up on herpes and learn about the virus and the infection. The more you understand about what is going on in your body, the easier it will be to cope and deal with flare-ups and breakouts. Herpes is well-documented and highly-researched. There is ongoing research in this area and new treatments may on the way.


Your doctor will also have many recommendations and can keep you up to date on the latest medications available to you.

, Take time to explain your condition to your sexual partners before you engage in behaviour that could transmit herpes -- this talk can be combined with a sexual health talk. Take precautionary measures to avoid further spreading the virus. These may come from lifestyle changes. For example, learn to recognise early signs of an outbreak, and consider exploring sexual practices that will not involve your outbreak site during these times. Use a condom in-between outbreaks.If you touch a herpes sore, particularly when you are newly diagnosed, wash your hands with soap and water - your body will not possess antibodies for a few months and you could accidentally spread it to your eyes or mouth. If you have an active cold sore on your mouth, don't kiss anyone., Realize that many people with genital herpes live without symptoms for a long period of time. Using high risk factors to determine your need for a test can help with early treatment. Factors that increase your risk of getting herpes include:


Immunocompromised states. A compromised immune system on its own won't give you herpes, but it will make it harder for your body to protect itself and fight an infection or breakout. Illness, stress, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and even old age can be factors may make you more vulnerable to infection by the herpes HSV-1/HSV-2 virus.
Atopic eczema in children (also known as atopic dermatitis). Eczema is a common itchy skin disorder, but if eczema skin is infected with herpes, it can lead to a serious skin condition.
Occupational workplace exposure. Some professions that are exposed to the virus may be at higher risk of getting herpes. For example, dental health providers are at higher risk of contracting HSV-1, resulting in a extremely painful infection of the hand., Condoms help reduce, but do not eliminate the risk. Sexual activity places you at the highest risk of getting HSV-2 and HSV-1. But, even protected sex can spread herpes, especially during an outbreak, though it can still be spread if there are no symptoms. Herpes is spread across the moist linings (mucosal areas) of the skin, so oral, anal, penile and vaginal openings are at greatest risk for transferring the disease. When any infected area of one person comes into contact with another mucosal area of an uninfected person, the disease may be transmitted.


Types of contact that can easily spread herpes include: kissing, oral sex, anal sex, and vaginal sex (or any combination of these where the mucosal membranes come into contact with each other).

, Since herpes can be contracted orally and through genital contact, your chances of getting the disease increase with the number of sexual partners you have. The more partners you have, the higher your risk of getting genital herpes.However, contracting herpes does not mean someone necessarily had sex with many partners; you can get it from one person, one time. Also, many people contract HSV-1 on their mouths when they are in elementary school, or from kissing relatives when they are young.

, Women are more prone to get herpes because it's transferred more easily from men to women than from women to men.For example, women have a 20.3% infection rate for HSV-2 versus a 10.6% rate among men.According to The Center for Disease Control, 1 in 6 people in the U.S. between 14 and 49 years old has genital herpes."

Familiarize yourself with the law.Nowhere in the United States are medical professionals required by law to inform the parents of minors of STD tests, but there are many states that allow them to notify parents without a minor's consent if they wish, usually if they feel it's in the best interest of the minor.,
Ask a trusted friend or adult to accompany you.",How to Get Tested for STDs Without Letting Your Parents Know," At some clinics you can just drop in for an appointment, and at other clinics you may have to make an appointment. Call ahead or visit their website and make an appointment if necessary. Provide as much detail as you can about your concerns. You want the health professionals to be able to help to the best of their ability.


Also find out if you will have to pay for the testing and/or treatments, and how much that may cost.
In most cases, you won't want to use health insurance to pay for these tests, as your parents will usually get a bill for the services. This would alert them to some of the details of your visit, such as what tests were done or what medications were prescribed.;
, Your doctor may want to know about any prior diseases or surgeries you have had. They may want to know if any diseases run in your family. Providing a clear detailed history will help the health professional give you the best help they can. Be honest about any STDs you may have had in the past or that your sexual partner may have.

, Write down all of the medications you are currently taking or have recently stopped taking. Include dose and frequency. This information is helpful in the diagnosis process and can provide additional helpful information. Make sure you include vitamins and supplements, too.


Share any allergies you have as well.

, Depending on the procedures at a given clinic, your sample might be collected through a urine sample, a swab from the mouth or genital area, or a blood sample.You can ask ahead of time, when you call for information, how the clinic of your choice administers its tests.

, Be as clear as possible that you don’t want your parents to find out about your test. Make sure that the staff at the clinic will not accidentally call your house to deliver your results, or send them to your house through the mail. Ask the staff to make a note of such details in your file in order to prevent accidents.Also make sure your parents won't receive a bill for the testing or treatment.

, Tell the doctor or nurse about how you are feeling about the testing or your health. They are there to help both your body and mind. Express concerns about depression or fear if you have them. They will be able to help or provide additional resources.

, Be prepared to answer some very invasive questions about your sexual history, but know that they’re not asking these questions to judge you. They need that information to make the best decisions about your testing and health. Furthermore, there’s nothing you’ve done that they haven’t heard before, so be perfectly honest in all of the answers you give to their questions.


Also be prepared that they may need the names of your sexual partners, especially if any of your tests are positive.

, The best way to deal with your situation and to prevent future mishaps is to educate yourself. Before the test begins, ask them to walk you through the process before they begin to set your mind at ease. It’s easier to stay calm when you know exactly what will happen., The wait-time on the test results will vary based on what diseases they’re testing for and the backlog in the clinic’s laboratory, so ask how long you’ll have to wait to hear back from them., Don’t put your house number down for the result delivery. Give them your cell phone number, or that of a friend or trusted relative (with his or her permission, of course) if you don’t want to risk your parents picking up your cell phone. If the clinic staff doesn’t like that idea, ask them to wait for you to call them for your results, rather than them contacting you.


It may also be possible for you to access your results online.

, Look for testing sites that are open and encouraging to patients under 18 years of age. The medical workers at these clinics will be less likely to notify your parents if you live in an area where they are allowed to do so. If you want to be absolutely sure that your parents cannot find out that you had an STD test, you should call your local facilities and ask whether or not they receive Federal Title X funds, as Title X organizations must provide confidential services to minors.


Planned Parenthood is a Title X organization that is committed to the confidentiality of minors.You can find other providers in your area through the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Many clinics, such as Planned Parenthood, offer STD testing free of charge, but others charge a fee. Make sure you know whether or not you need to pay for this service at your clinic of choice and how much it might cost.
The exception to confidentiality is if the teenager is a victim of child abuse or sexual abuse, or if the patient is posing a threat to others.

,


Note that all clinics that receive Federal Title X funds are required to provide confidential services to minors.The states that allow medical officials to notify parents of STD tests administered to minors without needing their consent are: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas.
The states in which you must be 14 or older to consent to an STD test are: Hawaii, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Washington.
South Carolina allows STD test consent for “mature minors 15 and younger and all minors 16 and older.”

In fact, some recent research has shown that the gap between life expectancy between people with or without HIV or AIDS is smaller than ever. This means that though you will have to be making some changes, your life is not over. This will most likely be the worst news you have ever received, but if you work on adjusting your attitude, then you can get through it. According to the study, the average person with HIV in North America lives to be 63, while the average positive gay male lives to 77. Of course, this depends on a number of factors, such as preexisting conditions, the strain of the virus, the transition from HIV to AIDS, and the diligence in taking medication and reactions to the medication.Back when Magic Johnson found out he was HIV positive in 1991, many people thought it meant that his life was nearly over. Well, over twenty years later, he's still living a healthy, normal, and an incredibly inspiring life.;
, Don't expect to get a new lease on life in the next few weeks, realizing that you've been living life the wrong way and that you have to turn everything around to find real happiness. You won't be a ray of sunshine. You may not be impressing your friends and family with your ability to stay positive during this difficult time. But after giving yourself time to see that your life isn't over, to let the idea that you are positive sink in, you will feel better. Unfortunately, there's no magic number (three weeks! three months!) that can tell you when you will begin to feel ""normal"" again, but if you stay patient with yourself, you will feel better.

That's not to say that you shouldn't immediately seek treatment once you find out that you are positive. It just means that you should be patient with yourself mentally.

, There are many ways to contract HIV, the most common of which are sex, sharing needles, being the child of a positive mother, or coming into contact with the blood of a person with HIV, which can happen more commonly in the medical profession. If you contracted AIDS through reckless behavior and now blame yourself for it, you have to let go of that. Maybe you had sex with someone you shouldn't have had sex with, maybe you shared needles you shouldn't have shared -- whatever you did, that was in the past, and all you can do is move forward from it.

If you did get AIDS through reckless behavior, it is important to come to terms with whatever it is you did, but once you do, you have to move on from it. There's no point in saying ""coulda, shoulda, woulda…"" because that won't affect you in the present.

, Another way to feel mentally stronger is to tell the people who care about you about your condition, from your close friends to your family members. (It's also incredibly important to tell your current or previous sexual partners: more on that later.) Be prepared for the people to feel angry, afraid, or confused, just as you did when you found out about your condition. Telling them initially won't be easy, but if they do care about you, they will be on your side, and having people to talk to about your condition will make you feel much better in the long run.If you plan on telling a close friend or family member, then you have to make a game plan about telling them instead of springing it on them. Pick a time and place where you can have privacy and the opportunity to really talk, and be prepared with health information and whatever answers you can give, because it's likely that you will be faced with a lot of questions.
Though you may feel so upset that you can't possibly share your situation with anyone, it's important to tell a friend or family member as soon as you can, so that you have at least someone who can vouch for you in the event of a medical emergency.
Know that you are not legally obligated to tell your boss or coworkers about your positive status unless it interferes with your ability to do the job. Unfortunately, you cannot be deployed if you have HIV or AIDS if you are in the armed services in certain countries, so you will have to inform your bosses in that case.

, Though getting support from your loved ones can go a long way in helping you find mental strength, sometimes you may want to find support from other people who are going through the same struggle you are facing, or people who are well-informed about your condition. Here are some other places where you can find support:Call the National AIDS Hotline (800-CDC-INFO). This hotline is operational 24 hours a day and can provide you with someone who can help you feel stronger and arm you with knowledge.
Find a support group in your area. For example, UCSF's Alliance Health Project offers many support groups for people who are positive; these groups are tailored for the stage of the experience, whether you're a new positive or have been living with AIDS for years.You can also check out this helpful site from the Health Resources and Services Administration that can help you find clinics, hospitals, and other HIV/AIDS services in your area.
If you're not ready to openly talk with other people yet, go online to find people like you. Find a helpful site like the Poz Forums, and talk to other positive people online., If you already have a strong relationship with your faith, then this is a great thing to turn to during a difficult time. If you're not religious, it may not be the time to suddenly start going to church (though anything can help), but if you already have a religious background, you can try to attend services more often, be more active in your religious community, and find comfort in the thought of a higher power, or a meaning greater than the sum of the parts of your own life., Unfortunately, many people have preconceived notions of what it means to have AIDS or HIV. They can judge you for thinking that you must have done something wrong if you got HIV or AIDS. They can be afraid of being near you because they'll think that they can contract the disease just from breathing your air. If you want to stay tough, then you can't let these people get to you. Get as knowledgeable as you can about AIDS or HIV so you can set the record straight with these people, or if they're just haters who don't want to hear it, remove yourself from the situation.

You're too busy worrying about your own well-being to care what other people think, right?

, It's perfectly normal to feel severe depression after you get your diagnosis. It's obviously a life-altering piece of news that even the most thick-skinned people would have trouble dealing with, so you may need some more help than your friends or loved ones, or even support groups, can provide. Having someone to talk to about your situation who is not close to you can help offer an alternative perspective and make you feel more in touch with your situation., If you find out that you have AIDS or HIV, then it is incredibly important to tell your doctor as soon as you can and to start treatment (if your doctor isn't the person who told you, of course). The sooner you get treatment, the better you'll feel, and the stronger and less susceptible your body will be to disease. Once you tell your doctor, it is very important to see an HIV/AIDS specialist. If your doctor is not a specialist in HIV/AIDS, then he must refer you to one so you can begin treatment., Your doctor won't just throw a cocktail of drugs at you and tell you to go home. He'll run a series of tests to see exactly what your body needs before you get correct treatment. Here's what the tests will include:Your CD4 count. These cells are a type of white blood cell that is destroyed by HIV. A healthy person's count varies from 500 - over 1,000. If you have fewer than 200 CD4 cells, then your HIV has progressed to AIDS.
Your viral load. In general, the higher the amount of virus in your blood, the worse you may fare.
Your resistance to drugs. There are different strains of HIV, and it's important to see if yours will be resistant to some anti-HIV medications. This can help you find the medication that will work best for you.
Testing for complications or infections. Your doctor may also require you to take tests for other conditions that can help you see if you also have other STDs, hepatitis, liver or kidney damage, or other conditions that would make treatment more complicated.

, You should start following your doctor's orders and take your medication if you have severe symptoms, a CD4 count under 500, are pregnant, or have kidney disease. Though you can't cure your HIV or AIDS, using a combination of drugs can help block the virus; having a combination ensures that you aren't immune to all of the drugs you are given. You will most likely have to take several pills at different times of the day for the rest of your life, once you find the best combination for yourself.Do not stop taking your medication on your own under any circumstances. If you have incredibly bad reactions to your medication, talk to your doctor about it immediately and see what course you should take. If you stop treatment on your own, however, this can have drastic consequences (much worse than you may be feeling).Your medication may include transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which disable the protein HIV uses to copy itself, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which are faulty versions of building blocks used by HIV to replicate itself, protease inhibitors (PIs), another protein HIV uses for replication, entry or fusion inhibitors, which block HIV from entering your CD4 cells, and integrase inhibitors, which are a protein used by HIV to insert genetic material into your CD4 cells.

, Unfortunately, the side-effects of the medication can be unpleasant, but if you find that a combination is really not working for you, you can talk to your doctor about making adjustments. It's better to be mentally prepared for some of the physical symptoms that you may feel. Know, however, that it does vary from person to person; some may have severe symptoms, while others may feel almost no pain at all for many years. Here are some symptoms you may feel:Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Abnormal heartbeats
Shortness of breath
Rashes
Weakened bones
Nightmares
Memory loss

, You should test your viral load at the start of your treatment, and then during every 3-4 months during your treatment. You should also check in on that CD4 blood count every 3-6 months. Yeah, if you do the math, that does add up to a lot of doctor's visits every year. But this is what you have to do if you want to make sure the treatment is working and to live with HIV or AIDS as best as you can.If the medication is doing its job, then your viral load should become undetectable. This does not mean you have cured your HIV, or that you can no longer transmit it to others. It does mean that your body is in better shape, though.

, If you are HIV or AIDS positive, then you have to take extra precautions when you're around other people. Yes, you can still hug the people you love, casually touch people, and live a relatively normal existence, but you may have to take extra precautions, such as always using condoms during sex, and not sharing needles to generally be more conscious around other people.If you know that you have AIDS or HIV and sleep with a person without telling him or her that, then you are breaking the law.

, It's important to tell anyone you have slept with after you were diagnosed, anyone you are currently sleeping with, and yeah, any future romantic possibilities.It will be unpleasant, but if you want to protect the safety of anyone you've been with, you absolutely have to take this precaution. There are even websites that can help you tell the person anonymously if you've had casual sex or really just don't want to talk to that person.It's important to get that information out there, because many people are unaware of their HIV positive status., A healthy diet can help almost any situation, including your HIV or AIDS positive status. Healthy foods help keep your body and immune system strong, and will give you more energy to face your daily tasks. So, make sure to eat at least three healthy meals a day, which include healthy carbs, proteins, and fruits and vegetables. Eat snacks whenever you're hungry and don't skip meals, especially not breakfast. The right diet can also help you process your medications and get the nutrients your body needs.Some great foods include lean proteins, whole grains, and legumes.
There are also certain foods that you should avoid because they can cause illnesses that will be more severe because of your positive status. These foods include sushi, sashimi, oysters, unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs, or raw meat.

, Getting regular shots against pneumonia or the flu can help you stay healthy. Your body will be more prone to these diseases, so it's important to take precautions against them. Just make sure that the vaccines don't actually contain live viruses, or that can make you more susceptible to the diseases., It's all about maintaining a healthy lifestyle that can help you stay strong and make you less susceptible to disease, which can lead to complications because of your HIV status. So, make sure to get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether you're running, doing yoga, biking, or power walking with your friends. This may sound irrelevant when you're facing an AIDS diagnosis, but it will make you feel better, both mentally and physically.If you really want your body to be as healthy as possible, then you can quit smoking and minimize your alcohol habits (or even quit all together, as it will not mix with many medications). Smoking can make you more prone to diseases normally associated with smoking if you have HIV.
It's perfectly normal to feel depression after an HIV or AIDS diagnosis. Exercise won't cure that, but it can help you feel happier for sure.

, If you're in the unfortunate situation where your HIV or AIDS symptoms are so severe that you can no longer work, then you should see if you qualify for employer paid disability, or government sponsored disability, such as Social Security (in the United States) or Statutory Sick Pay, Employment and Support Allowance, or Disability Living Allowance (if you're in the UK).

To qualify for disability, you have to prove that you have HIV/AIDS and prove that you are too sick to work.
For more information about the benefits your government can offer, you can contact the legal services in your county, call an AIDS hotline, or visit the government's websites about disability insurance."

The severity of the rash varies from patient to patient. Some get a very severe rash that covers a large area, while others only have a minor rash.If the HIV rash is the result of antiviral medications, the rash will appear as raised reddish lesions that cover your whole body. These rashes are called “drug eruptions”.;
, This is usually where the HIV rash shows up on your body. However, the rash tends to disappear by itself within a few weeks. Some people mistake it for an allergic reaction or eczema.HIV rash is not transmittable, so there is no risk of spreading HIV via this rash., These include:Nausea and vomiting
Mouth sores
Fever
Diarrhea
Muscle pain
Cramps and body aches
Enlargement of your glands
Blurred or hazy vision
Loss of appetite
Joint pain

, This rash occurs due to the fall in the number of white blood cells (WBC) in your body. HIV rash can occur at any stage of infection but generally, you notice it two to threes weeks after you have contracted the virus. This phase is called seroconversion, which is when the infection becomes detectable via a blood test. Some people may skip this phase and develop HIV rash in the later stages of having the virus.HIV rash can also be caused by an adverse reaction to anti-HIV medicines. Drugs like Amprenavir, abacavir, and nevirapine can cause HIV skin rashes.During the third phrase of HIV infection, you can develop skin rashes due to dermatitis. This type of HIV rash appears pink or reddish and are itchy. It can last from one to three years and is usually found on your groin, underarms, chest, face, and back areas.
You can also get HIV rashes if you have Herpes and are HIV-positive.

, If you have not already been tested for HIV, your doctor should perform a blood test to check if you have the virus. If you are negative, your doctor will then determine if your rash is from an allergic reaction to food or other factors. You may also have a skin issue like eczema.


If you are HIV positive, your doctor will likely prescribe anti-HIV medication and treatment.If you are already on anti-HIV medication and the rash is mild, your doctor will tell you to continue taking the medication as the rash should go away after one to two weeks.
To reduce the rash, especially the itching, your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine, such as Benadryl or Atarax, or a corticosteroid-based cream., Your severe rash may also appear along with other symptoms of the virus, such as fever, nausea or vomiting, muscle pain, and mouth sores. If you haven’t already been tested for the HIV, your doctor should perform a blood test to check if you have HIV. Based on the results of your blood test, your doctor will then prescribe anti-HIV medication and treatment., You may develop hypersensitivity to certain medications and your HIV symptoms, including your HIV rash, may get worse. Your doctor should advise you to stop taking the medication and provide alternative medications you can take. The hypersensitivity symptoms usually disappear in 24-48 hours.There are three main classes of anti-HIV drugs that can cause skin rashes:NNRTIs
NRTIs
PIs
NNRTIs, such as nevirapine (Viramune) are the most common cause of medication skin rashes. Abacavir (Ziagen) is an NRTI drug that can cause skin rashes. PIs like amprenavir (Agenerase) and tipranavir (Aptivus) can also cause rashes.

, If your doctor advises you to stop a certain medicine due to hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction, do not take it again. By taking it again, you run the risk of causing an even more severe reaction that could progress and make your condition much worse., People with HIV have an increased incidence of bacterial infection due to abnormalities in immune cell function. Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is prevalent among those who are HIV-positive,which may lead to impetigo, inflamed hair follicles, boils, cellulitis, abscesses, and ulcerations.If you have HIV, you may want your doctor to test for MRSA.

, Your doctor may prescribe anti allergy creams or medication to help with any discomfort or itching. You can also buy over-the-counter antihistamine cream to help with these symptoms. Apply the cream as directed on the package., These are both triggering factors for HIV rashes, and can make your HIV rash worse.If you are going to go outside, apply sunscreen to your body to protect your skin or wear long sleeves and pants.
Wear a coat and warm clothing when going outside to avoid exposing your skin to extreme cold.

, Hot water will irritate your rash. Skip the hot baths or showers and go for a cold water bath or sponge bath to soothe your skin.You can use lukewarm water and pat, rather than rub, at your skin in the shower or the bath. Apply an all natural moisturizer to your skin to help it heal, such as creams that contain coconut oil or aloe vera, as soon as you get out of the bath or shower. The top layer of your skin is like a sponge, so applying moisturizer once you have stimulated your pores will trap water inside your skin and prevent dryness., Look for mild soap, such as baby soap, or herbal body wash at your local drugstore.Avoid products that contain chemicals such as Petrolatum; Methyl-, Propyl-, Butyl-, Ethylparaben; and Propylene Glycol. These are all synthetic ingredients that can irritate your skin or cause an allergic reaction.You can also make your own herbal body wash with natural moisturizers like olive oil, aloe vera, and almond oil.Be sure to apply all natural moisturizer right after your bath or shower and throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated.

, Clothing made of synthetic or non breathable fibers can cause you to sweat and make your skin more irritated.Tight clothing can also rub against your skin and worsen the HIV rash.

Recognize the symptoms of a herpes outbreak.,
Consider avoiding sex during an outbreak.,
Use condoms or dental dams.,
Refrain from touching herpes sores.,
Be open to different types of sexual activity.",How to Have Sex with Someone with Herpes1," If your partner has genital herpes, they can be contagious at all times; however, the risk of infection is highest when your partner is having an outbreak. It's important that you and your partner both know how to recognize a herpes outbreak.Symptoms include the following:


A tingling sensation in the infected area
Small red dots or blisters around the genitals
Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, muscle aches, fevers, and swollen glands;
, Your partner will be most likely to pass on the infection to you during an outbreak. If you want to avoid becoming infected yourself, talk to your partner about avoiding sexual activity during an outbreak. The duration of outbreaks depend on how long your partner has had the virus and whether they are on any antiviral medications. On average, outbreaks last three to 14 days., Using condoms or dental dams during sex can reduce the transmission rates of genital herpes. Keep in mind herpes can affect parts of the skin not covered by a condom or dental dam so such protective methods do not completely eliminate the risk.


Be aware that herpes can be spread by both vaginal or anal sex.
Use of latex condoms can greatly cut down on transmission rates of genital herpes. Transmission rates are reduced by 30 – 50% when latex condoms are used properly.Dental dams may not provide as much protection as condoms but can still be effective at preventing the spread of herpes.Herpes can be spread through oral sex. Both the giver or the receiver of oral sex can contract herpes during the act; therefore, to be safe, you should also use condoms or dental dams during oral sex if you want to prevent the virus from spreading.Consider using lubricants. They will not protect against STDs, but can reduce friction and therefore limit the number of outbreaks. Lubrication will also help keep condoms from breaking during use. Products like KY jelly or AstroGlide are available at most drug stores., Herpes can also be spread from skin-to-skin contact. If you're engaging in genital stimulation with your hands, be careful to avoid touching herpes sores if your partner is having an outbreak.


Wash your hands immediately using soap and warm water after coming into physical contact with herpes sores to prevent herpes transmission., You may not be comfortable with genital-to-genital contact if your partner has genital herpes. That's okay. There are many other ways to have a fulfilling sex life with your partner even if you're refraining from certain sexual activities. Activities like mutual masturbation do not pose a transmission risk. You could also consider genital stimulation via hand, as long as you wash your hands shortly after contact. Experiment with your partner with alternative sexual practices. Be creative and find out what feels right for the two of you.If you share sex toys, make sure you thoroughly clean the toys or use fresh condoms after use. This can prevent the spread of the herpes virus."
"
Ask your partner to make an appointment with a doctor.,
Ask your partner to take medication.,
Have a frank discussion with your partner.,
Help them find herpes support groups.,
Get tested regularly together.",How to Have Sex with Someone with Herpes2," If you're worried about the disease spreading, having your partner talk to their doctor. Your partner's doctor can recommend treatment options that lessen the likelihood of an outbreak spreading.


Be respectful of your partner when suggesting they see a doctor. Talking about herpes can be embarrassing and stressful; however, your partner told you about their infection because they care about your health.
Explain to your partner you want to make sure the two of you have as fulfilling a sex life as possible. You feel a doctor may be able to suggest medications or other treatment options that can lessen the likelihood of the virus being transmitted.
You can say something like, ""I like you and I really want to have sex with you, but I want to make sure we both stay healthy and safe. What would you think about talking with your doctor about the best way for us to have fun and stay safe?""

, Antiviral medications can be used to manage a herpes infection. When used properly, these medications reduce the risk of transmission.


Your doctor can prescribe antiviral pills. Some people take the medication every day, but if your partner's outbreaks are rare, their doctor may recommend your partner only take the medication during outbreaks.Medication is not the proper course of treatment for everyone with herpes. Only a qualified medical doctor will be able to tell your partner if medication is the right choice for them., If your partner has genital herpes, the two of you need to have a discussion about your sex life. You need to establish sexual boundaries with your partner if they have herpes.


Stay calm during the conversation and try to keep things in perspective. Keep in mind that herpes comes with few health risks beyond irritation and many couples engage in sexual activity for years without spreading the virus.Be transparent with your partner about your expectations. You may prefer to only have sex using condoms or to avoid sex during outbreaks. If you can foresee a long-term relationship with your partner, you may be less worried about transmitting the virus., Having herpes comes with a certain amount of stigma. Your partner may need to find someone to talk to about the virus. You can help them find support groups online or in your local community.

, Couples should regularly get tested for STDs, especially if one partner has a condition like herpes. Make an agreement to get tested once every few months together. There are usually free or discount clinics in most cities for STD testing.

Knowing which type of herpes virus she has will help you determine what behaviors can lower your risk of disease transmission if you decide to continue your relationship. The more facts you have about the specifics of the herpes virus that she carries, the better off you will be.;
, If you are in a relationship with a woman who has herpes, you will want to learn about the virus. A simple Google search will help you start learning about the virus, but be cautious that you are obtaining your information from reputable internet sources. Educating yourself about the severity and the perpetuity of the herpes virus will help you make the right decisions regarding sexual activity in your relationship.


While herpes can be uncomfortable, the infection is generally not dangerous in healthy adults.It will likely be relieving to know that herpes is not as serious as it may seem at first and that it is relatively rare for adults to have any serious health problems as a result of herpes.It is also important to understand that as of yet, there is no cure for herpes.However, this STD can be effectively managed through prescription antiviral medications., Part of the importance of identifying which virus is causing a herpes infection is determining how it can be spread to others. Specifically, you will want to know what sorts of behaviors will put you at risk for contracting the herpes virus.


HSV-1 is spread through saliva, meaning that kissing, eating from the same utensils, sharing the same glass, or sharing personal items (such as chapstick or a towel) can spread the virus from her to you.In contrast, HSV-2 is sexually transmitted, meaning that it is usually spread through sexual contact., Herpes is an incredibly contagious virus; it is at its most contagious during an active infection. You can get the herpes virus simply from touching a herpes sore during a person’s outbreak.Herpes is so contagious that it can even be transmitted to a newborn during birth if the mother is experiencing an active infection.It is important to recognize the contagious nature of this STD and realize that by engaging in a relationship with someone that has herpes, you are putting yourself at risk, even if you take as many precautions as possible.

, While the classification of herpes as a sexually transmitted disease can make it sound rare and serious, approximately 20% of adults in the United States carry HSV-2, the virus that causes genital herpes, while up to 85% of adults have been infected with HSV-1 by the time they are in their 60s.It is important to recognize that having herpes does not necessarily mean that the woman you want to date has had many sexual partners, but instead that it could be a result of many other factors.


Everyone is at risk for HSV-1.You should not be too taken aback if the woman you are dating has HSV-1, because there is a significant chance that you may be a carrier of it as well.
People who are more likely to have HSV-2 are female, have (or had) another sexually transmitted disease, or have a weakened immune system due to disease or medicine., If you are with a partner who has herpes, it is important to know if you are a carrier of the virus yourself, or if you have managed to avoid contracting it.Getting tested is critical especially because many people who have herpes do not know they have it, so you may be a carrier (meaning that the virus is dormant) even if you have no symptoms.


A simple blood test can tell you whether you are a carrier of either herpes virus. You can get this test at a Planned Parenthood center, other health clinics, or private health care providers (such as your general practitioner, or GP).Both you and your partner should get tested for STDs before beginning a sexual relationship to make sure that neither of you have any other infections that can be transmitted through sexual intimacy.

, If you decide to have intimate relations with someone who has herpes, there are certain precautions you should take to reduce the potential of contracting the disease. These precautions include:Wear latex condoms. Condoms help to prevent the transmission of the herpes virus between outbreaks. However, even a condom will not prevent transmission of disease during an active outbreak.
Avoid sexual relations before, during, and after outbreaks. If your partner feels something coming on, it is best to avoid sexual relations and do so until seven days after the sore heals.Never touch any herpes sores. If you do, wash your hands immediately with warm water and soap., There are daily suppressive medicines (for example, Acyclovir, Famciclovir, Valacyclovir, and Valtrex) that can be used to treat herpes outbreaks caused by both HSV-1 and HSV-2.These medicines can lessen the frequency of active outbreaks and can also significantly reduce the risk of transmission.In order to get a prescription for these medications, the woman you are dating will have to visit her family doctor, GP, or gynecologist who will evaluate her to see if she is a candidate for these antiviral medicines.

, While HSV-1 is the harder of the two forms of the virus to avoid, it is possible to avoid exposure to HSV-2. The only way to completely avoid becoming infected with herpes (HSV-2) is to completely avoid sexual contact because even when your partner is not experiencing an outbreak, there is still a 4-10% chance of her transmitting the disease to you.You may want to try alternate forms of sexual intimacy to completely avoid the HSV-2 virus. You will want to avoid genital-genital or genital-oral contact, but can try an activity such as mutual masturbation., If you know your partner has herpes, she has already had to admit it to you. Because herpes (and in particular, genital herpes) has such a significant social stigma, admitting this is usually quite embarrassing.By admitting that she has herpes, your partner is showing how considerate and caring she is.Regardless of whether or not you choose to continue your relationship with her, you should express your appreciation that she was open and honest with you regarding her STD.

, You may be so enthralled with your partner that you are willing to overlook the fact that she has herpes and accept the risk of transmission, or you may become extremely uncomfortable with the idea of having sex with someone who has an STD. You are entitled to your feelings, but it is crucial that you communicate these feelings with your partner so that she knows where you stand in your relationship.


Take the time to think about how herpes may affect your relationship. You can consider the ways you can be intimate without risking infection, or you can think about ways that you can engage in a sexual relationship while reducing the risk of transmission., When you are properly armed with facts regarding the herpes virus, how it affects the woman you are dating, and how it will influence your dating experience, you are more prepared to make a decision regarding continuing your relationship. Each person will have a unique perspective on dating someone with herpes; there is no right or wrong way to approach your relationship. However, you will definitely want to have a frank and honest conversation with her where you can express your worries and concerns and hear her opinion on if and how her herpes will affect your relationship.

, When your partner told you that she was infected with herpes, she demonstrated her willingness and ability to have an open and honest relationship with you that focuses on strong communication. Strong and healthy relationships are built around good communication, so use her example and be open and honest with her about your own life.


While you may not have experience with an STD like she does, you undoubtedly have aspects of your personal life that you don’t tell many people. She has opened up to you about one important aspect of her life, and it may strengthen your relationship if you do the same.
Keep her trust. While she has informed you that she is herpes-positive, it is not your place to tell anyone else without her explicit permission. Show her that you value her openness, and maintain her trust by keeping her herpes status between the two of you.

, Dating a girl with herpes will have no effect on your dating life outside of sexual intimacy and sharing of personal items. You should treat a herpes-positive woman just as you would treat any other woman. Take her out on special dates, surprise her with her favorite flowers, and let her know how special she is to you.

, Kissing, cuddling, and fondling are safe activities with a partner who has genital herpes, while cuddling, massages, and holding hands are safe activities with a partner who has oral herpes"

Avoid talking about STIs when you or your date are tired, in a rush, or otherwise distracted., Bring up the topic when you are in a quiet and private location. Make sure you have time to discuss details if necessary.Try saying, “I was tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and HIV six months ago. When was the last time you were tested?” It is important to know if and when your date has been tested. Frequent testing (every three to six months) is recommended if you often have new sexual partners.If you have an STI, be sure to talk to your date about it. Prepare to explain accurate information. Know the risks for your sexual partner and learn of ways to prevent the passing of infections.

, Regardless of whether you or your date have an STI, you may want to use barriers as an extra safety precaution. There are many physical barriers that can be used during oral, vaginal, or anal sex to avoid the passing of disease through bodily fluids.Common physical barriers include the male condom, the female condom, and dental dams. All are effective for preventing the spread of STIs.Decide on what method you are most comfortable using and check with your date.


Condoms are commonly used as barriers for oral, vaginal, and anal sex. They are fairly easy to use, safe, and effective when used properly. Use condoms every single time you have sex. You must use condoms (and other physical barriers) for the full duration of skin to skin contact. Do not wait to put a condom on after you have already started having sex, and do not remove a condom before you are finished having sex.Note that physical barriers do not always protect against the passing of STIs. Some STIs can be passed via contact with skin or saliva. Condoms, for example, do not fully cover areas which may be affected by and STI, and are, therefore, not 100% effective."

Discuss non-hormonal contraception.,
Discuss hormonal contraception.,
Discuss backup options in case the contraception fails.",How to Discuss Safe Sex on a First Date3," If you do not want to have a child, you and your date should discuss ways to avoid pregnancy. Non-hormonal contraception prevents sperm from fertilizing the egg without introducing hormones into the female body. Spermicides, sponges, and condoms are all examples of non-hormonal contraceptives. Male condoms are widely used, relatively cheap, and easy to find. They are 97% effective against pregnancy and can also protect against sexually transmitted diseases or infections.Ask your date if they have a preference for a certain type of non-hormonal contraceptive method.


Try saying, “I’ve got spermicide, does that work for you?” You may agree or disagree with your date’s suggestion. Be sure to communicate the method that feels most safe to you. You might say, “We can use spermicide, but I’d also like to use a condom because it provides a physical barrier.”

, Hormonal contraception is an option for women who feel comfortable introducing hormones into the body that block sperm from fertilizing an egg. Nearly all hormonal birth control methods are at least 99% effective when used consistently and correctly.Hormonal birth control is often used with a barrier method, like a condom, for extra protection against pregnancy.


Tell your date if you are already using hormonal contraception. This can serve as reassurance for someone who is concerned about an unwanted pregnancy. You might say, “By the way, I’m on the pill, so we don’t have to worry too much about pregnancy.”
If you are man, consider asking your date if she is using any hormonal contraception. Try saying, “Hey, are you on any birth control? I was just wondering if there would be any backup so you don’t get pregnant.”

, Although birth control methods such as condoms and the pill can be very effective if used together, neither are 100% guaranteed to work. It may be appropriate to talk about what you would do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy.


If contraception fails, you can purchase an emergency contraception pill. Some emergency contraception pills can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex. You can also have an IUD (Intrauterine Device) inserted as emergency contraception.Emergency contraception can have risks if you have certain health problems. If you have health conditions that require you to avoid estrogen, you should search for a pill that is made only of progestin. You should not use emergency contraception if you know that you are pregnant."
"
Communicate what activities you like.,
Be clear about what you do not like.,
Discuss any toys or third parties.",How to Discuss Safe Sex on a First Date4," Everyone has different likes and dislikes during sex. If you do get to the topic of having sex on the first date, discuss what would be enjoyable for both of you. Be sure to discuss any unconventional activities that you would like to do. If they do come as a surprise to your date, it will be nice to have had a fair warning.

, Part of having safe sex is feeling comfortable with the person you are being intimate with. If there is anything that you are not comfortable doing, you should state that firmly to your partner. You might say, for example, “I want to have sex with you, but I do not want to give you oral sex. I just don’t feel comfortable doing that right now.”
Everyone differs on how, when, and where, they prefer sexual contact. It is important to be clear about any personal boundaries you have. Try saying, “Just so you know, I hate it when people touch my legs, so don’t go there.”

, Some people enjoy including things other than their date during sex. The use of sex toys can be discussed ahead of time so that both of you are on the same page. Similarly, including other people in the mix should be discussed and approved by everyone involved.

Healthcare workers and medical staff can be at risk of HIV transmission if there is an accidental injury from a contaminated needle or other sharp object, or if contaminated fluid has come in contact with a healthcare worker's open wound, eyes, or mouth.Workers in the sex industry are at high risk for contracting HIV from sexual contact without condoms and potential drug use with contaminated needles. If your partner has a history of sex work or has engaged in these risky activities, encourage them to seek HIV testing.;
, This may be a difficult conversation to have, but this honest conversation is important for your health and for the health of your partner.Determine the number of past partners your significant other has had. Start by asking, “How many partners have you had in the last year?”
Then determine if protection against STDs, like condoms, was used by asking, “Did you or the other person use protection every time?” If the answer is no, encourage them to get tested and ensure that you and your partner use protection every time.

, If your partner has a history of using or is presently using needles and syringes for intravenous drugs, including steroids, morphine, cocaine, heroin, and amphetamines, they are at high risk for contracting HIV and should seek testing., People with HIV/AIDS often live normal and otherwise healthy lives, but if they currently suffer from Hepatitis C virus, inflammation of the liver, they should also get tested for HIV.


Hepatitis C and HIV are both transmitted through unprotected sex and intravenous drug use. Both viruses often occur together, called co-infection. Eighty percent of intravenous drug users who have HIV will also have Hepatitis C., Currently in the United States, the risk of contracting HIV through a blood transfusion is very low due to stringent screening of all donor blood. If you are still concerned, ask your partner if they have been tested for HIV., The risk from contracting HIV from tattoos or piercings is low, but risk remains since both types of body modification are achieved by way of needles. If the facility that your partner received their tattoos and/or piercings did not use single-use instruments or sterilize their repeat-use equipment between customers, there is a chance for HIV infection., In contact sports, players might come into proximity of someone else's blood or bodily fluid through an open cut or sore. Though it is possible to come into contact with someone else’s body fluid in contact sports, the risk is minimal., Within four weeks of infection, 80% of people will exhibit flu-like symptoms, which most commonly include fever, sore throat, severe headaches, and a body rash. Less common symptoms include fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, ulcers in the mouth or on the genitals, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, and night sweats., If not treated during early-stage symptoms, the virus (HIV) will progress to immune deficiency (AIDS). These late stage-symptoms include rapid weight loss, recurring fevers, recurring sores in the mouth and on the genitals and anus, pneumonia, and chronic fatigue.

, If you suspect that you or your partner have been infected, don't wait for symptoms to surface to get tested, as some people might not ever show early-stage symptoms. You should especially seek testing if you do exhibit any of these symptoms after engaging in any risky behavior or accidentally coming into contact with contaminated fluids in your workplace.


HIV can take up to 3 months to develop antibodies, which means it can take up to 3 months to register on an antibody test. For a more immediate result, you can inquire about a RNA test, which is more expensive but it can detect the virus 9 to 11 days after infection.You can seek testing from your regular physician, and women can seek testing from their gynecologist.
If you do not have a regular practitioner that you see, or if you'd like to remain anonymous, you can seek testing at some Planned Parenthood clinics or you can use the AIDS.gov clinic locator., Since HIV spreads through body fluids, including vaginal fluid, semen, and rectal fluids, having sex without barriers, like condoms, exposes you and your partner to the virus. Use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how well you know your partner or how long you have been together., Any drug use through needles or syringes puts you at high risk for HIV infection. If you do use intravenous drugs, do not share needles with anyone and use only sterile drug injection equipment., If your job brings you in contact with contaminated needles and body fluids, be sure that you are thoroughly knowledgeable about your workplace's policies of gathering and disposing of contaminated matter. Adhere to the policies and procedures every single time because they are in place to protect you.

Understand the importance of HIV.,
Know what HIV resources are available in any given area.

,
Learn about your school's stand on sex education and involve yourself.",How to Educate Others on the Importance of HIV Awareness," In order to spread the message, it is important to know the facts. The basics are:


HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). It is preventable and treatable, but incurable. People can become infected with HIV through (1) unprotected sexual contact with an HIV-infected person (sex without the use of a male or female condom); (2) transmission from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding; and (3) blood from HIV-contaminated syringes, needles or other sharp instruments and transfusion with HIV-contaminated blood. It is not transmitted by casual contact or other means.
Anyone who wants to know how to prevent HIV or thinks he or she has HIV should contact a health-care provider or an AIDS centre to obtain information on HIV prevention and/or advice on where to receive HIV testing, counselling, care and support.
All pregnant women should talk to their health-care providers about HIV. All pregnant women who think they, their partners or family members are infected with HIV, have been exposed to HIV or live in a setting with a generalized HIV epidemic should get an HIV test and counselling to learn how to protect or care for themselves and their children, partners and family members.
All children born to HIV-positive mothers or to parents with symptoms, signs or conditions associated with HIV infection should be tested for HIV. If found to be HIV-positive, they should be referred for follow-up care and treatment and given loving care and support.
Parents or other caregivers should talk with their daughters and sons about relationships, sex and their vulnerability to HIV infection. Girls and young women are especially vulnerable to HIV infection. Girls and boys need to learn how to avoid, reject or defend themselves against sexual harassment, violence and peer pressure. They need to understand the importance of equality and respect in relationships.
Parents, teachers, peer leaders and other role models should provide adolescents with a safe environment and a range of life skills that can help them make healthy choices and practise healthy behaviour.
Children and adolescents should actively participate in making and implementing decisions on HIV prevention, care and support that affect them, their families and their communities.
Families affected by HIV may need income support and social welfare services to help them take care of sick family members and children. Families should be guided and assisted in accessing these services.
No child or adult living with or affected by HIV should ever be stigmatized or discriminated against. Parents, teachers and leaders have a key role to play in HIV education and prevention and in reducing fear, stigma and discrimination.
All people living with HIV should know their rights.;
,, In this instance, ignorance is not bliss."
"
Determine if you have HIV symptoms.,
Examine your past behavior for anything that may have exposed you to HIV.,
Protect your unborn child if you plan to get pregnant.",How to Get Tested for HIV1," If you have flu-like symptoms that last for a week or 2, and you don't recall being exposed to the influenza virus, you may have HIV. If you suspect your symptoms are from HIV, see your doctor.


Not everyone infected with HIV exhibits symptoms; some people infected with the virus may not exhibit symptoms for several years after exposure.;
, Certain behaviors increased your chances of being exposed to HIV. People who have injected drugs with needles shared with other drug users or who have unprotected sex with multiple partners or partners who themselves have had unprotected sex with other partners are at risk. Also at risk are people diagnosed with or treated for sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis or tuberculosis, as well as those who've had unprotected sex with someone so diagnosed.


If you've had unprotected sex, both you and your partner should get tested.
You cannot get HIV just from being around someone who has it, nor can you get it from someone else's sweat, saliva or tears or by sharing a closed-mouth kiss. Insect bites or stings do not transmit HIV, nor can you get it from donating blood, as the needles used for blood donations are not reused.

, Drugs are available to prevent a pregnant woman from passing HIV to her baby, but these drugs will be used only if doctors know the woman has HIV. If you want to have children, and you either have symptoms or have put yourself at risk, you need to get tested for HIV.

Go to an HIV testing site.,
Test at a regular clinic or doctor's office.,
Test with a ""home testing kit.""",How to Get Tested for HIV2," These special clinics run on a confidential basis; many preserve anonymity by assigning patients identification numbers to match them with their test results. Some run on an appointment basis, while others let patients drop in. Most collect information about patient ethnicity, sexual orientation and activity, drug use and prior HIV tests. Patients are counseled before and after the test. The test takes one of several forms:


A blood sample test from a vein that looks for the presence of HIV antibodies. It takes 1 to 2 weeks to process for results.
A saliva sampling test from between the cheek and gum. This test also takes 1 to 2 weeks to process.
A urine test. However, this test is less accurate than the blood and saliva sample tests.
A rapid sample test, where blood is taken from the finger and processed in 20 to 30 minutes. Patients who receive this test may receive less counseling than with the other 2 forms of testing, depending on how busy the testing site is.
All tests must be confirmed with a follow-up test, using the same bodily fluid that was sampled for the original test. In addition, if you test negative for HIV within 3 months of potential exposure, you'll need to be tested again 3 months afterward to rule out the possibility that the first test missed the presence of HIV antibodies.

, You may not be as likely to be tested anonymously in either of these settings as at a dedicated HIV testing site or receive the same level of counseling, but you may have more flexibility in making an appointment and not have to wait as long to be tested.


In addition to the tests listed under the previous step, if you visit your doctor just after taking part in HIV-risk behavior, he or she may administer an RNA test, designed to find the virus itself instead of antibodies it causes the body to produce. Typically, antibodies don't show up in detectable quantities until 2 to 8 weeks after infection (12 weeks at the outside), while the RNA test will detect the virus within 9 to 11 days after infection.

, More correctly a ""home collection kit,"" this test involves pricking your own finger with the included device, putting drops of blood on a treated card to be mailed to a laboratory for treatment. Anyone taking the test is assigned an identification number to preserve anonymity. Counselors are available by telephone before the test, while waiting for results and after receiving them.


While several HIV home test kits are advertised online, the only one presently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the Home Access HIV-1 Test System. Even so, it requires a follow-up test to verify the results, and anyone who receives a positive result is given a referral for such a test.
In some countries, the sale of home testing kits is illegal.

Be cared for by a doctor with experience in treating HIV.,
Be tested for other infectious diseases.,
Practice safe sex.,
Modify other risky habits.,
Get retested regularly.",How to Get Tested for HIV3," They'll need to get tested for HIV as well.

, Do this even if you're not experiencing any symptoms. There are now a number of treatment options for HIV.

, Being infected with HIV makes you more vulnerable to other infectious diseases. It's a good idea to be tested for tuberculosis, hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis.

, Use a condom when having sex. Latex condoms are highly, but not absolutely, effective in preventing HIV transmission, if used consistently and correctly. If either you or your partner has a latex allergy, use a condom made of polyurethane.


To prevent the condom from breaking during sex, use of a lubricant is advised, although spermicides such as nonoxynol-9 are not recommended to prevent infection from HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.

, Certain practices such as smoking, excessive drinking or using illicit drugs can weaken your immune system. Take advantage of programs to curb your use of these substances.


Avoid sharing razors or toothbrushes with others, as these may have someone else's blood on them.

, The Centers for Disease Control recommend that people who have practiced behaviors that put them at risk for HIV be tested at least once a year.

Prevent the spread of your STD if you have one.",How to Get Tested for STDs," One great ""first stop"" for STD treatment is your ordinary doctor that you see for your regular checkups. Your doctor should be more than willing to help you get the tests you need. Doctors are not allowed to judge you or tease you about your issues. If you are older than 13, most doctors will also agree to treat you without telling your parents the real reason for your visit. However, this depends on which state you live in.This can be a subject that is difficult to talk to others about. Luckily, you do not need to explain a single thing on the phone. If the receptionist asks, you can just say that you are not feeling well or that you want a routine physical exam. Then, once you are in the privacy of the examination room, you can explain your situation.
You can also give your parents the same excuse if you are worried about them having an angry reaction.;
, Don't be afraid to open up to your doctor about the reasons for your visit. It's your doctor's job to help you — she or he will want to get you your test results as quickly as possible. If you do have an STD, your doctor will help you get rid of it. Remember, your doctor is your friend, so there's no question you shouldn't feel comfortable asking.


Doctors will also be happy to direct you to other people who can help you. For instance, she or he should be willing to connect you with agencies that supply condoms and birth control for cheap or free.

, Worried about paying for a doctor's visit or keeping it secret from your parents? Try visiting a public sexual health clinic instead. In the U.S., the most famous of these is Planned Parenthood. Most of these sorts of clinics will offer confidential STD testing for cheap or even free.You can also almost always get birth control and condoms at these clinics as well.


Not sure where a sexual health clinic is near you? Try using inspot.org. This site offers an easy-to-use tool for locating clinics in your local area.Inspot.org even lets you send anonymous online requests for information about testing.

, Many (though not all) high schools and colleges will have their own on-campus health clinic for students. In most cases, these clinics will be confidential and will offer both STD testing and birth control services — just like a ""real"" clinic. The cost of your treatment may even be covered in your tuition. Call or ask the front desk staff for more information.


Note that some schools (particularly religious schools) may not offer all sexual health services in their campus clinics.

, Looking for information on where or how to get an STD test? Call the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) national STD helpline at 1-800-232-4636. Help is available 24 hours a day in English and Spanish.To learn where STD testing clinics are located near you, listen to the audio prompts. Use your phone's buttons to give your responses. As of March 2015, the button combination to get testing locations in English is: 1 (for English), 9 (for ""all other inquiries""), 1 (for STDs) and 1 again (for STD testing locations).

, Most of the suggestions in this section can be confidential. This means that your family members won't have to know you were tested. However, this isn't always the ""default"" option, so talk to the staff at your testing location to agree on a plan that works for you. A few questions you may want to ask are:Will you call me at home or send a letter to confirm the results of the test?
Will you send a bill to my home?
Will you send any other mail?
Will the test show up on my parents' insurance bill?

, In recent years, home tests for many common STDs (including HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) have become popular and affordable. These tests usually require you to collect a urine sample or swab part of your body. The sample is then sent in the mail to a lab for analysis. You may be able to find these tests for fairly cheap at your local pharmacy.


Note that there is some evidence that home tests tend to give more ""false positives"" than tests at clinics.In other words, if you do a home test and the test indicates that you do have an STD, you should confirm your results with a doctor or health clinic. There is a chance they may not be accurate.

, There are many different reasons why a person may want an STD test. The most urgent is when there is a change in the way your genitals look or feel. In general, anything ""out of the ordinary"" with your genitals might be an STD. However, there are plenty of alternate explanations as well. Signs that warrant an STD test regardless include:


Discomfort when urinating
Unusual bumps or sores
Persistent itchiness or irritation
Unusual discharge or smell
Again, these symptoms all have non-STD causes as well. For instance, some young women confuse the pain and discharge from a yeast infection with an STD.

, When you have sex with someone, you're also having sex with the people he or she has had sex with. If your partner has been sexually active since his or her last STD test, it's wise to have him or her get tested before you have sex. It is possible to have an STD without knowing it since symptoms can take a long time to show up.


Conversely, if you have been sexually active and you haven't had an STD test in a while, you should get tested before becoming sexually active with your partner.

, Medical professionals recommend different testing schedules for different STDs. For instance, two common STDs, gonorrhea and chlamydia, require testing once a year if you meet any of the following conditions:You are a sexually active female under 25.
You are a female older 25 who is at-risk for STDs. For instance, you are having sex with multiple partners or don't know your new partner's sexual history.
You are a man who has sex with men.
You have HIV.
You have been forced to have sex or perform sexual acts against your will.

, For example, testing is recommended for these three diseases only if you meet any of the following conditions:You have tested positive for a different STD.
You have had more than one partner since your last test.
You use intravenous (IV needle) drugs.
You are a man who has sex with men.
You are pregnant or want to become pregnant soon.
You have been forced to have sex or perform sexual acts against your will.

, Unfortunately, not all STDs have a test that is 100% effective. There may be some tests available, but they may not be perfectly accurate. False negatives and positives may be possible. In these cases, a doctor may need to make a diagnosis by examining your symptoms in person.


Herpes is one common STD that lacks a definitive test. Herpes may be diagnosed by taking a tissue scraping from the genital sores or via a blood test, but neither test works perfectly.
HPV (human papillomavirus) has no test for men. Diagnosis must be made by visually examining sores.
However, women can be tested for HPV via a pap test (which is recommended every three years for women between ages 21 and 65).

, Getting a positive result back from an STD test can sometimes be an emotional experience. You may feel embarrassed, frustrated, sad, angry, or ashamed. You may not know what to do next. Having these thoughts is OK. Give yourself time to process your emotions. You don't have to feel bad for having an STD. You're already better off than you were before your test. Now, you know about it and can start getting treatment.


Know that you are not alone if you get a positive STD diagnosis. Some STDs are extremely common. For instance, in the U.S., most sexually active men and women will get at least one case of HPV during their life., If you test positive for an STD, you have a responsibility to tell anyone that you've had sex with while you might have had the disease. This can understandably be an awkward experience, but it's a necessary one. By telling these people, you give them the chance to get tested themselves. If they have the disease, they can start treatment as soon as possible. If you test positive for a serious STD, like HIV, notifying past partners can be life-saving.

, Talk to your doctor about the results of your STD test. Usually, you will have the chance to do this when you receive your test results. A positive test will usually come with instructions to schedule an appointment. The quicker you start receiving treatment, the better the process of recovery is likely to be.


Some STDs caused by bacteria, yeast, and parasites have ""cures"" — that is, medicines that can make the disease go away forever. For instance, gonorrhea can usually be cured with antibiotics.
However, STDs caused by viruses don't have cures. In some cases, you must wait for your body to fight off the virus on its own. In others, the virus stays with you for life, though treatment can make symptoms disappear and make it much harder to spread the virus., If you have an STD, it's your responsibility to notify any sexual partners prior to sex. Certain types of protection can help prevent the infection from spreading through sex.


The easiest, most widely-available means of protecting against STDs is by using condoms. A male or female condom will greatly reduce the risk of giving your sexual partner an STD. However, this is only if it completely covers the infected area. Even condoms are not 100% effective, however, so it's important for both partners to make an informed decision before having sex.See our condom article for more information.

The most important thing you should know is that there have been a lot of advancements in the treatment of HIV and AIDS over the past few decades. It is very possible to live a long and fulfilling life even after a positive diagnosis.You can find a lot of helpful information online, but your most valuable source of information will be your doctor, as he or she will know your personal history, what strain of HIV you have, and the severity of your illness.
It's a good idea to write down every question you have as you think of it so you will remember to ask your doctor during your next appointment. Don't be shy about asking a lot of questions.;
, While it's normal for people to have emotional responses when they are diagnosed with HIV or AIDS, it's not healthy to hold in feelings of anger or sadness without talking to anyone about them.Ask your doctor or do an internet search to find out if there are any HIV/AIDS support groups in your area. These are great resources to meet people who know exactly what you are going through and can give you advice on how to cope. If you can't go to in-person meetings, consider online support groups.
Anonymous hotlines are also available to support individuals who have HIV and AIDS. These may be especially helpful to you if you don't have access to group meetings in your local area.You may also want to consider seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist, especially if you are struggling with depression after your diagnosis. Antidepressant medications may help. Talk to your infectious disease doctor and psychiatrist about proper treatment.

, No matter how uncertain your future is, you must fight on and keep living life to the fullest.Try not to withdraw from activities because of your diagnosis. You can't spread HIV through casual contact, like touching or sharing drinks, so there's no reason for you not to participate.Surrounding yourself with the people and things you love is a great way to get your mind off of your worries.

, Many people immediately begin to panic about the future when they are diagnosed with AIDS because they worry what will happen to their loved ones if they can no longer provide support. While this is an understandable concern, it is important not to let it cripple you. Remember that many patients are able to continue working and living normal lives.Instead of worrying about the future, try to focus your energy on staying healthy and caring for your loved ones in the present.

, It's up to you who you tell about your diagnosis and when, so take some time to think about it. Before you tell people, think about why you want to tell them, how supportive they are likely to be, and if there are any potential negative consequences of telling them.Don't feel compelled to tell everyone you know about your diagnosis, especially if you fear they may not react well. However, it is a moral obligation to tell people that you are having sex with that you have HIV, and make sure to use a condom each time you have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse.

, While you do have the power to determine who you tell about your diagnosis in most cases, there are laws that require you to disclose your condition to certain individuals. You should tell all past, present, and future sexual partners, as well as anyone you have ever shared a needle with. Depending on where you live, you may be legally required to tell others as well.


It is illegal in many states to knowingly transmit HIV, which includes engaging in sexual intercourse without informing your partner that you have HIV or AIDS.You are legally required to tell all of your doctors and dentists about your diagnosis in some states.This is because they may come in contact with your blood or other body fluids, so it's a good idea to tell them even if it's not a law in your area. They are prohibited by law from refusing to treat you or disclosing your diagnosis to other people not involved in your treatment.

, Once you have been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS, it is your responsibility to take reasonable precautions to avoid spreading the virus to others. This means always using latex condoms during sex and never sharing needles or other drug paraphernalia with others.If you have a regular sexual partner, encourage him or her to take pre-exposure prophylaxis medications, which can help reduce the likelihood of contracting HIV.
If you believe you have exposed anyone to HIV recently, talk to them about post-exposure prophylaxis medications, and encourage them to get tested.
Antiretroviral therapy decreases, but does not eliminate, the risk that you will transmit the virus, so it is still important to take extra precautions, even if you are taking your medications as directed.
It is also possible to pass HIV on from mother to child during pregnancy or while breast feeding, so make sure to talk to your doctor about how to reduce these risks if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.Also, do not share razor blades or toothbrushes with anyone.

, It is extremely important that you start seeing an HIV/AIDS specialist as soon as possible. The sooner you begin treatment, the better your chances are of avoiding complications and living a long life. You will be seeing this doctor a lot, so make sure you choose someone you trust.If you don't already have a doctor, you can find a list of specialists in the United States at AIDS.gov. These are usually infectious disease doctors, but you can also find internal medicine doctors or family medicine doctors that specialize in HIV/AIDS.
When you first see your specialist, he or she will run a series of specialized tests that will determine what strain of HIV you have been exposed to and how far the virus has progressed. This information will help your doctor decide on the best treatment plan for you., Your doctor will most likely prescribe antiretroviral therapy (ART). While ART cannot cure HIV or AIDS, it is recommended for all patients because it is effective at slowing the progression of the disease and protecting the immune system.ART can have a variety of side effects, many of which may subside after a few weeks. Common side effects include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, insomnia, weight loss, rashes, dry mouth, decreased bone density, and decreased renal function. Talk to your doctor about all of these side effects, as there may be other medications you can take or lifestyle changes you can make to combat them.It is important to take your medication regularly, Missing even occasional doses can cause the virus to become resistant to the medication., In addition to ART, you may want to try a variety of alternative treatments to help you deal with your symptoms. Make sure to always discuss any new treatment plan with your doctor to ensure that there are no potential negative reactions.Depending on your symptoms, you may benefit from energy therapies like Reiki or qi gong, mind-body therapies like meditation or visualization, physical therapies like massage and acupuncture, or herbal supplements.

, Once you have been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS, you will need to follow up regularly with your doctor to monitor your condition. Your doctor may perform blood tests to keep track of the progression of the disease, as well as your general health.Regular dental cleanings are important to reduce gum bleeding, which can transmit HIV to others., In order to keep your immune system as strong as possible, it's a good idea to embrace a healthy lifestyle. This will help keep you feeling better and decrease your chances of acquiring infections.Eat a healthy diet, including adequate amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water. HIV and AIDS can affect your metabolism, so be sure to discuss any changes you notice with your doctor.
Try to exercise as well. Your doctor can advise you on how much exercise is advisable for you.
Cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drugs are all very bad for you, especially when you have HIV or AIDS, so minimize your use of these substances as much as possible.

, Opportunistic infections, or infections that occur more frequently and with more severity in people with HIV and AIDS due to their weakened immune systems, are a major concern. For this reason, it is important to do whatever you can to avoid coming in contact with other infections.Wash your hands often to avoid coming in contact with germs.
Avoid foods that carry a high risk of food borne illnesses, such as raw fish, undercooked meat or eggs, and unpasteurized dairy products. Take extra care to wash produce and any surfaces that come into contact with raw foods.
Only drink water that has been safely treated. Be cautious when traveling abroad.
Get all of the vaccines your doctor recommends, particularly those for the seasonal flu and pneumococcal pneumonia. These infections can be very serious for people with HIV or AIDS.Always practice safe sex. This will prevent you from coming into contact with different strains of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

Enjoy up to ten years of pregnancy prevention.",How to Use Emergency Contraceptives," There are a wide variety of different emergency contraceptive pills that contain levonorgestrel (the hormone that can prevent pregnancy) available at pharmacies and drug stores. Some are available over-the-counter to anyone, regardless of age or gender, but others require a prescription in some cases.There are one-pill and two-pill options available, both of which are equally effective. The one-pill option is available to anyone without a prescription, while the two-pill option requires a prescription for patients under 17 and requires a photo ID.
If you need a prescription, visit your doctor's office, a walk-in clinic, an urgent care center, or a women's health clinic as soon as possible to get one. Although it may be uncomfortable, consider talking to your parents and getting their help.;
, If you do not need a prescription, simply visit your local pharmacy to purchase emergency contraception (also called ""the morning after pill""). Go as soon as you can after unprotected sex. While the morning after pill can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, it is more effective the sooner you take it.Some stores keep the pills in locked boxes or behind the counter, so you may have to ask an employee for help.
It's a good idea to call your local pharmacy to find out if they stock emergency contraceptives, as not all of them do.
Depending on what brand of pill you buy and where you buy it, you should expect to spend between $35 and $50 at a drug store. If you cannot afford this, you may be able to get the same pill for cheaper at a health clinic like Planned Parenthood.
Your insurance may cover this form of emergency contraceptives, but probably only if you have a prescription from your doctor.

, Over-the-counter pills are available under many different brand names, some of which are one-step pills and some of which are two-step pills. While they are all equally effective, it is important to read the instructions carefully to understand when you should take each pill.If you use a one-step pill, you should take it as soon as possible. While it can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, the earlier you take it, the more effective it will be at preventing pregnancy.
If you use a two-step pill, take the first pill as soon as possible, and then take the second pill after the indicated amount of time (typically 12 hours later). If necessary, set an alarm on your phone to remind yourself to take the second pill, as it is very important that you take it on time.
Swallow the pills with water just as you would any other pill.

, While levonorgestrel pills are typically highly effective, they are not the best choice for everyone. They are known to be less effective for women who have a body mass index over 25.If your BMI is 30 or higher, this method of emergency contraception may not work for you at all, so it's best to find an alternative method.

, While there are many different kinds of levonorgestrel pills available, there is only one pill that contains ulipristal acetate. It goes by the brand name ella, and you will need a prescription from a doctor to get it.While ella is not as easy to get as over-the-counter emergency contraceptives, it does have some benefits over the other type of pill. It is the most effective morning after pill available, and it can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, while levonorgestrel pills can only be taken up to 72 hours after.
You can see any doctor for a prescription for ella. If you do not want to go to your primary care physician or gynecologist, you can go to a walk-in clinic, an urgent care center, or a women's health clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.

, ella is a single-dose pill that can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex. It is no less effective if you take it on day five than if you take it on day one, but you should see your doctor and fill your prescription as soon as possible, just in case your pharmacy doesn't have it in stock.Just like levonorgestrel pills, ella is a small pill that should be taken with water.

, While ella is the most effective morning after pill available, it is not right for everyone. You should not take it if you have used other forms of hormonal birth control within the last five days, including birth control pills, patches, or rings, as it will not be as effective. It is also not as effective for women who have a BMI over 35.


If you have taken hormonal birth control in the last five days, you can still take levonorgestrel pills.
If your BMI is between 25 and 35, ella is a better choice than levonorgestrel pills.
You should also avoid using ella if you are breast feeding, unless you are able to pump and dispose of your breast milk for several days.

, After taking ella, it is important that you use a backup birth control method, such as a condom, for at least 14 days. If you are taking are taking a hormonal contraception, you can not restart their contraception for five days after taking ulipristal acetate.You should also avoid using other emergency contraceptives shortly after you use ella. If you have already taken ella and you need to take the morning after pill a second time during the same monthly cycle, be sure to take ella again.

, The most effective way to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex is to get a copper IUD inserted. This is a small metal device that your doctor will implant in your uterus to prevent pregnancy.There is a small risk of infection or perforation of the uterus, as well as expulsion of the IUD.
Having an IUD inserted can cost up to $900, but it is covered by most insurance policies.You can make an appointment with your regular gynecologist to have an IUD inserted, or you can go to a women's health clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.

, While copper IUDs are generally safe birth control methods, they are not recommended for everyone. Individuals who have unexplained vaginal bleeding, thrombo-cytopenia, endometrial or cervical cancer, or pelvic inflammatory disease should not use an IUD.Some people have side effects after having an IUD inserted, including cramping, back aches, heavier periods, and spotting between periods. These are usually mild., One of the greatest benefits of the emergency IUD is that it can be left in place for up to ten years. It will continue to provide safe and effective birth control without any further steps.If you do not wish to leave the IUD in place, you can have it removed after your next period or anytime thereafter.

Use NFP to address religious concerns.",How to Use Natural Family Planning," During the menstrual cycle, your cervix creates mucus that changes to reflect your fertility. After your period, you'll notice several dry days where little or no mucus is produced (possibly making sex feel a little uncomfortable). This is an infertile time. But, the mucus will gradually become tacky, cloudy, and then wetter, stretchier, and slippery (looking like raw egg white) over the course of several days. This wet, stretchy, and slippery mucus signals a fertile phase that usually lasts around four days.


While you're menstruating, this mucus is obscured by the menstrual flow.;
, Before using the toilet, take a clean tissue and wipe your vagina. If there's any mucus on the tissue (or in your underwear), pay attention to the color and consistency. Wash your hands and insert your index finger into your vagina. Notice the color. To check the consistency, gently rub a bit of the mucus between your index finger and thumb before separating your fingers. Check your mucus two to three times a day.The following characteristics of cervical mucus can mean that you're:Fertile: Mucus is creamy, lotiony, stretchy, slippery, similar to egg whites
Infertile: Mucus is dry, sticky, crumbly, or gummy

, Since you're checking your cervical mucus two to three times a day, you only need to write down the most fertile or wet mucus you experienced during the day. You may be surprised to find that your mucus can change:Throughout the day
Based on how long your cycle is
In amount
If you use feminine ""hygiene"" products
If you use hormonal contraception or spermicides
If you have a vaginal infection
If you're sexually aroused

, By charting your cervical mucus, you can look at the calendar and notice trends in your fertility. For example, you may see that you had five dry days after your period, followed by two sticky days, then a lotiony day, and a slippery day (indicating ovulation). This shows increasing fertility following menstruation.


If you're trying to prevent pregnancy and you notice your cervical mucus is starting to become wetter or stretchier, take extra precautions. You can either abstain from sex during this increasingly fertile phase or use additional contraceptives.
If you're trying to become pregnant, you'll want to start timing sex around the more fertile phases of your cycle (when you notice wet, stretchy, clear mucus and most importantly around ovulation)., You'll need the same calendar that you've been using to chart your cervical mucus. While you can use any digital thermometer to take your daily temperature, it's best to use a Basal body thermometer which will give you the highest degree of accuracy. You'll be taking your temperature orally, although rectal temperatures are the most accurate.During your menstrual cycle, your body temperature changes subtly. You should be able to see the temperatures rise by about a degree following ovulation. They'll stay slightly higher until you start menstruating or they'll stay elevated (which can indicate pregnancy).

, You should take your temperature every morning before getting out of bed, eating, drinking, or using the bathroom. Take your temperature at the same time every morning. If you like, you can set an alarm, take your temperature, and go back to bed. Record your daily temperature on your charting calendar.You can also chart your temperature and cervical mucus on graphs that you can get from your doctor, a woman's health center, and most pharmacies. This will make it easier to see temperature shifts and confirm ovulation.

, Once you've been charting your temperatures for a while, you should notice that your body temperature usually stays around a certain temperature. You'll need to look for a temperature that is at least 0.2 degrees higher than the previous six days. Of those six days, look for the highest temperature. Draw a horizontal line that is 0.1 degree higher than that temperature to make your coverline.The coverline is simply an easy visual way to glance at your chart and see if you've ovulated and if your temperatures remain high (possibly due to pregnancy).

, Unlike cervical mucus, you won't be able to use your daily temperature to determine if you're fertile or not. This is because a noticeable temperature shift will happen after changes in fertility have already taken place. While this can be helpful in confirming that ovulation occurred, it makes it almost impossible to rely on temperature changes alone to prevent pregnancy.Other things can also impact your daily temperature. These include:Drinking alcohol the night before
Taking your temperature at a different time
Having a fever
Being sick
Stress
Difficulty sleeping
Medications
Changes in time zones

, The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days and starts on the first day of menstruation or bleeding. After menstruation ends, your body prepares to ovulate, or release an egg for potential fertilization and pregnancy. Ovulation, the peak of fertility in your cycle, usually happens around day 14 of the cycle. Because of this, the three to four days before ovulation are increasingly fertile, but fertility drops off following ovulation.If no egg is fertilized by sperm following ovulation, your body will enter an infertile phase, followed by menstruation, and the cycle repeats.

, While you can keep track of the basics of your menstrual cycle (when your period starts and ends) on a calendar, you'll need to pay attention to physical symptoms of fertility. Cervical mucus is one of the best indicators of your fertility. Since your fertility is different from day to day, monitoring your cervical mucus every day will give you a more accurate indicator of fertility than if you were only tracking dates on the calendar. You'll also need a basal body thermometer to take your temperature every morning.


The basal body thermometer gives a more detailed temperature reading, usually to the 1/100th of a degree.You'll be tracking your temperature to confirm if you have ovulated.

, You'll need to consider why you want to use NFP (planning or preventing a pregnancy). If trying to prevent a pregnancy using NFP, you'll need to be disciplined enough to take and chart your cervical mucus and temperature every day. You'll also have to follow the rules concerning sexual abstinence during fertile periods (or use backup contraception). If trying to become pregnant, NFP can be a great way to understand what's happening in your menstrual cycle, making it easier to time sex around your most fertile times.Since NFP doesn't protect against Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), you may still want to use a condom, especially if you're not in a monogamous relationship.

, While it is possible to use natural family planning when you have an irregular menstrual cycle, the practice will be more difficult under those circumstances. Natural family planning is easiest for women with regular, easily tracked cycles.If you have an irregular cycle, consider talking with your OB/GYN for additional assistance in tracking your cycles before attempting NFP. Your OB/GYN can also review other family planning options with you.

, While natural family planning can be highly effective when followed correctly, it also requires considerable dedication. You'll need to track the changes to your bodily consistently. Additionally, you also need to be willing to abstain from sex during your fertile periods.Since NFP can also help you become pregnant when you're ready to start a family, it can also be a good practice to use for these purposes. You'll still need to remain dedicated to charting your changes, but there's little to no risk involved when intending to get pregnant using NFP.

, Natural family planning does not protect against STIs, so if you plan on having multiple sexual partners, it would be safest to use condoms instead of or in conjunction with NFP.Additionally, errors in calculation or lax record-keeping can increase your risk of an accidental pregnancy while using NFP. An unplanned pregnancy can be more difficult to handle when you are not in a long-term, stable relationship.

, Since errors in charting can reduce the effectiveness of NFP and may result in unplanned pregnancies, it's best to try NFP if you're financially, emotionally, and physically able to handle becoming pregnant, even when becoming pregnant is not your desired outcome.One positive of NFP is that it costs little to no money to use since you won't have to worry about prescriptions, devices, or extra visits to the doctor. That said, if you aren't able to remain consistent in your use of NFP, an unplanned pregnancy may cost you more in the long run than using standard forms of contraception would.

, Some faith traditions hold a negative view of many or all forms of contraception, but in most cases, these faiths are open to the practice of natural family planning.Instead of artificially limiting or preventing the inherent gift of fertility, natural family planning allows you to honor and work with your fertility while planning your family.


Natural family planning allows both spouses to give to each other fully, without holding anything back from one another.Note, however, that the same faith traditions that view contraception negatively typically hold a negative view of extramarital sex, as well. If considering NFP for religious reasons, you should also take the status of your relationship into consideration.

Go and purchase the pill.,
Take the pill.,
Expect your next period to be unusual.,
Look for signs of pregnancy.,
Learn about the single-dose progestin pills.,
Learn about the two-dose levonorgestrel tablets.,
Learn about Ella.",How to Use the Morning After Pill," Most morning after pills are formulated with a synthetic version of the hormone progestin (also called levonorgestrel). This hormone works by keeping your ovary from releasing an egg. If there is no egg, there is nothing for sperm to fertilize.If you are close to ovulating or have just ovulated, the pill has a significantly smaller chance of being effective.
Morning after pills typically have a higher dose of progestin than regular monthly birth control pills. You should not substitute morning after pills for regular birth control methods and they cannot terminate an existing pregnancy.;
, Morning after pills are most effective when they are taken within 24 hours of having unprotected sex or after you believe your contraception has failed. However, they can be taken a few days after and still prevent unwanted pregnancy.Progestin morning after pills should be taken within 72 hours of having unprotected sex.
Ulipristal acetate morning after pills (Ella) should be taken up to 120 hours after having unprotected sex in order to keep sperm from fertilizing an egg., Morning after pills are available at doctor’s offices, health clinics, and drugstores. At pharmacies, they may be kept behind the counter.You can purchase a non-prescription emergency contraceptive pill without showing your ID, regardless of your age or gender. Some pharmacies still may not stock the medication, or may refuse to provide it based on personal belief.
The pills are typically $35-$60 without insurance. Insurance may cover partial fees, depending on your plan.Some brands, such as Ella, require a prescription. , Emergency contraception medications are usually single-dose pills. However, the different brands vary and thus you should always take the amount of pills or tablets that are instructed by your doctor or the package labeling..


Morning after pills must be swallowed. Take your dose with plenty of water.
You may also want to take the pill with food to decrease your chances of developing nausea.
Regular birth control pills can be taken normally the day after you have a morning after pill.If you are unsure of the dosage or have any other concerns, ask for a consultation with a pharmacist.

, The morning after pill usually interferes with your hormones to control ovulation, so it's perfectly normal that your first period after taking the pill arrives early or late.Your period can also be lighter or heavier than usual.

, Levonogestrel pills are up to 89% effective when taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex. Similarly, Ella pills are 85% effective if taken within 120 hours after unprotected sex. However, there is still a chance you might get pregnant after taking a morning after pill.After you have taken the pill, look for signs of pregnancy especially if you miss your period.
Besides missing your period, other symptoms of pregnancy include dizziness, fatigue, aversion to the smell of food, nausea, and breast tenderness.Take an at-home pregnancy test or schedule a blood draw at your doctor’s office to determine if you are pregnant. At-home pregnancy tests can be found at drugstores in the family planning aisle.
Pregnancy tests check for hCG hormone levels in your body, which is elevated right after a fertilized egg attaches to your uterus., Single-dose progestin (levonogestrel) morning after pills (such as Plan B One Step, Next Choice One Dose, and My Way) stop pregnancy by preventing your ovary from releasing an egg. They can be found over-the-counter at pharmacies or acquired through your doctor.These pills should be taken as soon as possible but are usually effective when taken within 72 hours following unprotected intercourse. However, they may also work up to 120 hours afterward.These pills work best for women who have a BMI under 25 and may not work for women who have a BMI above 30.Taking this medication can alter your menstrual cycle, causing your next period to be lighter or heavier, and to occur earlier or later than you are used to. It can also bring on symptoms that are similar to those you experience during PMS, such as nausea and abdominal cramping.Other possible side effects include breast tenderness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal cramping., Unlike the single-dose morning after pills, the two-dose levonorgestrel tablets require you to take two tablets in order for the dose to be effective.Take one tablet as soon as possible after having unprotected intercourse and follow up with a second dose twelve hours later.
Levonorgestrel tablets can be found at your local pharmacy.
Like other morning after pills, side effects for these tablets include early or slightly delayed periods, lighter or heavier period flow, and abdominal cramps., Ella (ulipristal acetate) is a single-dose pill and is the only emergency contraceptive that is indicated to be taken up to 5 days after intercourse to prevent pregnancy; however, the sooner you take, the more effective it is.Depending when Ella is taken during your menstrual cycle, Ella can delay ovary from expelling an egg for up to 5 days after you take it. This means that sperm left behind cannot survive long enough to complete fertilization.Ella is a better choice for women who have a BMI over 25 than the progestin pills but its effectiveness lowers in women who have a BMI over 35.Ella is available by prescription only and the most common side effects associated with its use are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, dysmenorrhea, fatigue, and dizziness.

Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using an internal condom.,
Understand how a internal condom works.,
Examine the package of a female condom.",How to Use a Female Condom1," Before you commit to using a internal condom, you should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of using it instead of another form of birth control. Here are the pros and cons of using a internal condom:Advantages:

The internal  condom does not require a prescription and is therefore pretty easy to get. You can find it in most drugstores and some supermarkets.
Internal condoms let people share the responsibility for preventing infection.
Unlike the birth control pill, the internal condom doesn't have an effect on a person's natural hormones. (Though it may be used along with birth control pills for extra prevention, of course.)
It can stay in place even if a partner loses their erection.
It can enhance your sexual experience. The external ring can stimulate the clitoris during vaginal intercourse.
It is made with polyurethane instead of latex and can therefore be used by people with a latex allergy.
It can be inserted up to a few hours before intercourse -- and remember that you can use the bathroom while the condom is inserted.



Disadvantages:

The internal condom may irritate the vagina, vulva, penis, or anus (if it's being used anally).
It may slip into the vagina during intercourse.
It can be a bit tough to insert it, especially at first.
Wearing the internal condom can create a louder noise during sex, though this can be controlled with more lubricant.

;
, The condom works like a male condom but it's inserted into the vagina. It even looks somewhat like a large external condom, except it has a flexible inner ring that will be inserted into the vagina, and an outer ring that will hang about an inch from the vagina. Once the condom is inserted, the person can insert their penis into the condom. When they ejaculate into the condom, it should be removed.The female condom can be effectively inserted into the vagina or the anus, and the method for insertion is very similar.Remember that if you are wearing a female condom, the male should not wear a condom. This will create friction that can cause one or both of the condoms to tear.

, Before you use the female condom, check the expiration date on the package to make sure that you can still use it. Then, use your fingers to delicately smooth down the package to make sure that the lubricant is distributed evenly throughout the package.

"
"
Practice using the female condom.,
Remove the condom from the package.,
Put spermicide or lubricant on the outside of the closed end.,
Find a comfortable position.,
Squeeze the sides of the inner ring together.,
Insert the inner ring and condom into your vagina.,
Push the inner ring into the vagina, aiming towards the small of your back until it reaches the cervix.,
Pull out your finger.,
Insert your partner's penis into the female condom.,
Have sex.",How to Use a Female Condom2," Though female condoms typically cost around $4 per condom and can only be used once, you should practice using the condom on your own instead of using it for the first time right before sex. Though inserting the condom is easy once you get the hang of it, you should try it on your own at least once or twice to make sure that you can get it right when the time comes.

, Once you've determined that the condom is ready for use, just tear the arrow at the top of the package and remove the female condom.

, Using spermicides along with the female condom can further reduce your risk of pregnancy. Though the female condom will already be lubricated, extra lubricant can make it easier to insert and use the condom.

, To insert the female condom, you'll have to find a position that works for you. It's just like inserting a tampon -- you have to get comfortable and have access to your vagina before you can insert the condom. You can try squatting on the ground, laying down, or placing one foot on top of a chair.

, Hold the sides together similarly to how you would hold a pencil. Though the condom will be a bit slippery because of the lubricant, make sure you have a reasonably firm grip before you insert it.

, Insert it like a tampon. Push it up with your finger.

, Once it reaches the cervix, it will naturally expand and you won't be able to feel it anymore. Again, this is much like inserting a tampon -- if you can still feel it inside you, then you didn't put it in correctly.

, Make sure that the outer ring is hanging at least an inch outside the vagina. If it's hanging much further out, you may need to check if the inner ring is really inserted correctly.

, Once you've inserted the condom and are ready for sex, have your partner guide his penis into the outer ring that is hanging outside of your vagina. You can help guide his penis into the condom correctly. Make sure that his penis is actually going into the condom instead of touching one wall of your vagina as well as the condom.

, It's normal for the female condom to move from side to side once you're having sex. As long as the inner ring is still inserted and your man's penis is in the condom, you're good to go. If his penis has slipped out or the condom has come loose, you can comfortably reinsert it as long as the man hasn't ejaculated yet. Once the man ejaculates, you can remove and throw out the female condom. If you hear a loud noise because of the condom during sex, you can apply more lubricant.

"
"
Squeeze and twist the outer ring.,
Gently remove the condom from your vagina or anus.,
Throw the condom away.",How to Use a Female Condom3," Grasp the outer ring firmly before you twist it. This will keep the semen inside the pouch in the condom., Do this slowly while holding the twisted top of the condom together.

, Just like a male condom, the female condom cannot be reused. Just throw it in the garbage - do not flush it.

"
"
Store condoms safely.,
Check the condom package.,
Put the condom on before your penis touches your partner’s genitals at all.,
Open the condom wrapper using the easy-tear edges.,
Determine which way the condom is rolled.,
Make sure the reservoir at the tip of the condom is pointing in the right direction.,
Lube it up.,
Make sure the penis is fully erect.,
Pinch the entire reservoir at the tip of the condom shut.,
Roll the condom on.,
Smooth lubricant over the condom if necessary.,
Check the condom periodically during use for breaks.,
Replace the condom if alternating between different types of sex.,
Withdraw the penis and remove the condom immediately after ejaculation.,
Dispose of the condom discreetly.",How to Use a Condom1," Condoms can become brittle and more likely to break if you don’t store them correctly. Condoms that are exposed to heat or light are more likely to tear.Don’t keep condoms in your back pocket, wallet, or glovebox. If you think you may get lucky, put a couple in your wallet or car right before you hit the town. Don’t leave them there for days or weeks.
Store condoms in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
Keep condoms in their wrappers until you’re ready to use them.;
, Before you purchase condoms, check the expiration date printed on the box. You should also double check the date stamped on the wrapper before you use it. If it’s expired, toss it out. Never use an expired condom. It could tear or fail.









Check out the wrapper for any signs of obvious rips or tears. If the package is torn or ripped, toss the condom out and use a new one.
If the condom is sticky, brittle, or looks discolored, toss it out and use a new one., Men produce fluid known as pre-ejaculate (“pre-cum”) that can transmit STDs and, in some cases, contains sperm that can lead to pregnancy (though this is unlikely). Before you play, wrap it up.You should also put on a condom before oral sex, anal sex, or oral-anal contact. You can contract an STD from oral sex, so it's important to still use a condom for these activities. A condom can be cut open to cover a woman's vulva during oral sex or to cover the anus during oral-anal contact.
You may also want to put on a condom before mutual masturbation. This will keep fluids from getting on your hands that could easily be transmitted to your partner's genitals or mouth.
If you are using a sex toy, use a condom on the toy as well. The materials used to make some of the toys are not always safe to use in your body (like plastics containing phthalates). It can be hard to keep toys clean, meaning bacteria can build up, especially on toys made of porous materials.

, Push the condom away from the edge you plan to tear, and use the easy-tear edges. These are the zig-zag edges on either side of the wrapper that are designed to tear apart quickly and easily.










Don't get carried away in your passion. Don't shred open the foil, and stay away from scissors, teeth, machetes, or any other sharp instrument to open a condom wrapper, or you could tear the condom itself! A torn condom won’t protect against pregnancy or STDs.If it's your last condom and you destroy it, party's over!

, This can be difficult to do, particularly if you’re in the dark. However, checking by sight is the safest way to determine which way the condom is rolled, so you don't risk unrolling it too far or tearing it with your fingers. If the condom is right-side-out, there will be a lip or rim on the edge. If it's inside-out, the edge will be smooth. You can use your fingers to help you:









Place the condom on your thumb, but don't unroll it. Let it balance there like a little hat.
Run your pointer finger down the side of the condom, from the tip to the edge.
If your finger catches on the rim, it is right-side-out. If your finger slides smoothly off the rim, then it is inside-out.
If the condom is inside out, hold the rim of the condom with the inside-out tip pointing towards your mouth. Blow on the tip to invert it and turn it right-side-out.
Cautionary tale: don't unroll the condom, as unraveling it will reduce the condom's efficacy—and make it frustratingly difficult to put on.

, This reservoir should already be on the outer tip of the condom, but it can sometimes become inverted during packaging. Make sure the reservoir is oriented so that the rest of the condom rolls away from it.


, Consider placing a small drop of water-based lubricant inside the reservoir. This can make the condom easier to apply, especially if you are uncircumcised.Make sure this is a very small drop, as you don’t want to compete with the sperm for space inside the reservoir tip.




Do not apply lotion, baby oil, petroleum jelly, or oil-based lube, as it will degrade and weaken the latex., A condom should always fit snugly over a penis, leaving no tight or baggy spots. If rolled over a penis that is not yet fully erect, it will fit awkwardly and be more likely to fall off or tear during sex.The condom should go from the package to your genitals relatively quickly. Don't unwrap the condom until you are fully erect and ready to use it. Never try to reuse a condom.

, This eliminates the possibility of creating an air pocket inside the condom when it is worn, reducing the chance of breakage and providing the semen with a place to go during ejaculation., The condom should easily unroll down the length of the shaft. If it turns out that you are trying to put the condom on backwards, throw it away and start over.An erect penis produces fluid prior to ejaculation (called “pre-cum”) that can contain sperm. If a condom has been exposed to this fluid, flipping it over and re-applying it may cause pregnancy and









Pinching the reservoir shut with one hand, place the condom against the tip of the erect penis. With your other hand, push your pubic hair out of the way if necessary.
Then, gently roll the condom down the entire shaft of the penis, smoothing out any air bubbles that may appear.
Follow these same steps for putting a condom on a sex toy.

, Sexual lubrication decreases the risk of damage to not only the condom, but also reduces friction and increases pleasure for those having sex. Some lubricants even contain spermicides that can help reduce the risk of pregnancy. However, spermicides can increase the risk of transmitting an STD. If your condom isn’t already lubricated, apply it to both the condom and the other partner, particularly if you are engaging in anal sex.



Do not over-apply lube, as too much may cause the condom to fall off and friction is necessary for stimulation.
Again, Never apply an oil- or petroleum-based lubricant to a latex condom, as these can cause it to deteriorate.Water- and silicon-based lubricants are both safe to use with latex, but water-based lube washes off more easily and won’t stain your sheets.

, If a condom breaks or comes off during sex, replace it immediately and consider using emergency contraception such as the emergency contraception pill.An emergency contraception pill (sometimes called the morning-after pill) prevents pregnancy before it happens by delaying ovulation or blocking fertilization; it is not an ""abortion pill."", If switching from anal to vaginal sex, for example, switch condoms to reduce the risk of infection. For example, e. coli from the rectum can cause bladder infectionsor a severe vaginal infection. If the penis goes from anus to mouth, that can cause a serious infection in the stomach.



You should also replace the condom if you are using it on a sex toy that you’re sharing between partners. Basically, if the condom has your fluids in or on it, change it out before sharing., Grasp the bottom of the condom with your hand and withdraw, preventing the condom from slipping off or spilling. Do not allow the penis to go flaccid within the condom before withdrawal, as this can cause the condom to fall off and remain inside the partner.








, Tie the open end in a knot to prevent spillage, wrap it in toilet paper or tissue, and throw it in a trash can.










Don’t flush condoms down the toilet. Most septic systems can’t handle them, and they may clog up the toilet."

Check the condom package.,

Get into a comfortable position.,
Squeeze the inner ring at the closed end of the condom.,

Stop immediately if something goes wrong.,
Remove the condom slowly.,
Dispose of the condom discreetly.",How to Use a Condom2," Before purchasing, check the expiration date on the package. Then, before use, make sure you also check the expiration date printed on the condom wrapper. If it’s expired, toss it out. Never use an expired condom. It could tear or fail.Check out the wrapper for any signs of obvious rips or tears. If the package is torn or ripped, toss the condom out and use a new one.

, Female condoms are polyurethane or nitrile pouches with flexible rings at each end that you insert into the vagina or anus. They collect pre-cum and semen, preventing pregnancy and reducing the transmission of STDs.Female condoms don’t protect women during oral sex. For that, you will need to use a dental dam, or a condom that is cut open.
Don’t use a female condom and a male condom at the same time. It doesn’t provide twice the protection — in fact, it can cause breakage in either or both condoms., These are the zig-zag edges on either side of the wrapper that are designed to tear apart quickly and easily.Don't get carried away in your passion. Don't shred open the package, and stay away from scissors, teeth, machetes, or any other sharp instrument to open a condom wrapper, or you could tear the condom itself! A torn condom won’t protect against pregnancy or STDs.Female condoms are more expensive than male condoms, at about $4 apiece., Many women find it easy to stand with a foot on a chair, lie down, squat, or raise one leg up.You’ll find out what works best for you with a little practice., Female condoms have a flexible ring at each end. One end will be closed, a lot like a male condom. Pinch the ring at the closed end of the condom with your thumb and middle finger so it narrows. The open end should be hanging down., If you’ve used tampons before, this is the same process. Squeezing the ring to keep it narrow, insert the closed end of the condom as far as it will go. Insert your index finger into the condom and push it gently into your vagina. Be very careful if you have long nails — tearing the condom will render it ineffective.You should feel it meet resistance at some point. That’s a sign you’ve reached your cervix.Make sure the condom is not twisted inside your vagina.

, If you’ve inserted the condom correctly, the outer ring should be hanging about an inch outside your vagina.It is possible use the same method to insert a female condom into your anus for anal sex;however, the easiest way is to remove the inner ring and place the the female condom on the penis (or sex toy). The penis is then inserted into the anus., Regardless of what’s going into your vagina (or anus), adding some lubricant will help reduce friction. This makes it less likely for the condom to tear.Because female condoms are made from polyurethane or nitrile (a synthetic latex)and not latex, it is safe to use oil-based, water-based, or silicon-based lube with a female condom.

, It’s important to use your hand to guide the penis or sex toy inside you so that it doesn’t end up sliding outside the condom pouch., You should stop having sex immediately, remove the condom, and insert a new female condom if any of these things happen:The condom slips
The penis or sex toy enters your vagina (or anus) outside the condom pouch during sex
The outer ring of the condom enters the vagina
You may wish to consider using emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) if your partner has ejaculated inside your vagina, on the vaginal opening, or if semen drips from the anus onto the vaginal opening.

, Squeeze the outer ring closed with two fingers. Gently slide the condom out of your vagina or anus.Don’t yank or tug on it, as this could break the condom., Tie the open end in a knot to prevent spillage. Wrap it in toilet paper or tissue, and throw it in a trash can.Don’t flush condoms down the toilet. Most septic systems can’t handle them, and they may clog up the toilet.Don’t reuse female condoms. Sure, they’re expensive — but accidental pregnancy or an STD costs way more.

Birth control pills are widely available and can be inexpensive, making them an attractive option;however, depending on your needs, health, and pre-existing medical conditions, certain choices may be better for you, so it’s important to discuss your birth control needs with your healthcare provider.


There are two main kinds of birth control pills. Combination pills use the hormones estrogen and progestin. Another type, the minipill, uses only progestin.Combination pills also come in two types. Monophasi' birth control pills all contain the same amount of estrogen and progestin. Multiphasic pills vary the amount of hormones in certain phases.
Combination pills also come as “low-dose” pills. These pills contain less than 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol (normal birth control pills contain 50 micrograms or less). Women who are sensitive to hormones, especially estrogen, may benefit from the low-dose pill; however, the low-dose pill may also cause more bleeding between periods.;
, Combination pills are commonly prescribed, but they are not always appropriate. Your doctor and you will make the final decision. If any of the following apply to you, your doctor may recommend that you do not use combination pills:You are breast-feeding
You are older than age 35 and a smoker
You have high blood pressure
You have a history of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis or you have a inherited condition that increases your risk of clots
You have a history of breast cancer
You have a history or heart disease or stroke
You have medical complications related to diabetes
You have liver or kidney disease
You have unexplained uterine or vaginal bleeding
You have a history of blood clots
You have lupus
You have migraine with aura
You will be having major surgery that immobilizes you for a prolonged period of time
You take St. John’s wort, anticonvulsants, or anti-tuberculous medications
Your doctor may recommend that you do not use the minipill if you have breast cancer, unexplained uterine or vaginal bleeding, or take anticonvulsant or anti-tuberculous medications.

, Combination pills offer a variety of benefits that make them an attractive choice for many women; however, they also carry some risks. When considering which type of pill is right for you, you may want to take both of these into account. Benefits of the combination pill include:Highly effective prevention of pregnancy when used correctly (99%)

About eight in 100 women will become pregnant during the first year of using this pill due to incorrect usage


Reduces menstrual cramping
May protect against pelvic inflammatory disease
Decreases your risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers
Can reduce the frequency and heaviness of menstrual cycles
Improves acne
May help improve bone mineral density
Reduces androgen production caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Protects against ectopic pregnancy
Reduces the risk of iron deficiency anemia due to heavy menstrual flow
Protects against breast and ovarian cysts

, While combination pills offer many benefits, there are also risks that you should discuss with your doctor. Most of these risks are rare, but can be serious. Many of these risks increase if you have certain medical conditions or if you smoke.Risks of using combination birth control pills include:No protection against sexually transmitted infections or HIV (you must use condoms to protect against these)
Increased risk of heart attack and stroke
Increased risk of blood clots
Increased risk of developing high blood pressure
Increased risk of developing liver tumors, gallstones, or jaundice
Increased breast tenderness
Nausea or vomiting
Weight gain
Headache
Depression
Irregular bleeding

, Minipills, or progestin-only pills, have fewer benefits than combination pills; however, they also tend to have fewer risks. You should talk to your doctor to determine whether the minipill is a good choice for you. Benefits of the minipill include:May be able to be taken even if you have certain health problems, such as blood clots, high blood pressure, migraines, or risk of heart disease
Can be used during breastfeeding
Reduces menstrual cramping
May make periods lighter
May help protect against pelvic inflammatory disease

, While the risks of the minipill are fewer than for combination pills, it is still possible to experience rare but severe side effects from using it. Speak with your doctor to consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks for you. Risks of using the minipill include:No protection against sexually transmitted infections or HIV (you must use condoms to protect against these)
Potentially less effective than combination pills
Backup birth control is required if you forget to take the pill within three hours of the same time every day
Bleeding between periods (more common with the minipill than with combination pills)
Increased breast tenderness
Nausea and vomiting
Increased risk of ovarian cysts
Slightly increased risk of ectopic pregnancy vs. combination pills
Possible increase in acne
Weight gain
Depression
Unusual hair growth
Headache

, If you are healthy enough for birth control pills, you have a few options. If you choose combination birth control pills — which many women do — you can choose to reduce the frequency of your menstrual cycles if you wish.Continuous-dose pills, also called extended-cycle pills, reduce the number of menstrual cycles you have each year. Women may have as few as four periods a year. Some women may stop having a period altogether.Conventional pills do not reduce the number of menstrual cycles. You’ll still have a period every month., Your doctor can help you determine whether you are taking any medications or supplements that will interfere with your birth control’s effectiveness. Medications that are known to interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal birth control include:Several antibiotics, including penicillin and tetracycline
Certain seizure medications
Certain drugs used to treat HIV
Anti-tuberculosis drugs
St. John’s wort

, Before you decide on a birth control pill, tell your doctor about any medications and supplements that you’re currently taking. Some medications interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills, and many others may cause negative interactions and side effects. Make sure to mention if you take any of the following:Thyroid hormone drugs
Benzodiazepines (such as diazepam)
Prednisone drugs
Tricyclic antidepressants
Beta-blockers
Anti-coagulants (“blood thinners” like warfarin)
Insulin

, You should always follow the directions given to you by your physician. Different pills have different requirements. Some need to be started at a special time and some need to be taken at specific times. Start by reading the instructions and then follow the next steps.If you do not take the birth control pills as directed, they may not be effective and you may become pregnant.

, Smoking makes taking the pill extremely dangerous to your health. Together they put you at a very high risk for blood clots, which can easily kill you. Women who are older than age 35 and smoke should not use any type of combination birth control pill.


If you're smoking, stop. Even occasional, social smoking can be dangerous. If you're not smoking, don't start.

, Depending on the type of birth control pill you have been prescribed, you may need to start taking your pill at a certain time. Always ask your prescribing doctor how you should start your pill. In general, you have a few options:You can start combination pills on the first day of your period.
You can also start combination pills on the Sunday after your menstrual period starts.
If you have just given birth vaginally, you must wait three weeks to start the combination pill.
You should wait at least six weeks after giving birth before starting the combination pill if you have an increased risk of blood clots or you are nursing.
You can start taking the combination pill right away if you have had an abortion or miscarriage.
Always start your new pack of combination pills on the same day of the week as you started the first pack.
You can start the minipill (progestin-only) pill at any time. If you plan to have vaginal intercourse during the first 48 hours of using the minipill, use a backup form of contraception.

You must take the minipill at the same time each day. Choose a time when you will remember to take your pill, such as when you get up or right before you go to bed.
You can start the minipill right away if you have had an abortion or miscarriage.

, If you start taking your birth control pills on the first day of your period, it is effective at protecting against pregnancy immediately.If you started your pill on a different day, there is a chance that you could become pregnant if you have unprotected sexual intercourse.As such, it is recommended you use backup birth control for the duration of your first pill pack.
If you begin your regimen at any other time it can take up to a full month for the pill to become fully effective.
To avoid pregnancy, if you did not start your pill within 5 days of the start of your period, you should use an alternate form of contraception for a full month, or one full cycle of pills., You can take it at morning or at night, but most women find that they remember them better at night because their nightly routine for going to bed doesn't vary as much as their morning routines. If you fail to take your pill at the same time every day, you may experience spotting and you will not be as well protected.


If you use the minipill, you must take each pill within three hours of the same time every day. If you do not, you must use a backup form of contraception for the next 48 hours. For example, if you usually take your pill at 8 PM but you forgot until midnight, you should take the pill but also use a backup form of contraception, such as condoms, for the next 48 hours.Setting an alarm on your cellphone to take your pills or putting them next to your toothbrush can help you remember if you tend to be forgetful.
There are even mobile apps that will remind you to take your pill, such as myPill and Lady Pill Reminder.
Take the pill about half an hour after eating to help you avoid nausea., Combination pills come in several different “phases.” For some of them, the level of hormones in the pills changes throughout the month. If you are taking any pill other than a monophasic pill, you may have extra instructions on what to do if you miss a pill that are specific to the pill you’re taking.


Monophasic pills contain the same level of estrogen and progestin in all of the pills. If you forget to take one of these pills, take it as soon as you remember. Take the next day’s pill at your regular time. Examples include Ortho-cyclen, Seasonale, and Yaz.
Biphasic pills change the level of estrogen and progestin once during the month. Examples include Kariva and Mircette Ortho-Novum 10/11.
Triphasic pills change the level of estrogen and progestin every seven days during the first three weeks of pills. Examples include Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Enpresse, and Cyclessa.
Quadriphasic pills change the level of estrogen and progestin four times during the cycle. Natazia is the only quadriphasic pill prescribed in the US.

, Combination pills can be conventional or continuous-dosage (or extended-dosage). Depending on what type of combination pill you’ve chosen, you may take different pills at different times of the month. Refer to your instructions.


For 21-day combination pills, you will take one pill at the same time every day for 21 days. For seven days, you will not take pills. You will generally have your period at this time. After seven days you start a new pack of pills.
For 28-day combination pills, you will take one pill at the same time every day for 28 days. Some of these pills do not contain hormones, or may only contain estrogen. You will experience bleeding for four to seven days while you are taking these pills.
For three-month combination pills, you will take one pill at the same time every day for 84 days. Then you will take one pill at the same time every day for seven days that does not contain hormones, or only contains estrogen. You will experience bleeding for these seven days every three months.
For 1one-year combination pills, you will take one pill at the same time every day for the full year. You may have fewer periods, or may even stop menstruating altogether.

, Remember that you may experience symptoms of pregnancy during the first month as your body adjusts to hormones (swelling breasts, sensitive nipples, spotting, nausea).Certain types of birth control pills may also cause you to stop having periods, so make sure you and your doctor are clear about which one you're on so you know what to look for.


If you’re concerned that you may be pregnant, you can use a home pregnancy test. They are accurate even while you are taking birth control pills., Watch for spotting or breakthrough bleeding (bleeding in between periods) if you are taking pills that are designed to prevent you from having periods every month. Even pills that allow you to have periods can still sometimes lead to spotting. This is normal. It takes a while for your body to adjust to the new schedule and the spotting typically goes away within three months but may take as long as six months.Spotting or “breakthrough bleeding” is more common with low-dose combination pills.
Bleeding is also more common if you miss a day or if you do not take the pills at the same time every day.

, You don’t want to run out of pills, so make sure to schedule an appointment with your doctor before you need a refill. You should generally schedule an appointment when you have two packs of pills left on your prescription., Don't be afraid to try different brands or different birth control methods. Talk to your doctor about taking a different brand of pill if you are bothered by symptoms of premenstrual syndrome or side effects of the particular pill you're on. There are many birth control methods other than the pill, many of which are easier to deal with.Other hormonal forms of birth control include combined estrogen and progestin patches and the vaginal ring.Other long-lasting, highly effective birth control methods include intrauterine devices (IUDs), contraceptive implants, and contraceptive injections., Stop taking the pills if you experience jaundice, abdominal pain, chest pain, leg pain, severe headaches or eye problems. Be especially alert for problems if you smoke. It's probably best if you quit smoking while taking birth control pills. Doing both significantly increases the chances of health complications, like blood clots.

, Birth control pills do present some risks. If you encounter any of the following, contact your doctor as soon as possible:Severe, consistent headaches
Change or loss of vision
Aura (seeing bright, flashy lines)
Numbness
Severe chest pain
Trouble breathing
Coughing up blood
Dizziness or fainting
Severe pain in the calf or thigh
Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)

, When you forget a pill, take the pill as soon as you remember and take the next pill at the regular time.Certain combination pills, especially multiphasic pills, may have additional instructions that you should follow.


For most pills, if you don’t remember until the next day you should take two pills on that day.If you forget your pill for two days, take two pills on the first day you remember and two pills on the next day.If you forget a pill at any time during your cycle, you should use a backup form of contraception such as condoms until you finish the pill pack.
If you forgot a pill during the first week of a pack, you may need to use emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy.
If you take progestin-only pills (instead of the more common combination pill), it is extremely important to take it at the same time every day. Even a few hours off can allow you to become pregnant. , If you are not sure what to do if you have missed a pill, or if you want to know whether you need to consider emergency contraception, contact your doctor. Tell them exactly what happened (how many pills you forgot, for how many days, etc.).


How you treat missing or forgetting a pill varies depending on the pill you’re taking, so contacting your doctor is always a good idea.

, Use another method of birth control if you are sick and experiencing vomiting or diarrhea because the pill may not stay in your digestive tract long enough to be effective.


If you vomit or have diarrhea within four hours of taking a pill, it is likely to be ineffective at protecting from pregnancy. Use a backup form of birth control just as you would for a missed pill.If you suffer from an eating disorder and use vomiting or laxatives, an oral contraceptive is unlikely to be effective. Use a backup form of contraception.Consult with your doctor or a mental health professional for help.

Never re-use old condoms.",How to Remove a Condom1," After you ejaculate or finish sex, remove your penis from your partner while it remains firm. Do not wait until your penis is soft. If you do, your condom more likely will fall off and become stuck in your partner.;
, When you have finished sex, hold your penis parallel to the floor or pointing downwards with one hand. Use the other hand to grab the condom's ring, or outer end. Make sure you grasp the condom's base firmly. By holding onto the bottom, the condom is less likely to come off.Inspect the used condom for holes. If your condom has broken, your partner will need to use a back-up form of birth control. Pills like Plan B can help in this situation. Additionally, you or your partner might need to seek STI testing.

, Place the condom in the garbage. In no case should you throw the condom in a toilet.It's not environmentally friendly or good for your plumbing system! There are multiple ways you can dispose of a condom:


Tie a knot at the condom's opening. This will prevent fluids from spilling. Wrap it in toilet or tissue paper and then throw it in a waste bin.
See Dispose of a Condom for more tips.

, After removing the condom, wash your hands with warm water. Use liquid soap. If your partner has had contact with your semen, encourage that person to wash their hands as well.

, They will not be effective. If you don't have another condom to use, buy another one. Otherwise, abstain from sexual intercourse.

You should immediately stop intercourse and refrain from panicking. If the condom did not slip off when he was pulling out, the man should remove his penis.There is a risk of infection the longer the condom remains in place. You shouldn’t allow a condom to remain inside you for more than a couple of hours.When a condom slips off, it has already lost its effectiveness for both birth control and to prevent STIs. You should visit your doctor to discuss this immediately.;
, Before you try to remove a condom from inside you, make sure to wash your hands. This helps reduce the risk of bacteria from entering your body.If you have cuts or open sores on your fingers, make sure to cover them before you insert your fingers inside yourself.
You should also make sure you or your partner do not have sharp nails because you can scrape the inside of your vagina., If you have a condom stuck inside, lie on your back. Spread your knees apart to allow access and make it easier to remove. Insert one or two fingers into your vagina. Once you feel the condom, grab it carefully. Smoothly and gently, pull out the condom.If you are using one finger, try to hook the condom with your finger. You may also try to press the condom between your finger and your vaginal wall and drag it out slowly.
If you are using two fingers, try to grab the edge of the condom between your two fingers. Squeeze the edges tightly between your fingers as you slowly try to pull it out.
If you cannot reach the condom, ask your partner to pull out the condom. Your partner should insert one or two fingers and feel around for the condom. Once he touches the condom, he should gently pull it out.
Try your best to keep any semen from spilling out of the condom as you pull it out if possible.

, If neither you nor your partner can reach the condom, try raising your hips. This may shift the condom so that you or your partner can reach it more easily.


Place a pillow under your hips to help raise them higher or into a different position where you may be able to grip the condom.

, After you remove the condom, check it to make sure it is completely intact. If a condom breaks, parts of it can break off and remain inside of you. Check to see how much, if any, of the condom is left inside.If you have bits of the condom left inside, try to see if you can remove the pieces left inside with your fingers. If you cannot remove the missing pieces, you will need to see a doctor.

, If you can’t get the condom out while lying on the bed, try getting it out by sitting on the toilet. Sit down on the toilet and spread your legs with your feet on the floor.Push down with your pelvic muscles to try to push out the condom.
Insert a finger inside your vagina as far as you can. If you cannot feel the condom, move your finger back and forth to try and locate it.
When you feel it, insert another finger to grab the condom and pull it out.
Sometimes it works best to stand in front of the toilet and put one foot on the lid. Then try to use your fingers to remove it.

, If you cannot remove the condom, visit your gynecologist. They may be able to remove the condom. You may also consider visiting a nearby urgent care center or emergency room. You should also visit the doctor if you have any pieces of a broken condom left inside you.


At either your gynecologist’s office, the ER, or an Urgent Care Center, a pelvic examination will be performed. This will be similar to a normal pelvic exam, in which you lie down with your feet placed into stirrups and your knees apart. The practitioner will use a speculum and see if the condom can be removed manually. If not, long forceps may be used to pull the condom out.
The examination is usually not painful, but it may be somewhat uncomfortable.

Rinse off under running water for at least 30 seconds.
Make sure to dry your hands well before touching the cervical cap.;
, Hold the cap against the light and make sure it does not have any signs of damage. In case of a suspicious tear or hole, discard it immediately and use another one. It is no longer effective in preventing pregnancy.The cervical cap can also be filled with water to check whether for leaks. If the cap does not hold water and leaks, it is not safe to use.

, Spermicidal creams contain chemicals that kill sperm cells and prevent them from reaching and fertilizing the egg.:


Different spermicide products are used slightly differently. Always read the instructions before using a product.Squeeze about one-quarter teaspoon of spermicide in the dome of the cervical cap.
Spread the cream over the entire cap as well as on the brim.
Read the product label whether you need to add more spermicide into your vagina if you have repeated sexual intercourse (you don't have to remove the cap).For some spermicides, you need to wait ten minutes before you can have intercourse and they remain effective for one hour after insertion.

, To effectively insert the cervical cap, you can stand with one foot resting on a chair, lie down with knees bent and feet apart, or squat down. Find the best method for you and use that every time when inserting the cervical cap.Once situated, locate and get familiar with your cervix (the opening that leads to your uterus). It is found at the end of your vaginal canal.
When you have reached the end of the vagina to the opening of the cervix, the size of the vaginal canal will decrease and you will be able to feel the walls of the cervix and its spindle shape. This is where you need to insert the cap.

, To insert, start by using your non-dominant hand to separate your labia and expose the vagina. Your dominant hand should squeeze the cap to make it smaller and facilitate easy insertion.Note that the cervical cap’s dome should be facing outside. Imagine that you are wearing a cap. Your cervix is the head while the device is your cap.
Once the cap is inside and you released it, it will expand and assume its original shape before it was squeezed.
Use your middle and/or index finger to further push the cervical cap inside until you feel that the cap is securely resting on the cervix.
The cervical cap is easier to insert before sexual arousal when the cervix is still firm.

, You can use your finger to push against the dome of the cap to see if it is in the right place. You should be able to feel your cervix against the dome.The cervical cap has a suction mechanism once it is properly inserted. You can be sure that the cap is securely in place when you feel this.
Try to move around and see whether it is snugly fitted on your cervix. If it's not, simply adjust until it is.

, After you have inserted the cervical cap, wash your hands once again to remove any residual spermicide and bodily fluids.


Do not use the cervical cap during your period as this interferes with the natural flow., The cervical cap should be inserted before sexual intercourse and it should stay on the cervix for at least six hours after. If it is taken out too soon, there is a risk of some sperm cells surviving and being able to fertilize the egg.You should not leave the cervical cap in place for more than 48 hours as this can lead to toxic shock syndrome., As before inserting the cervical cap, it is important you wash your hands before removing a cervical cap.Always wash your hands before and after touching bodily fluids. This includes before insertion, after insertion, before removal, and after removal of the cervical cap.

, As with inserting the cap, you should find a comfortable position to remove the cap. You can squat, stand with one foot on a chair, or lie down with legs apart and knees bent.Try a few different positions to find the one that works best for you.

, Use your non-dominant hand to separate the labia and expose the vagina. Use your dominant fingers to locate the cervical cap.After you locate the cervical cap, place your finger inside the removal strap and rotate. Then push the dome to break the suction.
Grab the removal strap with your finger and pull out the cap.

, A cervical cap is reusable for up to one year as long as it is not torn or broken. It is important you wash it after removal to ensure it maintains proper hygiene and integrity.Wash the cap with mild soap and warm water to remove any bodily fluids and spermicide.
Air-dry the cervical cap and never use a towel. When using a towel you risk transferring fibers or residue to the cap, which can ultimately make it dirty again and lead to quicker deterioration.

, This prevents tears and contamination with infectious agents. Storing the cap in the container also keeps it away from light and makes it last longer.Baby powder, petroleum jelly, and oil lubricants should not be used on the cap. This is because these substances can make the cap brittle and weak. In addition, vaginal creams should not be used on the cap because they can damage it and cause infections.If you take good care of it, a cervical cap could last for up to a year.

, It is important you use a cervical cap that is the right size to ensure comfort and efficacy. Cervical cap forms a physical barrier over the cervix. That prevents sperm from entering. If that barrier is not properly sized, it will not work efficiently.Cervical caps (brand name FemCap) are available in 3 sizes: rim diameter 22 mm, 26 mm, and 30 mm.
The smallest diameter cap (22 mm) is intended for women who have never delivered a baby or been pregnant.
The medium diameter cap (26 mm) is intended for women who have been pregnant (even for a short duration of time) but have not delivered vaginally.
The largest diameter cap (30 mm) is intended for women who have delivered a full-term baby vaginally.

, The cervical cap does not offer any protection against sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Because of this, it is highly advisable you and your partner use a condom to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).The cervical cap only helps prevent pregnancy when used together with a spermicidal cream. However, it does not protect you or your partner against STDs.
Latex condoms can prevent the transfer of STDs when used properly during oral, vaginal and anal sex.Use a condom when engaging sex with multiple partners or if you and your partner have not been tested for STDs.
However, never use a condom that has not been stored properly or is damaged. Also, condoms made of natural membranes may not be as effective as latex condoms., Knowing as much information about the cervical cap or any other contraceptive will allow you to use it properly and identify any problems or concerns.


The cervical cap is available by prescription only.
It comes in 3 sizes and you should only use the size that is correct for you.The cervical cap should always be used together with spermicidal cream or gel to prevent pregnancy. When used properly, it provides a physical and spermicidal barrier that prevents sperm cells from entering the uterus and fertilizing an egg.Never use a cervical cap that is broken and use emergency contraception if you find the cap to be torn when you remove it.
You should leave the cap on for at least 6 hours after having intercourse but never use it for more than 48 hours.
The cervical cap can be inserted ahead of time but its application and removal can be cumbersome.
The only brand of cervical cap being used in the United States is the FemCap. It has a removal strap on top of the dome for easy removal and a brim folded upwards to further prevent sperm cells from getting into the uterus.When using a cervical cap, you have an increased risk of vaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis.Cervical caps do not prevent STDs.

, When it comes to effectiveness, the cervical cap is known to be more effective when used by women who have never given birth.Cervical caps are 84-91% effective at preventing pregnancy for women who have never given birth.They are 68-74% effective for women who have given birth.To increase the effectiveness of the cervical cap, it is suggested that couples should use other birth control methods as well. For example, men can use latex condoms or practice the withdrawal method.

Remove the condom promptly.,
Sit on the toilet to remove a condom stuck in the rectum.,
Remove a female condom immediately.,
Visit the emergency room.",How to Remove a Condom Stuck Inside2," If a condom gets stuck inside the rectum, or a female condom gets stuck inside the vagina or rectum, it should be removed immediately. Stop intercourse as soon as you discover the condom has slipped off and have the man remove his penis.There is no need to panic if a condom gets stuck inside you. Most condoms can be retrieved.
If the condom stays inside of you for more than a couple of hours, you may develop an infection.A slipped condom increases your risk for pregnancy and/or STIs. After the condom is removed, you should see your doctor immediately for a checkup and use emergency contraception if you were having vaginal sex.

, If you get a condom stuck in your rectum during anal sex, try to remove it. Sit on the toilet with your knees spread. Try to push down like you are having a bowel movement. This might push the condom down. Carefully insert a finger to try to pull out the condom.If you think you will have a bowel movement soon, you can wait to see if you push the condom out during the bowel movement; however, leaving a condom inside your rectum for long periods of time can cause infections.

, Female condoms can get pushed inside the vagina and get stuck. This happens when the outer ring of the female condom pushes inside the vagina.If the female condom gets pushed inside the vagina, stop sex immediately. Ask your partner to pull the female condom out, or try to insert one or two fingers inside to pull it out yourself.
Make sure to insert a new female condom before having sex again.

, If you get a condom stuck inside your rectum or a female condom stuck in your vagina that you can’t get out, you should visit the emergency room. Due to the way the anal muscles contract, removing a condom may be difficult without the help of a professional.


Never be embarrassed to go to the doctor or emergency room for help with this kind of issue. You should never leave a condom inside your vagina or rectum because it can cause serious complications.

Recognize dangers of a stuck condom.,
Properly put on a condom.,
Take caution after sex is finished.,
Use a female condom properly for anal sex.,
Use latex condoms if possible.",How to Remove a Condom Stuck Inside3," If a condom gets stuck in the vagina or rectum, it can cause problems, like infection. If small parts of a condom get stuck inside you, like from a broken condom, then you may not know it is left inside. Watch for these symptoms:Colored discharge from the vagina or rectum that may have a bad odor
Unusual odor from the area
High temperature
Itching, rash, swelling, or redness around the vagina or rectum
Pain or discomfort when urinating or having a bowel movement
Pain in the pelvic area or the abdomen

, The condom should be put on properly every time you use one. This not only helps protect from STIs and prevent the condom breaking, it also helps keep it from falling off during intercourse.The condom should be unrolled onto an erect penis, making certain to leave room at the tip for the semen. Place the condom on the head of the penis, leaving about a half-inch of space at the top. Pinch the condom at the top, pushing all the air out of it.
Continue unrolling the condom along the shaft of the penis. As you are unrolling, wrap your thumb and index finger around the penis right below the pinched condom to ensure that space remains.
Smooth out any air bubbles that are in the condom.

, Make sure to be careful right after sex to prevent the condom from falling off. You or your partner should hold onto the condom at the base of the penis while pulling out.Your partner should pull out immediately after ejaculation while the penis is still erect. Otherwise, semen can leak out.

, A female condom may get stuck in the rectum if it is used improperly. The rectal muscles can potentially pull a female condom inside the body.If you want to use a female condom for anal sex, make sure to insert the female condom right before engaging in anal sex. Don’t put the female condom in hours before anal sex because that increases the risk of it getting stuck inside.

, Condoms made of latex tend to slip less often than condoms made with polyurethane. Condoms made with polyisoprene slip less than polyurethane and are safe for people with latex allergies.


Polyisoprene condoms have lower breakage and slippage rates, and appear to be as strong and effective as latex.Polyurethane condoms tend to break and slip off more often than others. They appear to be about as effective as latex condoms in preventing pregnancy and STIs."

Start your pill the day after your period ends.,
Take your pill at the same time every day.,
Understand that the pill does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).,
Add it to another part of your daily routine.,
Set an alarm on your cell phone.,
Know what to do if you forget one or more of your pills.,
Know that there are other options for contraception if you have trouble remembering your pill.,
Learn about intrauterine devices (IUDs).,
Inquire about other options for contraception with your family doctor.",How to Remember to Take Your Birth Control Pills," The pill can technically be started at any time, but most doctors recommend this as it is the simplest way to begin. If you begin right after your last period, the pill is usually effective right away. However, some doctors recommend using condoms or spermicide (or an additional ""back-up"" method of birth control for the first month just to make sure). The pill generally consists of 21 days of hormone treatment, followed by 7 days ""off"" (or 7 days of sugar pills, depending what type of pill you are on). Newer pills may only have 4 days 'off' to shorten the duration of the bleeding.;
, It does not matter what time of day you take it, just that you are consistent with it each day.


Remember that you are putting hormones into your body, which will serve to regulate your menstrual cycle. It is important to take the pill at the same time daily in order to keep your hormone levels consistent.
Also, effectiveness of the pill is enhanced for those women who remember to take it at exactly the same time every day.

,


Doctors recommend either to have yourself and your partner tested for STIs prior to sexual intercourse, or to use a form of barrier protection (such as condoms) to diminish the likelihood of contracting a sexually transmitted infection.

, Examples include while eating breakfast in the morning, on the bus on your daily commute, at the same time as brushing your teeth (in the morning or evening), or placing it on your nightstand to take as you go to bed at night.


If you add taking the pill to something that is already a part of your daily routine, it helps you to remember by association.
Try to make it as easy as possible for yourself to remember. For example, if you want to link it to the activity of brushing your teeth, place your pack of pills beside your toothbrush. That way, when you begin brushing, the visual aid of seeing your pills there will help you to remember.
Remember that the more you establish a routine, the more it will become second nature!

, Most people today have their cell phone with them almost all of the time.


Set an alarm for the same time every day, and be sure you are carrying your pills with you at this time.
Some women do this first thing in the morning, or before they go to bed at night (if this is around the same time every day).
Some women carry their birth control pills in their purse so that they are conveniently available at whatever time they set their alarm.

,


If you have forgotten just one pill, take two the following day and resume your normal schedule from there.
If you have forgotten two or more consecutive pills and have had unprotected intercourse, it is advisable to use something called ""emergency contraception."" This can be used up to 5 days after intercourse has taken place to prevent pregnancy.
Options for emergency contraception include Plan B (a progestin-only pill, 89% risk reduction) and Yuzpe (a mixture of progestin and estrogen, 56-89% risk reduction). These can be purchased over the counter at your local pharmacy.
Both pills work better the sooner they are taken, but are effective anytime up to 5 days after having unprotected intercourse. Another option for emergency contraception is insertion of a Copper IUD (99.2% risk reduction). If you have consistent trouble remembering to take your birth control pills, despite the methods suggested above, perhaps it is wise to consider an alternate method of contraception. Some alternate options are outlined in the next section.

, Some women, no matter how hard they try, simply do not feel able to remember to take a pill at the same time every day. The stress can outweigh the benefits, and it can become a constant worry.


In cases such as these, consult your family doctor about alternate methods of contraception. There are a number of options out there, so do not feel limited to the pill if it is too hard for you to remember.

, These are currently the ""gold standard"" (considered the ""best option"" by doctors) for birth control in women, and they are a very good alternative to the pill if you have trouble remembering.


IUDs, after being inserted, last last 3-10 years (depending on the IUD) without needing to be changed. You do not need to ""remember"" to take a pill on a daily basis, which can be simpler for many women.
IUDs are also a more effective means of contraception, with over a 99% success rate (as opposed to a 91% average efficacy with the pill).

, There are numerous options available, including injections, patches, male and female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides to name a few. "

Wait until the penis has become fully erect.,
Add a drop of lube.,
Pull back the foreskin.,
Pinch the reservoir tip of the condom.,
Know what to do if the foreskin doesn't roll down.,
Roll the condom down his penis.,
Push the foreskin gently back toward the tip of the penis.",How to Put On a Condom with Foreskin," Just as with someone who is circumcised, you should always wait until the penis is fully erect and ready for sexual activity before attempting to put on the condom. If you try to put a condom on a non-erect penis, it can result in the condom sliding up, down, or off the penis., Place a small drop of water-based lube on the inside of the condom in the reservoir tip before you unroll it. Water-based lubricant can make it easier for you or your partner to roll the condom onto the penis. It can also increase the sensations he feels during sex.Make sure you put just a small amount of lube in the reservoir tip. Using more lube could take up too much space in the reservoir tip, and leave little to no room for semen.
Use water-based lube only. An oil-based lube can damage the latex condom, and increase the risk for pregnancy and the transmission of STDs., Before you put the condom on, gently pull back the foreskin. Pull it back until the head of the penis is fully exposed. Remember this is a very sensitive area, so be extra gentle.Pulling back the foreskin will make it easier for you to get the condom on properly.


Generally the foreskin will remain securely retracted one you have rolled it down off the head of the penis.
If it rolls back up again before you get the condom, just roll it down and try again.

, When you have rolled the foreskin right down the head of the penis it will, in most instances, remain retracted without you having hold it. Once the foreskin is secure below the head you will have both hands free and are ready to put the condom on.


Before you roll the condom down the penis, use one hand to pinch the reservoir tip of the condom.
This will help remove air from the condom, and prevent air from getting trapped as you roll on the condom., For some men the foreskin is too tight on the head of the penis to be able to roll all the way down the head. Men who are unable to roll the foreskin down may have a condition known as Phimosis. This in itself is nothing to worry about, and if you cannot roll down the foreskin, then you should just roll the condom down your penis and not worry about rolling down the foreskin.


Whether or not you are able to pull the foreskin back should not increase the likelihood of the condom breaking or slipping.
Slipping is normally only an issue when the man has troubling maintaining an erection.
If your Phimosis is causing you difficulty, such as pain during sex, infection or impeding urination, there are some treatments available that you can discuss with your doctor., As you pinch the tip of the condom with one hand, use the other hand to roll the condom down to the base of the penis. Your foreskin should remain retracted while you are unrolling the condom.You will be able to release the end of the condom you are pinching as you roll it down the penis.

, Once you have rolled the condom down to the base of the penis you can ease the foreskin back over the head. Hold onto the base of the condom with one hand, to prevent the condom from sliding off, and gently push the foreskin back up towards the head of the penis.


This will allow for more free movement of the foreskin during sexual activity, and could even help enhance your partner’s pleasure."

, Although Layton does once break his promise to Flora in the Unwound Future, his promise is often 100% reliable. The only reason he ever has to break a promise is when he must.

, Layton observes and remotely remembers every detail he encounters. This is always very helpful when he comes to the final confrontation at the end. Although you don't have to go off on your own private investigation every week with your blue suit apprentice, helping the police is another top priority.


Layton knows that the police have a job to do that is just as important as his own, and he doesn't interfere with them. Although his brainpower is superior to theirs, he does not look down on them, nor does he see the police force as his rivals.

, All Layton's friends are, to a certain degree, intelligent. Dr. Shrader is one obvious example. His best friend, Randall, was also very well educated. Although you may not see why Layton values this, it is vital. Layton knows the importance of true friendship. He can always refer to his friends and he is deeply connected with them.


Your intelligent friends don't have to be world-famous university professors. If you know that your baker-friend is very clever, then don't ditch him in search of somebody else. Knowing the correct type of friendship is a very useful skill.

, Layton's spirit could be the most important thing his personality has. He never will abandon his friends. Perhaps all of us have this spirit deep inside us - after all, it is an instinct to keep going. But letting this go too far is dangerous. Know when the situation is hopeless, and know exactly when to act.

For example, if your older brother is trying to help you with your homework, and you get the answers wrong, don't lash out on him. Thank him for just trying to help you.;
, Don't be picky. Even though you don't like that ugly wool sweater from your grandmother, think that you're lucky to have that sweater because it will keep you warm. A lot of other kids are very cold because they don't have enough money to stay warm. Eat all of your food- Katniss is lucky to get any bite of food on her table.

, It's okay to cry if someone you love dies, or if your best friend is moving away. But don't slump into your seat and pout when you get a bad grade. Be strong. Fight back.

, Don't go around looking like a slob. But being a fashionista shouldn't be your biggest goal. If you really want to look like Katniss, then always wear braids, don't wear as much makeup, and wear what is comfortable before cute.

, Katniss is different. Everyone is different. You should be yourself, everyone else is already taken.

, Katniss is known for her bravery out of many things. She stands up for what she believes in, clearly. Also, if she throws up, she does. No need to tell anyone, right? If she is in The Hunger Games, no need to cry, sob, and scream, just be as brave as possible.

, Katniss does not care too much about herself. She cares about other people and if she has an opportunity to do something, she does it.

, Katniss wears simple colors like brown and black. To get a style like hers, be confident in what you are wearing and do not wear expensive clothing whatever you do. Katniss has brown combat boots so you can get those, or beige boots that go up to her knee. She also has black pants, a brown v-neck, a black top, and her famous brown jacket. In the Hunger Games, she wore a loose black jacket.

, Katniss has black (in the books) or dark brown (in the movies) hair. It is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) below her shoulder when she has it at that famous side braid, so it is at a long length. To get her color, you can use dye, temporary dye, or even a wig. To get her length and style, try growing it out to make it somewhat long. She rarely has her hair down and when it is down, it is wavy, not straight or curly. You can achieve this by after showering, put your hair into a braid(s)and take them out in the morning.

, During Katniss' interview she wore smoky eyes, red lipstick and body glitter.

, Volunteer for charities. Katniss always help others before herself.

Be thoughtful.,
Be soft spoken.,
Maintain your dignity.,
Be a lady.,
Be yourself.",How to Be Like Evelyn Johnson (Pearl Harbor)1," Evelyn was a nurse, so she was especially thoughtful towards other people's feelings. She let Rafe off when he couldn't pass the eye test, because of his passion and strong will for flying. She forgot about her desire for Rafe as she was pregnant with Danny's baby.


Just remember that caring for other people's feelings doesn't necessarily mean forgetting about your own — although Evelyn was thoughtful, she was definitely not a pushover.;
, At no point in the movie do you see Evelyn raise her voice because of her emotions. She is extremely soft spoken and temper-controlled. This coincides with manners — when Danny knocks on her door and wakes Evelyn and the other nurses, she's polite and thanks him for dropping off her handkerchief when it wasn't necessary at all.

, Dignity is when you have the quality of being worthy of respect. Everyone deserves respect, but not everyone has self-respect, like Evelyn does. When Rafe was trying to ask Evelyn out on a date, she wasn't having any of it considering he was bent over with his backside on full display. She refused to accept his offer of going out on a date as he was asking very sloppily — until he made an effort and turned up to the hospital (Evelyn's workplace) at night, as she was leaving with her friends — with a bottle of champagne. This shows Evelyn was not easy to get, until Rafe made more of an effort to show how much she was worth.

, This may seem hard in today's modern generation, but having manners and class can really change the way you see yourself as well as how others see you. Evelyn was definitely liked by many due to her friendly and fun nature. Being a lady isn't walking around like you're the best there ever was; it's being generous, elegant and kind. Evelyn was all of these things.

, This may seem completely hypocritical as referring to the title of this how to. But, Evelyn was definitely full of life and let her personality shine through as well as having all of those previously mentioned good personality traits. She was definitely a joker — the 2nd to opening scene proves that — but she was well mannered and lady like too.

"
"
Get the makeup down.,
Get the hair.,
Emulate Evelyn's style.",How to Be Like Evelyn Johnson (Pearl Harbor)2," Evelyn's make up is pretty and brings out her best features while including red lipstick. Here are some make up tips for getting Evelyn's look:


Women in 1940s generally sported red lipstick as it was one of the few lipsticks out at the time. To get Evelyn's signature red lip, a few lipsticks you could try are: MAC Matte Ruby Woo, MAC Matte Russian Red, and MAC Matte Lady Danger.
Perfect, usually matted, powdered base.
Dark grey/slightly black eyeshadow or a slight winged eye liner and of course, mascara.
Her makeup was never overbearing.
Her nails would have more than likely always matched her lip colour.
Her eyebrows were tamed and shaped.

, Women in the 1940s made a huge effort with their hair — straight or messy hair was not at all in fashion back then — hence why Evelyn's hair was always perfectly styled. Don't sport any highlights or eccentric rainbow dyes — stick to solid colors such as black, deep dark brown, auburn, brown, or blonde.


Evelyn would have used hot rollers to curl her hair, made pin curls or used wave clips. She is often seen throughout the movie with curly hair with one side pinned back.

, Firstly, hosiery were a huge thing in the 1940s. Evelyn would always have been wearing stockings. Clear, fishnets or seamed stockings. For more information on 1940s American style: wikihow.com/Dress-in-American-1940s-Fashion


Evelyn and many women in 1940s dressed ""old Hollywood"".
Long dresses, no denim and of course high-waist bikinis.
Evelyn's lingerie would have always been lace or silk.
Flat shoes were not in style in the 1940s — all women would have had at least a slight heel on their shoe.

Be a loyal friend.,
Stay mysterious.,
Break the rules.",How to Be Like Alaska Young1," Alaska Young is beautiful, and she is mysterious. She is a free-spirited person who is spontaneous. She is not a rigid personality, nor is she a conforming one.

, Alaska is known for being outgoing and is always the first to come up with fun ideas. This could be smiling at new people, being inquisitive or being the leader of the conversation. Ensure that whatever you do is memorable.


Be creative. Pranks are a key part of the story, and Alaska is one of the main characters who comes up with the elaborate ideas for these.
If you're not sure whether pulling a prank is your idea of creativity then perhaps try to incorporate it into a different medium such as storytelling.

, Alaska stands up for her friends. When a teacher starts lecturing Miles, Alaska stood up and stuck up for him.


Alaska was a great friend. While undeniably moody, she was not afraid to help out her friends and not abandon them when they got in trouble. She was also very honest with them, making sure they knew how she felt about certain things.
Alaska also stands up for her beliefs. Just because you're friendly and flirty doesn't mean people should be able to walk all over you.

Alaska is really using alcohol to drowned her suffering because of her mother’s death. She is full of guilt and blame, and she is an emotional person. In real life, you should find better ways to cope with suffering and pain than alcohol, which can lead to more problems. She loves drinking wine.

"
"
Show intense emotions.,
Talk about death.,
Love to read.",How to Be Like Alaska Young2," Alaska is not a cold person. She has strong emotions, and they see saw back and forth. In one part of the book, she is described as a person who goes “from a hundred miles an hour to asleep in a nanosecond.”


Sometimes in the book, Alaska is funny and very bubbly. In the next moment, she might switch to being cold and condescending. Sometimes she breaks down into tears.

She reads deep messages into things other people think are just pranks. Alaska’s life ends tragically. If you have thoughts of self-harm, you should seek help from a trusted adult or a counselor. Being as sad as Alaska Young is really not something you should desire.
Alaska is self-destructive, whether it’s substance abuse or cheating on a boyfriend. These are ways that she numbs her pain. She carries a lot of suffering and pain inside. Her mother died of an aneurysm in front of her when she was a young child, and she didn’t call 911.

, Alaska Young is a girl who loves books. Reading goes along with Alaska’s complexity. She’s smart, and she’s deep. She’s not a shallow person.


Alaska collects books from yard sales. If you’re not interested in books, you’re not going to quite capture her vibe.Reading adds layers of complexity to Alaska’s personality. She is interested in exploring other worlds and gets lost in other people’s lives because she rejects the concept of home for herself.

"
"

Have curves.,
Wear your hair dark and long.,

(Re)Read the Vampire Academy and Bloodlines series by Richelle Mead.",How to Be Like Sydney Sage from the Bloodlines Series," Sydney has golden-blonde hair that is layered and shoulder-length. Try to dye it a natural-looking blonde, because Sydney doesn't dye her hair, so you don't want to make it obvious. Go to a professional to get it dyed or cut to the correct length so that you don't botch it up. Keep your hair straight and use hairspray to keep it perfect all day long.;
, Sydney's eyes are brown, and are molten gold when she stands in the light.

, If you've read the Bloodlines series by Richelle Mead, you know that Sydney wears business casual clothing in non-descript colors. Invest in some khaki or dress pants and some plain blouses. You can still look cute in these clothes, don't worry! Pick solid colors in white, off-white, beige, gray, peach, tan, and occasionally black (seriously, don't over-do it on the black) and match them up nicely.

, In the Bloodlines books, Sydney is close to an eating disorder, which is very unhealthy. If you want to be thin like Sydney Sage, just exercise and eat healthy. Do NOT starve yourself or restrict your calorie intake as she does. Remember, as much as we all love Sydney, she is just a fictional book character.

, The only jewelry Sydney wears is a small and simple golden cross around her neck.

, If you're dressing up as Sydney Sage for roleplay purposes, make sure you include the golden lily on her left cheek that identifies her as an Alchemist. Make sure you don't use anything that is permanent. If you're going for an everyday look, you should probably skip the facial tattoo.

, Sydney wears very little makeup and still looks beautiful. For those of us who aren't so lucky, try a no-makeup makeup look. You can find plenty of tutorials on the internet. I suggest using foundation and powder that is the exact shade as your skin to even out your skintone, some brown eyeliner (because brown looks more natural and isn't as dramatic as black) to make your eyelashes look thicker, some lip balm or chapstick, and to fill in your eyebrows (not heavily, though; make it look as natural as possible).

, As you probably know, Sydney Sage is very intelligent. She speaks five languages and is enrolled in many AP classes during her stay at Amberwood. Get an A+ on all of your homework and quizzes and have a love of learning, just as she does. Read educational books in your spare time (Greek Architecture, maybe?), and always be involved in your classes. Learn to love school and education. Make sure you're always a step (or five steps) ahead of everyone else, but don't intentionally be a show off.

, Sydney is polite to everyone. Always say ""Yes/No, sir"" and ""Yes/No, ma'am""  when spoken to. Be obedient and do as you're told, without argument, unless you see a flaw in the plan, but do not let anyone walk all over you or do anything you're not comfortable with. Stay silent until you feel you need to talk and always pay attention to your surroundings and what people around you are saying.

, Sydney has had to face some pretty tough situations and had to make decisions, based on what she believed was right, even though her beliefs changed over time. Be brave, even when you don't feel like it.

, Always have your school assignments in on time and take up some extra responsibilities at home and work. Be reliable and make sure you do everything perfect the first time.

, While Sydney belonged to the Alchemists, she really had to fend for herself once she was out in the field, with minimal help from her higher-ups. Make sure that you don't rely too heavily on anyone else and don't whine when you don't get your way. Keep your head held high, even when you're being interrogated or insulted. Don't break down and cry in front of anyone.

, Sydney is very organized. Feel free to color-code and containerize everything! Make sure everything is always spotless and orderly, just like Sydney Sage. If organizing is new to you, you can find plenty of tutorials on wikihow and the rest of the internet.

, This one is obviously optional, but Sydney Sage believes in a higher power. That doesn't mean you should too, but Sydney does, so I thought I should include it, as well.  But also, whether you're religious or not, respect everyone else's beliefs and religions, even if you don't agree.

, You never see Sydney Sage wearing indecent clothes or chasing after multiple men (in fact, if you noticed, they chase her). Learn how to be a proper lady and act modest.

, While sometimes Sydney can come off as mysterious, she does tend to show off her extensive knowledge to others. Do this carefully, though. You don't want to come off as arrogant.

, Even though Sydney didn't like the Moroi and Dhampirs at first, she warmed up to them and ended up helping them out with quite a lot. Don't be shy to help others out and put yourself last sometimes.

, Yes, Sydney can come off that way, but she's really not. Find the right balance so that you don't make yourself look bad. Again, we all love Sydney, but she is a fictional character.

, Sydney Sage loves coffee! She drinks tons of the stuff a day, however, make sure, if you're going to drink a lot of coffee, that you switch to decaf. Sydney's addiction to caffeine is pretty unhealthy.

, Syndey's mom is a mechanic, and she transferred her love of cars to Sydney. Make sure you know all about classic cars (and don't be shy to name your car, as well).

, You almost never hear Sydney swear or curse. If you do have that bad habit, stop. It doesn't look good on anyone.

, These are some of Sydney's cutest traits. She's very clever and funny when she wants to be, but she doesn't offend anyone and uses clean humor. So no perverted jokes!

, Sydney Sage is anything but trashy. She's very educated and mature and hardly ever flirts with anyone (unless it's with Adrian Ivashkov!).

, Sydney has the ability to remain calm in very tough situations. You often see that she schools her face to a neutral facial expression. Be careful when you do this, though, you don't want to come off as cold, emotionless, and creepy.

, Sydney doesn't really have emotional breakdowns and she keeps her head, even when things get really bad. If she does break down, it's in private.

, Syndey views everything logically. This can make it hard to relate to others her age, but it helps her cope in life or death situations. It's also one of the things that makes her seem so smart.

, Sydney won't touch the stuff!

, Sydney takes her time with things so that she gets it right the first time. She hates making mistakes.

, Nothing escapes Sydney's notice. Look over everything at least twice and think about it from every angle before making a decision or commenting on something.

, Sydney's job requires her to be placed in dangerous situations and she hates feeling helpless. If you do take a self-defense class, make sure you find the right one for you.

, I don't believe this is in the book, but I can't imagine Sydney Sage slouching. This doesn't mean sit rigidly straight, but try to keep your shoulders back to look more professional and put-together.

, Everything Sydney does is professional and tidy. Make no mistakes and always be prepared.

, If you really want to be like Sydney Sage, don't just take advice from me, take it from the source itself! Really get to know the character so that you know what she would and would not do or say in a certain situation.

, Acacia usually dyes her hair once in a while, and loves to experiment with her look. You can try dying your hair a natural dark brown, or a dark blonde, and try growing it out to rock the wavy look, or straightening it and letting it fall to your shoulders, or dyeing it ombre purple, or bleaching it blonde, or getting extensions, or cutting it into a bob. You can also try bangs and then grow them out so they fall to the sides of your face. Here are some other Acacia tricks that you can try:


Use an Instyler to get fashionable straight hair.
Add some bouncy curls to your look.

, If you want to get the Acacia look, then you should wear shorts and crop tops for the summer. For winter, rock some skinny jeans, oversized sweaters, and Uggs. Even add the occasional cute accessory, like panda mittens, to your style. You can keep it casual, too. You can often find Acacia in a cute white t-shirt, fitted jeans, and ordinary shoes. Here are some ways you can rock one of her looks:


Wear a simple white tank-top.
Wear a belly shirt with jean shorts during the summer.
Wear oversized purple sunglasses or thick-framed black glasses.
Wear a long gold necklace.
Put a few chunky bracelets on your left wrist.
Rock a D.A.R.E. t-shirt. Acacia likes the color and thinks these shirts send a powerful message.

, Acacia has a weirdly unoriginal, and awkward personality. If you want to be like Acacia, there are a number of things you can do. Don't be afraid to be a goofball. Acacia isn't too cool to make fun of herself, to talk in a funny accent, or to dance around like a goofball.


So, don't be so obsessed with being cool that you forget to laugh. She'll also stop and make a silly face at the camera by bugging out her eyes and pursing her lips.

, Being an Internet celebrity isn't all about fun and games. Be prepared to acknowledge the dark side of being a Tumblr girl. Acacia isn't always a fun-loving free spirit.

, Acacia's friend Lizzie is her best friend and you can find her in a number of her videos. Acacia loves shouting out to her close friends.

, Acacia loves to take selfies, no matter where she is! In some of her photos, she looks cute or sexy, while in others, she's pouting at the camera and just having fun and being silly. Take a mix of pictures that show all of your different expressions while rocking different styles.


Acacia likes to use the ""Valencia"" filter on Instagram. Next time you take a photo, do the same.

You need to get all of the correct clothes to look like Marilyn.,
Get your hair done.,
You also need some perfect skin.,
Now for the makeup.,
For the body, you need to exercise.,
Now, follow her diet.,
Play her sports.,
Talk like her.,
Love and be loved, talk and be talked to, walk and be walked towards.",How to Be Just Like Marilyn Monroe (Preteens)," Marilyn's favorite colors were beige, brown, black, cream, forest green, white, and red. She avoided bright colors, other than red. But, your parents may not like you walking around in bright red and black. So, it is acceptable for you to wear hot pink, pale pink, royal blue, royal purple, and other bright colors in moderation. You also probably can't wear her revealing dresses. But, you can wear pencil skirts, sweaters, capris, shirt dresses, knee-length jeans, blouses, fitted jackets, full skirts, A-line skirts and dresses, narrow and tight pants which were worn at home and leisure, and hourglass dresses. Wear these in Marilyn's colors.


At school, if you don't have a uniform, wear the suggested clothing items, even the pants if you want. Try to wear skirts and dresses as much as possible. If you have a uniform, get collared shirts in the suggested colors and wear black, beige, or brown skirts and capris, if allowed. If you can wear jeans, wear dark-wash and black jeans. Roll them up to your knees or get them in a flare or bootcut style. If your uniform is stricter, wear it and accessorize with small gloves, an old fashioned scarf, a belt around the waist, etc.;
, Marilyn was a golden blond, but Norma was a brunette. If you want blond hair and you have light brown or red hair, use a mixture of lemon or lime juice mixed with shampoo and water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide. Spray it on your hair once a day until you run out and your hair should have significantly lightened. Repeat for better results. Try not to get highlights. If you have them, make them strawberry blond to golden blond. If you have dark hair, you can try to lighten it to a lighter brown or let it be. You also need it cut. Get a shoulder length 'do with short layers in the front and long layers in the back. Try to get a set of rollers. If you can't, get yourself some bobby pins and make pin curls! You will also need some gel so your style will hold.

, Marilyn used extremely expensive creams, but you can probably do fine with some acne face wash, a toner, pimple cream, and facial moisturizer. In the morning, use a toner or lemon/lime juice, tighten your skin with an ice cube, and apply pimple cream and facial moisturizer. In the evening, use your face wash, toner, ice cube, pimple cream, and moisturizer.

, If you aren't allowed to wear makeup, skip this step. If you are, keep reading. Make your nose look smaller by applying blush to the tip and some petroleum jelly. Also, use a pink or coral blush under your cheekbones. Blend a cream highlighter around the nose, above the cheekbones, across the eye lids and forehead, and in the space between your nose and eyes. Point your eyebrows with tweezing and an eyebrow filler. Contour your jaw line with a dark powder, along with the hollows of your cheeks, temples, under your chin, and neck. Use a white eyeshadow from your lash line to brow bone. Then use a brown eyeshadow to contour the outer crease. Then lined the lash line with a black or brown eye liner and flicked it at the end. Line your bottom lash line halfway between the ends. Brighten the gap between the inner corner and the middle with a white eyeshadow. Curl and applied a couple of coats of mascara to your eyelashes. Apply a pink lip liner to your lips, since you probably can't use red. Then, apply a darker pink in the outer corner that blends into a lighter pink in the middle of your lips. Use a highlighter on the upper and lower parts of your lips.

, In the mornings after washing your face and brushing your teeth, lay down next to your bed with 5 pound weights. Spread your arms next to you and slowly lift them to a point above your head. Do this 15 times. Then, put your arms on the ground above your head and lift them directly over. Do this 15 times. Then, put your arms on your stomach and lift them from your stomach to above your head. Do this 15 times. Then, circle your arms until they are tired. Go jogging in the mornings too.

, For breakfast, have orange juice, cereal, two slices of crisp toast with butter, and hot cocoa or milk. For a snack, have milk and 1 cracker. For lunch, have 1 egg or cottage cheese, 1 potato or spaghetti or 1/2 cup of noodles without cheese, stale toast with butter, and Jello or cooked fruit. For and afternoon snack, have the same as before or fruits and vegetables. For dinner, have a type of meat, a potato, 1/2 a cup of vegetables, and a slice of bread with butter. For dessert, eat junket, tapioca, rice pudding, baked apple, custard, or eggnog. Try to add extra fruits and vegetables as additional snacks or with meals.

But, she was leaving it to the men to do swimming, golfing, and softball. Recommended sports would be horse-back riding, hiking, canoeing, surfing, running, and weight training.

Be cute and sweet.,
Be a little bit mysterious.,
Have some kind of a medallion, necklace or bracelet with an old sign or engraving on it.,
Wear interesting, but beautiful clothing.,
Don't wear tons of make-up!,
Be all about NATURE!,
If you're ill or sick, or someone else is ill and sick, ALWAYS carry herbs and oils with you (make sure to really learn about them first - what healing qualities they have and how can they help you or others) and try not to use medicine at first.,
Go outside A LOT!,
Have your own garden!,
Have the materials.,
HAVE A SPELL BOOK!,
Overall, just love nature and what you do!",How to Be a Witch Like Bonnie Bennett," Although witches are supposed to be very dark and introverted, Bonnie is always really sweet and is a great friend who likes to have fun and party. If you're a witch, it doesn't mean that you have to be closed down in a coffin all day, and not talk to anyone at school. That won't make you a witch - it'll make you a loner. It'll also make you feel bad and upset, so just be yourself - have fun, laugh, be caring and loving and help others.;
, When something weird happens, like, for example, a candle lights itself on fire or there's suddenly heavy rain, when there was sun a minute before, and people start saying things like: ""Wow, how did that happen?"" or ""This is so strange! It's almost magic! Impossible!"", don't look surprised or scared. Just say something like: ""Everything is possible."" and walk away, or look at your own hands and then look back to the object that has suddenly changed, and look really shocked and even a bit scared. This will create an illusion for people, and they'll think that it was actually YOU who lit the candle on fire without touching it, or YOU who suddenly changed the weather.

, It'll make people think it's some kind of a relic that your family's witches passed on for thousands of years. Wear it everyday and everywhere, and NEVER take it off when others see it, and if someone asks you something about it, just smile mysteriously and say: ""Oh, it's very important to me. I couldn't go without it. It's like... How to say... My energy source."" and laugh.

, Be stylish! Bonnie doesn't wear capes and black hats, not at all! She likes to buy clothing from shops like Free People, she's normally wearing tunics and leggings, with loads of different bracelets and feathers added to it. Her style is very hippy-ish and natural. Her hair is mostly down in beautiful, natural waves, so don't overdo the whole dressing part - make it natural, pretty and laid back with a touch of hippy.

, It's all about natural here. You're a witch, not a mannequin. Don't wear massive amounts of powder and make yourself look ""cakey"". You might wear some lip gloss or lip balm, some cheek stain and some concealer - but that's it. Don't fake it! Witches are ALL about nature. Which leads us to another step...

, If you're already a vegetarian, it's great, but you don't really have to become one, as long as you live ecologically. Recycle every day, live a healthy lifestyle, don't even eat the junk food, and always say things like: ""I'd never eat that badness they put in the food you all eat every day!"" and ALWAYS bring your own herbs, natural fresh salads and veggies to school in a lunch box, and disagree to eat the food they give you. Also, try to learn all the names of the plants you're eating, all the vegetables, fruits, herbs, and oils... A witch knows it all! Go to your local library or buy a book, and just examine all the plants, learn their good qualities, learn what you shouldn't mix together, how you should eat them, what their meanings are... You'll see how people will start coming to you and asking you about herbs and essences, and you'll feel really smart and cool about it.

, For example, if someone trips and falls and start bleeding, run to them, take your herbs and tell the person to press them to their wound. Of course, if no herbs can help, always use medicine, because sometimes, when you're just too ill, herbs are just too weak to heal you - you need real medicine. But when it's not too harsh - try doing it the natural way.

, Remember - you're best friends with nature. Whenever there's good weather, always go out and smile when you're walking - touch the trees, the leaves, take deep breaths and relax. Think of it this way - it's a therapy. Love every inch of the earth - and love every animal on it. Even snakes or spiders - never say you're scared of them. If someone starts saying: ""Oh, I hate snakes and spiders! They're so sneaky!"", try saying something like this: ""They're only sneaky when you treat them bad. We're all animals, one way or another. So it means that we might be sneaky when someone acts bad with US, too. You have to love the nature."". When there's bad weather, and people go all sad and depressed, saying that they can't go out anywhere, and how they hate the rain and the cold, just explain: ""Just smell it. Smell the rain, sense the freshness of the earth after it. Hear the water drops on your window pane. Isn't it beautiful? The air will now be fresh and clean. Everything happens for a purpose."" and then add happily: ""Oh! My herbs in my garden will be watered. Isn't that great? I hope those rosemary shrubs will finally grow."". And THIS leads us to...

, If you're living in a house and if you have your own back yard - you're lucky. Witches use natural herbs and oils. Why not grow your own patch of them? Wouldn't that be awesome? Just buy a gardening book, some seeds of the healing and good-quality herbs you want to grow, and start the gardening! Make fresh salad from them. Make meals and even smoothies, if you like them. When you're coming to your friend's house, ALWAYS bring your own fresh veggies and herbs, and make some salad for everyone. It's really cool! You can even learn to make your own oils, just find a book or Google it, and you're all set! People will love you for your love for nature, and how individual and awesome you are. If you live in a flat, try growing some plants and herbs in your balcony - just buy some pots and soil and do it, as well! Become a professional at it - it's awesome. Try to feel the connection between you and the plants. Love them.

, Witches never use fake, unnatural materials. Try buying some crystals and stones with good and healing qualities. Some may strengthen your brain work, some will make you relax, some will make you happy... There are thousands of different meanings - check them out and learn some of them. Try keeping them at home - and even give a person that stone if he/she is sad or depressed or unhappy, saying: ""This is ""...."" It'll help you with ""...."" Carry it, and it'll help. I promise."" Always have a pestle and mortar, and on your free time experiment with herbs and make oils, grind them and make powder, just read all the books you can about these kind of things - don't do it by your own mind. You might not know how dangerous some herbs can be - always find out what can happen and be careful when you do it.

, It's essential for a witch! Just take an old-looking leather notebook with old, yellow-ish paper, and write all of your experiments, all herbal meanings, you can even create your own spells that you say while you're grinding the herbs and spells you say when you're planting the plants... Just create your own! Write everything you learn about plants and herbs and how they work; it's so interesting and fun! Keep this spell book in a safe, secret place.

, Being a witch is being at peace with nature, you have to be a part of it. You have to FEEL it, you have to LOVE it and ENJOY it."

Dim the lights.,
Prepare the bedroom.,
Encourage a relaxing hobby at bedtime.,
Exercise to relax.",How to Cause a Person to Fall Asleep1," Approximately one hour before bed, dim the lights slightly in the person's home or apartment. Bright lights create stimulation in the brain, and as a result, can make it more difficult to fall asleep. By dimming them, a person more likely to fall asleep later on at night.


If the lights in the house or apartment cannot be dimmed, one alternative is to turn off all overhead lighting and leave a few smaller lamps on to create a dimmed effect.;
, Set the room to a comfortable temperature if the home or apartment has a thermostat. If the room is too cold, the person will not be comfortable enough to sleep because he or she will feel chilly. If it's too warm, he or she will be sweaty and uncomfortable. Usually, a temperature around 72ºF (21ºC) is ideal. Also, try to keep the room as quiet as possible by closing windows.


In a home or apartment without a thermostat, try providing a fan to keep the person cool or extra blankets to keep them warm.

, Rather than getting into bed and immediately turning off the lights to go to sleep, encourage the person to pick up a relaxing hobby once they get in bed. This will help bring the day to a close. By relaxing before bed with a repetitive activity, the person will be less stimulated, and thus be more likely to fall sleep. Try reading for 30 minutes before bed, for instance.
Be sure they do not reach for their tablet of phone. Once in bed, the bright lights from their tablet or phone will stimulate their brain and make it difficult to fall asleep after they are turned off.

, After their new nighttime activity, such as reading, suggest that the person further relax through exercise. One exercise frequently recommended includes progressive muscle relaxation, which involves going through each muscle group in the body and flexing and relaxing it. Another suggested exercise is deep breathing, which will also help prepare the person for bed.


You may also suggest mental exercise which will distract the mind, for instance, thinking of fruits and vegetables that begin with the same letter. "

Cut down on the coffee and fatty foods.,
Eliminate alcohol close to bed time.,
Establish a regular schedule.,
Exercise during the day.",How to Cause a Person to Fall Asleep2," Coffee and other caffeinated drinks, such as soda, energy drinks, tea, and hot chocolate, are stimulates. They make it very difficult to fall asleep, particularly if they are consumed later on in the day. If someone you know is having trouble sleeping, it could be because of caffeine consumption. Encourage them to stop drinking caffeinated drinks around 12:00PM, and remind them that the effects of caffeine last four to seven hours. Likewise, fatty and sugary foods are difficult for the body to digest and can cause indigestion and stomach aches. These issues can make sleep difficult, so they should not be consumed later in the day.


Suggest gradually reducing the amount of caffeine the person consumes in a day. For instance if they drink three cups of coffee, reduce that to two and a half for a week, and then to two cups the following week.

, Alcohol before bed can increase anxiety, making it more difficult to sleep. If the person enjoys drinking at night, his or her last drink should be three hours before bed. In addition, they should limit themselves to two or three drinks for the entire day. , Suggest that the person wake up at the same time everyday, including the weekends. Importantly, they should wake up at the same time regardless of what time they managed to fall asleep the night before. This should be done even if the person has a hard time waking up in the morning. By sticking the the same wake up time, their body will begin to adjust to a new schedule, and become tired at a certain time each night. This will aid in falling asleep. , A regular exercise routine has multiple benefits for sleep. Firstly, it will help reduce anxiety that can cause sleeplessness. Secondly, it will help the person become tired. Walking has been shown to be the best exercise to promote sleep. "

Consult a sleep specialist.,
Expect tests at the sleep specialist.,
Follow the specialist's recommendations.",How to Cause a Person to Fall Asleep3," If the person continues to have difficulty falling asleep, you may suggest that he or she visit a sleep specialist. People who visit sleep specialists are those who are complain about lack of sleep quality and/or quantity. Their are 88 different types of sleep disorders, and a specialist will be able to help your friend or loved one tackle their specific sleeping problem. A primary care physician may refer someone to a sleep specialist based upon symptoms, so their doctor can be their first stop.

, The sleep specialist will ask a number of questions to determine if the patient needs further testing. The test, called a polysomnogram, measures activity during sleep through electrodes attached to the body.


The polysomnogram will measure heart rate, brainwaves, eye movement, muscle tension, air flow, and more. , There are a number of possible suggestions that a specialist will make. It may be that they suggest behavioral therapy, for instance changing lifestyle and habits (as mentioned above). It is also possible they will suggest medication to help with sleeplessness, or suggest devices that will make it easier to breath at night. Whatever the suggestions of the specialist, make sure your friend or loved one follows the directions exactly.

Perfect your outerwear.,
Find a brown leather backpack, similar to that which Gwen uses for school.

,
Try to imitate her personality.",How to Be Inspired by Gwen Stacy's Style," Dye your hair blonde. Gwen has soft and straight hair. In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, she has curly hair, so you can curl your hair, if it suits you. Wear a plain black headband, or if your hair is long, tie it into a mid-high ponytail. Use a red ribbon to make a bow around the base of the ponytail.;
, Try to replicate Gwen's sassy and cute style .Draw a fine black line with eyeliner pencil on your upper lids to keep your eyes beautiful and strong. Then use a plethora of colors on your lids—blues, browns, frosty whites, and grays—but keep the shadow very soft and pretty. Don't do anything to glamorize yourself. Just use a little foundation and soft peachy blushes. Add a moisturizing lip balm in the same color as your lips, just to keep them looking moist and soft.

, Gwen looks amazing in above-knee skirts, not too short, but long enough to be professional while still showing off her legs. Gwen works at Oscorp, so she can’t wear anything too flashy, so she usually wears dark colors or tartan plaids.

, They are your new best friend. In order to intern in a high-end science lab, Gwen needs clothes that are comfortable and look decent with a white lab coat. She likes wearing sweaters–a lot of sweaters— sometimes with Oxford shirts underneath, sometimes without. An example- wearing a sleeveless v-neck sweater over a white t-shirt; completely cute while being functional enough to run away from animal hybrid super villains.

, Acquire boots. And then, maybe some more boots. Gwen’s signature boots hit right below the knee, which visually elongates the legs. You’ll want to have one black pair and one that’s a light tan or khaki color. A nice pair of rain boots is also a good idea, since leather and suede boots tend not to be very wet-friendly. Gwen wears knee high cable knit socks that barely stick out to complete the “I’m wearing boots. Don’t mess with me,” look. Avoid boots with too much of a heel–that tends to make it difficult to chase around after your swinging-from-rooftops mutant-spider boyfriend.

, Add ankle boots or moccasins with a denim skirt. At one point in the movie, Gwen wears a classy polka-dot dress with a navy blue cardigan. A smart move on her part; if it got warm she could just lose the cardigan and still look put together.

, You can, of course, wear pants. When Gwen has to deliver some sad news to Peter, it’s raining out so she wears skinny jeans with a tunic sweater to stay warmer. However, in keeping with her cool professionalism, skip the ripped and slashed jeans and opt for cords or slim jeans in neutral colors. Besides basic denim, try out colors like wine, navy or olive green.

, Outerwear is pretty important, as New York City can be chilly, especially on rainy days. A good choice would be to bundle up in a classic pea coat, or trench coat, or a nice big sweater that is warm enough to serve as a coat. Add a cable hat or cute patterned scarf as necessary.

,, Gwen is smart and intelligent and is a gifted scholar in the field of biochemistry. If you don't like this subject, go for another. Gwen is one of the few people to know Spider-Man's true identity.That means people can trust her. Be truthful and responsible. Gwen is known as the ""beauty queen"" in high school with her looks, so don't overdo it, but don't be afraid to add something different once in a while!

Talk to your doctor if your nighttime stress continues or worsens.",How to Sleep when Stressed," Stress is a physical response to something that might harm you in some way. In other words, it is your body’s way of protecting you from a perceived threat. People respond to stress in different ways. Some people go into what is known as “fight” mode when they are stressed, which causes them to become angry and agitated. Others may go into what is known as the “flight” mode and become withdrawn and depressed. Still others may go into “freeze” mode and seem incapable of doing anything when they are stressed. Depending on how you respond to stress, it may keep you up at night.For example, you may see failing an exam as a threat to your academic goals and go into “fight” mode. Therefore, your body may react by causing you to feel stressed so that you stay up late and study hard. But after you have finished studying, the effects of stress may wear on and keep you up at night. In this way, stress can be both beneficial and harmful. While you may benefit from studying, you still need your rest to function well.;
, If you are so stressed that you cannot sleep, it is important to pinpoint the cause(s) of your stress. Figuring out what is bothering you and doing what you can to deal with the problem may help you to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. Consider what you are stressed about and how you can resolve the problem.For example, if you are feeling stressed because of an upcoming exam, you may help to soothe your stress by studying well before the exam rather than waiting until the night before to cram.
If you are dealing with something that is beyond your control, such as an illness, you may be able to soothe your stress by talking about the problem with a trusted friend or writing about it in a journal.

, Journaling is a helpful way to handle things that you can’t control but still may stress about, such as other people’s feelings or one day getting eaten by a freak land-shark in the middle of Kansas (worry isn’t necessarily rational). Try getting out all of your worries on paper. This can often provide an immediate sense of relief.Ask yourself whether what’s stressing you out is a “what if.” These are the uncontrollable thoughts, like land-sharks in Kansas. Are you posing a hypothetical? Is it beyond what you could control? Remind yourself that you cannot control anything but your own actions and responses. This can help you set those other worries free.Ask yourself whether you are worrying about someone else’s actions or feelings. You can’t control anyone’s actions other than your own, but this likely doesn’t stop you from worrying about other people sometimes. Try acknowledging that you are worried but reminding yourself that you aren’t responsible for anyone other than yourself, like so: “I’m stressed about my job. I think my boss may fire me. I can’t control what he does. He is unfriendly and aggressive, even though I always do my best. I don’t even like working there because he’s so unpleasant. Rather than just worrying, I am going to put out some applications for a new job tomorrow.” By letting go of your need to control others, you allow yourself to let go of the stress that accompanies that need.

, If you have determined that the stress is due to something that you can address, try writing out a list of some options for addressing it. Actively problem-solving can help you feel like you are making progress toward solving the source of your stress, rather than allowing yourself to get stuck in a negative feedback loop.For example, if you’re worried about that huge test tomorrow, consider whether it would address your stress for you to study more. Are you really likely to learn a lot more between now and the test by cramming? Science says no.However, you could take action for the rest of the class by deciding to speak with your teacher or find a tutor in the subject. These will not necessarily help you ace the test, but they are decisions that can help you stop stressing about your overall performance in the class.
People also often worry about big things such as their relationships and jobs at night, because they finally have the free time to think about them. Resolve to handle what’s causing you stress the next day (or the next week, or however long you need to make a plan). For example: “I’m really stressed about my boyfriend. He doesn’t talk to me as much as he did. I will speak with him tomorrow and ask what’s going on.”
Once you have resolved on your action, let it go. You know what you are going to do about your stress tomorrow. You can’t do anything else tonight, so let yourself relax and sleep so you’ll be better prepared to put your plan into action.

, Instead of trying to suppress your stress, give yourself a short, set period of time earlier in the day during which you can worry away.Make sure not to let the period become too long, or you risk falling into rumination, that obsessive process in which your thoughts just repeat over and over without addressing anything.Try to puzzle out what’s worrying you during your worry period. Really run with it. Try writing out a list of everything that’s got you stressed out. You can refer to this list during your daily worry break.
Be kind to yourself as you worry. Try not to beat yourself up over your stress. Acknowledge that worry and stress happen to everyone. They’re not a sign that anything is “wrong” with you.
Plan to worry later. Sometimes, it can help to tell yourself that you will worry about something later (perhaps during your designated worry break!). This way, you acknowledge that you are feeling stressed, but you’re also able to save that stress to deal with later so you can drift off now.

, Some people like to get ready for the following day by making a to-do list, laying out clothes, preparing a lunch, and doing other things to make arrangements for the next day. But it is important to do these things earlier in the day so that you are less likely to be thinking about everything you need to do the following day when you go to bed. Make all of your preparations for the following day at least a few hours before bed so that you have time to wind down after you are done., Take deep, even breaths throughout this exercise.Next, try to focus your senses on what your body is experiencing. Can you sense where your body is in most contact with the bed? What do your sheets feel like? Is the room warm or cold?
Bring your notice to your breath. Can you feel it in your body? Can you feel your chest and abdomen rise and fall as you breathe?
Redirect your attention -- without judging yourself -- back to your breathing if it wanders. It’s natural for your mind to wander, especially at first. Acknowledge that this has happened and return your focus to your breathing.
Scan your attention over your body, beginning with your toes. Do you notice any tension in your body? Relax each group of muscles as you work your attention up your body. All the while, keep taking those deep, even breaths.
As you work closer to your head, imagine a sense of deep relaxation coming over your body. Close your eyes as you continue breathing deeply and tell yourself “enjoy your rest.” Then continue to notice the flow of your breath as you drift off.

, There are several medical conditions that may be contributing to your nighttime stress. Conditions like acid reflux disease, restless leg syndrome, and chronic pain may be contributing to your sleep disturbances. If you have a medical condition that you think may be keeping you up at night, talk to your doctor.Ask your doctor about other potential medical conditions that may have caused your night time stress.

, If you cannot figure out what is bothering you and there is no medical cause for your nighttime stress, consider talking to a sleep specialist who specializes in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to find the cause. A sleep specialist who can do CBT can help you to identify the cause of your nighttime stress and counsel you on specific lifestyle changes to help you sleep better., Set a regular time to go to bed every night and time to get up every morning. Keeping yourself on a regular sleeping pattern will help you to sleep better even if you’re stressed because your body will be used to sleeping at this time every night.Use the time that you need to wake up every morning as your guide for when to go to bed. For example, if you need to get up at 6:30am to be to work on time during the week, make sure that you are in bed by 10:30pm every night.
Try to aim for 7-9 hours of sleep a night. This is the optimal range for adults, but everyone is different. You may function well on more or less sleep.Keep the same bedtime and waking time even on weekends and holidays to keep your body and mind adjusted to that routine.

, Do the same things every night before you get into bed. Repeating the same activities every night before bedtime will help to teach your brain and body when it’s time to calm down. You might already do basic evening ritual things like washing your face, brushing your teeth and putting on your pajamas, but it’s a good idea to incorporate a relaxing activity into your bedtime ritual as well. For example, you might take a bath, read a book, practice yoga, or listen to some relaxing music.Avoid watching TV or using electronic devices, such as a tablet, laptop, or cell phone, as part of your bedtime ritual. Using electronic devices can cause you to become stressed and have a negative impact on your sleep. The light that these devices emit can also delay your body’s release of melatonin, a hormone that is critical for good sleep., Having a pleasing environment is important for a good night’s sleep. If your bedroom is cluttered, dirty, or otherwise unpleasant, it may be causing you stress and making it difficult for you to wind down at night. Your bedroom should be clean, dark, and kept at a cool, comfortable temperature.Make sure that your mattress, pillows, comforters, and sheets are clean and comfortable as well. Consider investing in some new ones if they are not comfortable or pleasing to look at.
Consider using a pleasant room spray or oil diffuser to help make your bedroom smell nice.
Use light blocking curtains to keep your room dark if you have a lot of outside light coming into your room.

, Your bedroom should be a quiet environment. Having lots of noise coming in from the outside or from your devices may make you feel more stressed and disrupt your sleep. Do what you can to minimize noise coming into your bedroom from outside, such as investing in noise reducing curtains or using earplugs while you sleep.Silence your cell phone and other devices so that you won’t be disturbed while you are sleeping.
White noise can help to counter noise pollution by adding a new steady sound for you to focus on. This steady noise will also make outside noises seem quieter. If you want some white noise in the background to sleep, try a fan or a white noise machine., Having a full stomach can keep you awake for hours. You should also avoid eating spicy, rich, or heavy food before bedtime because these foods are harder for your body to digest and may make it hard to fall asleep.If you are hungry before bed, have a light snack, such as a half of a turkey sandwich, a small bowl of low sugar cereal with low-fat milk, or a banana.

, Certain foods disrupt sleep while other foods may help promote good sleep. If you are having trouble sleeping due to stress, you may be able to help yourself relax by eating sleep promoting foods. What you eat for dinner and in the evening hours will influence the quality of your sleep the most, so it is important to choose wisely.Choose lean protein over fatty protein. Lean proteins like chicken, turkey, and fish are high in tryptophan, which increases serotonin levels and may help you sleep better. Fatty protein such as sausage, cheese, and fried meats are harder to digest and may keep you up at night.
Choose whole grains over processed ones. Brown rice, whole wheat bread, and whole wheat pasta may help promote good sleep. White rice, white pasta, white bread, and other simple carbohydrates reduce your serotonin levels and may affect your sleep.
Avoid sweets and added sugar in the evenings. It can cause you to stay awake., Caffeine is a stimulant that can remain in your body 8-14 hours after you drink it. This means that having a coffee with dinner can keep you up at night. To reduce the chance of having trouble sleeping due to caffeine, stop drinking all caffeinated beverages at least eight hours before your bedtime. Coffee, black tea, cola, and hot cocoa are some examples of beverages that contain caffeine, but check the label on anything that you drink in the afternoon and evening to be sure., A hot cup of tea is a great relaxation aid that can promote a good night's sleep. You can incorporate a hot cup of herbal tea into your bedtime ritual as a nice way to wind down in the evening. Just make sure that you choose a tea that is caffeine-free. Read the package to be sure.


Chamomile tea is a great choice for calming down at night. For many people, it works like a mild sleep aid. Don't use chamomile if you're pregnant or allergic to daisies or ragweed., Exercise is a great way to reduce stress. Plus, regular exercise has been shown to help promote healthier sleeping habits. If you don’t exercise already, aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day to help reduce stress and promote good sleep.Try taking a brisk walk a few hours before bedtime or doing a workout video when you wake up in the morning.
Make sure you exercise at least 2 hours before bedtime. Otherwise, the exercise can keep you awake., Melatonin is a hormone that your body makes to help you fall asleep. It has been found to be effective as a sleep aid and it is effective if taken at a low dose for a short time period. Even though melatonin is available without a prescription, it is important to talk to your doctor before you begin taking it. The required dosage amounts vary widely from person to person, ranging from 0.2-20 mg. Your doctor can advise you on whether or not melatonin is a good choice for you. Be aware that melatonin has some side effects including:grogginess or sleepiness after waking
vivid dreams
lower body temperature
changes in blood pressure

, There are several herbs that may help you sleep better. However, because these herbs can interact with medications and existing medical conditions, you should always consult with your doctor before starting any treatment, including herbal remedies. Here are a few you could ask your doctor about:Valerian root. Valerian can help you relax and fall asleep faster. It may take a few weeks to begin to work optimally. You can take it as a tea or powdered extract.Passionflower. Passionflower tends to be more mild than valerian. It can interact with MAOIs, blood thinners, and sedatives, so talk to your doctor if you are on any of these medications. You can take it as a tea or in an extract., Progressive muscle relaxation is one of the simplest relaxation techniques. The process helps you learn how to relax your muscles by first putting tension on muscles and then focusing on the feeling of the muscles relaxing as you release the tension. You should spend about five minutes doing this, but do not tense each limb for more than 5 or 6 seconds.


Start by spending a few minutes just watching your breathing, or something else such as the feeling of the bed linen or mattress.
Focus on your arms and hands and tense them as tightly as you can for a few seconds. Do not tense them if they are painful, or if they will cause you pain. Spend a few seconds watching the tension, then as you breathe out, relax them. Feel the arms slowly relax and feel heavy. If your arms feel pleasant, spend a few seconds or minutes focusing simply on that pleasant feeling. If you wish, you can move on to the next part.
Next focus on your legs, ankles, and feet and tense them. Spend time watching the tension and how it feels. Then relax them. Let go of any tension. Allow them to become heavy and relax into the mattress. Feel the bed linens and be aware that it is time for sleep.
From here, focus on other body sections such as the buttocks, the back of the body, the front of the body, the shoulders, and the head. Tense each group, then on an exhale, relax them, each time allowing them to become heavy., Aromatherapy can be helpful to reduce stress and promote good sleep. Put a few drops of essential oil in a humidifier or diffuser to disperse the smell throughout your bedroom. You can also try burning an aromatherapy candle just before bed, or taking a bath with aromatherapy bath salts.


Aromatherapy with lavender essential oil has been found to help relax the body and aid with insomnia.Roman chamomile oil is also a good choice.Some essential oil companies sell oil blends, candles, and other products designed to help promote good sleep.

, Your mind and body need time to wind down. Therefore, spend 1-2 hours before bedtime relaxing. This can include a variety of relaxing activities. Just make sure to avoid overstimulating your brain and body.


Take a warm shower or bath before you sleep. Soaking in a warm bath can relax muscles and your mind. Add some Epsom salts to your bath. It contains magnesium that can be absorbed through your skin, which can promote sleep.
Read. Spend some time reading a pleasure novel before bed.
Try stretching exercises or gentle yoga that can relax the body. Soft or low intensity massage or Tai Chi can also help some people. If one of these activities keeps you up, try a different one next time.Try meditating. Meditation can help in some cases. Breath meditation (often referred to as ""Anapanasati"") is effective for sleep as it keeps the mind anchored to the breath, rather than chasing after thoughts and anxieties.

, To avoid making your room a stressful place, leave your bedroom if you cannot sleep. Don't lay in bed and surf the internet, talk on the phone, or stress about not being able to sleep. Go into another part of the house and try to do something that will help you get back to sleep. Don't reenter your bedroom until you are tired and ready to sleep.Leave your room after 20 minutes of tossing and turning. Do something relaxing, then return., It is important to get help if stress continues to disturb your sleep. Stress can have negative long-term effects on the body and mind. If your stress is keeping you up at night, you may also be sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation can also have negative long-term effects on your body and mind, so it is important to get help so that you can resume a normal sleep schedule again. Medical doctors will be able to prescribe sleep medication for short term relief although you should be wary as many of them are addicting.


If your stress is a long-term pattern and you find that you constantly face this problem, you may be suffering from insomnia and should consider going to a therapist to learn stress management strategies.

Understand the stages of sleep.,
Maintain a regular sleep schedule.,
Turn off all electronics and distractions a few hours before bed.,
Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.,
Don’t consume caffeine or alcohol four to six hours before your bedtime.,
Try to go to bed sleep 30 minutes earlier than usual.,
Ask your doctor about melatonin for improved REM sleep.,
Be wary of over-the-counter medications that can lead to suppressed REM sleep.,
Commit to exercising at least 20 to 30 minutes a day.",How to Get More REM Sleep," There are four stages of sleep, with the fourth and final stage being REM sleep. In order to get more REM sleep, you need to gradually allow your mind and body to go through the first three stages of sleep. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule and healthy sleep habits will help you do this.Stage N1: This is when you are transitioning into sleep and lasts about five minutes. Your eyes will move slower under your eyelids, and your muscle activity will slow down but you can be easily awakened by a noise or a sound.
Stage N2: This is the first stage of true sleep and lasts 10–25 minutes. Your eye movement will stop completely, your heart rate will slow and your body temperature will decrease.
Stage N3: This is the beginning of deep sleep, during which you are hard to wake up and if you are woken up, you will often feel groggy or disoriented for a few minutes. In this stage, your brain waves are very slow and blood flow is directed away from your brain to your muscles, which restores physical energy in your body.
Stage N4: The final stage of sleep is REM sleep, or dream sleeping. This occurs about 70 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. You will likely experience rapid eye movement, shallow breathing, and your heart rate and blood pressure may increase. During this stage, your arms and legs are also paralyzed.
Keep in mind that during the night, your sleep follows a pattern, moving back and forth between deep sleep and REM sleep. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes and repeats four to six times during the night. As the night progresses, the amount of time you spend in each stage changes. Most deep sleep occurs in the first half of the night. Later in the night your REM sleep stages become longer.;
, Create a sleep schedule where you wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday, even on weekends or days off. Sleep requirements vary from person to person, but on average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep. Having a regular sleep schedule will allow you to experience REM sleep more often, as you will cycle between the stages of sleep several times throughout the night during a full seven to nine hour sleepSome people think getting just one less hour of sleep won’t affect their daily functioning or that they can make up for lack of sleep on the weekend or a day off, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way. Any changes or shifts in your regular sleep schedule will only have a negative effect on your sleeping habits and could lead to less deep sleep or REM sleep.It’s a myth that your body adjusts quickly to different sleep schedules. While most people can reset their biological clock, this can only be done by timed cues, and even then, only by one to two hours per day at best. Keep in mind it can take more than a week for your body’s internal clock to adjust to traveling across several time zones or to switching to the night shift.

, Shut off your television, smartphone, tablet, and computer or, even better, keep all electronics out of your bedroom completely. The type of light these screens emit can stimulate your brain, suppress the production of melatonin (which encourages REM sleep), and interfere with your body’s internal clock.Another option is to shut down your computer on a schedule. This will automatically sleep your machine and prevent you from working on your computer too late or too close to your bedtime. There are sleep features on both PCs and Macs that you can activate. As well, if you want your computer to be ready to go in the morning, once you wake up, you can schedule a startup time too.

, Use heavy curtains or shades to block the light from windows. Cover any electronic displays, like tvs or computers so the light does not glow in the room. You can also use a sleep mask to cover your eyes and create a dark space that will help you sleep.If you have difficulty sleeping due to loud noises outside your window or a loud sleep partner, consider investing in good earplugs, or a noise machine.

, About half the caffeine you consume at 7 pm is still in your body at 11 pm. Caffeine is a known stimulant that can suppress your REM sleep and can be found in coffee, chocolate, soft drinks, non-herbal teas, diet drugs, and some pain relievers. Limit how many cups of coffee you have several hours before bed, or try to eliminate caffeine from your diet all together.Alcohol also prevents deep sleep and REM sleep. It will keep you in the lighter stages of sleep, causing you to possibly wake up easily and have a harder time falling back asleep. Avoid consuming alcohol several hours before bed to improve your chances of having REM sleep., Your REM sleep stages are longer in the morning, so try to prolong your REM sleep by adding an extra 30 minutes of sleep. Adjust your bedtime so you go to sleep 30 minutes earlier than usual and then maintain this adjustment in your sleep schedule by doing this every night.Always be consistent with adjustments to your sleep schedule, as you will need to get enough of each stage of sleep, especially deep sleep, to improve your REM sleep. If you do not get enough deep sleep at night, your body may try to make up for it the next night, thereby reducing the amount of REM sleep you experience.

, Recent studies have shown that taking melatonin supplements, about 3 mg a day, can increase your REM sleep and help you stay in the REM stage of your sleep cycling for a longer period of time. Your doctor can recommend a melatonin supplement, usually in pill form, as well as the prescribed dosage for your body type.Melatonin is also recommended for the elderly and people who work late shifts at night, as it can help to normalize your sleep cycle and be beneficial for your health overall.

, Many of the side effects of these drugs can have adverse effects on your sleep patterns and daytime alertness. Common medications that can disturb your REM sleep include:Nasal decongestants.
Aspirin and other headache medications.
Pain relievers that contain caffeine.
Cold and allergy medications containing an antihistamine.
Certain diet pills and antidepressants.
If you are taking any of these medications, try to reduce your dosage. Or research alternative methods to treat these issues so you can stop taking these over-the-counter medications.

, Daily exercise is proven to help people sleep and can help you stay in the REM stage of sleep longer. But a workout too close to bedtime might interfere with your sleep schedule. Try to get daily exercise about five to six hours before bedtime."

Keep track of the amount you sleep.,
Assume that you should be getting eight hours of sleep per night.,
Calculate how much you're really sleeping per night.,
Think about your strategy for catching up on sleep.,
Check your weekly schedule for sleep openings.,
Eliminate long naps.,
Understand sleep hygiene.,
Don't drink alcohol before bed.,
Avoid caffeine before bed.,
Avoid large meals and dietary changes before bed.,
Avoid exercise immediately before bed.,
Don't use your bed for anything besides sleep.,
Avoid television and other mental stimulants before bed.,
Establish a consistent and soothing sleeping environment.",How to Catch up on Sleep," In order to catch up on sleep, we need to know how much we've lost. Sleep debt is a real thing,and it's just as likely to develop over an extended period of minor sleep deprivation as it is from one or two all-nighters. If you can, take note of how much you sleep per night for two weeks, as that should paint a fairly accurate portrait of your sleep debt, and provide a basis for you to adjust your routine.;
, Eight hours is the optimal amount of sleep for the average person, and while your actual needs may deviate slightly from the norm, it's best to be safe and aim for eight hours or more., On average, Americans sleep 6.8 hours per night during the week, and 7.4 hours per night on the weekends, which averages out to 6.9 hours total per night.That means in one week, a typical American adult accumulates 7.7 hours of sleep debt. How much do you accumulate?

, It's common that people deprive themselves of sleep during the week, and then try to make it up on the weekends. But is that enough? If you sleep 6 hours per night Sunday-Thursday, then ""catch up"" on the weekends by sleeping 11 hours per night, you're still coming up 4 hours short every week—that's 200+ hours of sleep debt every year.

, In a perfect world, we would simply allocate an extra hour or two every day for sleep, but that's not always possible. However, you might be able to find time sporadically. If your schedule requires that you sleep 6 hours Monday, Wednesday, Friday, try to sleep 8 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It might not seem like much, but those few extra hours will supplement your elongated weekend sleeps, and greatly reduce your debt.

, Generally speaking, if you're napping for over an hour, you're better off not napping at all.There are exceptions to this—e.g. shift-workers who simply have no other option. But if you're planning on sleeping that night, daytime naps are counterproductive. In the typical nap, you spend very little time, if any, in a state of REM sleep.REM sleep is the most regenerative and refreshing type of sleep, and without it your nap does nothing to work off your sleep debt, not to mention that it will make it more difficult to fall asleep for the night.

, Sleep hygiene is a way of measuring the quality of your sleep. Just like personal hygiene, you can improve it by tweaking your daily habits. While most of the behaviors pertinent to sleep hygiene are things we do right before bed, the process begins as soon as we wake up in the morning. All of the following steps contribute to achieving the most hygienic sleep possible. , While some people believe alcohol helps them sleep, the truth is just the opposite. Alcohol negatively affects sleep quality in two ways:It reduces the quantity of REM sleep for the first several hours of sleep, which causes a massive decrease in sleep quality.
When it wears off, 4-6 hours after sleep begins, it creates a stimulating effect in the sleeper, which can make him or her wake up and have trouble falling back asleep.

, Most people know not to drink coffee before going to sleep, but it's important to avoid caffeine in any form. Other caffeinated substances to avoid before bed include:Chocolate
Non-Cola Sodas
Weight Loss Pills
Pain Relievers
Decaf Coffee

, Spicy foods, in particular, are problematic before bed. But it's not a good idea to eat any large meal before going to sleep. The digestive process can upset your body's natural sleep sequences, and reduce the quality of your sleep., For the most part, exercise actually improves your quality of sleep. However, exercise before bad can have a stimulating effect, and limit your ability to fall asleep. It should be noted, though, that some experts believe calmer forms of exercise, like yoga, improve sleep hygiene, regardless of when the exercise is performed., Ideally, we subconsciously associate our beds with sleep, and our bodies begin to ready themselves for sleep as soon we get into bed. These associations can be disrupted if you fall into the habit of reading, working, or watching TV in bed, and you may have a harder time falling asleep at night., Television is the most common mental stimulant in which people engage before trying to fall asleep, but it's not the only one. While some experts suggest reading before bed, others argue that it can have the same stimulating effects as television or work.

, The idea is to get your body used to certain sleeping conditions, so that your body will naturally ready itself for sleep when exposed to those conditions. Consider all of the following:


Use your favorite bedding.
Adjust the room to your preferred temperature, and sleep that way every night.
Black out as much noise and light as possible."
"
Exercise.,
Cut out certain substances.,
Develop a sleep routine.,
Keep your bedroom environment sleep friendly.,
Reduce the number of hours you sleep gradually.,
Be patient.,
Aim for six hours of sleep each night.,
Do not sleep less than five and a half hours a night.,
Watch for ill health effects.,
Understand sleeping less is difficult to maintain long-term.",How to Condition Your Body to Need Less Sleep," If you expect to function without sleep you'll have to build up your body's overall strength. Exercising three or four times a week can build your overall strength and stamina, resulting in you needing less sleep.

Focus on aerobics, like running or jogging, as well as mild weight training, such as lifting weights, doing push or sit ups, and Pilates.Exercise in the afternoon is ideal as your overall sleep quality at night improves. This means you get higher quality sleep overall, which may lead to you needing less sleep.;
, Alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine all mess with your sleep schedule. If you want to function on less sleep you need to take steps to assure your sleep is high quality.









Alcohol can help you fall asleep faster. However, once you do fall asleep the sleep you have is of a lesser quality. You'll end up needing to sleep more. Ditch alcohol, only drinking on occasion and in moderation.Caffeine stays in the body for up to six hours after you drink it. Drinking caffeine in the late afternoon can affect your ability to sleep at night. It's best to stick to coffee in the mornings without going overboard. One or two 8 ounce cups a day should be enough.Nicotine, in addition to leading to many health problems, is a stimulant. Smoking cigarettes throughout the day can lead to trouble sleeping at night. Not to mention tobacco weakens your body and immune system, meaning you'll need more sleep for strength. If you want to go on less sleep, take steps to quit smoking., Work on improving your sleep schedule before trying to cut back on sleep. Take measures to assure you fall asleep quickly and wake up feeling refreshed.









Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every night. Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that adjusts to a regular sleep/wake cycle. If you keep your bedtime and waking time the same each day, you'll feel tired naturally at night and wake up refreshed in the morning.Avoid electronic screens in the hours leading up to bedtime. The blue light that comes from smartphones and laptops has a stimulating effect on the body that makes nodding off difficult.Have some kind of bedtime ritual. If your body associates a certain activity with bedtime, you'll naturally feel tired in response to that activity. Pick something relaxing to do, like reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle., Remember, to sleep less you need to make sure your sleep is of as high quality as possible. To do so, make sure your bedroom is sleep friendly.









Check your mattress and pillows. They should be firm and supportive and not result in you feeling sore. Pillows and bedding should be free of any allergens, that could cause irritation and keep you up at night.Keep your room cool. The ideal sleeping temperature is between 60 and 67°F (15.5 to 19.4°C).If you live in a noisy building or area, consider investing in a white noise machine to block out unwanted sound., If you try to go from sleeping nine hours a night to sleeping six, it's going to backfire. Work on gradually delaying your bedtime or getting up earlier.









For the first week, go to sleep 20 minutes later or get up 20 minutes earlier than usual. For the second week, add another 20 minutes. For the third week, move your bedtime or wake time back or forward by an hour.Continue cutting back by 20 minute intervals each week., You'll likely experience fatigue for the first few weeks. It will take your body time to adjust to less sleep. If fatigue is getting to you, change your diet by adding healthier, energy-stimulating foods and exercising more to rev up the quality of your sleep.







, Six hours of sleep a night should be your goal. You can still function relatively well, if you maintain the quality of that sleep. Anything less than this could pose major health risks.







, The absolute least amount you can sleep is five and a half hours a night. Sleep studies that monitored the effects of sleep deprivation on the brain report subjects who get less sleep than this report severe fatigue and reduced ability to function in day-to-day life.







, Sleep deprivation can be dangerous. If you experience any of the following, you may want to consider returning to your regular sleep schedule:








Increased hunger
Changes in weight
Loss of short term memory
Impulsive behaviors
Poor motor skills
Changes in skin
Blurred vision

, While you can cut back on sleep for short periods of time, sleeping less than eight hours a night is not recommended long-term. Eventually, your functioning will slip and you'll need to catch up on sleep.









How much sleep you need varies based on lifestyle. However, most people need at least eight hours of sleep a night. Regularly getting less than this is bad for your concentration.If you continuously run on six hours a night, you'll create what's called a sleep debt. Your body will crave more sleep than you're providing. Eventually, you'll end up crashing. If you're trying to run on little sleep, make sure to only do so for a few weeks at a time before returning to eight hours a night."

Revert to your diurnal self.",How to Be Nocturnal," It’s difficult to switch straight from a normal sun-driven schedule to one in which you’re sleeping while the rest of the world is awake. Doing this will likely just leave you completely sleep deprived, since you’ll force yourself to stay up all night and you won’t be able to sleep well during the day. Instead, gradually start staying up later each night and sleeping in later in the morning. Push the times back more and more, and in a week or so you won’t have as much trouble waking and sleeping when you want to.


The first night of training, stay up as late as you can without forcing yourself. Stay awake until you feel like you can’t keep your eyes open a moment longer, then go to sleep. Don’t set an alarm, and block the windows so you won’t wake up with the sun. Sleep as late as you can, then wake up and go about your day.
The next night, try to stay up an hour later than you did the night before, and in the morning, sleep an extra hour.
Continue this process until you’re falling asleep and rising when you want to.;
, Staying up at night is a lot easier when you’re doing activities that keep your brain engaged. Watching shows or movies can be helpful, although many are known to fall asleep midway through an episode. Try something that keeps you active, like reading a book or playing video games.


Some find that they feel more creative at night. Try working on an art project, making music, or writing an essay in the middle of the night. Try not to go to sleep until you’re at a good stopping point. You probably won’t even notice when the sun begins to rise.

, This is a sure way to get your blood rushing and make you feel more alert and awake instead of sleepy. Go for a night run or a brisk walk. The fresh air will wake you up, too. If you don’t want to go outside, do sets of crunches, situps or pullups in your house to keep yourself awake.


Taking a shower after you work out, preferably a cool one, will also help keep you from falling asleep.
If you don’t like to exercise, just stick your head outside and take several deep breaths of air when you’re feeling tired. The temperature difference will make your body wake up.

, Your body will wake up a little in order to start digesting the food you take in. Cook a meal and eat it in the middle of the night. Don’t fall back on a typical midnight snack, like a peanut butter sandwich or pizza, because these are foods your mind already associates with late night eating. Instead, cook a meal you’d normally eat during the day, like poached salmon, spinach and couscous. Drink a big glass of cold water as well.

, If you don’t share your home with people who would like to be able to sleep in peace, put on some loud, fast music to get your body moving. Choose music that makes you want to get up and dance or sing along, instead of music that puts you to sleep. If you’re concerned about waking people up, use headphones.

, Have you ever had one of those late night phone sessions with a friend that keeps both of you up until dawn? Talking with someone else is very stimulating, and it’s one of the best ways to keep yourself awake. If you have a friend who’s also trying to stay up all night and sleep during the day, schedule phone conversations to keep each other entertained.


If you don’t know anyone else who’s trying to be nocturnal, use a chat program to get in touch with someone living in another time zone where everyone’s awake. If you’re chatting with someone who lives in a place where it’s daytime, you’ll be able to wake right up.

, Getting out of the house and walking around can help you feel more awake and normal at night. If you know of a store or a diner that’s always open, consider going there to hang out and shop or eat for a few hours. This is usually easier to do in a city where there are other people looking for spots to hang out at night.


Make sure you stay in safe, well-lit areas when you go out at night. Since fewer people will be out and about, it’s important to be aware of your surroundings and mindful of your safety. Bring a cell phone with you and tell someone where you’re going.

, Caffeine is a stimulant that provides an excellent pick-me-up for a few hours, and it’s great in a pinch when you need to pull a one-off all-nighter. However, if your goal is to become permanently (or semi-permanently) nocturnal, you shouldn’t fall back on caffeine as your tool for staying awake. Having a lot of caffeine in your system will make it more difficult to get to sleep during the day, and it’s important that you sleep when you can so you don’t deprive your body of rest.


The same goes for energy drinks that contain other types of stimulants. It’s better to gradually train your body to stay awake instead of forcing it using artificial means.

, When your body senses the sun has come up, it’s a lot harder to get to sleep. The slightest bit of sun peeking out from around the edges of your blinds will cause your body to become more alert. If you want to be able to sleep during the day, invest in blackout curtains. They’re so sturdy and opaque, they block out all sunlight. When the sun comes up, you’ll have no idea that it’s daytime.


If you don’t want to buy a set of blackout curtains, get very dark, heavy drapes or cover your windows with thick, dark-colored blankets.
Using a sleeping mask to block out light is also helpful if you don’t mind sleeping with something on your face.

, As the rest of the world wakes, they’ll start making all kinds of noises: the sound of a garbage truck barreling down the street, the neighbor calling his dog, your roommate’s microwave opening and closing. To defend against the onslaught of morning sounds, you’ll need a good pair of earplugs or noise-canceling headphones.


If you don’t like wearing items on your head while you sleep, try using a white noise machine. These machines produce low, quiet sounds to which your ears quickly grow accustomed, and they block out the other more annoying sounds that might enter your room.

, This is a chemical the brain produces to put the body to sleep. Melatonin pills are a natural sleep aid that can help your body rest if you have trouble sleeping during the day. Unlike regular sleeping pills, they don’t have addictive properties and won’t leave you groggy when you wake up.


If you’re interested in taking stronger sleeping pills that use synthetic chemicals to put the body to sleep, it’s best to discuss this with your doctor first. This is especially important if you have to drive or go to work upon waking.

, Even if you wake up at 6:00 in the evening, eat breakfast foods. This will signal to your brain and body that it’s the beginning of your day. If you eat lunch or dinner foods, you’ll be sending different signals. Follow the normal morning routine you’d have if you woke up at 8:00 am. Put on a pot of coffee or tea and enjoy your typical breakfast.

, If you’re quite serious about following a nocturnal schedule, tell the people in your life not to disturb you during the day unless it’s an emergency. Let them know that it’s very important for you to sleep during the day, because otherwise you’ll end up sleep deprived.


You’ll need to set up a schedule that works for your family so they have no need to disturb you. For example, if your children will be coming home from school during the time you’re supposed to be asleep, have a plan in place for them to go to after school care or stay with someone until you wake up.

, If you’re planning on staying nocturnal for awhile, it’s important to stick with a steady schedule. Go to bed at the same time of day and rise at the same time, too. If you don’t, your sleep schedule will end up all over the place, and that can wreak havoc on your health.


After you’ve gradually gotten accustomed to your schedule, stick with it the same way you would a regular schedule. Set your alarm and try to go to bed on time.
When you’re ready to go back to a normal day/night schedule, do it gradually.

, Sure, too much sun is a bad thing, but too little sun is actually worse. When you don’t get exposed to any sun, your body doesn’t produce vitamin D, which is essential to healthy bone growth and other natural functions.


Try to arrange your schedule so that you get at least a little sun exposure during the daylight.
You may want to get a sun lamp to stimulate vitamin D production if you’re getting very little sun.

, When you adopt a nocturnal schedule, you’re going against your body’s natural rhythms. You’re always going to be a little sleepier and less sharp than you’d be if you had a normal day/night schedule. For this reason, it’s important to be careful operating machinery, including a car, while you’re still getting used to being awake all night. Stay as alert as possible, especially while you’re at work.

, There are many reasons for going nocturnal, but they need to resonate with who you are and the life you'd like to lead. The disadvantages of going nocturnal should be weighed when considering it as a way of life. You won't be around when most people are awake, so that means missing out on a lot of social activities. You'll also be underexposed to vitamin D, which could negatively affect your health. However, the benefits of going nocturnal are numerous:


There are fewer people around during the night, which can be great for a number of reasons.
It can be a creatively productive time if you are naturally a night owl. People will not be emailing you with demands, so you will not be interrupted.
You'll be the life of the party because you'll be more refreshed than all the people knocking off a day's work. You might even join the ranks of the ""professional night owls"" who live to party in the best nightclubs in town.
It's a chance to connect with interesting people also staying up all night, including night owls, vampire fans, social moths, and people who just can't get off the internet late at night.
Your house won't seem as messy. Human vision is terrible at night. Even with the lights on, it is harder to see the dust and fluff bunnies. You won't need to clean half as hard!
Another thing to consider is being nocturnal seasonally or for a set period rather than all year long. This can be useful during a special season like summertime when the nights are lovely, during a vacation season and so on. You can be available to pursue whatever interests happen to coincide with your need to stay up all night.

, If you're serious about making this a long-term commitment, you'll need to find a job that allows you to sleep during the day and stay awake at night. If you plan to stay nocturnal as a long-term or permanent change, you'll need to be able to work around the things that are usually done during the day.



Shift work will allow you to continue working during the night. There are many different possibilities for shift work, including loading and transporting goods, security and policing, monitoring facilities, night-fill in supermarkets, hotel reception work, fishing, cleaning, journalists, highway work, and so on. Even sports can be played at night; a recent study showed that morning larks made better morning pitchers, while night owls made better evening pitchers.
Work from home. If you are a blogger, online marketer, eBay seller, writer, artist, etc., who can work from home, set up your own routine as befits your work.
Studies will be harder, but if you are taking classes online, you can study this whenever you like. For university, get recordings of lectures, or ask friends for notes. You will have problems with missing tutorials that require attendance for grades, so try to schedule evening tutorials.

, Find other people who love the night more than the day, from geeks and gamers, to creative types and mystics. Try to connect with people who have the same love of the night as you. Be aware that this is going to be more likely in a large urban environment like New York, Tokyo, or Sydney than anywhere else – cities that never sleep.


In New York City, you can connect with other like-minded night owls through the New York Night Owls, a weekly meet-up of hardworking night owls which keeps the hours 10pm – 4am.The idea has also caught on in London,and may be coming to a location near you anytime soon!
Look for cafes and other meeting places that court night owls and don't throw you out after midnight. Again, these are more likely to exist in large urban environments but if there isn't one near you, consider creating a home network with fellow nocturnals so you can drop in on each other and have a cup of something and brainstorm creatively together in the deep of the night.
Use social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to connect with other nocturnals in your area: check the location status so that you know you're talking to a night owl and not a lark in a city on the other side of the world!

, Be aware that while it has been claimed recently that night owls are more intelligent than their morning lark counterparts,being a night owl can impact your mental health negatively.If you find yourself experiencing mental challenges, such as depression, you might want to reconsider your night owl behaviors. Seek advice from your doctor if you're worried.


Be sure to get sufficient vitamin D. You will need a little regular sunshine daily.

, If you want to be back to your normal diurnal self again, it's easy. Just stay up all night and then keep yourself awake all day the next day. When the sun comes up and lights up the sky with beautiful colors, you should feel peaceful with that moon still hanging in the sky, it will give you a wonderful fresh, waken-up feeling for the day. The time it takes to get back into the usual rhythm will depend on your personality, activities, and how sleep deprived you're feeling.

Avoid too much caffeine.",How to Become a Night Owl," The best way to transition into the life of a night owl is to take it day by day. Unless you’re in a rush, you should try going to bed and waking up 15-30 minutes later each day until you’ve reached your ideal bedtime. Night owls typically go to bed anywhere between midnight and five in the morning, though you can decide what the term “night owl” means to you. The most important thing is that you find a schedule that works for you and that you stick to it once you’ve transitioned to your ideal sleeping and waking time.


In fact, it’s just as important to go to bed and to wake up around the same time as it is to get the 7-8 hours of sleep that most people need to get. Getting 8 hours of sleep each night won’t make you feel rested if you have an erratic sleep schedule.
Once you’ve found your routine, your mind will become accustomed to your new energy cycle and will be able to work more efficiently.;
, If you have to wake up at a certain time every morning but are determined to go to bed later, then you should make sure to make up for that sleep during the day as much as you can. Though taking long naps lasting over thirty minutes can actually make you more tired, if you just take one or two 10-15 minute power naps throughout the day, whether it’s on your lunch break or in the late afternoon, then you may be able to get the rest you need.


People also say that 10 minutes of intense focused meditation can be equal to an hour of sleep. If you want to be a night owl but you still have to get up early in the morning, then you may want to look into meditation in the mornings. All you have to do is close your eyes, keep your body still, and focus on your breathing, letting all distractions fade away.

, Transitioning to the night owl lifestyle will, of course, lead you to go to bed later, but you should still plan to have a time for yourself to wind down so that you actually do make it to sleep. You should turn off all visual stimuli, which includes your phone, your computer, or your TV, at least an hour before bed so your mind begins to go into “sleep mode.” Relax with some light reading, camomile tea, and soft music before bedtime and you’ll be in dreamland in no time.


If you watch hours of YouTube videos and then attempt to go straight to bed, your mind will still be racing.

, It’s important to let the people you live with, as well as your friends, know about your new lifestyle change. This will keep your parents or roommates from making too much noise in the morning or expecting you to have late morning brunch plans with them, and will lead them to respect your lifestyle. If you live alone, letting the friends you see frequently know about your decision can be helpful because they won’t call you or come knocking on your door early, and they won’t send you emails at seven in the morning expecting a response any time soon.


Your friends or family members may also be open to hanging out with you later in the evenings, since they know you’ll be staying up late.

, If you’re really committed to being a night owl, then you should find a way to work or study that syncs up with your way of life. You can work for an international company in a completely different timezone, so you can communicate with your coworkers and get business done in the middle of the night. You can also be a writer, blogger, or have a contract position where it doesn’t matter when you work, as long as you get the job done. If you’re in school, you can set up a study schedule that allows you to be productive at night, and to get up in time for your exams.


If you’re in a creative field, such as painting, photography, design, or acting, then you may be able to create, practice, rehearse, develop photos, or get much of your creative work done in the nighttime. In fact, it may even be easier for you to do so because you’ll have fewer interruptions!

, One major benefit of being a night owl is that the world will be asleep when you get to work. Whether you live alone or with roommates, you’ll have the sense that the world has gotten quieter, and that it has slowed down just enough for you to catch your breath and get down to business. You’ll look out your window and find that there are only a few lights on in your neighborhood and should have a sense of calm and peace.


You can take advantage of this quiet, this time away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, to do whatever it is you want to do.You can get creative, do some homework, talk to fellow night owls, or just hang out in your living room and read a magazine. Take advantage of the fact that no one will disturb you and that you can do whatever you want without being slowed down.

, One thing you can do if you want to be a night owl is to use your dishwasher, oven, or other appliances that most people use during the day. If you have a washing machine and dryer, then you can do your laundry at night, too. Not only will you be able to use your appliances without worrying about other people in your building or your home wanting to use them, but you’ll also save some money, too.


You should look into your utility company’s peak and off-peak rates to see when you can use your appliances more cheaply., If you don’t live alone, then you can use the time when everyone else is sleeping to take advantage of hanging out in different parts of your home. Maybe you can finally hang out in the living room on your own without being interrupted, or take advantage of the office that is normally used by your roommates. You can step out on your balcony or in your yard on your own to get some fresh air. You can even start a baking project in your kitchen — as long as you focus on cooking for the next day, and not indulging in too much late-night eating.


Think about it: where in your home would you most like to be during the day, when other people are in it? Take advantage of the alone time you have there.
You can even do some yoga or do a giant puzzle in a room with a hardwood floor that is normally taken. Take advantage of the fact that you’re the king of the castle — when it’s dark out, anyway.

, The nighttime is prime territory for night owls to get their creative work down. If you’re a creative person, whether you’re a fiction writer, visual artist, painter, or composer, you can use this time to get down to business. Find a calm space, play some light music if that works for you, light a candle, and just focus on working and writing down whatever comes to your head without judgment or distraction. You can make a point of avoiding the Internet, or even avoiding your computer in general, in order to focus on the work in front of you.


You may not be used to working with a pen and paper instead of your computer, but this may be just the thing that gets your creative juices flowing. If you tend to do your “work work” in front of a computer, this can also be a nice way to separate your creative work from your day job.
Some business people actually recommend standing up at your kitchen counter at night, and thinking of it as an “idea bar” where you can generate new ideas, instead of sitting down as you normally do., Another thing you can do to take advantage of the night owl lifestyle is that you won’t have to deal with a lot of the distractions from the outside world that you would face in the daytime. You won’t get annoying phone calls from telemarketers, you won’t get a slew of emails from your work, and you won’t have anyone knocking on your door asking if you’d like to buy a candy bar. Since these distractions won’t be there to bother you, you can work on picking just one project at a time and sticking to it, so your nighttime hours are the most productive.You can set one night aside for a creative project, like starting a short story. You can even spend every night for a week, or a month, to really work on it. You can also set aside each night for a different aspect of your job.
Just avoid multi-tasking as much as you can if you want to be efficient. Of course, this is good advice for working during the day, as well, but being a night owl makes it much easier to focus on one project at a time, so you should take advantage of that.

, Though one advantage of being a night owl is that you’re free to be on your own, working on your own projects without distractions, there’s nothing wrong in wanting to hang out with other night owls. In fact, you may get a bit lonely being up at night by yourself all the time, so you should look into grabbing a late-night snack with a fellow night owl at a diner (while trying to keep it healthy), hanging out at coffee shop that is open until midnight, or even meeting up with some friends to go bar hopping when you can. Just because you’re a night owl doesn’t mean you have to be alone all the time.


If you know other night owls, ask them where they hang out at night when they do go out. They may have some ideas for places to catch a late movie, cool bars or restaurants, or other ways that you can still feel like you’re part of a community even though you’re up late.

, Another thing you can do to take advantage of your night owl lifestyle is to make a plan in advance to make sure that you make the most of your energy peaks and valleys. For example, if you have trouble getting up in the mornings and don’t feel like you’re fully functional until some time after noon, then don’t plan to have important meetings or to make any important decisions before then, if you can avoid it; instead, save the easy stuff, like chores or routine emails, for the morning, and plan for the serious and/or creative stuff for later.


You should also know when your energy dips the most. If you feel the most tired around 2-3 pm every day, for example, then you can plan to go for a quick energy-reviving walk around then, instead of forcing yourself to slog through a pile of work.
If you know you’re most productive around 10 pm, for example, and your friend asks you to catch a late movie then, you may want to put it off if you have a short story you want to work on in the evening. You want to be able to catch that creative lightning in a bottle instead of spending those productive times doing something you could do when you’re sleepy or tired.

, One problem that night owls face is that they tend to eat a “fourth meal” late into the night. These meals can be problematic because most people tend to eat them when they get a craving, spend another hour or two in front of the computer or television, and then pass out shortly thereafter, leading them to burn very few calories after eating some extra food. To avoid the late-night meal, you can plan for a dinner time as late as 9 or 10 pm, and then have some healthy snacks, such as almonds, yogurt, or bananas around in case you get a craving.


Of course, if you’re a night owl, then you may be more likely to get in a late evening workout routine. Working out in the evening is okay, but remember that, contrary to what people believe, it actually gets your adrenalin pumping and makes you less, not more, ready for bed. If you do plan to work out late as a means to stay healthy, make sure you still leave a few hours between working out and bedtime.
If you’re committed to working out late, then you can check out a late or 24-hour gym in your area. You may be compelled to run in the evenings, but try to do it with a running buddy or in a place where you will be safe, with many other runners doing the same.

, If you’re a night owl, then you might not be spending very much time outside in the sun. While you don’t have to be outdoors all day to get the Vitamin D you need for the day, it is important to get some sunlight to protect against the risk of many diseases, such as heart disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and others. Getting enough sun can also help protect you from insomnia, depression, and having an overly-active immune system.Even if you don’t wake up until the sun has been up for many hours, you should get the equivalent of spending at least 10 minutes in the sun per day, with some of your skin exposed, if you want to stay healthy.
Even if the sun isn’t out, it’s important to spend at least half an hour outdoors if you can, for your mental and physical health.

, Though one of the benefits of being a night owl is that you can get your work done without distraction, the downside is that you may spend more time by yourself as a result. If you’re okay with a lot of solo time, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but you should make a point of socializing or being around people at least a few times a day. This can help you stay healthier while feeling like you’re not alone in the universe.


If you know other night owls with similar interests, try to talk to them at night, when you need a little break from work or creativity, so you can swap ideas. Whether you chat on the phone, online, or even meet up in person, it’s important to connect to people when you can.Of course, it may not be possible to socialize with people you know every single day of your life. However, if you want to keep yourself from feeling isolated, make sure to step out of your house at least twice a day and talk to people, even if you’re just making small talk with the person sitting next to you at the coffee shop, or talking to the girl at the deli counter. Even the smallest human interactions can do wonders for your mental health.

, If you’re a night owl, then you may be prone to spending large portions of the evening sitting at your computer or sitting in front of the television. You should work on spending some time standing as well so that you stay healthy and keep your spine straight. Investing in a standing desk can do wonders for your health and can make you excited about doing work. Sitting down can lead to hunch over, hurt your arms, back, and neck, and therefore to feel less motivated to get work done. Though you don’t have to stand all the time, you can try to do it for at least a few hours each evening to break up your routine.You don’t have to get a standing desk or even work on your computer when you’re standing up. But, for example, you can stand up to do other things, like chat on the phone, or just to think aloud or generate creative ideas, instead of sitting down.

, Night owls are notorious for not getting enough sleep. They may stay up late into the night and then wake up fairly early, hoping a few cans of soda will keep them alert. If you want to be a true night owl while staying healthy, however, then you should make sure not to fall into this trap, and to create a life that allows you to stay up late and to get enough rest in the process.


If you’re stuck with a schedule that requires you to wake up really early, then you need to seriously consider whether or not being a night owl is right for you. If you’re determined to make it work, though, then you should try to find a way to change your schedule so you could wake up later.

, Night owls have been proven to typically drink more caffeine than early birds. While a little caffeine can help get you going, too much can lead you to crash, give you headaches, and keep you from being productive. People who keep more typical hours should avoid having caffeine after noon or so so they can fall asleep more easily in the evenings. If you stay up much later past midnight, then you should avoid having caffeine after 3 pm. or you’ll be staying up much later than you need to, and will feel jittery when you try to get to bed.


Aim to have just one or two caffeinated beverages a day. You can have enough to give you a little boost, but not so much that you become dependent on it.
If you feel like you’re on a caffeine high for too much of the day, you can try replacing your usual coffee with a low-caffeine tea. It will make you feel less jittery and may also have less of an impact on your stomach.
Avoid energy drinks as much as you can. While they may give you what is initially a strong boost of energy, they are very sugary and will lead to a major crash, later on.

How much is your perversion preventing you from living a productive or happy life? Do people get hurt? How are these thoughts and behaviors causing problems?


Reflect on how your thoughts and actions affect your day-to-day life and how your life would change if they were to disappear. Would you free up more time? Would you feel better about yourself? Would other people think differently of you?
Keep in mind that sexual thoughts are natural and not evil. If you have heard that thinking about sex makes you an evil person or that you will be punished because if these thoughts, keep in mind that everyone has these thoughts and they are natural. Especially during your teen years, you will have a wide range of sexual thoughts that are a normal part of exploring your sexuality.;
, Healthy sexuality can be difficult to understand. For instance, some people enjoy engaging in casual sex while to others this practice would be horrifying; some people enjoy masturbation while others are embarrassed or refuse to masturbate. Defining healthy sexuality means doing what feels healthy for you in a way that enriches your life.It means feeling sexually fulfilled and happy without having residual feelings of shame or hatred toward yourself.


Keep in mind that by nature, humans are sexual beings and it is okay and completely normal to have sexual desires and feelings.

, While you are trying to lessen your perceived perverted thoughts, it’s important to also decide what you do consider healthy. Don’t focus on removing all sexuality from your life. Instead, focus on creating a healthy sexual atmosphere for yourself, in your body and within your mind. Remember that it is not realistic to hold yourself to a standard of not having any sexual thoughts or desires. You do, however, have control over your behaviors.


Write a list of what you believe healthy sexuality is to you. Focus on defining healthy thoughts and actions, how you engage with other people in a sexual way, and how you feel about about yourself afterward.
Think about the things that make you feel good versus the things that make you feel bad. What is the difference between these two things?

, Shame often functions from the belief that “Because of this behavior, I am bad.”If you feel you are perverted, it is likely you experience some shame related to this belief. Feeling shame toward yourself can lead to feelings of lower self-esteem.Confront the shame and recognize it does not play a positive role in your life.


Recognize when you feel ashamed. Is it after masturbating or after viewing pornography? Is it after having sexual thoughts? Notice what evokes shame. Then, decide what needs to leave, the action or the shame. Decide how you feel about the action, whether you would feel better stopping the action, or if you need to work through that action without a shame response.
Where does the shame stem from? Is this a belief that was passed down in your family? Does it relate to deeply held religious beliefs? Understanding the source of the shame can help you work through it.
If working through feelings of shame you wish to let go, say to yourself, “I am able to love and express my sexuality in a way that is healthy and pleasurable to me. It's not shameful to express my sexuality.”

, Guilt can be a healthy emotion when recognized for the role it can play in shaping behavior. For instance, if you feel remorse for an action, guilt may accompany this, and lead you to choose a different decision the next time you are faced with a similar situation.If you have guilt about your sexual thoughts or feelings, treat it as a guidepost and pay attention to it. Try and spend some time understanding the guilt, where it originates from, and how you can engage in healthy sexuality without feeling guilty.
Ask yourself when you experience guilt. Is it related to sexual acts/thoughts, your own sexuality, or outside influences (such as religion or beliefs)? Is the guilt justified?
If you do not want to experience guilt related to your sexuality, say to yourself, “I am allowed to be a sexual being and express my sexuality in a healthy way without guilt.”
If you’ve hurt someone in a sexual way, it is absolutely imperative to confront the situation.

, If you feel shame or embarrassment toward your own body, learn to accept yourself as you are.Accept your body in skin color, hair texture, height, and weight. If you hate your body, you may find yourself overly fixated on other body types and engage in perverted thought patterns. Start with self acceptance. The more you accept yourself, your body, and your own sexuality, the less you may experience unhealthy sexuality.


If you are ashamed of your body for having stretch marks, loose skin, or scars, forgive your body. Learn to appreciate the functions your body does for you such as digesting food, sorting out toxins, and converting food to nutrients.
You may not celebrate all parts of your body, but take some time to express gratitude for the little things your body does for you and the abilities it gives you.Your body tells a story. your skin tone, freckles, and scars each encapsulate a story of ancestry and experience. Celebrate your family and your own unique experiences on your living canvas.

, Rid your electronics of any material that may cause you to stray. Keeping your computer and phone free of temptations means you foster an environment that supports you in your goal of less unpleasant thoughts and feelings about sex.


Use a parental control tool from preventing you ""unintentionally"" opening porn web sites. If you have to unlock that software, this buys you some seconds to think again and direct the impulse somewhere else.
If you struggle with consuming pornography, check out How to Deal With Porn Addiction.

, This may also include taking down any posters you have in your room, or getting rid of any t-shirts, stickers, or hats that don’t support your view of healthy sexuality. You want to create an environment that encourages you to stick to your goals and takes away any thoughts or feelings that do not align with your version of healthy sexuality.

, Making sexual jokes may be your way of making sexual comments with the guise of being funny, but in reality the joke is hostile or disrespectful.Sexual jokes are often not funny, especially when directed at someone directly. They can often be disrespectful and hurtful. Poking fun at someone’s sexuality is never appropriate, especially when spread as gossip or intended to hurt someone. Just don’t do it.


If you find a joke you find funny yet you know it will hurt someone, keep it to yourself.

, You may need to distract your thoughts and/or behaviors. Once you catch yourself in a thought or behavior you want to change, divert your attention. You may need to change your gaze, start a different conversation, or excuse yourself from the situation.


If you’re having a hard time staying focused, take a break and go to the bathroom, take a walk, or engage in something else altogether.
If you find yourself staring at someone inappropriately, catch yourself and divert your attention.
If you’re about to tell an inappropriate joke, stop yourself and say something different.

, If you have perverted thoughts toward people, make sure you treat all people with value and respect. If you are interested in women, treat all women with respect. If you are interested in men, treat all men with respect. Respect each person’s sexual limits. Before engaging in sex, talk about it beforehand. Establish boundaries and communicate your preferences and desires, and make sure you understand your partner’s preferences and desires.Don’t approach any person in a manner that devalues him or her in a sexual way.

, If others have been telling you that you are a pervert, then there are things that you can do to avoid reinforcing these people’s ideas about you. Some behaviors can even be considered sexual harassment or bullying, which could get you into a lot of trouble. Make sure that you avoid:making sexual jokes or gestures.
bringing up sex in inappropriate situations, such as during class, while someone is telling you a story, or in other situations you think it might make people feel uncomfortable.
sending sexual text messages or inappropriate pictures to people.touching your private parts in public.
touching other people in inappropriate and/or unwelcome ways.
exposing yourself to people.

, If you feel stressed, you may be more vulnerable to revert back to bad habits. Find ways to relieve and manage stress daily. Don’t let stress build up; find ways to decrease stress each day. Engaging in exercise, being social, and avoiding unnecessary stress are excellent ways to manage stress.Join a running club, start yoga, or go for daily walks with your dog.
Call up a friend, host a game night, or plan to see your friends for dinner.
If you feel chronically stressed but are not sure how to pinpoint it, start a stress journal and keep track of what stresses you each day/week/month. You may start to find patterns of the stressors you experience, then begin to tackle them one by one., Don’t surround yourself with people that encourage you to think or act in a perverted way. You may need to take a break from friends or choose new friends altogether. Allow people in your life that support you and encourage you to live in the way you find most beneficial for you. Having good support in your life helps you combat stress.If there are people that negatively influence you yet are a fixture in your life, kindly ask them to tone down their comments or behavior, or not to discuss those things in your presence.

, Your friends can help you along your journey and make it easier by supporting you. Start an accountability group if you and your friends struggle with similar problems. Send supportive texts, meet for lunch, and keep each other on track.


You can also join a support group, either locally or online, such as the Society for the Advancement of Sexual Health or Sex Addicts Anonymous.

, If you feel like you cannot control your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and don’t think you can do the journey on your own, see a therapist. A therapist can help you confront your feelings, find coping strategies, and work through the process of decreasing negative sexual thoughts. Your therapist is there to support you and help you live a happier, more fulfilling life.For more information about going to therapy, check out How to Tell if You Need to See a Therapist.

Discuss why he had the vasectomy in the past.,
Talk about reasons for wanting to get pregnant.,
Decide how far you are willing to go.",How to Get Pregnant if Your Partner Had a Vasectomy1," Many men who have had a vasectomy were quite clear at that point in their lives that they did not want to have children.It is important to take the time to discuss with your partner why he had the procedure, and how his thoughts might have changed since then.;
, Make sure both of you are on the same page about it, and that he is not simply compromising to keep you happy.Remember that when you are planning to become parents together, it is important to have both people on board and fully committed. Otherwise, it may have a negative toll on the relationship, as well as for your baby.
If your partner is not fully committed, it might take some soul-searching to determine whether having a baby is really the best idea.
You may find couple counseling helpful as you discuss this, as it is a very significant life decision and your partner no doubt had strong feelings about it in the past, or he would not have had a vasectomy., It is important to talk about things such as cost with your partner, and the effort and monetary investment you are willing to make, prior to taking the steps to becoming pregnant.


Certain procedures (such as in vitro fertilization) can be very expensive, so it is important to know how far you and your partner are willing to go in order to become pregnant."
"
Have your partner see a urologist.,
Book time off to take your partner to his vasectomy reversal.,
Allow the doctor to perform the procedure.,
Help your partner to recover from his vasectomy reversal.,
Refrain from sexual activity until at least one week after the procedure.,
Ensure your partner attends follow-up appointments.,
Understand that if your partner's vasectomy is successfully reversed, you will be able to get pregnant as any other couple would.",How to Get Pregnant if Your Partner Had a Vasectomy2," This is a doctor who specializes in the male reproductive system. The urologist can take a detailed medical history and perform a physical exam to determine what course of action is best to help you and your partner become pregnant. The urologist can also assess your partner to see if he has any specific fertility problems, other than the vasectomy.
It is advisable for you, as the woman, to also consult your OB/GYN and to make sure you have no fertility problems that could hold the two of you back from becoming pregnant.

, It is a procedure that can be done directly in the doctor's office, with only local freezing (anesthetic) to numb the scrotal area, and it is relatively quick (around 30 minutes).Some men find it helpful to have you there as moral support.
It is also recommended to drive your partner home after the procedure as he will likely be experiencing some pain and discomfort.

, Sperm is produced in the testicles, and it then goes to the epididymis to mature. From the epididymis it travels through the vas deferens and eventually joins the urethra for ejaculation. The initial vasectomy procedure cut through the vas deferens to prevent sperm transport during ejaculation. The vasectomy reversal can be done in two ways. The first way is reattaching the two cut ends of the vas deferens (called a vasovasostomy). This is the more common procedure.The second way is reattaching the vas deferens directly to the epididymis (called a vasoepididymostomy).This is used when a vasovasostomy is not possible., Recovery from this procedure usually does not take more than a few days.The man may have some pain in his scrotal area, and this can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin.
Most men are fine with over-the-counter pain medications and do not need anything stronger; however, it is an option to receive prescription pain medication from the doctor if your partner needs it.

, Sometimes couples will hold off on sex for up to a few weeks after the procedure, as some men experience discomfort (and occasionally some blood) with ejaculation.


If this occurs for your partner, it should resolve on its own with time (within a few weeks).
If the bleeding is severe or the pain and discomfort are not improving, seek additional help from your doctor.

, The urologist will likely ask for follow-up appointments to check your partner's sperm counts, and to assess whether or not the procedure was successful.


Note that success rates of vasectomy reversal are approximately 60%. It partly depends upon the number of years that the man has had the vasectomy for. A shorter duration equates to a greater success rate.

, In other words, when you have sexual intercourse after the vasectomy is reversed, you will have the same chance as any other couple of conceiving a baby.Note that this also means that the man is no longer ""sterile"" (that is, the vasectomy is no longer functioning as birth control), so the two of you will need to discuss alternate methods for contraception after the pregnancy is over.

Talk to your doctor about in vitro fertilization.,
See if your partner has stored frozen sperm from the past.,
Have your doctor combine the sperm sample with one or more eggs from your ovaries.,
Allow the embryo from the medical lab to be implanted into the uterus.,
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure.",How to Get Pregnant if Your Partner Had a Vasectomy3," This is the route many couples go when the man has had a vasectomy and the couple wants to get pregnant.It is important to talk to a doctor who specializes in this area and who can provide additional information (as well as expected cost) for your case. The cost and complexity of the procedure can vary greatly between couples.
One of the main reasons that IVF is chosen is that the vasectomy reversal was unsuccessful, and the couple is still determined to have biological children of their own.
Success rates of the procedure vary greatly depending upon the reason for receiving it, as well as fertility factors for both the man and the woman. , If he has had his sperm frozen in the past, this can be used for the procedure.


If he has not, another option is to collect sperm directly from the man's vas deferens (the portion of the tube that is still intact and that was not cut by surgery) and to use this for in vitro fertilization.

, This is a procedure done in specialty medical labs.


Normally more than one egg is taken from the female, in order to maximize the chances of a successful embryo forming in the lab.

, Often more than one embryo will be implanted in order to maximize success rates of the conception (in hopes that at least one of the embryos will successfully survive and grow once placed in the uterus).


A complication of IVF, for this reason, is the risk of having multiples (twins, triplets, or perhaps more). Speak to your doctor about how many embryos he or she recommends to have implanted in your specific case. It would depend upon a number of factors specific to each couple, including cost (as if the procedure ""fails"" and has to be done again that gets expensive), as well as other ""fertility factors"" that can be assessed by your doctor. , Like any medical procedure, IVF has advantages and disadvantages.


The advantages of IVF include:

the vasectomy still exists as permanent birth control after your child is conceived
it is an easier procedure for the man (compared to undergoing surgery to have his vasectomy reversed)
conception can often occur within a faster time-frame (as compared with vasectomy reversal). The disadvantages of IVF include:

cost (quite expensive)
it is a more arduous procedure for the woman
the procedure may have to be repeated if you wanted additional children. This is not always the case, as sometimes extra embryos can be created that can be frozen for future pregnancies.
it may result in more than one child. Oftentimes more than one embryo is inserted into the woman's uterus, to increase the success rate of one surviving. However, this can result in more than one baby for some couples, so it is important to consider the possibility of having multiples. "

Realize that you are not the only one who feels this way.,

Welcome sex education and learn about sexuality.,
Wait until you're ready.,

Go online.,

Find someone to talk to.",How to Cope With Sex Education," Embarrassment and awkwardness are common responses to learning about sex. Sometimes, people act embarrassed to hide how curious they are, because they don't want their friends to think they are excited to learn about sex.But whatever your response is to sex education, it's okay!


In most cultures, sexuality is considered rather private, so sexual information is not discussed in the same way as other topics. But do not let that keep you from asking important questions.
Health educators understand how to make sensitive issues easier to discuss.In a sex education course, topics are developmentally appropriate for the age of the class, and the more difficult topics come later in the year.;
, Sexual education is not just about sexual intercourse--it also involves learning about how male and female bodies work and how to take care of your body.


Most sex ed curriculums in the United States are set by the individual states' boards of education . These courses tend to cover topics such as puberty, human anatomy, physical and mental health, self-esteem, and social issues like peer pressure and dating violence.
A thorough sex ed curriculum will answer questions like how to handle your menstrual cycle (for girls), what to do if you think you might be gay, how to prevent sexually-transmitted infections and diseases, what to do if you receive sexually explicit text messages, how to handle being the only virgin or the only non-virgin in your group of friends, and what to do if your boy- or girlfriend is manipulative or controlling, plus many other topics.You might feel like some of these topics don't apply to you--for instance, if you have already gone through puberty and handled those changes well, and plan to stay a virgin for now. In that case, sex ed might feel like a waste of your time, but it is possible that there are other topics you might not even realize you still need to learn about.

, No matter what your views are on controversial issues such as the biology of reproduction, heterosexuality and homosexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy, you are a sexual being. It's important to learn about this part of yourself to grow as an individual with a healthy self-image.


Even if you identify as asexual (not having any interest in sex), throughout your life other people are likely to make sexual advances toward you, and you must learn how to respond to living in a world where sexuality matters.
Health courses at the high-school level are often known as ""easy A's"" if you keep up with quizzes, projects, and homework. Typically, they are less demanding than core subjects like mathematics, science, history, world languages, or literature.
You may even have fun learning more about yourself and your body!

, For the most part, you can wait to learn about the details of sexuality until you're feeling curious and ready to start exploring.


It's OK to say, ""I don't think I'm ready for that information yet,"" when it comes to talking about sexual education. There's a lot to absorb and process, and it shows maturity to wait until you're ready to handle it.

, Although this may feel awkward, these are people who love and accept you and can really help you. Sit down with them and talk to them about sex, your body, or your relationship issues--whatever is on your mind.Don't just have ""The Talk."" Keep talking about it. Learning about sexuality should be an ongoing process.
Use opportunities to ask questions when they arise naturally. You don't have to force discussions. It may be easier to talk about issues if you discuss something you saw together in a talk show, movie, or on the news rather than ask, ""So Dad, what is a homosexual?""
Realize that your parents have been expecting this your entire life, and they have been planning how they might respond to your questions. Still, your questions might catch them off guard and they might need a little time to come up with a response that they feel is accurate without being too much information that might overwhelm you. So cut them a little slack if they seem embarrassed, too!

, Maybe Mom isn't the right person to ask about condoms. It may be better in many cases to talk with a relative you trust, such as an older brother, aunt, an older cousin, or a family friend. Just be sure the person you talk to is a mature adult with your best interests in mind.Keep it casual. Talking about sex doesn't have to be a big deal. Simply say, ""I've been meaning to ask you about something, do you have a few minutes this weekend for us to get together?"" If you let them know why you're asking (for instance, because you overheard your friends talking about something, or you saw something on the internet) they will have more context to give a thorough response.
Just like your parents, sometimes other adults can feel anxious about these types of conversations with kids or teens because they don't want to give the wrong information or more information than you need. If they seem embarrassed or caught off guard by your questions, just give them time to think about their response and don't worry about it., As long as you are cautious about where you look, the web is an extraordinary place for you to research topics you want to learn more about.


Be careful about doing internet searches for keyword terms that involve anatomy or sexuality. You might accidentally get results that are sexually explicit or pornographic instead of informative. Instead, go to a trusted website like WebMD or the American Sexual Health Association, and then search their website for the terms you are interested in learning about. For example, Wikipedia shows pictures of the human body (both female and male) and will explain confusing terms.

Be sure to let your parents know what you are researching. Always remember to be open with your parents and let them know why you are doing it, so no one gets in trouble or is overly embarrassed.

, Sexual education is available (although sometimes not mandatory) in many schools. It's helpful to have a trained professional available for questions, surrounded by people your own age, and no parents in sight.


If you do not have a sex ed class, ask your school nurse or counselor.For young adults, sometimes the school nurse can help with particular questions in privacy.

, Doctors are trained professionals and they are required to maintain your privacy. There is no need to be embarrassed around them, as they chose a career dealing with the human body. Nothing you could ever ask or show them will shock or surprise them.


You can prepare questions for your annual well-check or make a special appointment if your questions are urgent. Feel free to write down or type out your questions, and if you're too embarrassed to ask them yourself, hand them to the nurse before the doctor comes in and ask if he will give them to the doctor for you. This way, the doctor can read over your questions and prepare a good response before coming in to see you.

, Surprised? Sexual education is a lifelong process of gaining new information about relationships, intimacy, and human bodies. As you get older, you will learn more about how to be a confident, healthy individual, and as you grow, your need for information will also change.For instance, as a young teen, you may have questions about dealing with puberty. You may have issues with sexual identity as a college student. As an adult, you may have trouble conceiving a baby. And on and on. There's not one point where you will magically know everything. So you might as well start learning now.

, Sometimes embarrassment is unavoidable, so the only thing you can do is to pretend you're not embarrassed at all. With time and practice, this form of acting will help you actually overcome your embarrassment.


You can also try to deal with embarrassment by using humor to lighten the atmosphere. This is a common strategy among young people learning about sex; just mention the word ""penis"" in a room of teens and everyone will start to giggle! It turns out that laughter is a normal human instinct to try to deflect attention from feelings of embarrassment. So don't be afraid to smile to relieve some tension.Embarrassment tends to feel like everyone is looking at you and judging you.But when young people learn about sex education, they all likely feel embarrassed and awkward. No one is busy judging you; they are all busy feeling just as awkward as you do!

, Especially in a school sex ed course, there might be times when you disagree with something that your teacher says. It is OK to disagree and have your own opinion.


If you feel that the teacher is saying things that are discriminatory or dangerous, let your parents know so that they can determine if they should talk with school officials.
Otherwise, feel free to raise your hand and politely but firmly let the teacher know that there are other valid opinions on the subject. Realize you are unlikely to change the teacher's opinion, but at least you will let other students know that there are other opinions out there.

, If you are overwhelmed by information you've learned about sexuality or the human body, you might feel anxious, confused, or scared. Sometimes these responses happen because a person has heard just enough about an issue to worry them but hasn't learned enough to understand the issue completely. If you are feeling confused, worried, or disturbed by something you have heard, talk to someone you trust who can help to reassure you.


Consider talking to your parent or a trusted adult and letting them know what you heard or experienced and why it is bothering you.If you experience prolonged anxiety about these issues or about yourself as a sexual being, consider talking to a professional therapist or counselor. You can start by talking to your parents or to your doctor, school nurse, or school counselor about your concerns. Ask for a referral or recommendation."

Regardless, FAS always involves some degree of physical disability. Common ones include small head and brain size, distinctive facial features, joint problems, slower growth rate, vision and hearing issues, and heart and kidney dysfunction.Distinctive facial appearance includes: small face, small eyes, thin upper lip and a small upturned nose.
In general, people with FAS are smaller in stature and proportions compared to their cohorts.;

Children with FAS may develop attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or something similar at an early age.
Some kids with milder forms of FAS can stay in the regular educational system and may even get college degrees, but most need specialized education.
Keep in mind that FAS is a spectrum condition, so some kids may not be as affected by it as others.

, Due to their physical and mental disabilities, some people with FAS also experience many profound social and behavioral issues throughout their lives. In essence, they have trouble functioning, coping and interacting with others because of their issues with processing information, reasoning, problem solving and understanding the consequences of their actions.People with FAS may have difficulty in school, trouble getting along with others, problems adapting to change, difficulty keeping track of time, and difficulty making plans or working toward longer term goals.
Alcohol and drug abuse, criminal behavior, depression and inappropriate sexual behavior are all much more common in people with FAS.

, If you drank alcohol during your pregnancy (especially during the first trimester) then you may have a strong suspicion that your child has FAS if they display FAS symptoms. However, if you adopted a child or are providing foster care and don't know their prenatal history, you should see a doctor (preferably a pediatrician) as soon as you notice physical, mental, learning and/or behavioral problems.An early diagnosis of FAS may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for an afflicted child.
If you drank any alcohol after conceiving, let your obstetrician or pediatrician know as soon as you find out you're pregnant.

, Once you've recognized unusual symptoms in your child and received a diagnosis of FAS from your doctor, you should seek support from experienced / trained medical professionals and other families dealing with FAS children.Get a list of resources from your healthcare provider and spend quality time researching FAS-related websites online.


Knowing that you're not alone and don't have to learn everything from trial and error tends to be very reassuring to parents of kids with FAS.
Being able to get answers to your questions and having a sympathetic “sounding board"" prevents parents from feeling helpless and overwhelmed.

, Children who receive special instruction focused on their specific needs and learning abilities are more likely to achieve their full potential. Families of children with FAS who participate in social services (such as counseling) increase their chances of having positive relationships and a more stable family dynamic.Plus, with your child in the hands of competent people on a regular basis, you'll have more time for other aspects of your life.


As noted, kids with FAS have a wide range of behaviors and challenges that need to be addressed by trained professionals, such as counselors, social workers and healthcare workers.
Special education schools hire trained staff to specifically deal with the learning disabled. Plus, there are often less students per teacher in these environments, so your child will have more one-on-one time.

, All children prosper from a loving and nurturing home life. Children with FAS can be especially susceptible to turmoil, frequent moves, or destructive relationships, so consistent support from an understanding and patient family structure at home are essential.A calm child who feels loved, secure, and stable will be much easier to cope with at home.


Positive family support and attention can help prevent secondary conditions related to FAS, such as criminal behavior, chronic unemployment, and incomplete education.
Keep in mind that people with FAS may struggle with daily life situations, so some kids might need supervision to develop patterns of appropriate behavior., Those with FAS who live in calm, abuse-free households are less likely to develop violent and aggressive behaviors, which they may be more prone to because of their disabilities.As such, don't allow domestic violence and severely heated arguments to occur in your household. Children with FAS should learn how to control their frustration and anger early on.


Kids with FAS need to be taught other ways of channeling their anger or frustration, such as doing strenuous physical exercise.
Pointing out and using rewards to reinforce acceptable behavior is an effective way of steering a FAS child away from negative or aggressive behavior.Family counseling, where everyone participates, can be helpful in reducing moments of impatience, intolerance and frustration.

, While communicating at home, keep things simple for your child by using concrete, specific language and lots of repetition in order to reinforce learning new things.Don’t use words with double meanings, abstractions, idioms, etc. because their ability to understand may be far below their chronological age. Keep it simple and consistent when talking to your child to limit confusion and forgetfulness.


Recognize your child's strengths and limitations when implementing daily routines and creating/enforcing simple rules and limits of behavior.
Stable routines that don’t change make it easier for people with FAS to know what to expect, which decreases their anxiety and makes them easier to cope with.

, Another great way to cope with a child with FAS is to get specific parent training because of all the special needs they have. Parent training is successful in educating parents about their kid's problems and it may help them cope better with all the FAS-related symptoms and challenges.Parent training can be done in larger groups or just with individual family units. These programs are typically offered by therapists or counselors.
If there are two parents involved with an FAS child, it's important that both attend the training so they are ""on the same page"" with the techniques and coping strategies.

, Children with FAS have such a diverse set of disabilities and problems, your family doctor or pediatrician may not be able or trained to be the sole healthcare provider. Instead, while your child is still very young, assemble a team that includes a pediatrician, an ENT (ear, nose, throat) specialist, physical and occupational therapists, a psychologist, a speech therapist, neurologist (if seizures are a problem for the child), and a special education teacher.Once these people are assembled it'll be easier to cope and experience less anxiety when your child needs their expertise.
Choose a medical facility that has many of these types of specialists under one roof, which will save you lots of time driving around to different locations.
Encourage communication between the members of your medical team for the most effective treatments and best results.

, No drugs have been approved specifically to treat FAS, but many types can help improve symptoms, such as hyperactivity, the inability to focus, difficulty sleeping, and depression.Behavior and mood altering medication can make it easier for parents to cope with FAS children. The children also tend to do better in social environments and are more likely to score higher on tests.


Stimulants (Adderall, Ritalin) are drugs used to treat ADHD, poor impulse control and other behavior issues.
Antidepressants help with depression, mood swings, aggression, sleep problems and anti-social behaviors.
Anti-anxiety drugs help treat symptoms of anxiety, stress and obsessive / compulsive thoughts.
Neuroleptic drugs can help treat aggression, irritability, anxiety and other behavior problems.
Medications affect each child differently, so your doctor might try different types and doses to get the best results.

, Although there are no alternative therapies that are proven to help FAS children (and none are recommended by the medical establishment), a number of approaches may be worth a try in efforts to improve your child's behavior and help you cope better. Some alternative treatments used for FAS include: biofeedback, relaxation therapy, visual imagery, meditation, yoga, high intensity exercise (if it is well-tolerated by the child), regular exercise, acupuncture, massage, energy healing, animal-assisted therapy and various nutritional supplements (vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids).Before starting any type of alternative treatment, research it carefully and talk to your medical team about it.
These treatments can't fix the physical and mental damage done by FAS, but they may be able to relax and calm behaviors.

Complete the test at home.,
Evaluate the results.,
Consult a specialist to check your sperm.",How to Check Your Sperm Count1," At-home sperm tests have been found to be accurate around 95% of the time.Masturbate into the cup the kit provides for you and complete the test exactly as indicated in the instructions. Read the instructions carefully beforehand so you know what to do and what not to do.

Generally, you will collect your sample in a cup, transfer the sample to the testing kit after a specific amount of time, and read the results.You may also have to add another solution to the sample, but this depends on the test.
Tests like these are available at many drug stores and pharmacies.;
, Results should be available in about 10 minutes, though this varies by test. A normal sperm concentration is considered to be above 20 million per milliliter. If your results are lower than that, consult your doctor for a complete infertility workup.Some tests simply tell you whether your count is normal or low. Others may be more exact. This varies by test, so read the instructions carefully.

, At-home tests do not measure other factors that affect fertility. If you are having trouble conceiving, consider seeing a fertility specialist even if your at-home test shows normal results. At-home tests do not check:How much semen you ejaculate at one time (semen volume)
The percent of your sperm that are alive (vitality)
How well your sperm move (motility)
The shape of your sperm (morphology)

Consult your doctor for a yearly physical.,
Avoid processed, packaged, and prepared foods.,
Eat foods as close to their natural state as possible.,
Avoid outside sources of sugar.,
Increase healthy fats.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat only when hungry.,
Don't go on crash diets.,
Eat following a workout.",How to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally1," Ask for a detailed analysis of your weight. If you are overweight or obese, this could be the cause of a drop in testosterone.


Obese people secrete more aromatase, an enzyme that works to convert testosterone to estrogen. Your metabolism will continue to decrease as your body produces more aromatase, making the problem worse. Create a weight loss plan with your doctor.;
, Increased weight and obesity can lead to low testosterone levels.Changing your dietary patterns can make a big difference not only to your testosterone levels but to your risk for heart disease and diabetes. Start changing your diet by cutting out processed, packaged, and prepared foods.

, Eating “whole” foods means cutting out excess sugars, trans and hydrogenated fats, preservatives, etc. Try to incorporate:


More fruits and vegetablesMore fish and quality meat.
Avoid processed food, including grains, lentils, beans, and dairy.
More nuts and seeds

, This includes sugars added to processed foods (such as high fructose corn syrup), as well as artificial sweeteners.If you need a “sweet hit”, try using Stevia, a herb that can provide sixty times the sweetness of sugar.

, Omega-3 fats are healthy fats found in a variety of foods. These include those found in eggs, algae, fish, and mussels, but also plant oils like flaxseed, hemp and walnut oil. Healthy fats actually help to build a healthier body.

, Lots of water is essential to any healthy diet. In addition to hydrating you, water can also stop you from feeling hungry.

, Cut down on snacking, eating when bored, and other sneaky calories. Try to eat only when you are hungry.

, Restricting calories significantly may send the wrong signals to your body, which will not increase testosterone. Instead, cut your calories by approximately 15 percent the first week.


All weight loss goals should be reasonable. Aim to lose a pound per week by improving diet and increasing activity levels.

, Meat, high-protein yogurt, and some vegetables can help build muscle. Increasing muscle will help burn fat and increase testosterone.

Visit your doctor for a history and physical exam.,
Schedule a semen analysis test.,
Repeat the test.",How to Check Your Sperm Count2," Tell your doctor you are worried about your fertility, and get an examination. They will ask you about your medical and family history, and perform a physical exam. They will examine your genitals, and may ask you about your sexual history and sexual development., Semen analysis looks at a sample of your semen under a microscope. A lab technician, doctor, or computer count how many sperm appear in the squares of a grid pattern. This is the most common sperm count test, so ask your doctor to schedule you an appointment with a fertility specialist., Semen analysis tests are usually repeated at least twice over a period of time. This is because sperm count varies somewhat, and your doctor will need an accurate representation of your sperm count over time.A second sample is usually collected one to two weeks after the first.

"
"
Masturbate into a container your doctor gives you.,
Use a special condom made to catch semen for testing.,
Avoid common pitfalls.",How to Check Your Sperm Count3," When it comes time to do your sperm test, your doctor will give you a special cup or container. Masturbate and catch your ejaculate in the container. Make sure to put the lid on to avoid spills.If possible, do this in the clinic. If you need to, you may be able to take the container home with you. Ask your doctor to give you specific instructions about storing the container, and when to bring it back to the office.

, Some clinics may be able to provide you a special condom to wear during intercourse. This condom collects your semen for examination. Some men find it easier to ejaculate this way, and it may help you if you feel nervous at the doctor’s office. These may not always be available, however – ask your doctor about your options., Collecting a sperm sample can go wrong in a number of ways. Ask your doctor for specific details about how to collect an accurate sample. Follow these guidelines to the best of your ability:

Do not use lubricant, which can interfere with how your sperm move
Do not masturbate for at least a day before you collect your sample; on the other hand, abstain no more than 11 days before you collect your sample.
Make sure all of your ejaculate goes into the container. If you miss, wait a day and try again.

Start a strength-training routine.,
Use weight machines or free weights 2 to 3 times per week.,
Do cardio-interval training.,
Make sure you sweat during your 30-minute workout.,
Fast intermittently.",How to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally2," If you have never lifted weights, used resistance bands or used weight machines, hire a personal trainer or physical therapist to teach you the proper form and procedure.If you are very weak, start with resistance bands. This gentle form of strength-training allows you to use a rubber strap to train weak muscles before lifting actual weights.Do this 2 to 3 times per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks. If you have a joint or back problem, you may want to graduate to stronger bands and stick to this form of strength training.
You can increase your testosterone levels by up to 20 percent by lifting weights 3 times per week for 11 weeks.
Strength training in the evenings can increase testosterone levels in the evening. These effects tend to be brief and smaller the better shape you are in.They can still help.

, For men, you will want to choose weights that tire your muscles after only 5 repetitions. Do 3 sets. You should feel muscle fatigue after a weight training workout. Allow your muscles 24 to 48 hours to rest.


Women or people with joint problems may choose to do endurance training. For example, they may choose a slightly lower weight and complete 3 sets of 10 to 15.
Work half sets in between full sets. This means you should complete half the range of motion, from the bottom up or top down, to work the fast twitch muscle fibers as well as the slow twitch fibers.
Lift weights slowly. Breathe slowly and never drop the weight. Control the weight until it is in its original position.

, Begin doing cardio exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times per week.


Interval training requires you to warm up, sprint or workout intensely for a short period (such as 90 seconds), and then work out at a more moderate ""resting"" pace for a slightly longer interval (approximately 2 to 4 minutes). Repeat these sets for approximately 30 minutes, including warm up and cool down. The different intervals can vary based on the specific cardio activity. If you are new to interval training, consider having a personal trainer suggest a regimen for your experience level.
Cardiovascular machines, like stair machines, bikes, ellipticals, and treadmills can be programmed to do interval training if you do not want to jog or swim while providing your own interval timing.

, While general activity is good, you will need to work your heart more intensely to reach weight loss and testosterone improvement goals. This is true for both strength training and cardio.


Do not overtrain. If you are already fit, too much cardio exercise is likely to lower testosterone levels.Your goal is to keep your metabolism high while giving the body plenty of time to rest and recover.
Drink plenty of water before, during, and after exercise. Dehydrated people produce less testosterone after a workout.
Don’t forget the other benefits from exercise, including better cardiovascular health, weight loss, increased strength, and endurance., Intermittent fasting combined with moderate to high-intensity exercise has been shown to increase testosterone levels.During the fasting period, include moderate to high-intensity exercise of your choice. The idea here is that since you are fasting, your body will turn to stored fat for its fuel."

Get a full night's sleep.,
Stay active.,
Reduce your stress levels.,
Consider including sexual activity in the morning.",How to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally3," Doctors recommend 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Less sleep can result in 10% lower testosterone levels. Less sleep can also make it difficult to lose weight., Moving around more and sitting less will balance your hormones, decrease stress, and result in weight loss.


Buy a pedometer. Make sure you hit at least 10,000 steps per day during the course of your daily routine.

, Stress produces the hormone cortisol and interrupts the production of hormones such as testosterone.Focus on creating a work/life balance. Spend 2 hours a day on leisure activities you enjoy. Try to bring your workday down to 10 hours or less.Start meditation, deep breathing, yoga, tai chi, and/or qigong. These activities can reduce stress and help you sleep better. If you don’t think you have time, start by taking four 2-3 minutes throughout the day to take 25 deep breaths per break.

, If low testosterone has affected your sex life, then consider changing sexual activity to the morning. Testosterone levels are naturally higher in the morning.

"

Get some sun.,
Take a zinc supplement.,
Consider herbal supplements.",How to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally4," Getting vitamin D requires you to spend some time (15 to 30 minutes) with a good amount of your skin in direct sunlight. Keeping vitamin D levels high can produce up to 20% more testosterone. Consider talking to a medical professional about vitamin D supplements if you work inside all day and cannot spend time in the sun., Moderate to mild zinc deficiencies have been shown to lower testosterone levels.Talk to a knowledgeable healthcare provider about a zinc supplement.

, Some studies have shown that certain herbal supplements may help to increase testosterone or combat the effects of low testosterone. Some of these herbal supplements include:


Tribulus terrestris, which has shown an increase in sexual activity in animal studies. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.
Withania somnifera (ashwaganda), which has been reported in preliminary clinical trials to increase sperm quality.Most studies have used up to 450 mg four times a day.
Ginkgo biloba, which increases testosterone synthesis.Dosage was 270 mg of ginkgo extract 4 times a day. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.
Yohimbe, which has been used to increase sexual interest and treat erectile dysfunction.Doses vary but ranged from 5.4 mg (3 times a day) to 10.8 mg (3 times a day). Follow manufacturer’s instructions.

Understand how HIV works.,
Realize that most social interactions cannot spread HIV.,
Know how infection is transmitted.",How to Avoid HIV and AIDS1," HIV invades and destroys the T-cells or CD4 cells in the blood responsible for fighting off other viruses and bacteria, leaving the victim vulnerable to other infections and diseases.The HIV virus needs these T-cells in order to reproduce itself, and so cannot survive in areas without blood cells, such as skin or hair.


Someone who has been infected with HIV is referred to as ""HIV positive"" or ""HIV+"". Someone with ""AIDS"" has lost almost all of their CD4 cells, or their immune system has been damaged enough that they are experiencing ""opportunistic infections"" or infection-related cancers.;
, Speaking with or shaking hands with HIV+ people is completely harmless, so you do not need to worry whether anyone you meet has HIV. The virus cannot survive in air, water, or most other substances outside of the human body, so sharing food, swimming in the same pool, or sharing a bathroom with an HIV+ person will not transmit an infection.

, HIV is transmitted by certain bodily fluids, but not all of them. They are: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, breast milk and vaginal fluid.Any exposure to these fluids could result in acquiring HIV. The following sections give you specific advice on how to avoid contact with these fluids in all situations, including sex.


Note that saliva or phlegm do not contain the virus. This means that exposure is not possible through kissing, sneezing, or coughing, unless visible amounts of blood are mixed with the other bodily fluids. Even then, transmission through brief contact is highly unlikely."

Understand how HPV is transmitted.,
Identify genital warts.,
Look for signs of anal cancer.,
Identify penile cancer.,
Watch for signs of throat and mouth cancer.,
Be aware of risk factors for HPV in men.,
Consider a vaccine.,
Treat genital warts.,
Ask about anal cancer screening if you have sex with men.,
Examine yourself regularly.,
Discuss possible cancer symptoms with the doctor.",How to Recognize HPV in Men (Human Papillomavirus)," HPV can spread through any skin-to-skin contact involving the genitals. This can happen during vaginal sex, anal sex, hand-to-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact without penetration, and (rarely) oral sex.HPV can remain in your system for years without causing symptoms. This means you could still have HPV even if you have not recently had sex, or if you have only been having sex with one partner.You cannot get HPV from shaking hands or from inanimate objects such as toilet seats (except possibly shared sex toys). The virus does not spread through the air.Condoms do not protect you completely from HPV, but they may reduce the chance of transmission.;
, Some strains of HPV can cause genital warts: lumps or growths in the genital or anal region. These are considered low risk strains, since they rarely lead to cancer.If you're not sure whether you have genital warts, compare your symptoms to the following:


The most common location for genital warts in men is under the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, or on the shaft of a circumcised penis.Warts can also appear on the testicles, groin, thighs, or around the anus.Less commonly, warts can appear inside the anus or urethra, causing bleeding or discomfort at the toilet. You do not need to have anal sex to get anal warts.The warts can vary in number, shape (flat, raised, or cauliflower-like), color (skin-colored, red, pink, grey, or white), firmness; and symptoms (none, itchiness, or pain).

, HPV rarely causes cancer in men. Even though almost every sexually active person has been exposed to HPV, it only causes anal cancer in about 1,600 U.S. men a year.Anal cancer can begin without any obvious symptoms, or with one or more of the following:Bleeding, pain, or itching of the anus.
Unusual discharge from the anus.
Swollen lymph nodes (lumps you can feel) in the anal or groin area.
Unusual bowel movements or a change in the shape of your stools.

, About 700 U.S. men each year are diagnosed with HPV-caused penile cancer.Possible signs of early penile cancer include:An area of penis skin becoming thicker or changing color, usually on the tip or foreskin (if uncircumcised)
A lump or sore on the penis, usually not painful
A reddish, velvety rash
Small, crusty bumps
Flat, bluish-brown growths
Smelly discharge under the foreskin
Swelling at the end of the penis

, HPV increases the risk of cancer in the throat or back of the mouth (cancer of the oropharynx), even if it's not the direct cause.Possible signs include:A persistent sore throat or ear pain
Difficulty swallowing, opening the mouth fully, or moving the tongue
Unexplained weight loss
Lump in the neck, mouth, or throat
Hoarseness or voice changes that last more than two weeks, Certain characteristics make an HPV infection more likely. Even if you are not showing symptoms, it's a good idea to educate yourself about possible medical checkups and treatments if you fall into any of these categories:Men who have sex with men, especially those who receive anal sex
Men with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, a recent organ transplant, or immunosuppressant medication
Men with many sexual partners (of any sex), especially if condoms are not used
Heavy use of tobacco, alcohol, hot yerba mate, or betel increase your risk of some HPV-linked cancers (especially in the mouth and throat).Uncircumcised men might be at higher risk, but the data is unclear., One series of the HPV vaccine provides safe, long-lasting protection against many of the HPV strains that cause cancer (but not all).Because the vaccine is much more effective on young people, the Center for Disease Control recommends it for the following men:All men 21 or younger (ideally at age 11 or 12 before sexual activity)
All men who have sex with men at the age of 26 or younger
All men with a compromised immune system age 26 or younger (including HIV positive men)
Tell the provider about any severe allergies you have before getting the vaccine, especially to latex or yeast.

, Genital warts may go away on their own after a few months, and will never lead to cancer. The main reason to treat them is your own comfort. Treatments include creams or ointments (such as Podofilox, Imiquimod, or Sinecatechins) which you can apply at home, or removal at the doctor's office by freezing (cryotherapy), acid, or surgery.A doctor can also apply vinegar to illuminate warts that aren't yet raised or visible.You can transmit HPV even if you don't have symptoms, but the chances are higher while you have genital warts. Talk to your sexual partners about this risk, and cover the warts with condoms or other barriers if possible.
Although the strains of HPV that cause genital warts do not cause cancer, you may have been exposed to more than one strain. You should still talk to your doctor if you have noticed any possible cancer signs or unexplained symptoms.

, HPV-related anal cancer rates are much higher among men who have sex with men. If you fall into this category, tell your doctor about your sexual orientation, and ask about the anal pap smear test. Your doctor may recommend a test every three years (one year if you are HIV positive) to screen for anal cancer.Not all doctors agree that a regular screening is necessary or helpful, but they should still educate you about the test and allow you to make your own decision. If your doctor does not offer this service or cannot tell you about it, seek a second opinion.
If homosexuality is illegal in your country, you may be able to get treatment and health education resources from an international LGBT or HIV prevention organization.

, Self-examination can help you detect any HPV signs as early as possible. If it turns out to be cancer, it will be much easier to remove if you catch it early. When in doubt, visit the doctor promptly when you see any unexplained symptom.


Regularly examine your penis and genital area for any signs of warts and/or areas that look unusual on the penis., Your doctor should examine the area and ask you questions to help diagnose the problem. If they think HPV-related cancer could be a possibility, they can take a biopsy and let you know the result within a few days.Your dentist can check for signs of mouth and throat cancer during a routine checkup.If you are diagnosed with cancer, the treatment will depend on the severity and how early it was discovered. You may be able to remove early cancer with minor surgical procedures or local treatments such as laser removal or freezing. If the cancer has already spread, you may need radiation or chemotherapy."

Look for physical symptoms.,
Look for emotional symptoms.,
Have a blood test to determine the condition.",How to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally5," Men with low testosterone levels may notice a variety of associated symptoms. These may include:


Erectile dysfunction (ED), including a decrease in the number and quality of erections
Smaller testes (hypogonadism)
Decreased sperm counts
A decrease in muscle mass leading to decreased strength and endurance
Changes in blood lipids such as cholesterol levels
Osteopenia (softening of the bones) and osteoporosis (decreased bone density)
Hot flashes
Swollen or tender breasts (gynecomastia)

, In addition to physical effects, men may also notice mood changes associated with low testosterone. These can include:


Decreased sex drive (libido)
Fatigue
Mood changes, including depression, irritability, and anxiety
Problems with memory, concentration, or a sudden lack of self-confidence

, Diagnosis involves a blood test along with a physical exam. The test is most often done using blood drawn in the morning. This is usually when testosterone levels are highest.


Your doctor will diagnose the condition if your combination of symptoms and lab results indicate low testosterone levels.

Increase testosterone if you’re an adult with abnormally low levels.,
Try herbal supplements if you have no conflicting health concerns.,
Exercise caution if you take certain medications.,
Consider short-term use of herbal remedies.,
Use dietary supplements in moderation.,
Make beneficial lifestyle changes after consulting your doctor.",How to Increase Testosterone Levels Naturally6," Under most circumstances, adults who have been medically diagnosed with low testosterone levels can safely increase their levels, and natural methods can be some of the healthiest ways to do so. That being said, you should avoid intentionally increasing your testosterone if you are still an adolescent or if you’re an adult with normal or undiagnosed levels.


Testosterone levels are usually highest during your adolescent years, but since your hormones fluctuate regularly during this time of your life, it's best to let them naturally adjust themselves rather than attempting to change them yourself.If you're concerned about low testosterone as a teenager, consult with your doctor before making any changes.
Increasing testosterone when your levels are already normal can negatively impact your health, even as an adult. For women, high testosterone may lead to polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, obesity, and thinning hair, among other problems.There's some debate regarding how harmful high testosterone can be for men, but some research suggests that excessively high levels can increase a man's risk of cardiovascular disease., If you have no known health concerns other than low testosterone, most herbal supplements should be relatively safe to try on a short-term basis. Certain medical conditions may make these herbal remedies dangerous, however, so you may wish to avoid using herbs to increase testosterone if you have known health concerns.


For women, avoid most herbal supplements if you are (or might be) pregnant or if you're currently breastfeeding. Tribulus, ashwagandha, ginkgo, and yohimbe are all considered unsafe under these conditions.
For men, tribulus might be linked to prostate problems.Ashwagandha may cause problems in people with diabetes, low blood pressure, stomach ulcers, auto-immune diseases, and thyroid disorders.Ginkgo may cause an allergic reaction if you're allergic to urushiols, like poison ivy and cashews. It could also cause problems if you have blood pressure irregularities, diabetes, hypoglycemia, gastro-intestinal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, nervous system disorders, seizures, skin disorders, psychiatric disorders, or heart disease.Yohimbe is dangerous if you suffer from bleeding conditions, schizophrenia, prostate problems, PTSD, liver disease, kidney disease, blood pressure irregularities, heart disease, anxiety, depression, or diabetes., If you're not currently on any medications, most herbal remedies are likely safe to use. You may need to avoid these remedies if you're currently on medications that could interact with them, however.


Avoid tribulus if you're on blood pressure medication, diabetes medications, or steroids.Ashwagandha may be dangerous if you're on immunosuppressants or sedative medications.Ginkgo could negatively interact with heart disease agents, seizure medications, anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, and CYP450-metabolized agents.Avoid yohimbe if you take or may take MAOIs, clonidine, guanabenz, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs, naloxone, phenothiazines, or stimulant drugs., As long as you do not have conditions or medications that may cause complications, testosterone herbal remedies are likely safe for adults when taken for six months or less.


Beyond six months, some herbal remedies may result in complications like excessive bleeding,stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting.Difficulty sleeping may also be a result., While moderate amounts of vitamin D and zinc can help your body produce more testosterone and stay healthy, excessive amounts of either nutrient can actually be toxic. It's usually best to get both nutrients from natural sources, but if you choose to take supplemental forms, simply make sure you follow the dosing instructions provided on the label.


The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D is 600 IU (international units) daily. Toxicity usually occurs in people who regularly take around 50,000 IU for several months, but this amount may be smaller for individuals with liver problems, kidney problems, or other health concerns.For zinc, the recommended daily allowance is between 8 and 11 mg daily in adults.The upper limit is about 40 mg daily, and toxicity typically occurs when individuals regularly intake more than this upper limit., Making healthier diet and exercise choices can be a great idea, even if you don't need to increase your testosterone levels. To get the most benefit out of your improved lifestyle while minimizing any possible risks, see your doctor before implementing any major changes.


In addition to testing your testosterone levels and notifying you of any personal health limitations, your doctor can work with you to determine the best treatment possible. Your doctor may suggest medical remedies, but don't be afraid to let your doctor know if you strongly wish to stick with natural methods. As long as it doesn’t present a threat to your health, most doctors will be willing to work out a strategy according to your wishes.

Increase your level of physical activity.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.,
Quit smoking.",How to Cope With Erectile Dysfunction1," Erectile dysfunction is often related to blood flow and circulation. Being sedentary or overweight can result in poor circulation, increasing the risk of ED. By keeping your blood flowing at a healthy pace, you can improve your sexual performance and alleviate or prevent erectile dysfunction. Commit to getting exercise every day to improve symptoms of ED.You don't have to start running marathons to see results. One study demonstrated that just 30 minutes of walking a day reduced ED risk up to 40%.;
, A healthy diet is good for your overall health, and this will benefit your sexual performance. Eating right will give you the nutrients you need for energy and good circulation, while also helping you maintain a healthy weight.Cut out saturated fats, processed sugar, and enriched wheat. These foods can clog your arteries and increase your cholesterol levels. Both will lead to poor circulation that could contribute to ED.
Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods will help keep your cholesterol low, give you a healthy blood pressure, and improve circulation.
Vitamin B12 deficiency has been suspected to contribute to ED. You can remedy this with a daily multivitamin or eating shellfish, dairy products, and fortified cereals., These muscles help keep blood in the penis to maintain an erection. Weak pelvic muscles can let blood escape and contribute to ED.You can strengthen the pelvic muscles with Kegel exercises. These are usually recommended for women, but men can benefit from them as well.To do Kegels, you'll have to flex the muscles you would use to hold urine in.
Tighten these muscles for five seconds, then relax for five seconds. Do this four or five times in a row.

Reduce your sexual risk factors.,
Prevent exchange of bodily fluids during sex.,
Learn how to use a condom effectively.,
Learn about HIV prevention myths.,
Understand which sexual practices reduce, but do not eliminate, the chance of infection.",How to Avoid HIV and AIDS2," You are less likely to become exposed to HIV if you do not have sex, reduce the number of your sexual partners, require sexual partners to get tested for HIV, and/or limit your sex to uninfected sexual partners who do not have sex outside your relationship. Choosing one or more of these sexual practices is an excellent way to reduce the chance of HIV transmission, especially when combined with condom use as described below.


Have long-term sexual partners get tested for HIV before you have sex without a condom. A significant percentage of people with HIV do not know they have the virus., HIV can be transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sex if one or more people involved are HIV+. However, there are ways to reduce, but not eliminate, the chance of its transmission. Always use latex condoms or latex female condoms when having sex with a new sexual partner, any sexual partner who has not been recently tested for HIV, or during every sexual encounter if you have multiple sexual partners. When performing oral sex on a vagina or anus, use dental dams or non-lubricated, cut-open condoms for oral sex to prevent direct contact with the mouth.



Warning: lambskin condoms do not prevent infection, as they contain microscopic holes that the virus can travel through. Polyurethane condoms may not prevent infection as effectively as latex condoms., Practice putting on and removing a condom or a female condom several times before you use one during sex for the first time. Talk to your sexual partner in advance about condom use so you aren't pressured not to use one at the last minute, and make sure to put on the condom before any genital contact begins.Male condoms should be pinched at the tip before putting them on, so there is room for the semen to collect. Make sure not to expose yourself to the portion of the condom that was exposed to your sexual partner's fluids while removing the condom, especially if you have cuts on your hands. Follow these instructions as well for safest condom use:A condom or dental dam should never be torn, used past its expiration date, re-used, or used for more than 20 minutes at a time.
Apply a small amount of water-based lube to the condom if necessary to prevent it from drying out and breaking. Never use oil-based lubes or lotions, which can damage the condom.
Penises with condoms should be pulled out from orifices before the erection is lost, as the condom may slip off when the penis is no longer hard.
Store condoms inside their wrapper in a dark, dry location. Replace condoms that have been kept in your wallet or car for longer than one or two weeks.

, There are many myths or misunderstandings about how to protect yourself from HIV or AIDS during sex. Learn the truth so you do not try to protect yourself with the wrong method. Understand that any form of sex with an HIV positive person carries the risk of infection, and that condoms are one of the most reliable ways to reduce that risk.


You cannot prevent infection using any type of birth control besides condoms.
You cannot eliminate the chance of infection through circumcision. Studies show that circumcision partially reduces a man's chance of contracting HIV from an HIV+ woman.However, this is not effective enough on its own to result in ""safe sex,"" and does not necessarily help at all in male-male sexual encounters, or reduce the chance of a woman contracting HIV from a man.
There is no such thing as a special lube, anti-microbe medicine, or vaccination that protects against HIV.Lube is only useful in HIV prevention because it helps prevent condoms from breaking, not because it can stop the virus on its own.

, While no sexual activity that involves the vagina, penis, or anus is completely safe, some involve lower risks than other and may be preferable if you have decided to have sex with someone you know is HIV positive. Oral sex, especially mouth-on-vagina, carries less risk than other forms of sex, although studies are unclear on the exact level of risk.Inserting fingers or sex toys into the anus or vagina carries little risk of transmission as long as the fingers do not have open cuts or sores, and the sex toys are washed between uses."
"
Stop using injected drugs if possible.,
Do not re-use or share needles when injecting drugs or receiving piercings or tattoos.,
Disinfect needles between use if you have no access to clean needles.",How to Avoid HIV and AIDS3," You can become infected with HIV by using a needle that has been previously used by someone with HIV. This can occur even if the needle appears clean. Because many injected drugs are addictive, it can be difficult to turn down an opportunity to inject, even if you know the needle is unsafe. Entering a substance abuse recovery program is highly recommended in this scenario.

, Use new, sterile syringes each time, or confirm with the tattoo artist that they are not re-using a needle. Make sure to receive your needles from a reputable source. Never reuse or share anything used to prepare or take drugs, including water (as this could be contaminated with HIV-infected blood). After using, dispose of needles safely by throwing them away inside a closed bottle, preferably one with no recycling refund or collectible value.Some regions have free needle exchange programs where people can turn in used needles and receive clean ones in return. Search online for programs in your area.

, If stopping or finding a new needle are not possible, clean and disinfect a used needle before injecting. This does not make the needle safe; it only partially reduces the risk. First, fill the syringe with clean water, shake it to dislodge particles of blood, then empty. Repeat this process several times, until no more blood is visible. Next, fill the syringe with a disinfectant such as household bleach, and let sit for at least 30 seconds. Empty and rinse gain with more clean water in order to remove the disinfectant.Bleach stored in a warm or sunny place can break down and become much less effective.

Reduce your exposure if you work around bodily fluids.,
Take action after exposure.,
Practice safer sex.,
Research your options if you want to have children with an HIV+ person.,
Talk to a doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis.",How to Avoid HIV and AIDS4," Health professionals or anyone who comes into contact with bodily fluids that can carry the virus should always be cautious at work. Never recap sharp objects (syringes, lancets, etc.) after use. Always dispose of used sharp objects in a clear container to avoid accidental contact. Wear the proper safety protection (gloves, gowns, goggles, etc.) when working with blood or other fluids. Always treat all blood and body fluids as if they are infectious.

, Whether you are health care worker who was splashed with a patient's blood, or you were having sex while a condom broke, it's important to consult a doctor as soon as possible. See the section on taking action for more detail.


If you are pregnant or become pregnant, talk to a doctor about your pregnancy and HIV exposure to find out more about reducing the risk of transmission to the baby.

, If you know a sexual partner is HIV positive, work out a way to have an intimate relationship with minimum risk. Use condoms while having sex, or perform sexual acts that do not exchange bodily fluids, such as having one person use their fingers or sex toys instead of other body parts. See ""reducing the risk of sexual transmission"" for more detail.

, Minimize the risk of a woman or baby contracting HIV from an HIV+ man through adoption or a sperm donor. If a woman has HIV, consider a surrogate mother. Using an HIV+ person's sperm is not recommended, but it can be treated by medical professionals to reduce, but not eliminate, HIV before it is used in in vitro fertilization or artificial insemination.Having unprotected sex with an HIV+ person carries the highest risk of transmission. Always talk to a medical professional before making this decision, and limit sexual activity to the woman's most fertile point in the ovulation cycle.

, This preventative medicine, also known as PrEP, is a drug taken daily by people who are exposed regularly HIV, such as people who frequently have sex with HIV+ people. It may also be recommended for long-term sexual partners of people who are at risk of HIV. It is not 100% effective, and is best combined with other safety practices such as condom use. It is important to take the drug every day in the instructed doses, or it will be much less effective.If you are not frequently exposed to HIV+ body fluids, PrEP is not for you. Instead, if there is an incident which may have transmitted HIV, ask a doctor about post-exposure prophylaxis immediately after the incident.

"
"
Contact a doctor about post-exposure prophylaxis.,
Look for symptoms.,
Get tested regularly.",How to Avoid HIV and AIDS5," If you have been exposed, or fear that you have been exposed, to infected fluids, you may be able to take post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, an anti retroviral drug. This medication, when taken immediately after exposure (or up to 72 hours after) can drastically reduce the chance of becoming infected.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that only HIV negative people who have recently been exposed to HIV use this drug. Abusing this drug can result in serious health risks. While this drug does not cure HIV, it can, if used properly, prevent someone who has just been exposed from contracting the virus.

, Two to four weeks after being infected, people who are HIV+ often, but not always, experience flu-like symptoms. This is called ARS (acute retro-viral syndrome) and is described as the ""worst flu ever."" The person may experience fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash. These symptoms may last up to 4 weeks.If you notice these symptoms get tested right away.

, Testing is the only way to actually know your status. When you get tested, you will most likely be given a blood test, although urine or a swab of fluid are also used. The results will come back in a few days or in as little as 20 minutes, depending on where and when you get tested. If you test as HIV+, meaning you have the virus, receive treatment as soon as possible.

Understand the implications of contracting HIV.,
Make an appointment with a doctor who specializes in treating HIV or AIDS.,
Prepare for your doctor visit.,
Accept that finding the right medications for your treatment takes time.,
Reduce your expose to other infectious diseases.,
Build up your support system.,
Reduce the risk of exposing others to the virus.,
Follow doctors' instructions.,
Consult a doctor if you become pregnant.",How to Avoid HIV and AIDS6," Once someone becomes HIV positive, the virus will never leave the person's body. However, medical treatment is still vital for delaying the progress of the infection, which can eventually reach the more serious condition called AIDS. Modern medicine has been able to slow down the spread of the virus and help HIV+ patients live relatively comfortable lives, but there is no cure. Infecting others remains a concern even if the HIV+ person has had stable health for years or decades.

, Find an infectious disease (ID) specialist in your area, or ask any doctor to refer you to a specialist. Be aware that, depending on your condition, he or she may ask you to see other doctors as well to address other aspects of your health. If you follow your doctors' instructions and have access to adequate medical care, you can potentially prevent your HIV from developing into AIDS, and lead a relatively healthy life.

, Make a list of any concerns, questions, symptoms and other medical conditions you have. This will help your doctor guide the conversation during your appointment. Certain medications are not compatible and the doctor may need to look over your medication regimen and your symptoms to ensure that your are maximizing the benefits of your medications. Also use the time before an appointment to write down any questions or concerns. Having an expert discuss these thoughts with you will decrease your stress levels, help you find valuable sources of information and set expectations for future problems that may arise.


Be informed about your specific diagnosis. Do research. No question is unimportant. HIV is a life-changing disease and the more information you have, the better you will be able to cope with your condition.

, Like many other diseases, there is a trial and error process with finding the right medications. Be sure to be open with your doctor about any side effects you may be experiencing as these may be a sign of a more serious problem. Don't get discouraged during this adjustment process. Some of the side effects may be unpleasant, but modern medicine has greatly increased the overall health, well-being, and lifespan of HIV patients.

, Because HIV affects your immune system, this will exacerbate any other infections or diseases you may acquire. Be sure to take precautions during flu season or if you feel like you might be exposed to a virus.

, AIDS can be a deadly disease. Many people need help coping with the stress and uncertainty of their situation. Things like community support groups, open dialogue with family and friends, and counselors can all help you deal with the ups and downs of being diagnosed.

, If you are keeping your HIV+ status a secret, as many people choose to, then it becomes your responsibility to try to limit the exposure of the uninfected people around you. Always let future sexual partners know you are HIV+ and inform them about prevention practices before you have any type of sex. Allow them to make their own informed decision about how best to proceed.

, Take all of your medications on time and do not skip any doses. By doing this, you ensure that your ""viral load"" in your body fluids is low. This will keep your body healthier and prevent the chance of infecting those around you.

, If you're pregnant, talk to your doctor about options. While there is no vaccine or cure for this disease, there are medications that can be taken to reduce the chance of a mother passing the virus to a baby throughout the pregnancy, during labor and though breast-feeding. While this is not 100% effective, it does significantly reduce the risk.

Visit the doctor.,
Take medication to help with ED.,
Receive testosterone replacement.,
Try implants or pumps.",How to Cope With Erectile Dysfunction2," There are several medical reasons you could be having ED: high or low blood pressure, poor circulation, high cholesterol, medications you're on, recreational drug use, and a long list of others.To narrow down the list, you'll have to visit your doctor. He can perform a full workup and determine what's causing your problem.

, There are a number of drugs designed to treat and improve ED. When your doctor examines you, she may determine that these drugs are your best option. Some of the most common drugs include:Sildenafil (Viagra)
Tadalafil (Cialis)
Vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn)
Avanafil (Stendra)

, For some men, low testosterone is the cause of their ED. Lack of this hormone can make it difficult to get and stay aroused. Your doctor can confirm if you suffer from low testosterone with a blood test. If this test confirms that you have low testosterone, then you can begin hormone therapy to fix the problem., If you can't find any other solution to your ED, the doctor may recommend a pump or penile implant. These devices will allow you to inflate the penis and maintain an erection to have sex. They are usually only recommended when all other options have been tried."
"
Avoid dwelling on the problem.,
Take sex more slowly.,
Reduce your stress level.,
Consider that you may be depressed.,
Limit your consumption of pornography.,
Consult a therapist.",How to Cope With Erectile Dysfunction3," For many men, ED will only occur once or twice and isn't an indication of anything more serious. Once it happens, however, men often have anxiety about it and think about it when having sex. This anxiety can actually cause ED, so dwelling on the problem will only make it worse.If ED happens once, do your best to brush it off as a one-time occurrence. Attribute it to being tired or stressed.
Stay focused on the moment at hand. When you and your partner are getting intimate, don't think about the past. This will cause you to think about your past ED. Instead, just be mindful of the present moment and focus on the pleasant sensations you and your partner are sharing.

, Rushing through intimacy can cause you to feel like you only have a set amount of time to satisfy your partner. This can cause anxiety that might make it difficult to maintain an erection. Instead, focus more on foreplay and exploring with your partner. That way, you'll allow your body and mind to relax. As a result, your sexual performance will benefit., A high level of stress can cause ED and make it worse. Stress can do several things that will hurt your sex life: it can lower your sex drive, make it difficult to get an erection, make you tire quickly, and generally not put you in a good mood. Reduce your stress level for an improvement in your sex life and overall health.Read Reduce Stress for some great tips on reducing your stress levels.

, Depression is another major psychological cause of ED. It often leads to feelings of inadequacy, insecurity, and other emotions that kill sex drive. Think about the symptoms of depression and if you exhibit them, seek psychological help to overcome the problem.Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness. These don't need to focus on any particular situation. You may just feel like you're stuck in a rut and will never be able to get out of it.
Sleep changes. Both insomnia and oversleeping can indicate depression, so pay attention if you've been having any sudden sleep disturbances.
Lack of energy or fatigue.
Trouble concentrating and completing tasks.
Loss of interest in daily activities, especially ones you used to enjoy.
Unexplained aches and pains all over your body. These can include muscle aches, headaches, and upset stomach.

, Watching pornography can gradually desensitize you to real-life sex. The result can be a lack of arousal with your partner. To avoid this outcome, it's best to cut off or limit your consumption of pornography. That way, you'll gradually get re-sensitized to real-life sex acts.If you can't stop using pornography entirely, stick to viewing materials that closely represent what you do with your partner. That way, you can prevent getting desensitized by viewing things that would never happen in your life.

, Besides what has already been mentioned, there are a number of psychological issues that could be causing your ED. If you can't get to the bottom of the issue, then seeing a mental health professional would be beneficial. He can help talk through your issues and narrow down what might be going on.Having your partner come to these sessions would also be beneficial, as you two can work through the problem together as a couple.

"
"
Keep your partner informed about what's going on.,
Ask for your partner's help and support.,
Reassure your partner that the problem isn't him or her.,
Talk with your partner about your sex life.,
Consider going to counseling with your partner.",How to Cope With Erectile Dysfunction4," While you may be embarrassed about your ED, shutting your partner out is not the answer. The problem involves both of you, and your partner will end up feeling distant and neglected if you don't keep her or him involved in your life. Make every effort to talk with your partner about what's going on. The outlook is generally much better for men who involve their partner in the healing process. , Erectile dysfunction is like any other problem in a relationship, and requires both partners to fully fix. You may have to attend doctor's appointments and therapy sessions to treat your ED, and it would be great to have your partner there for you. , Men and women with a partner struggling with ED often blame themselves for not satisfying their partner. Most often, however, it is a physical or mental issue with the man, not his partner. You need to make this clear to your partner, otherwise he or she may internalize the problem and feel like the cause.Reassure your partner that you're committed to the relationship, and this isn't a sign that you aren't interested.
Stress that you're not having an affair or are interested in someone else. Some partners see ED as a sign of an affair, but this is not true an overwhelming majority of the time. Prevent suspicion and negative feelings in your partner by assuring him or her of this.Of course, don't lie to your partner. If there is a problem with the relationship, you need to communicate this. Tell your partner if he or she does something sexually that you don't like, or if you have sexual needs that aren't being met.

, Dissatisfaction with your sex life could be a contributing factor to your ED. Have an honest conversation with your partner about your needs. Keeping your needs to yourself could make the problem worse.Keep this conversation friendly and blame-free. This is a sensitive topic, and your partner may feel like he or she failed you by not meeting a sexual need. Assure your partner that you're committed to the relationship, and that this is a way to strengthen the relationship.

, Erectile dysfunction can put a strain on any relationship, even if you've properly communicated with your partner. If you and your partner are having trouble getting through this, try going to therapy together. A counselor can help you work through your problems and remain strong as a couple."

Get tested regularly.",How to Avoid Getting HIV," Someone infected with HIV cannot spread it by sneezing or shaking hands, like an ordinary cold. For an uninfected person to get HIV, he needs to come into contact with one of the following:Blood
Semen and pre-seminal fluid (cum and pre-cum)
Rectal fluids (fluids found in the anus)
Vaginal fluids
Breast milk;
, The safest way to avoid HIV is to avoid all contact with the above fluids. However, the following areas of your body are much more likely to pick up an infection if exposed to infected fluids:Rectum
Vagina
Penis
Mouth
Cuts and wounds, especially if bleeding

, Many people are infected with HIV without realizing that they have the virus. An HIV test at a medical clinic is the only way to know for sure that someone does not have the virus.A ""negative"" result means you do not have the virus, while a ""positive"" result means you are infected with HIV.


Many areas have HIV/AIDS clinics that provide free tests.
You can usually get a result within the hour, but this is not 100% reliable. For accurate results, ask for the test to be sent to a lab, or get tested a second time by a different staff member.Even if you test HIV-negative, you may still have a recent infection. Practice precautions as though you had HIV for 6 months, then return for a second test., The following activities have no significant risk of contracting HIV:


Hugging, shaking hands, or touching an HIV-positive person.
Sharing a bathroom or toilet with an HIV-positive person.
Kissing an HIV-positive person — unless he or she has cuts or sores in the mouth. Unless there is visible blood, the risk is extremely small.Someone who does not have HIV can never ""create"" it and transmit it through sex or other means. However, it is not possible to know that someone is HIV-negative with 100% certainty.

, The fewer people you have sex with, the lower the chance that one of them has HIV. The lowest risk comes in a ""closed"" relationship where the people involved only have sex with each other. Even then, get tested and follow safe sex practices. There is always the chance that someone is unfaithful.

, These activities carry almost no risk of transmitting HIV, even if one person involved has the virus:Erotic massage
Masturbation or hand jobs (hand-to-penis), without sharing bodily fluids
Using sex toys on your partner, without sharing them. For added safety, put a new condom on the toy for each use, and wash thoroughly afterward.
Finger-vagina or finger-anus contact. There is a chance of transmission if the finger has a cut or scrape. Increase safety with medical gloves and water-based lubricant.

, There is significant risk of infection if you perform oral sex on an HIV-positive person's penis. It is rare, but not impossible, to get HIV from someone using their mouth on your penis or vagina, or from performing oral sex on a vagina.Take these precautions to minimize this risk, and avoid other diseases:


If a penis is involved, put a condom over it. Latex condoms are the most effective, followed by polyurethane. Do not use sheepskin condoms.Use flavored condoms if you need to improve the taste.
If a vagina or anus is involved, hold a dental dam over it. If you don't have one, cut open a non-lubricated condom or use a natural rubber latex sheet.
Don't allow someone to ejaculate into your mouth.
Consider avoiding oral sex during menstruation.
Avoid flossing or tooth-brushing before or after oral sex, as this may cause bleeding., Inserting a penis into a vagina causes a high risk of HIV transmission for both people involved, especially for the woman. Reduce this risk by using a condom or a latex female condom — but not both. Always use water-based lubricant to reduce the risk of the condom breaking.The outer ring of the female condom must remain around the penis and outside the vagina at all times.Other forms of contraception do not protect against HIV. Pulling out before ejaculation does not protect against HIV.
It is possible but not certain that people who have undergone male-to-female reassignment surgery can contract HIV more easily., Rectal tissue is highly sensitive to tearing and damage during intercourse. This makes the risk of transmission high for the person inserting a penis, and extremely high for the person receiving the penis.Consider other forms of sexual activity as described above. If you do perform anal sex, use latex condoms and plenty of water-based lubricant.


Female condoms are probably effective during anal sex, but this has not been thoroughly studied. Some organizations recommend removing the inner ring, while others do not., Review how to put on and take off a condom or female condom. Importantly, remember to pinch the tip before putting on a male condom, and grip the base closed when you remove it. Before you have sex, make sure the condom was treated properly:Never use oil-based lubricant with latex or polyisoprene condoms, which can break the condom.
Use the condom before its expiration date.
Store the condom at room temperature, and not in your wallet or other place where it may get damaged.
Use a condom that fits snugly, but easily.
Do not stretch the condom to examine it for tears.

, No matter which type of sex you engage in, some practices make the risk of transmission higher. Be aware of these factors:Rough sex increases the odds of the condom tearing.
Avoid spermicides that contain N-9 (nonoxynol-9). This can irritate the vagina and increase the chance of the condom tearing.
Do not douche the vagina or rectum before sex. This can irritate the area or remove bacteria that help fight infection. If you need to clean the area, clean gently with a soapy finger and water instead.

, Substances that affect your mental state increase the odds of making a bad decision, such as having unprotected sex. Have sex only when sober, or make plans in advance to protect yourself.

, Avoid receiving body piercings or tattoos performed by anyone but licensed professionals in a well-maintained professional environment. All needles use should be brand new, and you should watch the artist open the sealed package at the start of your appointment. The use of contaminated instruments is relatively likely to result in the transmission of HIV.

, Before injecting any substance, make sure the needle you are using has been stored in a clean container, and has never been used by anyone else. Never share cotton balls, containers of water, or any other drug-related equipment with another injecting drug user. Sterile needles are available at pharmacies, or at free needle exchange programs in some areas.


In most places, you do not have to explain why you are buying or exchanging the needle.

, There is no way to completely disinfect a needle by yourself. There will always be a chance that a used needle transmits HIV. Use this only if you are going to inject anyway, and do not expect it to protect yourself completely:Fill the syringe with clean tap or bottled water. Shake or tap the syringe to stir it. Wait 30 seconds, then eject and throw away all water.
Repeat several times, then additional times until no blood is visible.
Fill the syringe with full-strength household bleach. Shake or tap it, and wait 30 seconds. Squirt it out and throw it away.
Rinse the syringe with water.

, Addiction makes drug users more likely to take risks. The only certain way to eliminate the risk of HIV transmission from injected drugs is to stop injecting. Attend a drug addiction meeting in your area for help and more information.

, Whether you are a drug user or health worker, be very careful around used syringes. In a hospital, assume that all fluids are infectious. Assume that any sharp or broken equipment may be contaminated with infected fluids. Wear gloves, a face mask, and long sleeves. Pick up contaminated objects using tweezer or other tools, and dispose of them in a clear container or biohazard bag. Disinfect all skin, hands, and surfaces the object or infected blood came into contact with., This once-a-day pill can greatly reduce the risk of HIV infection, but only if used as prescribed. PrEP is recommended for people who do not have HIV, but are exposed to HIV-positive sexual partners or objects regularly.Visit a doctor every 3 months when taking PrEP, to check your HIV status and monitor for renal (kidney) problems.
There are no known effects of PrEP on a fetus, but there have not been many studies. Talk to your doctor if you are on PrEP and become pregnant.

, If you think you've been exposed to HIV, talk to a medical worker at an HIV clinic or hospital immediately. If you start taking PEP drugs as soon as possible, and no later than 72 hours after exposure, there is a chance that you will fight off the HIV infection.You must take the drug (or more typically two or three drugs) daily for 28 days, or as directed by the health worker.


Because this is not a guaranteed method of protection, you should still be tested for HIV after the drugs are done, and a second time 3 months later. Until you test negative, tell your sexual partners that you may have HIV.
If you are exposed frequently, take PrEP as a constant daily pill instead, as described above.

, HIV-positive people who take antiretroviral drugs can have significant success managing their infection levels. Some of these people consider this ongoing treatment an important tool to help prevent spreading the infection to their HIV-negative partners. Researchers and workers in the HIV prevention community are divided on how effective this message is. Some studies show that people who use ""treatment as prevention"" (TasP) are more likely to skip other forms of protection, such as condoms.While treatment can certainly reduce the risk of transmitting the infection, it is not a guarantee. Each person involved should receive regular testing to measure the risk involved.

, Someone infected with HIV should receive regular testing to determine the ""viral load,"" or concentration of HIV in the bodily fluids. With constant treatment, HIV positive people can have ""undetectable viral loads."" It's important to understand that someone with an undetectable viral load still has HIV, and may still be able to transmit HIV to a sexual partner. While some studies show very promising results about low (or potentially nonexistent) transmission rates, more studies are needed for accurate risk assessment.Some people with undetectable viral loads in their blood may have much greater viral loads in their semen or other bodily fluids., All of the suggestions listed here are risk mitigation techniques. There is no such thing as completely safe sex or safe drug use. Things can go wrong. Accidents happen. If you engage in any behavior that may cause infection, including safer sex with someone you know to be HIV positive, get tested for HIV. Get tested every three months as long as you continue the behavior, plus additional tests three months and six months after it ends.

, Cities issue smog warnings when ozone gas collects in a city. If a smog alert is issued for your area, remain inside.These alerts can be found via weather apps, local news stations, or other news sources.

, Air pollution is worse in the afternoon. Heat decreases the quality of the air. To limit your exposure to air pollution, only go outside in the morning or after the sun goes down.Refrain from doing any physical activity, such as exercise, during the afternoon. Either avoid going outside all together, or plan your activities for alternate times.

, Getting outdoors is a great thing. Walking outdoors is a wonderful exercise for pregnant women. When you engage in outdoor activities like walking, make sure to walk in green spaces. Green spaces provide better quality air since trees help to purify it.Green spaces include parks, nature trails, or even cemeteries.
Avoid walking in heavily trafficked areas, such as city centers and along busy highways.

, Just because you are in a car doesn’t mean you are safe from air pollution. You can still end up breathing it in. When you drive, try to take back roads with less traffic if possible.Avoid driving too close to other vehicles, especially large trucks or buses that expel a lot of exhaust.
When you start your car, make sure not to do it in a closed garage. That can expose you to toxic fumes."

This symptom shouldn't cause great alarm if it's the only one you're feeling, but it's something to look into further.Acute fatigue isn't the same as simply feeling sleepy. Do you feel tired all the time, even after a good night's sleep? Do you find yourself taking more afternoon naps than usual, and avoiding strenuous activities because you feel low energy? This type of fatigue is cause for concern.
If this symptom persists over a few weeks or months' time, be sure to get tested to rule out HIV.;
, These symptoms commonly occur during the early stages of an HIV infection, during what is called the primary or acute HIV infection stage. Again, many people don't have these symptoms, but those who do usually experience them two to four weeks after contracting HIV.Fever and night sweats are also symptoms of the flu and the common cold. If it's flu or cold season, that might be what you're experiencing.
Chills, muscle aches, sore throat, and headache, which are also symptoms of the flu and cold, can also be signs of an early HIV infection.

, The lymph nodes swell in reaction to bodily infections. This doesn't happen to everyone who has primary HIV, but among those who have symptoms, it's a common one.The lymph nodes in the nick tend to swell more than those in the armpits or groin with an HIV infection.
Lymph nodes can swell as a result of many other types of infections, such as a cold or the flu, so further investigation is necessary to determine the cause.

, These symptoms, which are commonly associated with the flu, can also indicate an early HIV infection. Get tested if these symptoms persist., If you see a mouth ulcer appear along with the other symptoms noted, especially if you don't commonly get mouth ulcers, it may be a sign of primary HIV infection. Genital ulcers are also an indication that HIV may be present.

Continue to live your life.",How to Care for Someone With AIDS at Home," You are one caregiver who is part of a larger team that is working to keep the person healthy and happy. It’s important to talk to any medical professionals or other individuals who are also providing care for the person with AIDS. Doctors, nurses, social workers, case managers, can give you important information about the person’s health and care. They can also give you tips on how best to provide care for the person. Coordinating your care with other types of treatment the person is receiving can boost his or her health and wellbeing.Get the person’s permission to contact his or her healthcare team. You may need the permission in writing, but assure the person you are doing this in his or her best interests.
Ask any questions you have about caring for the person. This may be things such as knowing when and how much medication to give, when you should wear protective gloves, and ways to boost his or her health.
Keep the care team informed as you work with the person. You may notice things that he or she doesn’t and it could be vital information to a doctor in the person's overall care.;
, Most people with AIDS take medication to manage the disease. These can help prolong life and fight conditions associated with AIDS. Make sure the person is taking medications and has prescription refills on time. You should also watch for side effects any medication is having. This can help the person maintain his or her health for the long term.Read the dosing instructions for every medication the person is taking. Check to see if he or she has taken the medication for the day. You can also keep a notebook of medications and the times he or she takes it to ensure that the proper dose is taken.Talk to the person about any side effects he or she may be having. If it is acceptable to the person, contact his or her doctor to discuss the side effects and ways to relieve them, including taking a different medication.

, If you are giving or watching the person’s medication, it’s a good idea to learn about the person’s treatment. This can help ensure you are giving the person proper care and watch out for potential problems with medications or other treatments. Some of the most common medications and treatments for AIDS are:#*Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI), which interrupt the virus from duplicating. NRTI drugs include: Abacavir (Ziagen, ABC), Didanosine (Videx, dideoxyinosine, ddI), Emtricitabine (Emtriva, FTC), Lamivudine (Epivir, 3TC), Stavudine (Zerit, d4T), Tenofovir (Viread, TDF), Zalcitabine (Hivid, ddC), Zidovudine (Retrovir, ZDV or AZT).


Protease Inhibitors (PI), which also interrupt virus replication, but at a later step in the virus life cycle. Some PI’s the person may take are: Amprenavir (Agenerase, APV), Atazanavir (Reyataz, ATV), Fosamprenavir (Lexiva, FOS), Indinavir (Crixivan, IDV), Lopinavir (Kaletra, LPV/r), Ritonavir (Norvir, RIT), Saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase, SQV).
Fusion inhibitors, a new class of drugs that prevent HIV from fusing with the inside of a cell, which keeps it from replicating. This type of drugs includes Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon or T-20).
Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), which also known as the anti-HIV ""cocktail."" It is a combination of three or more drugs such as protease inhibitors and other anti-retroviral medications. HAART decreases the rate at which HIV replicates itself and can slow the spread of the virus in the body.
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are drugs that block the HIV from infecting new cells by. NNRTIs such as Delvaridine (Rescriptor, DLV), Efravirenz (Sustiva, EFV), and Nevirapine (Viramune, NVP) are prescribed in combination with other retroviral drugs.

, Someone with AIDS is vulnerable to other diseases and conditions because of his or her weakened immune system. The person with AIDS, you, and anyone else who has close contact should get regular immunizations to minimize the risk transmitting diseases like measles, polio, or tuberculosis to the individual for whom you are caring.Ask the doctor about the best immunizations for the person with AIDS. The medical professional may suggest immunizations for pneumonia and the flu.He or she may also give the person with AIDS the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Be sure that you, family members, or anyone else who is in close contact to the person with AIDS have proper immunizations as well. This includes MMR, flu, and polio. It’s important that the polio vaccine be “inactivated virus” because the live culture has weakened polio virus that can give a person with AIDS polio. You and other close contacts should also be checked for tuberculosis (TB) every year.

, Because AIDS causes a weakened immune system, illnesses you might consider otherwise harmless can be deadly to the person with the disease. If you or anyone who has contact with the person is sick, stay away until healthy. This minimizes the risk of transmitting potentially harmful illnesses to the person.Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth if no one else can care for the person. You should also wash your hands with soap and water before you touch the individual.
Be aware that chickenpox and shingles can kill someone with AIDS. Never let a person with chickenpox or shingles in the same room as a person with AIDS until at least the sores have crusted over. Anyone who has been near someone with chickenpox or shingles also shouldn’t be in the same room. In this case, the person can visit again after 3 weeks.

, To protect yourself as well as the person with HIV / AIDS, cover any sores and cuts you have with bandages. If you have a rash or sores on your hands, wear disposable gloves when providing care. If you have cold sores, fever blisters or any other kind of skin infection, then avoid touching the person or their things.You should also, if at all possible, stay away from the person with HIV / AIDS if you have impetigo, boils, or shingles.

, Healthy foods can keep a person with AIDS strong, give him or her more energy, and support the immune system. Making sure the person has plenty of healthy choices stocked in the kitchen can maintain or even boost overall health.Consider cooking together for a fun and lighthearted activity. A person with AIDS can safely cook for others unless he or she has diarrhea.Involve the person in planning his or her meals. This will give you a sense or what he or she likes and can help you pick foods at the supermarket.Incorporate plenty of fruits and vegetables for fiber and vitamins, starchy carbs for energy, protein, and some dairy products. You should also include small amounts of fats and sugars. Some excellent examples of foods for a person with AIDS are: raspberries, blueberries, spinach, bread, potatoes, lean meat, eggs, yogurt, and cheese., A person with AIDS can eat almost any food he or she wants. But there are some foods that may cause foodborne illnesses that he or she should avoid. These foods include:Raw or unpasteurized milk
Raw eggs and foods with raw eggs such as hollandaise sauce
Uncooked or lightly cooked meats
Raw fish or shellfish

, Just as proper nutrition is important to a person with AIDS, so is getting activity or exercise. This can build muscles, keep the bones strong, and keep his or heart healthy. If the person is able, suggest doing an activity together or go to a gym or outside for some exercise.Exercise may help the person feel better and relieve the side effects of AIDS and medications.Keep in mind that everyday activities like dancing, walk to the park, playing with kids, and gardening are activities that can get the person moving.Aim for the person to get 45 minutes to an hour of activity 3-4 times a week. If the person isn’t able, help him or her do whatever is possible. This might be walking in the yard for a few minutes twice a day.Consider different types of exercise such as cardio, resistance training, or flexibility training. Things like running, swimming, lifting light weights, or doing yoga can promote overall physical and mental health., Rest is something else that is also important to a person with AIDS. It helps the body recover and relax from stress, which can be harmful to the immune system. Make sure the person is getting plenty of rest during the day if he or she is tired. Allow the person to sleep for eight hours every night., A person with AIDS may be down or stressed about things such as the rest of his or her life, fulfilling goals, and maintaining contact with others. These types of concerns can harm the person’s immune system. Making sure you are there to provide emotional support to the person can help him or her relax and feel confident to live an active life.Talk to the person often and make yourself available to discuss anything he or she wants. You don’t have to push, but can say something like, “I care about you very much, Alex, and I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything you want anytime.”

, In addition to your emotional support, the person for whom you’re caring may require emotional support from a medical professional or social worker. These people may have special training to support AIDS patients, including individuals who may be suffering from depression. This may help the person deal with fears or stresses related to the disease.Talk about counseling if you feel the person has a problem that is better solved by a professional. Broach the subject gently. You could say, “You know Sam, I am always here to support you and talk about your feelings. But there are some things that I don’t know a lot about and I wonder if maybe seeing a counselor who helps other AIDS patients could supplement my support.”
Make sure to let the person’s care team know about your concerns. Ask for possible references to counselors who may help. You can also locate a counselor or psychiatrist near you at services such as http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/hiv-aids.html and http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/issues/hiv-aids.

, Surround the person with people that he or she loves. You can also be sure to invite and include the person in group activities or outings. Knowing that he or she is a part of a caring community can help relax and de-stress the person.Find things the person likes to do and help him or her do them as much as possible. This could be something like bringing books and magazines, going for a relaxing walk together to enjoy nature. Ask if the person would like to take a warm bath or get a massage.
Ask the person if he or she would be interested in having a therapy dog stop by once a week or more. It may help relax or soothe the person. Just be sure that the dog is clean and the person is healthy enough to touch pets., Smoking, drugs and alcohol are harmful to the body, especially the liver and lungs. These can increase vulnerability to infection as well as rob the body of previous vitamins. If the person uses tobacco, drugs, or alcohol, suggest that he or she quit to help maintain health and wellbeing., You also need to know whom and when to call for help or information if you are caring for someone with AIDS. Make a list of doctors, nurses, and other people you might need to contact in case of emergency. Write down phone numbers and information such as when they are available. Keep the list by the phone for easy access.

, Companion animals can provide comfort and joy to a person with AIDS. But animals can also carry parasites that cause infections. Cleaning up after animals for the person can minimize the risk that he or she is infected with a parasite.Clean up any animal feces for the person, including the kitty litter box. Empty, don’t sift, the cat litter every day.Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, while reptiles can carry salmonella and birds may have the fungus cryptococcus or histoplasmosis.
Make sure that you and the person with AIDS wash your hands thoroughly after handling pets or cleaning up after animals., Just as coming in contact with animals and their feces can be harmful for a person with AIDS, so can being in the garden. A garden or potting soil often has germs. You and the person should wear work gloves when handling dirt. Washing your hands before and after handling dirt—even with gloves-- is also advisable., Germs can be dangerous for a person with AIDS. Having regular cleaning sessions can help maintain the person’s health and keep infections at bay.Clean and dust the entire home at least once every week and more often if necessary. Sanitize toilets, tubs, showers, and sinks more frequently and as needed.
Use either commercial cleaners or a bleach mixture of ¼ cup bleach to 1 gallon of water (or 1 tablespoon to 1 quart water for smaller jobs). Rinse surfaces with fresh water after disinfecting them.

, You can use many of the same items a person with AIDS does including utensils and bedding. The key is to wash them regularly or as needed. This can prevent the spread of diseases to the person with AIDS and also minimize your risk of coming into contact with HIV.Recognize that a person with AIDS doesn’t need separate utensils such as dishes, knives, forks, or spoons. His or her dishes also don’t need special cleaning. Washing this dishes in hot water with soap or dishwasher detergent is plenty to keep everyone safe and healthy.
Wash bedding or clothing in hot water at least once a week. If anything is soiled with blood, vomit, semen, vaginal fluids, urine or feces, remove them with disposable gloves. Wash immediately or as soon as you can. If you have to wait to wash the items, put them in plastic bags.

, A person with AIDS should have his or her own razors, toothbrushes, tweezers, nail or cuticle clippers, and pierced jewelry. Anything that may have the person’s blood on it shouldn’t be shared because it can transmit HIV. You can also transmit infections to someone with AIDS by sharing these types of personal items., Many people are scared of contracting HIV through something as simple as a hug. HIV and AIDS are transmitted by blood. Knowing the ways you cannot get AIDS can help you more confidently and sympathetically provide care to a person who has the disease at home. A well-timed hug can go a long way to helping the person feel better.HIV/ AIDS is not spread:


By food or water
By sharing food, dishes, or cooking utensils including cups, plates, forks and knives
By touching another person, hugging, shaking hands, or holding people

, Get a grasp on the basics of the disease as well as any new research or information about care. Learning about AIDS can help you provide better care for the person who has the disease.Consult the websites and/ or publications from government and international organizations, AIDS support groups, and research centers. You can even sign up to receive newsletters from many of these places, which may help you stay informed on the latest and best care for the person with AIDS.

, In some cases, such as medical care or life support decisions, you may need to be legally named as the care coordinator. This may also be important if you are going to file insurance claims, apply for government aid, pay bills, or handle other business for the person with AIDS. Meet with a lawyer or an AIDS support organization to see what options are available to you and the person for whom you are caring.Let the person for whom you are caring know about any concerns about providing sufficient care without legal acknowledgement. The person can decide how much or how little to involve you in important decisions. Tell him or her you will respect any wishes he or she has.
Contact local lawyers or health advocates about what options are open to both of you. Attend any meetings with the person, or, if he or she can’t go, give them a selection of options from which to choose.
Find AIDS support organizations in your local area using online search tools.Consult organizations, such as your local health and human services department. This can help the person with AIDS get whatever benefits to which he or she is entitled.

, If you are able and new to providing care, consider taking a course on home care for someone with AIDS. The class can help you learn the skills you need to provide care as well as how to effectively handle special situations.Inquire with your local public health department, Red Cross/ Red Crescent chapter, a visiting nurses association, or an HIV/AIDS service organization about home care courses.
Ask any questions you have about how to best care for the person during your course. You can never know too much or be prepared enough.

, Providing care for a person with AIDS can be physically and emotionally draining. You can't take care of someone else effectively if you are sick or upset. Taking good care of yourself through things like rest and exercise can help you keep going and give the best care possible to the person with AIDS.Watch your own health. Eat a balanced diet, exercise as often as you can, and give yourself sufficient time to rest, which can help you relax.
Consider joining a support group or talking to a counselor. Either of these can help you deal with your feelings about your role as caregiver. A support group or counselor can help bolster you and give you an outlet to tackle any hurdles you may encounter.

, Allow yourself to do things you enjoy, such as visiting friends or going out for a meal. Remember that you are not selfish for taking some time to yourself. Don’t avoid anything you want to do because you feel badly for the person or guilty for leaving. In the long run, living your own life may help both you and the person for whom you are caring.


Ask a family member or friend to care for the person if you need a break. Many AIDS service organizations can help with ""respite care"" and send someone to be with the person while you get out of the house for a while.

Take hormonal birth control pills.If you are a woman seeking to prevent pregnancy without using a condom, one of the most common options is to take hormonal birth control pills.,
Have an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted.An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that is inserted through your vagina into your uterus (where it sits for the next number of years and functions as birth control).,
Try other hormonal birth control options.Other hormonal options include a vaginal ring, Depo-Provera injections, and contraceptive patches.,
Opt for a spermicide.,
Use a barrier method such as a cervical cap or a diaphragm.,
Opt for sterilization.One of the surest ways to prevent pregnancy is for either the man or the woman (or both) to be sterilized.",How to Prevent Pregnancy Without a Condom1," These are available from your family doctor; the pills are composed of either a blend of estrogen and progesterone, or just progesterone. You normally take one per day for 21 days followed by seven days of ""sugar pills"" (during which your body experiences a ""withdrawal bleed"" in place of a period).


There are a variety of different birth control formulations, and you can speak to your family doctor about the different options to determine which one is best for you.
The advantage of taking birth control pills is that they are 91% effective in preventing pregnancy (and even more effective when used at exactly the same time every day without missing any doses).
If you are a man having sex with a woman and not wanting to get her pregnant, you can ask her if she is regularly taking birth control pills. The downside of this method of contraception for men, however, is that you are relying on taking the woman's word for it, and also trusting that she has been taking them daily and not accidentally missing doses.;
, They are over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.


IUDs available include: the Mirena, Skyla, and Lilletta IUDs, and the Copper IUD.
The Mirena IUD is hormone-based. It is more expensive and lasts up to five years; however, the benefit is that it decreases menstrual cramps and bleeding. Skyla, and Lilletta IUDs are also hormone based and these last up to three years.
The Copper IUD is not hormone-based. The pros are that it is cheaper and lasts up to 10 years; however, the downside is that your menstrual cramps and monthly bleeding may be increased.
You may receive a prescription for an IUD from your family doctor. Your doctor can then set up an appointment to have it inserted, which usually only takes a couple of minutes.
Having the IUD inserted may be painful for a brief moment as it passes through the narrow opening of your cervix; however, after it has been inserted, you should no longer feel any pain.

, They are available via a prescription from your family doctor.


A vaginal ring (called the NuvaRing) is something you place in your vagina and leave there for three weeks at a time (and then remove it for one week for a withdrawal bleed).It suppresses ovulation by releasing hormones (a mixture of estrogen and progesterone) during the time that it is in your vagina. It is rare for the ring to cause any problems with sexual intercourse, and it is normally not felt by either the user or the user's partner. The failure rate is 9% with typical use, and 0.3% with perfect use. The ring can be removed for up to three hours, so if you are more comfortable having sex without it, then this is an option.
Depo-Provera injections are administered by your family doctor once every three months, so the advantage is that, as long as you go every three months, you do not need to remember to take birth control pills (or to use another method) on a regular basis.The failure rate is less than 1% for those who follow through with injections every three months.Contraceptive patches are about 5cm x 5cm in size, and are placed on your skin. Each patch lasts for one week, and then must be replaced - therefore, you need to use three in a row, followed by one week off to allow for a withdrawal bleed. The patches contain the same hormones as the birth control pill, and, when used correctly (and replaced diligently every week), the failure rate is less than 1%.Ask about the implantable birth control called Implanon. This birth control method is inserted into your arm and it will last for up to four years., Spermicides are gels or foams that are inserted into the vagina, which trap and subsequently kill sperm through the use of chemicals that are toxic to sperm. They can be purchased at your local drugstore or pharmacy.The failure rate for spermicides is around 22%.

, Both a cervical cap and a diaphragm are devices that a woman inserts into her vagina to cover the cervix. This blocks sperm from entering the uterus. The cervical cap or diaphragm also normally contains chemicals that kill sperm, further reducing the risk of becoming pregnant.The failure rate is about 14% in women who have never been pregnant, and 29% in women who have previously been pregnant.


You can get fitted for a cervical cap or diaphragm at your doctor’s office.

, However, it is key to know that this is a permanent procedure. It should not be undertaken unless you are absolutely sure that you do not want biological children of your own in the future.


For a man, the procedure is called a ""vasectomy."" In this procedure, his ""vas deferens,"" the tube that carries sperm, is cut. This prevents the man's ability to contribute to a pregnancy.
For a woman, the procedure is called ""tubal ligation."" The woman's fallopian tubes (which carry unfertilized eggs from the ovaries to the uterus) are severed. This prevents eggs from being fertilized and thus prevents pregnancy.

Keep windows closed during unsafe times.,
Avoid freshly painted rooms.,
Use cleaning products sparingly.,
Stay away from cigarette smoke.,
Avoid heating with gas.,
Take caution when burning wood.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Avoid Air Pollution During Pregnancy2," Opening windows to get fresh air into your home is a great idea, but make sure to only do this during times when air quality is safe. If there are air quality alerts, make sure to avoid opening doors and windows at all, or only open them during the morning or night.Refrain from opening your windows if you live on a busy road or in a city.

, When you are pregnant, make sure to limit any exposure to freshly painted rooms. If you are painting a new nursery, spend as little time in there as you need to.Keep the windows and doors open in freshly painted rooms. You can also put fans in the windows to help circulate the air. Do this for two days after you paint to clear the air in the room.
Wear a mask when you are working in a freshly painted room.
Only use paint labeled “for interior use only.” Don’t use outdoor paint in indoor rooms.

, Cleaning products also have harmful fumes. When you are cleaning your home or office, make sure to keep all windows and doors open. Never clean in poorly ventilated rooms.Wear protective gear, such as masks and gloves, when cleaning with harsh chemicals.
Never mix chemicals, because that could produce toxic fumes. Never mix ammonia and bleach, acids and bleach, or use two drain cleaners together or in quick succession.Try using non-chemical cleaners, such as baking soda or vinegar. You can also find all natural cleaning products in the store, or search online to find recipes for all natural cleaning solutions.

, Cigarette smoke is a common air pollutant. When you are pregnant, make sure to stay away from smoke as much as possible.Avoid going to restaurants or venues that allow smoking. Steer clear of smoking patios or smoking sections in public places.
If you have friends or family members who smoke, ask them to refrain from smoking around you. Avoid going to their houses while pregnant, even if it seems rude. Being in a house full of second- and thirdhand smoke can be dangerous, even if they are not smoking while you are there. Instead, invite them to your house or meet them in a non-smoking public place.

, During the winter, refrain from using gas appliances, such as gas ovens or burners, to heat your house. This can release unhealthy gases into your home that can harm your family and your baby.You should also avoid using gas-powered items, such as mowers, generators, or snow blowers, in small spaces.

, You can expose yourself to harmful pollution through wood smoke. If you are burning wood, make sure it is clean. If you have a wood-burning stove, make sure you have upgraded to an EPA-certified stove.Make sure to perform annual maintenance on your stove. Also check your fireplace.
Consider alternate forms of heating instead of wood-burning heat.
Don’t burn trash or plastics.

, If you are concerned about air pollution and pregnancy, or you live in a high-risk area, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can help provide tips and suggestions to help you avoid air pollution.They can also answer any of your questions concerning the effects of air pollution on your baby.

Install carbon monoxide detectors.,
Check your appliances.,
Consider air cleaning devices.",How to Avoid Air Pollution During Pregnancy3," You should install carbon monoxide detectors in your home. This is not just for when you are pregnant, since carbon monoxide is harmful to everyone. A carbon monoxide detector can help alert you if the carbon monoxide in your home reach unsafe levels.Make sure the carbon monoxide detectors are approved by the Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL).You can buy carbon monoxide detectors at most major retailers or home improvement stores. You can also order them online.

, Make sure that your appliances are working properly and not emitting any kind of air pollution. This can help limit any unnecessary gases in your home.Check furnaces, wood-burning stoves, fireplaces, or gas heaters and stoves. These appliances may be emitting carbon monoxide into your home.
You can have all your appliances checked by trained professionals. This will help eliminate any doubt to the safety of your home. Contact your gas or electric company for a consultation., Air cleaning devices can help purify the air in your home. This helps reduce the air pollution you breathe every day.Start by changing the air filter in your home’s air conditioning or heating system. Check the air filter every month to see how much dust and debris has built up.
Buy an air cleaner. There are multiple kinds of air cleaners you can buy, such as HEPA filter mechanical air cleaners. These air cleaners can be placed in your home and help remove air pollution."

Don't dismiss a dry cough.,
Look into irregular spots (red, brown, pink, or purplish in color) on the skin.,
Pay attention if you get pneumonia.,
Check for yeast infections, especially in the mouth.,
Examine your nails for signs of fungus.,
Determine whether you're experiencing rapid weight loss with no known cause.,
Be aware of issues with memory loss, depression, or other neurological afflictions.",How to Recognize HIV Symptoms2," This symptom occurs in the later stages of HIV, sometimes many years after the virus has been contracted and been latent in the body. This seemingly innocuous symptom is easy to ignore at first, especially if it occurs during allergy season or during cough and cold season. If you have a dry cough you just can't seem to kick by taking allergy medications or using an inhaler, it may be a symptom of HIV.

, People in the later stages of HIV often get rashes on their skin, especially on the face and torso. These can also be present on the inside of the mouth and nose. It's a sign that the HIV is developing into AIDS.Flaky, red skin is also a sign of later stage HIV. The spots may also look like boils or bumps.
A skin rash usually doesn't accompany the flu or a cold, so if you have one at the same time as other symptoms, see a doctor right away.

, Pneumonia often affects people whose immune systems aren't working properly for other reasons. People with later-stage HIV are prone to getting pneumonia from a germ that wouldn't normally cause such a severe reaction.

, Later-stage HIV patients commonly get a yeast infection in the mouth, called thrush. The condition looks like white spots or other unusual spots on the tongue and inside of the mouth. This is a warning sign that the immune system isn't effectively fighting off infection.

, Nails that are yellow or brown, and that are cracked or chipped, are common among later-stage HIV patients. The nails become more susceptible to fungus, which the body is able to fight off under normal conditions.

, In the early stages of HIV, this could be caused by excessive diarrhea; in later stages, it's known as ""wasting,"" and is a strong bodily reaction to the presence of HIV in the system.

, HIV affects the cognitive function of the brain in later stages. These symptoms are serious and should be looked into no matter what.

Know if you are at risk.,
Don't wait for symptoms to occur to get tested.,
Get tested for HIV.",How to Recognize HIV Symptoms3," There are several different circumstances that can place you at risk of contracting HIV. If you've experienced one of the following situations, you are at risk:


You've had unprotected anal, vaginal, or oral sex.
You've shared needles or syringes.
You've been diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted disease (STD), tuberculosis, or hepatitis.
You received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985, the years before safety precautions were in place to prevent tainted blood from being used in transfusions.

, Many people HIV don't know they have it. The virus can be carried in your body for over ten years before symptoms begin to occur. If you have reason to think you may have contracted HIV, don't let a lack of symptoms stop you from getting tested. It's best to know as soon as possible.

, This is the most accurate measure in determining if you have HIV. Contact a local health clinic, the red cross, your doctor's office, or another local resource to find out where to get tested. Go to the website aids.gov for a listing of testing locations.


Testing is easy, affordable, and reliable (in the majority of cases). The most common test is done through drawing a blood sample. There are also tests that use oral fluids (not saliva) and urine. There are even tests you can take at home. If you do not have a regular physician who can provide testing, contact your local Health Department.
If you are tested for HIV, do not let fear prevent you from obtaining your test results. Knowing if you are infected, or not, brings about change in your lifestyle and your way of thinking.

Inform your doctor of any new or existing medical conditions.",How to Prevent Spotting on Birth Control," Spotting frequently occurs for the first three to four months after starting birth control pills for the first time. This is also the case if you have been on birth control pills in the past, took a break, and now have restarted this form of birth control, and in cases where you have changed the brand or type of birth control pills you are taking.The clinical use of the term “spotting” refers to episodes of slight bleeding that do not require the use of a pad or tampon.
The term “breakthrough bleeding” commonly indicates a level of bleeding that requires the use of a product.
However, these terms can be misleading since they are often used interchangeably, even in the medical literature.;
, Develop a schedule that works for you to help regulate your cycle. Consistently taking birth control pills at the same time each day reduces the incidence of spotting.Altering the time by a few hours is generally okay, but if you alter your dose by four hours or more, then you are altering how your body absorbs the birth control pills and naturally produces hormones.
This may lead to spotting. It may also decrease the effectiveness of the birth control pills, which can increase your short-term chances of getting pregnant.
Pick a time that is convenient and that is the most likely to time you will remember. Try taking them last thing before bed, in the morning when you brush your teeth, or at another time when you consistently perform other daily activities like taking your shower or going for your morning walk.
If you don’t like the time you picked and want to adjust, wait until you start the next new pack. Adjust your scheduled dose time with a fresh pack to be sure you do not compromise the way the pills work in your body. Adjusting your time mid-cycle can increase your chance of spotting as well as getting pregnant.

, Do not pop out the tablets or remove them from their original package or container. The packaging is designed to help you keep track of where you are in your cycle.If your pack contains pills that are different in color, it is especially important to take them in the exact order as they are in the package.
Colored tablets contain different strengths of hormones to provide the amount of hormones your body needs at different times of the month.
Even if your pills are all the same color, take them in the order they are in the package. This can help you and your doctor identify any problems you may have, such as spotting, at a particular part of your cycle.

, Talk with your doctor in advance to be sure you know what to do if you miss a pill. Missing a pill is a common reason for spotting or breakthrough bleeding to occur.If you miss a pill, ask your doctor when to take the missed dose and if added protection is needed to prevent pregnancy.
However, these questions do not have simple answers. The answers vary depending on three primary factors. The factors include the type of pills you are taking, where you are in your cycle when you miss the pill, and if you missed more than one pill in a row.

, Always check with your doctor to be sure you know what to do if you miss a pill. General guidelines that are used for women that take a new pack of pills every month, as opposed to packs that are designed for three month cycles, include the following:If you miss the very first pill in a new pack, take the missed pill as soon as you remember and take the next pill at the normal time. It is okay to take two pills in one day. Use a backup form of birth control until you have taken the next seven tablets on schedule.
If you miss a pill during the cycle, take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at the normal time. It is okay to two pills in one day.
If you have a 28 day pill pack, and you miss a dose during the last week, or tablets 21 thru 28, then you are not at risk of getting pregnant. Start your new pack as you would according to your regular schedule.

, Every manufacturer provides additional information in their product literature to help guide you if you miss more than one pill during a cycle. You can also check with your doctor to be sure you understand what to do. Be aware that you will likely need to use another method of birth control until you get back on schedule with your pills.If you miss two pills in a row during the first or second week, take two tablets on the day you remember and two tablets the following day. This will put you back on your normal schedule. Use another form of birth control until you begin new cycle and a fresh pack of pills.
If you miss two pills in a row during the third week, then use another method of birth control until it is time to start a new pack. You can discard the remainder of the pack you were in when you missed the two pills in the latter part of your cycle.
If you miss three or more pills in a row anytime during the cycle, then you should use another method of birth control and you will need to start a new pack.
Contact your doctor for clear instructions as to when to start the new pack. In some cases you may need to wait until your menstrual cycle occurs and start the new pack as you normally would. Your doctor may want you to start another pack sooner than that, depending on the type of birth control pills you are taking and how long until your menstrual cycle would normally begin.
Be sure to use other forms of birth control until you have taken seven days of your new pack.

, If you don’t smoke, then don’t start. Smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing serious problems when combined with birth control pills. Smoking can increase your metabolism of estrogen, resulting in lower levels of estrogen and possibly lead to spotting.Women who smoke more than 15 cigarettes a day and are over 35 years old should not take birth control.
Smoking cigarettes while taking birth control pills has been proven to greatly increase the risk of serious side effects.
Some examples of the serious complications that can occur from smoking and taking birth control pills include blood clots, liver tumors, and stroke.

, Weight gain or weight loss can affect your body's natural hormonal balance. If you experience significant weight change, check with your doctor to be sure your birth control pill regimen is still appropriate for you.Recent research has shown that birth control pills are equally effective in women that are overweight as they are in women of average weight.
There are still questions about significant changes in weight, either weight gain or loss, and how that may alter the body’s general metabolism, normal production of hormones, and the effects on birth control pill absorption and metabolism.

, Research has shown that some vitamins and herbal supplements influence the effectiveness of birth control pills. Some published remedies for spotting include taking vitamins or other supplements to alter the levels of hormones to prevent spotting.While it is true that some vitamins, supplements, and even foods, can interfere with the way your body absorbs the hormones in birth control pills, this is not a recommended method of trying to self-adjust your dose.
Consult your doctor before you use vitamins, supplements, and some foods and beverages to try to alter your absorption of your birth control pills.
These methods are not established in scientific research and are not recommended. There are many well-researched options available to balance the hormones in the birth control pills to match the needs of your body.
Some examples of vitamins, herbal supplements, and foods that alter the absorption of the hormones in birth control pills include vitamin C, St. John’s Wort, and grapefruit juice. If these agents are part of your regular routine, let your doctor know.

, Stressful situations cause your body to alter the release and absorption of the stress hormone called cortisol. Cortisol can alter the normal production of natural hormones, and may have an impact on the absorption and efficacy of your birth control pills.Alterations in cortisol levels influence how your body uses available hormones. This can lead to abnormalities in your menstrual cycle and may include spotting and breakthrough bleeding even when taking birth control pills.
Take steps to consistently manage the stress in your life. This may include participating in a new exercise routine or learning stress management tools such as yoga, meditation, and mindfulness exercises.
Learn how to use breathing and relaxation techniques to control unexpected stressful circumstances.

, If you experience spotting or breakthrough bleeding for an extended amount of time, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor needs to know if you have spotting or breakthrough bleeding for more than seven days of your cycle. In addition, spotting or bleeding that persists for more than four months warrants medical attention.See your doctor for new episodes of spotting. The spotting or breakthrough bleeding may be caused by something unrelated to your birth control pills.If you are continuing on the same regimen of birth control pills but begin to experience mid-cycle bleeding, this may be a symptom of another problem and should be evaluated by your doctor.
Breakthrough bleeding may be a sign of other problems including pregnancy or conditions involving cervical changes. If you have made lifestyle changes such as smoking, or have started taking new medications that may be interacting with the birth control pill regimen, this can cause breakthrough bleeding as well.

, Many birth control pills are made to contain the lowest possible amounts of some hormones. Your doctor may change your pills to a type that contains slightly higher levels of estrogen if he or she is aware of your ongoing problem with spotting. Changing to a pill formulated with a different type of progesterone, such as levonorgestrel, may also help.>


If you continue to have problems with spotting or breakthrough bleeding on your current pill, talk to your doctor about either switching to another strength or extending the number of days you take active pills vs the placebo pills at the end of most packs.
There are many types of pills that are effective at preventing pregnancy. Finding the best one to suit the hormonal needs of your body is simply a matter of being patient and trying a few different types.
Doctors routinely start with products that contain the lowest possible amounts of either estrogen, progesterone, or both. Changing to a brand with a slightly higher dose of estrogen usually stops the problem with spotting and breakthrough bleeding.
Some packages are now designed to extend your days of active pills by taking advantage of a 3 month cycle as opposed to the usual 1 month pill pack.
By switching to a 3 month cycle, you may have less trouble with your periods and fewer problems with spotting and breakthrough bleeding. Talk to your doctor about this option.

, Many women stop taking their birth control pills out of frustration due to continued problems with spotting or breakthrough bleeding.


Consider being patient and open to trying other types of birth control pills.
Realize that stopping your birth control pills means you will need to find another method of birth control.
Birth control pills are one of the most effective and convenient ways to prevent pregnancy.
Other methods are often less reliable, inconvenient, and sometimes require interruptions during sexual intercourse.

, Your doctor will schedule your appointments at intervals felt to be most appropriate for your age and any risk factors you may have for other diseases. Many doctors may recommend scheduling your appointments on an annual basis to evaluate for changes and be sure your prescription birth control pills are at the best dose for you.If you are having any problems with new or persistent bleeding, make an appointment as soon as possible for an evaluation.
Vaginal bleeding can be a symptom of a medical condition, including some that are serious such as cervical cancer.
In addition, your doctor may want to perform screening tests for sexually transmitted disease or other problems on a routine basis, possibly annually, depending on your personal circumstances.
Birth control pills do not protect from sexually transmitted diseases. Let your doctor know as soon as possible if you think you may have acquired a sexually transmitted disease., Many drugs can interfere with the effectiveness of your birth control pills. Be sure your doctor has a list of all your medications. Continually update him or her on any changes that are made to your regular daily doses of prescription drugs, over-the-counter agents including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and ibuprofen, vitamins, and herbal supplements.Drugs that can interfere with the effectiveness of your pill can include everything from over-the-counter herbal supplements to antibiotics.
Both short and longer term use of some antibiotics can alter the effectiveness of your birth control pills. If you are prescribed an antibiotic for any reason, it is important to let your doctor know since your birth control regimen may be less effective.
Some antiseizure medications can also interfere with the effectiveness of your birth control pills. Seizure medications are sometimes used to treat mood disorders and chronic pain syndromes such as migraine headaches.
Some herbal supplements, especially St. John's wort, may also interfere with hormonal birth control.
Always ask your doctor or pharmacist about the need to use backup birth control when you are taking something new.

, Medical conditions can alter the way birth control pills work in your body and may put you at additional risk of unwanted complications.Some medical conditions may warrant closer monitoring for women that are taking birth control pills. Examples include diabetes, a history of cardiovascular disease, and a history of breast disease.
If you get a virus, the flu, or a stomach condition that includes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, let your doctor know.
The symptoms alone can alter the absorption of your birth control pills. This means they are probably less effective during this time and you may need to use another method of birth control until you are feeling better for at least seven days.

Stay safe and take it easy.",How to Prevent Pregnancy if a Condom Breaks," Time is of the essence in preventing an accidental pregnancy after unprotected sex.Effectiveness is highest in the first 24 hours after sex but emergency contraception can be effective up to 5 days after.;
, Douching is not only ineffective at preventing pregnancy but is generally advised against by doctors.Douching changes the normal bacterial and yeast state of your reproductive tract leading to increased infections.

, If you had unprotected sex, you are not just at risk of pregnancy but you are also at risk for a sexually transmitted infection. See a doctor and get tested for pregnancy and for sexually transmitted infections.HIV testing usually requires two tests six months apart to ensure a true reading.

, Plan B is a hormone based emergency contraceptive available in Canada and the United States that prevents ovulation and fertilization if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex.The hormone in Plan B is called progestin, or levonorgestrel.
Plan B is available over the counter at most pharmacies or from your medical provider. You do not need a prescription for Plan B, and it is not covered under most medical insurance plans., Ella is a synthetic pill (made of ulipristal acetate) that works much the same as Plan B but can be effective up to 5 days after sex. Because of this, it is a bit more likely to be effective at preventing pregnancy than Plan B.Ella requires a prescription from a medical provider.Ella reduces the risk of pregnancy after unprotected sex by approximately 75%.There is no current evidence that Ella causes abortions. The ""abortion pill"" (RU-486, or mifepristone) is only available with a prescription. While both drugs do interact with progesterone, they do so very differently. The dosage in Ella is not high enough to cause an abortion., Do not assume the pharmacist or medical provider will know what you are asking for.Pills currently available in the US are Plan B (also called My Way, Next Choice, or Take Action), and Ella. In Canada, you can ask for Plan B (also called Option 2, Next Choice, or NorLevo). Ella is not yet available in Canada.
If the professional helping you only hears you say “contraceptive,” she might think you are asking for regular oral contraceptives. Be specific to ensure you get what you need.

, Certain combination birth control pills work at preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex. You can find a full list at Princeton's Emergency Contraception website here.Be sure you are choosing a regular oral contraceptive that has been shown to be effective in preventing pregnancy. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you aren't sure.If taken in the proper doses, oral contraceptives reduce the risk of pregnancy after unprotected sex by 75%. This depends on the type of oral contraceptive you have, however., The copper intrauterine device (aka IUD) is a highly effective form of emergency contraceptive as it reduces the risk of pregnancy by more than 99% if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.However, many offices do not carry IUDs in stock and must order them, meaning it may be difficult to use them as emergency contraception within the appropriate timeframe.


The copper IUD works by increasing cervical mucus and repelling sperm. Side effects may include cramping and bleeding between periods.
Hormone based IUDs (such as Mirena) do not work as emergency contraceptives but they are an excellent choice of preventative birth control.
The IUD can easily be inserted by a professional at a doctor’s office or clinic. You do not need to go to a hospital.
Having a copper IUD inserted provides the extra benefit of being effective as a regular birth control method if left in place for up to 10 years. However, they may be expensive, so they may not be your first choice.

, Whether you take Plan B, Ella, or a dose of regular oral contraceptives, there are certain suggestions to follow for optimal effectiveness in preventing pregnancy.

, Plan B is two pills (which equals one dose) that you take together as soon as you can.You only need to take one dose. Do not take more than the suggested dose or any other birth control pills in addition.
The sooner you take Plan B after unprotected sex, the more effective it will be in preventing pregnancy. Plan B reduces the risk of pregnancy after unprotected sex by 95% if taken within the first 24 hours., Ella is only available by prescription but it is similar to Plan B in how you take it. You only need one dose, which for Ella is just one pill.You only need to take one pill. Do not take more than the suggested dose or any other birth control pills in addition.

, Doses differ depending on the type of pill you are taking.For example, if you have Levora oral contraceptives, you will take 4 pills at each dose but if you have Aviane, you will take 5 pills at each dose. Be sure to check with a medical professional or pharmacist if you are uncertain how much to take.Take your first dose within 5 days of unprotected sex, then a second dose 12 hours after the first dose. To use regular oral contraceptives as emergency contraception, you usually have to take two doses.Do not miss the second dose or you greatly decrease the chance of successfully preventing a pregnancy.

, Regardless of which pill method you choose, you can expect certain side effects to occur so be prepared.Emergency contraceptive pills can cause side effects such as nausea, headaches, and dizziness. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor what to expect.

, Taking an anti-nauseant pill, if one is available, will decrease the chances that you will vomit as a side effect of taking the emergency contraceptives.Taking an anti-nauseant one to two hours before taking your emergency contraceptive may prevent you from throwing up the emergency contraceptive.
If you throw up within an hour of taking the emergency contraceptive, call your medical provider to see if you should take another dose.

, Do not drink or drive vehicles in the first 24 hours after taking your pills.You may be additionally drowsy, especially if you have also taken an anti-nauseant.

Try the ""withdrawal method.,
Use the ""calendar method.,
Track your fertility using physiological markers.One way to track your fertility is to use physiological markers such as basal body temperature measurements, and/or observing cervical mucus discharge, to help pinpoint the specific days when the woman's fertility peaks.,
Understand that natural methods still pose a risk of pregnancy.",How to Prevent Pregnancy Without a Condom2,"""One way to diminish the chances of pregnancy without using a condom is to try the withdrawal method. This method consists of the man removing his penis just prior to ejaculation, so that the sperm do not have a chance to travel up the woman's vagina in a way that may lead to pregnancy.


The challenge with this method is that some sperm may leak out prematurely (prior to ejaculation and thus prior to withdrawal of the man's penis), which is what makes this method only 78% effective at preventing pregnancy.

,""Technically, there are only a few days each month when a woman can actually become pregnant. Most women have a 28 day cycle, which starts on the first day of her period. On average, ovulation occurs on day 14, but a woman can be fertile for several days before and after ovulating.


If a woman has sex significantly before or after her most fertile days, her chances of becoming pregnant are much lower.
The downside to the calendar method is that not all women have exactly 28 day cycles. There is quite a bit of variability between women, and one woman may even find that her own menstrual cycles are not completely consistent from month to month. It is for this reason that this method is only 76% effective at preventing pregnancy, without the use of a condom.
If your cycle is consistently more or less than 28 days, subtract 14 days from the END of your cycle and consider this the start of your most fertile few days. The second half of a woman's menstrual cycle (following ovulation) tends to be much more consistent than the first half of the cycle (prior to ovulation).

, You can then avoid having sex on those days when the woman's fertility is high.


With the ""basal body temperature"" method, a woman measures her temperature first thing in the morning and before eating every day. It will rise 0.4-1.0 degrees Fahrenheit following ovulation. Therefore, it is advisable to use a condom, a spermicide, or another non-hormonal form of birth control from the first day following the woman's period to three days after her basal body temperature has risen.
With the ""cervical mucus"" method, the woman observes the characteristics of her cervical mucus discharge. There is typically no mucus discharge immediately following a period, mild and sticky secretions in the days after that, greatly increased mucus secretions that are more wet and clear in the days surrounding ovulation, and no noticeable secretions following the end of her ""fertile period"" all the way until the beginning of the woman's next menstrual cycle. Therefore, during days when cervical mucus is abundant, clear and wet, it is important to avoid sexual intercourse as this is when a woman's fertility is at its peak., Both the withdrawal method as well as the calendar method are significantly less effective than the medical methods of contraception. It is important not to rely on these techniques if you are truly seeking to avoid a pregnancy. Here's why:


If you are a man and you inadvertently get a woman pregnant, in most places she has 100% choice as to whether or not to proceed with the pregnancy (or whether to get an abortion).
This may mean that, by getting a woman pregnant, if she chooses to keep the baby you are now responsible financially to help out, and may take on the responsibilities of co-parenting duties as well.
Both men and women are impacted by unintended pregnancies. Having the responsibilities of supporting a baby before you are ready can significantly impact (and potentially get in the way of) other plans you may have, regarding career, relationships, or any other sphere of life.
If you are the woman and you inadvertently become pregnant, you may be faced with the challenging decision of whether or not to keep the baby or to proceed with abortion, if this is legal in your area.

"
"
Consider a condom for STI risk reduction.Before making the decision to forego condom use, it is important to consider the role that condoms can play in STI risk reduction as well as in preventing pregnancy.,
Use a condom if you do not fully trust your sexual partner.,
Seek emergency contraception if your condom breaks or otherwise malfunctions.Condoms have an 82% effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.However, if your condom breaks while having sex, it is important to seek a form of emergency contraception immediately.,
Use a condom as backup protection if becoming pregnant would be unthinkable.",How to Prevent Pregnancy Without a Condom3," Even if you are using other contraceptive devices, such as a hormonal form of birth control, other contraceptive methods do nothing to prevent you from STIs (sexually transmitted infections). Therefore, condoms have an important advantage when it comes to practicing safe sex.


Condoms protect you from STIs by reducing genital-to-genital contact, and by also blocking the ejaculatory fluid from the man's penis from getting into the woman's vagina. Both of these types of contact are ways in which an infection can be passed from one person to another.

, If you are in a long-term committed monogamous relationship, you will know whether your partner is taking alternative forms of birth control, such as taking ""the pill"" or using an IUD, as you will have developed a trusting relationship with that person and have presumably discussed the best contraceptive strategies for the two of you. However, if you have a new sexual partner who you do not yet know well enough to fully trust, it is important to understand that a condom can be one of the more reliable methods of contraception.


If you are a man, you can never know for sure if a new female sexual partner is actually on ""the pill"" (or another birth control method), and taking it reliably.
It is possible for a woman to be dishonest about using birth control while purposefully becoming pregnant.
Similarly, a man may be dishonest to a woman about having a vasectomy when he actually does not. Or, he may say he will withdraw and then fail to do so.
Using a condom is a clear and straightforward method of contraception that does not require trust on anyone's behalf.

,


You can purchase emergency contraception at your local pharmacy or drugstore, or oftentimes even at the supermarket.
Your options are a pill (Plan B), or having a Copper IUD inserted. Plan B needs to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse (ideally within one day, as its effectiveness decreases the longer you wait). However, Plan B can be used up to 72 hours after having unprotected sex. A Copper IUD is effective as emergency contraception for up to 5 days following unprotected intercourse.
Other options include ulipristal acetate and combined estrogen-progesterone pills.Both of these emergency contraception medications require a prescription from your doctor.

, Since every method has a failure rate, it is smart to combine more than one method - such as using both a condom and birth control pills - in situations where you absolutely do not want a pregnancy. It is better to be cautious than risking becoming pregnant, and having to then deal with the potential aftermath.

Because of this, it’s important to coordinate your care with any medical professionals or other caregivers in your efforts. Doctors, nurses, social workers, and case managers can provide important information about individual’s case and proper care strategies. This can help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s and boost the person’s health.Ask other caregivers questions you may have about providing care. Consider factors such as knowing when and how much medication to give, promoting overall health, and reducing potential frustrations for the person and you.
Inform the rest of the care team if you notice any changes in the health or behavior of the person. Because the disease affects the memory and thinking, you may notice potential problems or changes that the person can’t recognize. This could be vital information for doctors about the person’s health, including the progression of the disease.
Medical professionals to consider for the person's health team (beyond their physician) include a therapist, social worker, or psychologist to support mental health; an occupational therapist who can evaluate the safety of the person's home and provide tips for transport, driving, and self-care.;
, Make sure you have the person with Alzheimer’s permission to coordinate care and treatment with the health care team members. This helps the individual feel more independent and that any decisions you make are in their best interest.Be aware that in some cases, you may need written permission to legally make decisions on the person’s health and treatment. If this is the case, explain to the person that you would like their signature to be a member of the health care team. The Alzheimer's Association is a great resource for how to handle the legal and financial aspects of caregiving. Check out their free pamphlets here: http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_publications_financial_legal.asp

Ask at a time when the person is most alert. Speak clearly to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications. For example, “Hi Sam, I would really like to help care for you. I need legal permission, though. Please sign this form so that I can be a caretaker. Do you have any questions?”

, Many people with Alzheimer’s are on a regimen of medication to slow the disease’s progression and related symptoms such as anxiety or sleep changes.Make sure the person takes medication daily and gets prescription refills on time. This can help the person maintain brain health for a longer period of time.


Read the dosing instructions for every medication the individual takes. Keep a notebook of medications to ensure the person takes the daily doses. Note the times the person takes the medication and any problems that may arise. This can also be vital information for other members of the care team.

, If you are giving the person medication, you may want to learn more about the treatment regimen. This can ensure that you are providing the best care and disease management options. Some of the most common medications and treatments for Alzheimer’s disease are:Cholinesterase inhibitors including donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine. These slow the process that breaks down one of the brain’s key neurotransmitters.
Memantine, an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist, that slows down neural cell damage.
Sleep medications such as zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta)Anti-anxiety medications such as clonazepam, lorazepam

, Routine is a key component of caring for a person with Alzheimer’s. It supports the person’s sense of wellbeing and continued ability to function. One way to support that is by scheduling the person’s regular appointment with care team medical professionals at the same time on the same day as much as possible. Speak to the doctors’ offices about the need to maintain this routine for the person and ask if they can accommodate you., As Alzheimer’s progresses, a person with the disease may become easily frustrated as once easy tasks become increasingly difficult. Limiting challenges and managing situations can reduce potential frustration.For example, you could:


Pre-select a couple of dishes for the person to eat at a restaurant so they don't get overwhelmed and/ or frustrated with an entire menu.
Have a tailor replace buttonholes with snaps.
Give the person a comfortable spot away from the action at family gatherings.

, A person with Alzheimer’s can still learn and follow routines. Set a regular daily routine for the person that varies only as necessary. This can make situations less agitating and confusing for the individual.Schedule tasks such as bathing and medical appointments when the person is most alert.
Incorporate some flexibility in the schedule for spontaneous activities the person would like to do.

, Even with a routine, a person with Alzheimer’s may need more time to do once easy tasks. Take your time with care and allow the person to take breaks as necessary. This can keep the person from feeling hurried, which may increase anxiety and agitation.Incorporate cushions of time for each task. For example, if the person has a doctor’s appointment at 9 a.m., start getting ready at 8:45 to give the individual time to put on a coat, walk to the car, and arrive on time.

, Involve your Alzheimer’s patient to continue doing tasks with as little assistance as possible. This can boost the person’s wellbeing and help stimulate the brain, which is important in slowing the disease’s progression.Keep the tasks as simple as possible so that the person isn’t overwhelmed. This can lead to anxiety and agitation. For example, let the person set the table with the help of visual cues. You can also lay out the person’s clothes and allow the individual to dress independently.

, Although a person with Alzheimer’s can get frustrated with variety, it’s still important to provide the person different choices every day. This can help the individual feel like they still have control over their life and also helps stimulate brain cells. This may slow the disease’s progression.Recognize that fewer options are better, but that giving the person a choice is important to health and wellbeing. For example, you can let the person choose between two outfits, what type of meal to eat, or if a movie or walk is a preferable activity.

, Confusion is a typical symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.Giving the person simple and clear instructions can help minimize confusion and may prevent anxiety or agitation.Use clear, one-step instructions. For example, “Dad, please grab the water glasses,” or, “Sara, put on your shirt.” If the task requires multiple steps, break it up into several steps and give the person breaks as necessary.

, Distractions can impair a person with Alzheimer’s ability to focus. Reducing the number of ambient distractions, such as the TV, helps a person with Alzheimer’s focus. This can minimize confusion, frustration, anxiety, and/ or agitation.Turn off TVs, stereos, or other media during mealtimes, conversations, or activities such as reading. Allow one person to speak at a time during conversations so the person can follow along.

, Alzheimer’s destroys brain cells and impairs a person’s judgment and problem-solving skills. This increases the risk of injury, including from falls. Avoiding clutter, area rugs around the house and installing grab bars can minimize the risk of the person falling.Remove extension cords, excess furniture or other clutter on which the person may trip.Make sure the person’s shoes and slippers have good traction and are comfortable.
Take away area rugs or secure them with anti-slide material. This can keep the person from slipping and hitting their head.
Clean up spills as soon as possible.Install sturdy handrails or bars in potentially dangerous areas such as stairways and bathrooms.
You can employ and occupational therapist to come in and evaluate the home for safety concerns and advice on how to make the home safe and efficient for the person.

, As the person’s Alzheimer’s progresses, use locks on cabinets that contain potentially dangerous items. This can keep the person from accidentally ingesting chemicals or exposing themselves to other hazards. Some items to lock include:Medicine
Alcohol
Guns
Toxic chemicals, including cleaning substances
Knives or other sharp kitchen implements
Tools
Scissors
Gasoline

, A hot water heater set to higher temperatures may accidentally burn a person with Alzheimer’s. Setting the thermostat lower or placing a water temperature controller in showers and kitchen sinks can minimize the risk of burns., Fires may also occur if a person with Alzheimer’s gets confused about matches or lighters. Placing fire implements out of reach and having alarms and extinguishers easily accessible can minimize the risk of injury or property destruction by fire.Make sure you have a full and easily accessible fire extinguisher. Check the date of the last fill and replace it if it’s older than one year.
Check smoke detectors to ensure the batteries are full and working properly.
Light cigarettes and supervise smoking if the person does it.

, A person with Alzheimer’s may place items such as keys, wallets, mobile phones and jewelry in unusual places if they are confused. Keeping these items in one secure place can minimize the risk of them getting lost.Consider having an area in an entry way the person can set items. Place a dish or basket in a prominent spot for things such as keys, wallets, and phones.

, A person with Alzheimer's may begin to wander around the house. Keep detailed notes about wandering patterns — when they occur, how often they occur, and how long the wandering lasts. This can help you determine the cause of the wandering. For instance, if the person wanders first thing in the morning, it may be because they are hungry. Ensure the person is fed, hydrated, and going to the bathroom regularly, as these impulses may cause wandering. It is also important to take steps to prevent the person from wandering out of the house and to protect them should this happen.Give the person an ID bracelet with contact information or fit them with a wristband transmitter. You may want to slip a card with this information into their jackets, wallet, etc.
Make sure you have a current photo of the person. Ask the police department about keeping one on file, should the person wander off.
Consider installing an electronic chime that will sound when someone enters or exits the home to notify you if the person attempts to exit.
Post signs that read ""DO NOT ENTER"" or ""STOP"" on exits. Placing a black mat in front of exits may also prevent the person from leaving — the mat may appear to be a hole in the floor to someone with dementia.

, Alzheimer’s destroys a person’s ability to remember things. Setting photographs and other meaningful objects around the person’s house and those of loved ones can help the person recall family, friends, and special events such as weddings or births., Limit the number of mirrors the person can access. This minimizes the risk of the person finding images in the mirror frightening, which can also decrease anxiety and/or frustration. For example, if the individual has a beloved antique mirror, consider displaying that and removing other options such as entry way or decorative mirrors that have no purpose."

Condoms.,
Female condoms.,
Diaphragms.",How to Prevent Pregnancy1," Latex condoms are worn on the penis during intercourse. They prevent pregnancy by keeping semen from coming into contact with fertile eggs. Condoms are often given out for free at health clinics, and they're available for over-the-counter purchase for about $1.00 a piece at drug stores and grocery stores.


An added benefit of condoms is that they protect both parties from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well as pregnancy.
Condoms are made from thin latex, so they occasionally tear during intercourse. When this happens, the chances of pregnancy go up.Some people have allergies to latex condoms, and choose condoms made of plastic instead.;
, Also made of latex, female condoms are shaped like a ring with a pouch. The pouch fits inside the vagina, while the ring stays outside the body to hold it in place. They collect semen during intercourse so it never has a chance to enter the woman's body. Female condoms cost about $4.00 a piece and are available at drugstores.


Female condoms reduce the risk of STDs by protecting the vagina from directly getting touched.
Female condoms are slightly less effective than regular condoms, and some people say that they are less comfortable to use., These shallow cups made of silicone are inserted inside the vagina and over the cervix to prevent semen from contacting an egg. They are commonly used in combination with spermicidal jelly, which prevents sperm from moving, in order to increase efficacy.


Since every woman's body is a slightly different shape, diaphragms must be fitted to make sure they're the right size. Talk to your gynecologist or health clinic worker about getting fitting for a diaphragm.
Diaphragms are quite effective, but they don't prevent the transmission of STDs."

Be sure to dry them before touching the diaphragm.
You can also rinse off your diaphragm (if needed).
If you need to empty your bladder, do this before washing your hands.;
, Always inspect the device before use to make sure it doesn’t have holes or tears.Hold your diaphragm up to a light source to have a clearer view during inspection.
Gently stretch the diaphragm at the area of the rim on all sides. This helps ensure that there are no holes or tears in the device.
You can also check for tears or holes by pouring water inside the diaphragm. No leaks should be observed. If you see leaks, do not use the diaphragm and use another contraceptive method.

, Never forget spermicides (jelly or cream) before inserting the diaphragm, otherwise the effectiveness of the diaphragm is reduced.Add at least a tablespoon of spermicidal cream inside the dome of the diaphragm. Spread the spermicide over the rim and dome with your finger.
Always follow the instruction in the spermicidal package as the different products are used slightly differently.

, You can insert a diaphragm by standing with one foot resting on a chair, lying down with knees bent and feet apart, or squatting down. Try the different methods to find the best method for you.Once you have found the comfortable position, locate your cervix (the opening that leads to your uterus).
You can feel your cervix at the end of the vaginal canal. This is where you need to insert the diaphragm.

, Pinch the diaphragm between your fingers and thumb and hold the diaphragm so that the inside of the dome (and the spermicide in it) is facing your vagina.Separate the lips of your vulva and push the diaphragm all the way into the vagina until it reaches the cervix.
Make sure the front rim is tucked under the pubic bone and that the diaphragm covers the cervix snugly.
If it feels loose, then you might have the wrong fit. Consult your doctor if you think you need a different size.

, Washing your hands will remove bodily fluids and spermicide and should always be done before and after inserting or removing a diaphragm.

, If intercourse should happen again within a few hours after the first act, additional spermicidal cream should be applied without removing the diaphragm in between.You should also add more spermicide if you insert your diaphragm hours before having intercourse.
Most spermicide products come in a tube with an applicator tip. Simply insert the applicator as far as you can without discomfort to make sure you reach the cervix, and then squeeze the tube to insert one tablespoon of spermicidal cream into your vagina before intercourse.

, Always wash your hands before and after inserting or removing a diaphragm.


Proper hygiene helps maintain your diaphragm longer and prevents vaginal infections.

, Do not remove the diaphragm immediately after intercourse as this can lead to unwanted pregnancy.You should not leave the diaphragm in for more than 24 hours. This is unhygienic and can lead to serious complications, such as toxic shock syndrome., Insert your finger inside your vagina and locate the top rim of the diaphragm. Hook your finger firmly on the upper rim and break the suction.Pull the diaphragm out with your finger.
Be careful not to tear a hole in the diaphragm with your fingernails., Always clean the diaphragm after use to remove bodily fluids and spermicide.


Do not use strong and perfumed soaps because it may weaken the rubber.
After washing, allow the diaphragm to air dry. Do not use a towel to rub the diaphragm dry as this can lead to tears.
If you'd like, you may dust it using cornstarch, but remember to rinse the diaphragm before next use.
Avoid products such as baby powder, body powder, or face powder, Vaseline or hand creams. These can damage the diaphragm rubber. , With proper care, the diaphragm can last up to two years. This includes storing it in its container and avoiding exposure to hot or wet environment.Also avoid placing the diaphragm in direct sunlight as this can heat the rubber and impair the integrity of the device.

, If the diaphragm breaks or tears before it is time to replace it, contact your healthcare provider and ask for a new device.If you notice any damage in your diaphragm, do not use it.
Also, if you have any doubt about the integrity of the device, it is better not to use it.

, Choosing the right type of diaphragm is important. Currently there are three types of diaphragms to choose from.Arching spring diaphragm: this is the most common and easiest type of diaphragm to insert. This type of device has two hinged points that form an arc for easy insertion.Coil spring diaphragm: this has a soft flexible rim but it does not form an arc when you fold it. Women with weaker muscle tone of the vagina can take advantage of this. This type of diaphragm comes with an introducer tool.Flat spring diaphragm: this is similar to the coil spring diaphragm, but it has a thinner and more delicate rim. You can also insert this type of diaphragm with an introducer tool. A flat spring diaphragm is better used by women who have stronger vaginal muscle tone Diaphragms are made with silicone or latex. Silicone diaphragms are less common and must be ordered from the manufacturer. Caution: If you are allergic to latex use silicone diaphragm instead. If you experience an allergic reaction (rash, itching, flushing, restlessness, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness) seek medical assistance immediately.

, Proper fitting of the diaphragm is vital to ensure effectiveness. If you use poorly fitted diaphragms, it can slip during intercourse and lead to pregnancy.For diaphragms that do not have a dome, you can use fitting rings to find the proper fit. These can be ordered from the manufacturer.
You can also get fitted by your doctor who can also help you choose the proper diaphragm. This is especially helpful if this is the first time you are using a diaphragm.
If you schedule an appointment with your doctor, the procedure takes around 10-20 minutes and you may experience some discomfort during the fitting.
After the doctor knows the right measurement, she will also teach you how to insert the diaphragm by yourself.
You may need to refit your diaphragm after weight loss, weight gain, childbirth, and/or miscarriage.

, Certain conditions are contraindicated for intrauterine devices, therefore it is important that you inform your healthcare provider regarding any past health conditions (such as allergies, and uterine and pelvic disorders) that may impact your ability to use a diaphragm.If you are not a good candidate for this type of contraception method, other alternatives are available. Consult your doctor about the different contraceptive methods available for you.

, When it comes to contraception, there are numerous methods to choose from. Knowing the pros and cons of using a diaphragm is vital and allows you to choose the proper contraceptive method for you.Unlike hormonal contraceptives, diaphragms do not produce hormonal related side effects or risks.
Diaphragm does not interfere with intercourse and can be inserted several hours before intercourse begins.
You are in control of your contraception.
During the insertion process, using diaphragms can become uncomfortable because some women are not comfortable touching themselves.
Cases of diaphragm dislodgement during intercourse may result to unwanted pregnancy.
Diaphragms do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.
Women using diaphragms are at higher risk for urinary tract infections. Note: UTIs respond easily to medical treatments. If you have a UTI or experience frequent UTIs, seek medical attention.
Urethritis (infection of the urethra) and recurrent cystitis (infection of the bladder) can be caused by upward pressure of the diaphragm rim against the urethra.Diaphragms increase the risk of toxic shock syndrome especially if used improperly. To prevent toxic shock syndrome, use proper hygiene methods before inserting or removing your diaphragm and do not leave your diaphragm in for more than 8 hours after sexual intercourse"

Hide condoms in containers.,
Store condoms in clothes.,
Consider investing in a condom case.,
Hollow out a book.,
Store condoms at the proper temperature.,
Avoid keeping condoms in your wallet.,
Do not leave condoms outside.",How to Hide a Condom," A good way to hide condoms is to place them in uninteresting containers. This is a relatively safe way to store condoms as well, as they're less susceptible to damage.


An Altoids tin, toiletries bag, an unused jewelry box, or a coin purse are all good places to hide condoms.One downside to this method is that if someone wants a mint or some change, they may find the condoms. It might be a good idea to keep the container in a discreet place as well.;
, Condoms can also be hidden in clothing. Hide a condom in a sock, the sleeve or pocket of a coat you do not usually use, or a winter hat. Just make sure the item of clothing is stored in a safe place where it will not get moved around without your knowledge. Make sure clothing is not stored at extremely hot or extremely cold temperatures., You can purchase discreet cases in which to covertly store condoms. These cases are often disguised as mint tins or jewelry cases. They also may look like simple, non decorative containers. You can buy condom cases online or at sex shops., If you have an old book you do not need, consider cutting a square shaped hole in the center of the pages. You can place a condom in here or several condoms. Just be careful where you leave the book. If you leave it out on a coffee table, for example, someone may open it. It's best to choose an uninteresting looking book and tuck it away in the back of the bookshelf., The effectiveness of condoms changes if they're stored in very high or very low temperatures. Do not store condoms in places where they could become expose to extreme heat or cold.


Do not hide condoms in fridges or freezers or near microwaves or ovens. Exposure to heat or cold could make the condom less effective.Do not store condoms in your car. If the car overheats or gets very cold, the condom could become less effective.Condoms are best stored at room temperature, between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit., It can be a bad idea to store a condom in your wallet especially if you carry your wallet in your pocket. The friction from your body can cause excessive heat, making the condom less effective, and can also lead the condom to crack or tear., It's a bad idea to hide condoms outside. Not only can changes in temperature damage condoms, weather conditions could damage. Animals could also get into the condoms. You don't want the condoms to be missing or damaged when you need them."

Birth control pills.,
Other hormonal devices.,
Intrauterine Devices (IUDs).",How to Prevent Pregnancy2," Birth control pills, often referred to in shorthand as ""the Pill,"" consist of synthetic estrogen and progestin hormones that keep a woman's eggs from leaving her ovaries, so that pregnancy can't happen.When taken properly, they are extremely effective. Contraceptive pills are available on a prescription-only basis from your gynecologist or health care provider.


The Pill must be taken every day, at the same time each day, to work properly. Skipping a few days could decrease its efficacy.
The Pill causes some women to experience side effects. Different brands of pills have different levels of estrogen and progestin, so your doctor may prescribe a different brand if one seems to be causing negative side effects., The same hormones that make birth control pills effective can be distributed to the body by other means. If you don't like taking pills every day, consider these options:

Depo-Provera, or the birth control shot. This shot is administered in the arm once every three months. The shot is very effective at preventing pregnancy, but it has been reported that side effects are possible.The birth control patch. The patch is usually placed on the arm, back or thigh. It distributes hormones through the skin and has to be replaced every few weeks.






The birth control ring. The ring is inserted into the vagina once a month. It releases hormones to prevent pregnancy from occurring.






The birth control implant. A small rod is inserted in the arm, and it releases hormones to prevent pregnancy for up to three years. It must be inserted and removed by a health care provider., The IUD is a small metal device inserted in the uterus by a health care provider. One type of IUD works by releasing hormones, and another type is made of copper, which affects the mobility of sperm and stops them from fertilizing the egg.IUDs are extremely effective and last up to 12 years, although they can cost from $500 to $1,000.
If you're concerned about disrupting your menstrual cycle, consider the copper IUD, which doesn't interfere with your hormones or cause hormonal birth control-related side effects.

Abstinence.,
Fertility awareness.",How to Prevent Pregnancy3," Abstaining from vaginal intercourse prevents pregnancy by preventing the man's semen from coming into contact with the woman's egg. Abstinence is one hundred percent effective in preventing pregnancy when it is used continuously.


Some people define abstinence as abstaining from all sexual contact, but in order to prevent pregnancy, only vaginal intercourse needs to be avoided.
Abstinence requires strong willpower, and some people might find it difficult to rely on this birth control method for long periods of time.
It's important to have another birth control method in place once abstinence is ended.

, Also called natural family planning, this method of birth control requires having sex only during times of the menstrual cycle when the woman is not fertile. During times when pregnancy would be possible, periodic abstinence is employed. For fertility awareness to be effective, the practitioner must understand and respect the perimeters of her fertility.

Fertility awareness often involves three different ways for calculating fertility: the calendar method, the mucus method, and the temperature method. Used together, these three methods are very effective at determining exactly when a woman is fertile.
The calendar method requires tracking the different phases of the menstrual cycle on a calendar, then noticing patterns over time and using the patterns to predict when ovulation will occur.






The mucus method involves checking vaginal mucus, which changes in color and consistency when a woman is fertile.






The temperature method involves checking the body's basal temperature every day and noticing when it goes up a few tenths of degree, which signals that ovulation has occurred.






The downside of fertility awareness is that it requires a lot of time and attention. If you forget to check mucus or temperature for a few days, you may miscalculate the days during which sex should be avoided.
The upside of fertility awareness is that it its completely natural, requiring almost no money, no outside hormones, and no uncomfortable devices.

Female sterilization.,
Vasectomy.",How to Prevent Pregnancy4," Surgery is conducted to close off the fallopian tubes in a process called tubal ligation, preventing the possibility of pregnancy. This method is extremely effective at preventing pregnancy, but it is not to be taken lightly, since it is difficult or impossible to reverse.

, Men may choose to undergo a process that blocks their vas deferentia, through which sperm flow, preventing them from mixing with semen.When the man ejaculates, his semen does not contain sperm, making it impossible for him to get a woman pregnant. Vasectomy may be reversed in some cases, but it should not be considered unless the intention is to become permanently sterilized.

"
"
Use emergency contraception.",How to Prevent Pregnancy5," Also called Plan B, emergency contraception consists of two pills containing levonorgestrel that are ingested as soon as possible after sexual intercourse.The sooner they are taken, the more effective they are at preventing pregnancy.


Emergency contraception is available at most pharmacies and from your healthcare provider.
Emergency contraception should not be a replacement for regular birth control; it's a last resort to be take after unprotected sex.

, Some physicians may give out free condoms.


If you are a minor concerned about confidentiality, ask your doctor what his or her policy is. You can ask whether the information would be kept confidential from your parents.

, These organizations often offer condoms free of charge. You can call them ahead of time to ask if they are currently distributing.


Possible sources include health clinics, gynecologists’ offices, and hospitals.
Planned Parenthood in the US often offers free condoms. For example, in Oregon you can drop in and receive 12 free condoms. It is confidential, even for minors., Many universities, both public and private, distribute free condoms to students in ways that are anonymous.

Some schools have programs with where parents may decide whether these services will be available to their teen.

, Depending upon where you live, these services may even be available to you as a teen.Check the websites of organizations like TeenSource.org, LAcondom.com, or CondomUSA.com.
Check the expiration date and do not use expired condoms. They are less reliable.
As always, check the condom for tears or pinprick holes.

, Condoms do not last forever.Make sure the expiration date has not passed. Never used a condom after its expiration date.
Examine the condom to make sure it is still intact. If it has small tears or stiff patches, get a new one.

, To be effective, the condom must be used during all times of genital contact.Use lubrication to make sex more enjoyable and reduce the chances of the condom breaking.
Use only water-based lubricants with a condom. Examples include Astroglide and K-Y jelly.
Oil-based lubricants may break down the latex, increasing the chances of the condom breaking. Don’t use body or massage oils, vaseline, or cooking oils as lubricants.

, If you start to put the condom on inside out, don’t turn it around and start again. Use a new condom. Make sure to use a condom for the entire sexual encounter.


Start with the rolled up condom at the tip of the penis. The rolled side should be out.
Pinch the tip of the condom and hold it in place while you unroll the condom until it covers the entire length of the penis. There should be about a half an inch of space at the tip to catch semen during ejaculation.
If you are unfamiliar with how to properly put on a condom, practice on a banana or a model penis.

, Hold the base of the penis while you gently and carefully remove the condom.


Do not spill the semen inside the condom.
Dispose of the condom in the trash.

, A broken condom does not offer protection.

, Don’t use a lambskin condom. It won’t protect against sexually transmitted diseases.A latex allergy is the only reason that a doctor will tell you not to use a latex condom. There are no other health considerations or concerns that would indicate that you should not use one during a sexual encounter.

, Keep them in a place where they won’t be exposed to heat, sunlight or physical stress. These conditions can weaken the condoms.Don’t carry condoms in your wallet or pants pocket. The friction and bending will weaken the condoms. This will make them more likely to break or get small holes.
Glove compartments of cars get too hot to safely store condoms.

Think about whether you want to have another child, and when.,
Consider trying a method you didn’t use before.,
Don’t wait for your period to use birth control.",How to Go on Birth Control After Having a Baby1," Talk to your doctor or midwife about how to prevent pregnancy after you deliver your baby. Ideally, develop a plan before you leave the hospital post-delivery. Whether or not you decide to breastfeed will affect your options, and you’ll have to consider the changes your body just went through.Your doctor can help you with these questions.
, Whether or not you want your family to grow larger, and when you might want to have another child, will influence your choice of birth control. If you feel like you want to get pregnant again soon, then barrier methods or some hormonal methods will be good options, whereas you’ll want to avoid methods that affect your fertility for longer such as Depo-Provera. If your family has finished growing, you may opt for surgical sterilization.

Nothing has to be set in stone, but having an idea about your future family plans can help you choose the best birth control method now.

, The birth control method you used before giving birth may or may not be the best method for you now. With the changes your body and hormones are going through, you may opt for using a different method.

It may be harder to remember to take a pill every day now that you have a new baby
You shouldn’t use an estrogen-based method if you’re breastfeeding.

, Ovulation happens two weeks before you menstruate, which means you can get pregnant two weeks before you get your first postpartum period. Don’t wait to start using birth control – use some method of protection as soon as you start being sexually active again.How long it takes to get your period again varies a lot between women, so predicting it can be hard. It’s better to protect yourself.
If you feel comfortable having sex before you get your period, use a barrier method. Some methods take time to work, or shouldn’t be used until your first postpartum checkup.

, After you have researched consent laws in your state, find a clinic. This can be a doctor's office, the local health department, a school clinic, or a Title X clinic, like Planned Parenthood.


Even if the state law prevents minors from obtaining contraceptives without parental consent at a physician's office, you can go to a Title X clinic to receive confidential reproductive care. This Title X Guarantees List outlines the clinics and offices covered under Title X. Use this list to find a clinic near you.
Call the clinic and ask about your rights as a minor. Remember, you have the right to know and the right to ask.
Make sure to tell your clinic you want the information to remain confidential. This may be an unnecessary step since your information should stay confidential, but double-checking that your information will remain private will give you peace of mind.

, Birth control and clinic visits aren't free. Most minors are on their parents' insurance plans, and if you are trying to keep the birth control a secret, it is not advisable to use their insurance.


Many Planned Parenthood clinics offer reduced rate or free visits for uninsured minors who qualify for no-pay rates.Planned Parenthood also offers free insurance for people who cannot afford it.

, Since many contraceptives are pills or inserted into a female's body, there can be side effects. Being consistent with the contraceptive method is also important to prevent pregnancy.


If you are taking birth control pills, take them as directed. Missing even a single pill puts you at risk for pregnancy. Missing more pills increases that risk.Some contraceptives have side effects. Talk to your doctor or read the literature with your contraceptive to understand these risks.

, Think about if talking to your parents about having sex and getting birth control is a good option. Sometimes teens are so terrified to admit to having or thinking about having sex. They believe they will disappoint their parents, or that their parents will get angry. Think about your parents or guardians - do you truly believe they will have a problem? Or do you think they will be accepting?


One way to figure out how your parents will react is to drop hints. Mention the school's free condoms. Talk to them about a friend's sexual questions and experience. Ask them questions about sex in general. Their reactions can help you figure out if they would be open to your concerns about sex.
Think about how they treat you and your boyfriend or girlfriend. How strict are they? Are they happy or unhappy you have found someone to date? How do they react to the idea of you kissing another person?
If talking to your parents is the right thing for you to do, be honest with them. By choosing to take contraceptives, you are demonstrating that you are being responsible and mature., Birth control pills, also called oral contraceptives, are pills that are ingested orally and contain hormones. When taken correctly, the pill is 99.9% effective in preventing pregnancy.Birth control pills must be taken every day, preferably at the same time.
If you are trying to hide this from your parents, take them at a time when you know you will be alone, like in the morning or at night. If you spend the night elsewhere, make sure you take your pills with you to prevent missing one.
Find a safe, private place to hide your pills. Parents are most likely to check bathroom cabinets, nightstands, and under the mattress. Instead, try something more creative. Put it in a DVD case or an old textbook. Place it in a coin purse, or in the pocket of your purse. Keep it in a sock in your drawer. Make sure the hiding place isn't conspicuous or obvious to a parent who may go snooping.
Even if you don't have insurance, most birth control prescriptions range from $15-$50.Ask your doctor for a free trial. They might give you for up to three months free.
Oral contraceptives do not prevent STDs. This is extremely important to remember. Just because you are preventing yourself from getting pregnant does not mean you are protected from STDs and HIV.

, An IUD, an intrauterine device, is a small T-shaped plastic device inserted into the uterus. IUD's must be inserted by a health care professional.They are extremely successful in preventing pregnancies.


IUDs can be hidden from your parents. The only person who will know you have an IUD is your partner.IUDs are long-term contraceptives. They can last between 5-12 years. They are removable, but it is not recommended to remove them on a whim. Choosing an IUD is a serious commitment.
The price of an IUD varies. They range from $0-1000. Talk to your health care provider to make sure this is the right choice for you.
IUDs do not prevent STDs or HIV.

, If pills require too much dedication, and an IUD is too much of a commitment, try one of these other methods. They might be a better choice for your needs.


The patch is placed on your arm once a week for three weeks. During the fourth week, no patch is applied. A prescription is required for this method.The patch may not be the best method if you are trying to hide from your parents. If the part of the skin is seen by your parents, they might ask questions or find out. If you are serious about keeping your birth control a secret from your parents, the patch is probably the last option you should choose.
The birth control shot is an injection method. Hormones are injected into the arm, and the effects last for three months. This is an extremely effective method, as long as you consistently get your shot every three months.This is the most private birth control method. Parents nor your partner will know you have gotten the shot unless you tell them.The birth control ring is a ring inserted into the vagina. The ring remains inside for three weeks, and then removed for one week.The ring is safe and effective, and obtained with a prescription. Your parents won't find the ring while you are wearing it. As long as you keep the refill hidden, and dispose of the old ring and the box for the new one privately, your parents won't find out. However, your partner will know you have a ring.
The cost of these methods range from $0-80.
None of these methods prevent STDs or HIV.

, One of the easiest birth control methods is a condom. Condoms come in both male and female varieties, and can be found at most major retailers. If you are too embarrassed to buy condoms in a store, or fear parents finding out, most health clinics provide them for free, as do some school clinics.


Make sure to hide the condoms in a safe, inconspicuous place. Keep them in a DVD case, an old book, in a sock in your drawer, or in a change purse. Avoid placing condoms in obvious places your parents will look, like your bathroom, under your bed, in your pillowcase, or in your nightstand.
Condoms not only prevent pregnancy, they also protect against STDs and HIV. Even if you are using one of the other birth control methods, you should also use condoms when having sex. Protecting yourself from STDs and HIV is just as important for safe, responsible sex as preventing pregnancy. Condoms protect you and your partner.
Be sure to use condoms correctly to avoid pregnancy or transmitting diseases. Condoms should be put on before any sexual fluids are exchanged. Make sure the condom is properly fitted to avoid breakage. A broken condom can result in accidental pregnancies and an exchange fo STDs.
Use a condom only once. Never reuse a condom. This means you should always have multiple condoms on hand to avoid any irresponsible decisions.
Don't rely on the male partner to provide condoms. Females concerned with safe sex carry their own condoms. Don't let anyone tell you that the two of you should have sex without a condom. Some people believe that sex is less enjoyable with condoms, but sex with a condom is enjoyable. More importantly, it is safe. Take control of your own body and your sexual health - no matter your gender. Protect yourself and practice safe sex.

, No matter which birth control method you use, you will need to go to a clinic. This comes with the possibility of your parents finding out. Use caution when visiting clinics to avoid any questions.


If you can, go to a clinic in another town. If you live in a small town, this might be the only way for people not to talk. The doctor and staff are bound by confidentiality, but other patients in the waiting room and anyone who sees you in the parking lot are not. If you live in a busy city, this may not be a problem. However, you might want to visit a doctor in another neighborhood.
Keep all the paperwork from your visits hidden. Place it in a folder between unrelated papers or put it in a book.
Don't give the doctor your home phone number. If at all possible, give them your cell phone number. You don't want the clinic calling while you're not home and alerting your parents to your visit.
Although you don't have to visit a clinic when buying condoms, you still want to use discretion while buying them. Purchase your condoms in a store where no one will see you. If everyone in your town goes to the major retailer, don't buy them at that store. Someone might see you walking around with a box of condoms and mention it to your parents.

However, they are rarely used perfectly and 21% of women experience a pregnancy in the first year of use. Condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and many other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like herpes or chlamydia when they are used consistently and correctly. This type of birth control does require a responsible partner who is willing to help you prevent an unplanned pregnancy.Websites like http://www.condomfinder.org/find.php can help you find places near you, anywhere in the US, that give out free condoms. Some websites list sites only in a certain area or are for teens only.;
, The services offered by the clinic associated with your local health department will depend upon where you live. It is a good place to find out about your options for getting free birth control.


Some of the clinics will offer you birth control at a reduced price. Other clinics will help you apply for programs that allow you to get free health care like family planning and birth control. Once you are accepted into a program, you can get your free birth control at the clinic. The healthcare workers at the clinic will tell you what methods are available free., The staff that works at a sexual health clinic like Planned Parenthood, your local free clinic, or a clinic for adolescent health can help you get the birth control for free. You could have access to a wide variety of birth control methods such the pill, the patch, an intrauterine device (IUD), or a diaphragm. It depends upon clinic you go to and the state in which you live. You can call your local health department to see There are many programs out there that will help you get birth control for free, but you must sign up to take advantage of the benefits. Adults will have to see what the income requirements are and most minors under the age of 18 will qualify. The staff at your clinic is there to help you through the process.In most states, adolescents are able to consent for themselves for contraception, and do not need a parental consent.
If you are a college or university student, visit your health center. These centers often offer free condoms and sometimes they even offer free birth control pills., After the Affordable Care Act (ACA) went into effect in 2010, some states gained access to funds that would allow them to provide certain individuals with free family planning services and supplies. This plan provides birth control for both women and men.This is a good option if you are uninsured, have a limited income, or have Medicaid. There is no age limit to apply. Each state is different in terms of what services the plan offers. In general, this option does give you access to a variety of birth control methods like an intrauterine device (IUD), a diaphragm, or getting your tubes tied. But, it seems like over-the-counter methods like spermicides and the sponge are covered less often.Unlike private insurance, your partner can be covered to undergo a vasectomy. This is a surgical procedure which involves having his vas deferens cut and tied off to prevent sperm from being released during sexual intercourse., Drug companies like to give healthcare professionals free drug samples to help promote their products. Your healthcare professional may give you some free samples if you tell her you are having trouble paying for birth control.


It cannot hurt to ask for help wherever you receive medical care. You can talk to your doctor in the office or at the clinic. If you have a health center at your school, university, or college, talk to someone there. Your school counsellor may not have access to birth control, but her advice may direct you to the right place to get free birth control.You will not be able to get an unlimited amount of free samples. Pursue other ways of getting free birth control.

, Because this government website is associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), you will be able to find an insurer which will provide you with one type of free birth control from each of the 18 Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved categories. The website can help you find an affordable plan that meets your medical and financial needs. Even if you cannot find a plan, you may qualify for Medicaid. Under ACA, many states expanded their Medicaid services, including providing free birth control. Specifically, some states allow you to get the free birth control from Planned Parenthood even it is not an “officially approved” provider for Medicaid.If you can get private insurance, your options for free birth control are increased. The 18 FDA-approved categories offer you a wide range of birth control methods. This includes being able to use a barrier method, like a diaphragm or a sponge, during sexual intercourse. You could use a hormonal method like birth control pills or a vaginal ring. The use of an implanted device like an intrauterine device (IUD) is another one of your options. You even have access to emergency contraception, like Plan B® and ella®, to stop you from ovulating after unprotected sexual intercourse. If you want a permanent form of birth control, you can choose to undergo a sterilization procedure like having your tubes tied. The best part is that you are offered patient education and counseling to help you figure out which method of birth control is best for you.One difficulty is that this application must be filled out during a specific period of time each year (the annual open enrollment period) unless you qualify for a special enrollment period. This period is the 60 days following certain life events that involve a change in family status (marriage or the birth of a child) or the loss of other health coverage."

Remove the condom correctly.,
Tie the condom off.,
Wrap it up.,
Put it in the garbage.,
Take out the trash.",How to Dispose of a Condom1," A used condom still poses the risk of pregnancy and illness. Don't spill everywhere. You don't want to spend twenty minutes cleaning up, much less eighteen years raising a child.


Remove the condom so that fluids do not spill. If you're not careful, removing a condom will make a big mess, and possibly increase the risk of unwanted pregnancy or infection. Pay attention to what you're doing to avoid mishaps.
For a male condom, remove with the tip pointed down. If you pull off just by the ring of the condom, it can come off inside-out. Pull from the tip, and gently ease the ring off.Condoms with a reservoir tip are specially designed to help retain fluids at the tip of the condom, and they may help during this process.
For a female condom, squeeze and twist the outer ring, so that the fluids do no leak out. Pull the condom out gently. The inner ring of the female condom should help to hold any fluids in.Beyond this initial removal, the process for disposing of both male and female condoms is the same.;
, The same way you tie off a balloon, you should tie off a condom. Make a loop near the opening, and pull the ring of the condom opening through this loop in order to seal it off. This will help to limit odor as well as spillage.

, Put the condom in a piece of tissue or a paper towel. This will help keep your hand clean, as well as keep it from being unsightly in the trash. It will also help to deter bugs.

, There is no better place to put a condom than in the garbage.Everywhere else is likely to cause problems. Save yourself the trouble; put it in the trash.

, For the comfort of guests or those with whom you share living spaces, take the trash out. If you leave a used condom sitting around, it can begin to smell. A used condom can also be quite unpleasant to see unexpectedly. So for discretion's sake, empty out the garbage bin.

Use condoms.,
Get a new diaphragm.,
Be refitted for a cervical cap.,
Choose an IUD.",How to Go on Birth Control After Having a Baby2," If you intend to breastfeed, use birth control that doesn’t contain the hormone estrogen. Condoms can be used as soon as you start having intercourse again. If you are having problems with vaginal dryness (which is normal due to your changing hormones), use a lubricated condom or extra lubricant.Female condoms can also be used when you’re ready to be sexually active again., If you used a diaphragm in the past, you know that they are fitted specifically to your body. Now that your body has changed and the size of your cervix has changed, you need a new diaphragm. You can get refitted at your first postpartum checkup.You should still be refitted even if you delivered by Caesarean section (C-section).

, Like a diaphragm, a cervical cap has to be refitted to your cervix. Cervical caps aren’t as effective at preventing pregnancy after birth as condoms or diaphragms – they have about a 60% success rate. Consider using a backup method if you choose to use a cervical cap., An IUD, or intrauterine device, can be an especially good birth control method after you have a baby. IUDs have to be inserted into your uterus and removed by a doctor. It’s a quick procedure that can be done any time after delivery. You can choose an IUD that also releases hormones, or one that is “barrier only” (hormone-free).Hormone-releasing IUDs have to be changed every year.
Non-hormone IUDs can stay in place for up to a decade, but may cause heavier menstrual bleeding and cramping.

Take oral contraceptives, i.e.,
Try out the ring or patch.,
Opt for a long-term implant.,
Get birth control shots.",How to Go on Birth Control After Having a Baby3," the pill. If you are NOT breastfeeding, you can discuss starting the pill with your OB/GYN at your first postpartum checkup. Discuss with your doctor when you should start taking the pill, because usually you should wait at least 4 weeks from birth, if not until after your first postpartum period (usually 6-10 weeks after delivery).If you like using the pill but want to breastfeed, consider the “mini-pill.” It’s a progestin-only (no estrogen) pill that won’t affect your breast milk. It has to be taken at the same time every day. Ask your doctor – it may still be best to wait about 6 weeks after delivery to start taking it.Some women should not take the pill if they have a high risk of blood clots, and you shouldn’t use tobacco if you take the pill., The NuvaRing is a small ring you insert into your vagina and leave in place every 28 days. The patch, like OrthoEvra, gets applied to your skin weekly. Both of these methods release hormones that prevent pregnancy.These use both progestin and estrogen, so may not be the best choice for breastfeeding mothers. Some feel that the patch and ring are still a safe choice once your baby is 6 weeks old, even if you’re breastfeeding., Consider getting a long-term birth control method started before you leave the hospital, like the birth control implant. Norplant is a small rod that’s surgically inserted under the skin of your arm and lasts for up to 5 years. It’s progestin-only and doesn’t contain estrogen, so won’t interfere with breastfeeding.These have a high success rate of preventing pregnancy – over 99%. You might get side effects like headaches or breakthrough bleeding.
You can get the implant in the hospital right after you give birth, or you can wait until you get your first period (using a backup method in the meantime). Some doctors suggest waiting at least 3 weeks for the implant; ask your healthcare professional for advice., You can get a Depo-Provera injection before you leave the hospital with your baby, and then continue to get them every 3 months. The shot is also over 99% effective, though consider when you want to have another child – it may take a while to be able to get pregnant again once you stop getting the injections.You might gain some weight while taking the shots.

Use the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) carefully.,
Try the Rhythm Method only after your period returns.,
Don’t rely on the withdrawal method.",How to Go on Birth Control After Having a Baby4," Using breastfeeding as a form of birth control (the LAM) can be effective if it’s done correctly. As long as you meet three requirements, then breastfeeding your baby suppresses your fertility and prevents pregnancy. Breastfeeding alone does not prevent pregnancy – you must meet the additional criteria in order to be protected, and as soon as one of your criteria changes you need to use alternate birth control. You can rely on breastfeeding as a birth control method if you fit into all three of these categories:You have not had a period since you gave birth.
Your baby is under 6 months old.
You nurse on demand at least every four hours during the day and every six hours at night, so that your baby gets all or most of its nutrition from breastfeeding.

, The rhythm method, also called the timing method or fertility awareness method, requires that you have a detailed understanding of your fertility cycle. This is usually done by measuring the length of your cycle and recognizing signs of ovulation like changes in your cervical mucus and basal body temperature. Because these body functions can be in disarray for several weeks after you have a baby, don’t attempt this method until you start having regular menstrual cycles again.You can try this method if you don’t want to use hormonal or physical methods of birth control, but it’s only about 75% effective. If you opt for this method, get instructions from your OB/GYN about how to do it correctly.

, The success rate of withdrawal, or “pulling out,” is low. This method requires proper timing and self-restraint, and as many as 28 out of 100 women still get pregnant if they practice this method for a year.For better protection against pregnancy, use a different method."

Check your plan to see what all your free options are.,
Use your parents' health insurance.,
Consider changing your birth control.,
Make your doctor your advocate.,
Look for changes in approved in-network providers.,
Get a prescription for your over-the-counter birth control.,
Change your insurance carrier if it no longer works for you.",How to Get Free Birth Control2," Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), most insurance companies must provide a woman with one type of free birth control from each of the 18 Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved categories.When you call member services, the representative you are talking to may not know all of your options. Do not stop until you have a list of all your free options.
The 18 FDA-approved categories offer you a wide range of birth control methods. This includes being able to use a barrier method, like a diaphragm or a sponge, during sexual intercourse. You could use a hormonal method like birth control pills or a vaginal ring. The use of an implanted device like an intrauterine device (IUD) is another one of your options. You even have access to emergency contraception, like Plan B® and ella®, to stop you from ovulating after unprotected sexual intercourse. If you want a permanent form of birth control, you can choose to undergo a sterilization procedure like having your tubes tied. The best part is that you are offered patient education and counseling to help you figure out which method of birth control is best for you., Even if you are younger than 18, the rules and regulations under ACA apply to you. But, it will be hard to prevent your parents from becoming part of the conversation if you use their insurance.


You have a right to free birth control because of ACA. You can go to a doctor, talk to her about the different birth control methods, and get a prescription. She cannot discuss any of this with your parents. Your parents could find out because the insurance company must provide your parents with documentation of how their benefits are being used. Consider visiting a free clinic if you want complete confidentiality. Remember it is a good thing to involve a responsible adult in this important decision process.

, You may be able to get free birth control if you change to the generic form of your present birth control. After talking to your doctor, you may find that free birth control in a different FDA category actually would suit you better.Your doctor can help you make this important decision and the counselling is free because of ACA. You may try the generic form and see that it works just as well as your favorite brand-name birth control pill. If you do not like the free generic birth control pill, you may find that you actually like the equally effective and more convenient implanted device. Your insurer decides which birth control it will offer free in each category, but you can choose to fully explore your options.

, You may have a bad reaction if you do not use a specific brand-name birth control. Your doctor can make an official appeal to your insurer to have this brand provided to you free of cost.The Department of Labor makes it clear that you can be charged a copay for a brand-name drug or device when an equivalent generic is available. If a generic version is not available or your doctor determines that the generic form would not be medically appropriate for you, your plan or issuer must provide you with the brand-name drug or device without charge to you.In this situation, you cannot be forced to use a free birth-control method from another FDA-approved category.

, Your insurance company can charge a copay if you do not use an approved pharmacy to fill your prescription or an approved healthcare provider to perform a birth control procedure like inserting an IUD. Your insurer may not fulfill its responsibility to inform you of the changes in a timely fashion.For example, your insurer can start charging a copay on a previously free form of birth control if it now wants you purchase it from a home-delivery pharmacy instead of your local pharmacy like you had in the past., Insurance carriers require that you have a prescription for whatever type of birth control you are using. This includes over-the-counter birth control like spermicides (kills sperm), sponges, and emergency contraception like Plan B.This requirement is actually helpful to you. Patient education and counseling for birth control is covered by your plan free of cost. You can ask your healthcare provider questions about other forms of birth control available to you. You can chose to stick with the over-the-counter form of birth control or change to another type which suits your needs better.

, You have a right to free birth control because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, some plans do not have to provide you with free birth control and others may not have to provide this coverage until a few years from now.


You must decide if the money you will save by using free birth control is worth the cost and effort of having to buy your own insurance.
Under ACA, some insurance plans are grandfathered if the plan was purchased before March 23, 2010. They do not have to follow ACA rules and regulations or offer the same benefits. So, your plan could offer some types or no types of birth control for free. At some point, these plans will have to provide you with one free method of birth control in each of the 18 FDA-approved categories, but you may not be willing or able to wait.If your employer is a house of worship, your plan is not required to cover free birth control. You will have to pay for your birth control. For all other religious employers, you are provided free birth control coverage through a third party. The information on this third party carrier must be made available to you."

Do not recycle condoms.",How to Dispose of a Condom2," Condoms are most commonly made from latex, polyurethane, nitrile, polyisoprene, or lambskin.Each has advantages and disadvantages. All should be disposed of in the same way. They go in the garbage. With condoms, there's no real way to avoid the landfill. Get a biodegradable latex condom or lambskin condom if you're worried about the earth.Latex condoms are the most common. They are durable and inexpensive when compared to other condoms. However, some people are allergic to latex condoms.
Polyurethane is stronger than latex, and can be made thinner. They are a suitable replacement for people with latex allergies. However, they are more brittle and expensive than latex condoms.
Nitrile feels a bit like latex, and is relatively inexpensive. This material works very well for female condoms.
Polyisoprene is a relatively new material. It is made by putting latex rubber through a process to remove allergens. It is expensive, but it is still, though rare, possible to be allergic to it.
Lambskin condoms are able to prevent pregnancy, but not HIV. Natural membrane condoms are not proper protection from sexually transmitted infections. Those seeking to prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases should choose a latex, polyurethane, nitrile, or polyisoprene condom., You will need to hire a professional to fix it. That can be expensive and potentially embarrassing.

, This is littering. It is also a bio-hazard. A pet could bring it back inside, or try to eat it, causing health problems. Young children might play with it and become sick.

, They will take a very long time to breakdown.Composting condoms can also attract animals. Not only are wild animals hazardous, the condom, if ingested, can cause the animals harm. Even pets may be drawn to it. Though some condoms are biodegradable, and can theoretically be composted, the potential problems created by using condoms for compost makes them unsuitable for most situations.

, Unfortunately, the foil wrappers around condoms are not recyclable.It will need to go into the trash with the condom.

, They cannot be reused or recycled. Though there are people developing tools to do so, the technology isn't quite there yet."

Avoid condoms that contain spermicide and go for non-lubricated condoms to prevent an allergic reaction., If you are buying male condoms, or using them yourself, you may want to go for condoms in regular size to start. Regular sized condoms are good option, unless your friends specify they would like a specific size.


If you want to be sure the condoms will fit properly, you may want to have your friends measure themselves to determine their condom size. Using condoms that are the right size will make sex more enjoyable and help to prevent the condom from slipping off during sex.Condoms usually come in small, regular, large, and extra large sizes. The sizing is based on the length and width of your penis.

Small is 1.75” width x 6.3” long (4.45 cm x 16 cm)
Regular is 2.0” width x 7.9” long (5.08 cm x 20 cm)
Large is 2.12” width x 7.9” long (5.38 cm x 20 cm)
Extra large is 2.25” width x 8.1” long (5.71 cm x 21 cm)



, You should put a condom on your penis before you have sex. Do this once your penis is erect. Tear the packet of the condom and take it out carefully. Do not tear or rip the condom itself.Check that the condom is unrolling the right side out. If you have foreskin, pull it back. Place the condom on the top of your penis. If there is a teat on the end of the condom, squeeze the air out of it using your thumb and forefinger.
Carefully unroll the condom all the way to the base of your penis. Once the condom is secure on your penis, you can enter your partner.
If the condom won’t roll down, it is probably inside out. You should take it off, throw it away, and try again with a new condom. This will ensure there is no sperm on the condom when you use it.

, If you are using a female condom, you should insert it into your vagina or your anus before you have sex. The condom will be tube-shaped, with a flexible ring on each end. You will place the inner ring at the closed end into your vagina or anus and let the outer ring at the open end sit outside your vagina or anus.Your partner’s penis will then be inserted into the open end of the condom, creating a barrier between your vagina or anus and their sperm.
You should only use a male condom or a female condom when having sex. Using both condoms at the same time can lead to friction and rubbing, which could then cause the condoms to break.
Female condoms are not as readily available and are used less often, but they are a viable option.

, Lubricant can help to prevent condoms from breaking during sex. It can also prevent irritation caused by skin-on-skin friction during sex. Only use water-based lubricants that are advertised for use during sex. Often, you can find these lubricants in the same aisle or area as condoms.Do not use oil-based lubricants like Vaseline, baby oil, body lotion, or vegetable oils. These oils will weaken the condom and can lead to breakage.
The pharmacy may be the best place to buy lubrication, but adult bookstores have a variety of lubricants, and some of these lubricants are more enjoyable.

, Once you have had sex, you should remove the condom right away. Only use the condom once and use a new condom when/if you have sex again.If you are using a male condom, withdraw the penis while it is still erect. Hold the condom at the base of your penis and then carefully pull the condom off. Do not to spill any of the semen or allow your penis to touch your partner’s genital area.
If you are using a female condom, you should carefully slide out the inner ring of the condom from your vagina. Remove the condom from your genital area, making sure none of the semen spills out on you or your partner.Always throw condoms away in the garbage. Do not flush condoms down the toilet.

, You should always store condoms in a spot away from heat or moisture. Make sure the condoms are properly sealed and wrapped in the box. You may place the condoms in an easy to reach place so you can locate them before having sex, such as in a drawer by your bed.Make sure you check the expiration date on the condoms before you use them, as you should not use expired condoms.

, Sometimes a condom breaks, it slips off, or it does not work properly. If this happens, you should take steps to protect yourself and your partner from STDs and from an unwanted pregnancy.The female partner can take the Plan B pill, a progestin hormone that you can get over-the-counter. This pill can act as emergency contraception and help to prevent unwanted pregnancy. It should be taken as soon as you realize the condom did not work properly or up to five days after having sex.You and your partner should also be tested for STDs. Make sure you have a clean bill of health before you have sex again to prevent the spread of STDs.
Talk to your doctor about Plan B and about STD’s. Condoms do not protect from all STD’s, but they are the best option.

Prepare for the surgery.,
Perform proper after-care.",How to Get a Vasectomy," The vasectomy is a simple surgery that will cut the tubes carrying sperm to be mixed with semen. It has been proven effective as a method of birth control for males and the vasectomy is usually an outpatient procedure, using only a localized anesthetic.Vasectomies are considered permanent. Although some may be reversible, there are no guarantees. Some people save a sample of sperm just in case they would like to fertilize an egg in the future.
Make sure you understand that you will likely never have children in the future after your vasectomy.
Vasectomies have a low risk of complications.
You will still need to practice safe and protected sex, as a vasectomy will not protect you against any sexually transmitted infections.
Full recovery takes, on average, a week.;
, The main vasectomy technique in use today is known as “percutaneous no-scalpel vasectomy”. All vasectomy procedures will target the same area, tubes known as the vas deferens. These tubes will be located, exposed, cut, tied, and then secured inside the scrotum to heal. You can expect the entire procedure to take around thirty minutes.Your doctor will first apply a localized anaesthetic. This will numb the area and eliminate any pain.
The vas deferens are then located by your doctor. This is a simple step which your doctor is able to find the vas deferens simply by feeling for them.
A small and specialized tool is used next to make a hole in the skin of the scrotum. This hole will allow your doctor to access the vas deferens directly.
The vas deferens, once exposed, will be cut and then tied. By cutting and tying these tubes, sperm are prevented from leaving the body, eliminating the chances of reproducing.
Modern techniques cause very little bleeding and no stitches should be required.

, While most vasectomies are performed without problem, certain risks do exist. To make a fully informed decision about getting a vasectomy, you should understand these risks before scheduling your appointment.Side effects that can occur immediately after the surgery:

Bleeding. Blood may appear in semen, at the site of your vasectomy, or a blood clot may form inside the scrotum.
Bruising or swelling at the site of the surgery.
Discomfort or mild pain.
Infection, as with any surgery, is a possibility.


Long term complications that may occur are:

Chronic pain, which is rare, may occur after your vasectomy.
Fluid build-up, or inflammation resulting from leaking sperm.
Pregnancy, in the rare case that the vasectomy failed.



, If you are in a relationship, and are planning on getting a vasectomy, discuss this with your partner. Ultimately the choice will be your own, however, since this decision impacts both parties, it's best to reach the decision together.

, When you schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your vasectomy, you should come prepared with certain facts about your own medical history. Keeping your doctor informed will help determine if the procedure will be safe and effective for you. Talk to your doctor about the following issues:Any history with excessive bleeding or blood disorders. As this is a surgery, any issues with blood loss need to be discussed.
If you have any allergies, specifically to anaesthetics. Anaesthetics will be used during the vasectomy, and your doctor will need to know if you are unable to receive them.
Inform your doctor if you have any skin diseases, especially on or around the scrotum.
If you regularly use aspirin or any other medication that thins the blood.
Any previous injury, surgery, or any current or repeat infections of the male genitalia or urinary tract.

, At least a week before your vasectomy you will want to start taking steps to prepare. Taking these steps will help make your surgery be a successful and easy one.Stop taking any any medication that might thin the blood, which includes aspirin, warfarin, heparin and ibuprofen.
Trim body hair and clean the area that will be worked on.
Find a pair of tight or supporting underwear to bring with you on the day of your surgery. This will help minimize swelling and support the area after the surgery.
Find someone to drive you home from the surgery. This is to minimize aggravating the areas affected by the vasectomy.

, After your surgery, you will need to practice proper after-care techniques. Plan to rest for two to three days. Although modern vasectomy techniques cause minimal discomfort, there are some things you can do to speed along the healing process.If you develop a fever or signs of infection, seek medical help immediately.
Support the scrotum, either using a bandage or supportive underwear, for 48 hours.
Keep the area cool by using ice packs for the first 48 hours. This helps reduce swelling or inflammation.
Avoid physical activity for at least one day after the surgery. Too much activity can cause injury and bleeding in the scrotum.
Avoid bathing or swimming for, at minimum, one day after the surgery.
Avoid heaving lifting for seven days.
Wait seven days to have sex. If you engage in sexual intercourse before a week has passed, you may notice pain and blood in your ejaculate.
You also still may have viable sperm in your semen, which can result in pregnancy. Because the tubes still have sperm in them a man needs to ejaculate 20 time before birth control is effective. Continue use of birth control until your doctor has confirmed that your vasectomy has been successful.
Follow up includes a sperm count 3-4 months after the procedure to check and see how many sperm the man has in his sample. The couple can then stop short term birth control.
The vasectomy can sometimes be reversed, but this does not always work.

Start with condoms.,
Contact your health department.,
Visit your health center on campus.,
Apply for The Family Planning Benefit Plan.,
Try to get free samples.",How to Get Birth Control1," Condoms can be obtained for free at health clinics, in university dorms, and various kinds of health centers.Best of all, you do not need a prescription from a doctor.


Condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time (when used correctly). Condoms are also effective at preventing transmission of HIV and many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Websites like http://www.condomfinder.org/find.php can help you find locations near you, that distribute free condoms (in the US only).;
, Depending on where you live, your local health department may have a clinic that offers free or sliding scale services. Some clinics are able to offer birth control at a reduced price, while other clinics can help you apply for programs that provide free health care (including birth control).Some states also offer free forms of permanent sterilization (vasectomy or tubal ligation) for low-income citizens. Keep in mind that these are permanent and non-reversible, so this should only be considered if your family is complete and you are certain you don't want more children.

, Health centers on college campuses often offer free condoms for students. They may even offer free birth control pills (or other forms of contraception) for students. If you are a college student, speak to a doctor or nurse at your student health clinic to discuss which forms of birth control are available through student health insurance, or for free from the health center., Thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many states are able to provide free birth control to qualifying women and men. If you are uninsured, have a limited income, or qualify for Medicaid, this is a great option for you. Each state is different in terms of what services the plan offers.
In many states, this option provides access to a variety of birth control methods, such as an intrauterine device (IUD), a diaphragm, or permanent options like a tubal or vasectomy.
Over-the-counter methods like spermicides and the sponge are covered less often.Speak to someone at your local health department, or visit the ACA website to apply: https://www.healthcare.gov/


, Pharmaceutical companies sometimes provide doctors and healthcare providers with free samples. If you explain your financial issues to your doctor, they may be able to offer you some free samples to try.


You can talk to your doctor in the office or at the clinic.
If you have a health center at your school, university, or college, talk to someone there. You will only be able to get a limited amount of free samples. Use this method in the short term while you pursue other ways to get birth control.

Consider why you need removal.,
Make an appointment.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Use other forms of birth control.,
Get a pre-procedure examination.,
Have the IUD removed.,
Deal with a difficult removal.,
Recognize normal side effects.,
Get another IUD implanted if desired.",How to Get an IUD Taken Out," There are multiple reasons why you might want or need to remove your IUD. You should get your IUD removed if you want to become pregnant, if you have started going through menopause, or you want to start using an alternative birth control method. You may also need to remove your IUD if the expiration date on the device is up, if it failed and you have become pregnant, you caught a sexually transmitted disease, or you need to have a procedure that requires its removal.


On rare occasions, you may need to remove your IUD because of reactions to the device, such as abnormal bleeding, excessive pain, or heavy or exceedingly long menstruation.
The expiration date on hormonal IUDs is 5 years. Copper IUDs can be left in for 10 years.;
, Once you know the reason you need removal, you should contact your gynecologist's office to schedule an appointment. Let them know why you need the appointment because you may need a consultation visit first.


You may also be able to go ahead and schedule your procedure as well.

, Either over the phone or during your consultation visit, you should discuss your IUD removal with your doctor. Let her know the reason that you need or want to remove your IUD. If for some reason your need for removal is unfounded, she will let you know and can discuss any reservations you have about keeping your IUD.


It is best to be completely honest with your doctor so she can help you make the best choice for you., If you are taking out your IUD in order to start another form of birth control, because of a procedure, or due to an STD, you should start another form of birth control a week prior to your IUD removal. If you have unprotected sex in the weeks leading up to your removal, you may be able to get pregnant after it is removed, even if you don't have unprotected sex after it is removed. This is because sperm can live up to 5 days inside of you.You could also abstain from sex for the week or weeks leading up to your IUD removal if you don't have access to an alternative form of birth control.

, When you get to the doctor's office, she will check for the location of your IUD device. She will locate it by inserting her fingers into your vaginal canal and placing her other hand on your abdomen or by using a speculum. She will then feel around to see if the IUD is still at the top of your cervix.


She may also use a hysteroscope, which is thin tube that has a light and camera lens on the end of it.
This pre-examination also checks for excessive tenderness or physiological changes that might prevent your IUD from being removed.
In rare cases, it may be necessary to have an ultrasound or x-ray if your doctor cannot easily find the strings of your IUD. These are used to make sure that the IUD has not shifted into your abdomen or your pelvis., To get your IUD out, your doctor will first insert a speculum, which is a tool used to widen your vagina in order to see your cervix better.Now that the IUD can clearly be seen, your doctor will insert ring forceps to grasp the strings of your IUD. She will gently pull on the strings and the IUD will come out.The arms of the IUD fold outward, so they will not hurt too much coming out., It is possible for your IUD to have shifted, for the strings to be in a difficult area, or for the IUD to become embedded in your cervix. If your doctor tries to remove your IUD and it won't move, she may use a cytobrush, which is a small brush that looks like an mascara applicator. The cytobrush is inserted, twisted, and then pulled out again, grabbing the retracted or stubborn strings of the IUD and pulling out the device.


If this doesn't work either, she may use a IUD hook, which is a thin, metal instrument that is hooked on one end. This method may take several passes to work, depending on how your IUD has shifted. Your doctor will insert the hook and pull it out. If she didn't grab onto the IUD, she will then continue to insert the hook again until it has tried to grab the IUD on all sides.
Outpatient surgery to remove the device is a last resort that may become necessary if the IUD cannot be removed by any other means.Sometimes a small camera (hysteroscope) is used to find an IUD if the strings cannot be found. This is usually done in the office.

, The only common side effects of IUD removal are cramping and minimal bleeding after the device it taken out. These effects should only last a short while before they stop all together.


In some rare instances, you may have more severe reactions, which may be due to an underlying health issue. Call your doctor immediately if you have severe cramps, pain or tenderness in your abdomen, a fever, chills, or unexplained vaginal bleeding or discharge., If you are just changing your IUD because it expired, you can get another one inserted immediately. Talk this over with your doctor before the procedure so she can plan for the insertion of the new device. You may experience some mild discomfort or slight bleeding.


There will be no interruption of the contraceptive abilities of the IUD if you have immediate reinsertion."

, Dandies are quite flamboyant in their fashion. Wear romantic clothing with a fashionable touch and develop your own style. Look into the history books (or Google if you wish) and find images of what dandies used to look like - both in the 19th century and the 80's. You can also read books and watch movies that have a more romantic image. Pick and choose what you like from history, art and, of course, your own imagination. Only you set the limits to your own dandy-ness.

, Dandies set no limits to personal hygiene. There is absolutely nothing wrong with perfume - pick and choose from both the men and female fragrances.

, The point is that you must take care of your hair. Never once will you see a dandy without good hair, and many of them will have grown their hair long.

, Yes, you must. At least a little bit. Find your personal style and determine how far you want to go with it.

, You must not only dress the part; the way you speak is a great part of your personality. Be confident, yet refined in your language, and find your own personal style. An English accent is wonderful, if you can pull it off.

,, Big issues like politics, economy and such should always be discussed with a smile and some emotional detachment, but when it comes to your love-life, fashion and other less important things, be dead serious and slightly more emotional.

Get spermicide.",How to Get Birth Control2," Male condoms are worn on the penis during sex, or female condoms are worn inside the vagina. Condoms are the easiest form of birth control to obtain, and they are the only one that also protects against sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms are considered a ""barrier method"" of contraception, meaning they stop sperm.Condoms can be purchased at pharmacies, gas stations, and other retailers.
Condoms can be purchased for around $1 each (sold in packages of varying sizes).
Check with local family planning clinics and community health centers about obtaining free condoms.
Condoms can be used in conjunction with any other form of birth control for additional protection.
You may also try “female condoms” which are worn inside the vagina.

, Also considered a barrier method, the sponge is used by women who want to prevent pregnancy without prescriptions or hormones.Contraceptive sponges can be purchased at most pharmacies.
They cost around $15 for a package of 3.

, Spermicide is a gel or foam that stops sperm from moving. Often it comes in the form of “spermicidal lubricant.” Spermicide is commonly used with other forms of birth control, such as condoms, although some people choose to use it on its own.Spermicide can be purchased at most pharmacies.
It costs about $8 per package.

If you do not already have a gynecologist (or a family doctor who can perform this service), search for a Planned Parenthood or women’s health clinic in your area, and make an appointment.


In some states (such as Utah and Mississippi), you must be 18 to obtain prescription birth control without parental consent. In most other states, if you are under the age of 18 and you understand the risks and benefits of birth control, you do not need your parents' permission.To check the laws in your state, check out this interactive map.

, Health insurance is not required to obtain prescription birth control, but it can significantly lessen the cost. If you already have health insurance, call your company to determine what they will pay toward your birth control, as well as which methods are covered. If you do not have health insurance, you may consider purchasing private health insurance, obtaining health insurance through the ACA, or applying for public insurance (Medicaid).

, Birth control pills are a medication that is taken orally at the same time every day in order to prevent pregnancy. The pill releases hormones (usually estrogen and progestin) that stop ovulation from occurring, which means there is no egg released to be fertilized by sperm.There are many different pills on the market. Your doctor can help you decide which one is best for your, based on a variety of health factors.


To maximize the benefit of birth control pills and keep your hormone levels stable, it is important that you take it at the same time every day. Set a reminder on your phone or make it part of your daily routine.
The pill can have some minor effects, including breast tenderness, spotting (bleeding between periods), and nausea. The pill can also increase your risk of blood clots, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and some other serious conditions, though they rarely occur. It is important that you do not smoke while taking the pill, as this increases your risk for serious side effects.
Some health clinics will be able to fill your prescription for you.
Otherwise, you can fill it at your local pharmacy.
Your doctor should provide enough refills to get you through a few months or a full year.
Without insurance, birth control pills can cost up to $250 per month.

, Depo-Provera, also called “the shot,” is a hormonal birth control shot administered in the arm every three months. The appeal of this method is that you will not have to remember to take birth control every day, or insert a barrier every time you have sex.The shot is a progesterone birth control, which can have some side effects. You may experience irregular bleeding for the first six to 12 months. Your period may become heavier, or it may become lighter and stop completely. You may also experience less common side effects, including weight gain, depression, change in sex drive, nausea, or headache.Without insurance, the shot can cost up to $100 per injection.

, “The patch,” also called Ortho Evra, is a hormonal birth control patch that you affix to your skin. It uses the same hormones found in the pill — estrogen and progestin to prevent ovulation and thicken your cervical mucus, which can prevent sperm from swimming to the eggs. You use a total of three patches per month (one per week, and the fourth week you do not wear one). The patch is an effective form of birth control that doesn’t involve taking a daily pill.In the first two to three months, you may experience side effects such as nausea, breast tenderness, and spotting.The patch, like the pill, can also increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart attack. It is important that you do not smoke while using the patch.
Some evidence indicates that the patch may not be as effective in women weighing over 200 lbs, so overweight women should consult their doctor about this option.
Some health clinics will be able to fill your prescription for you. Otherwise, you can fill it at your local pharmacy.
Without insurance, the patch can cost up to $80 per month.

, A vaginal ring, or “NuvaRing,” is a small, flexible, plastic ring (containing hormones) that you insert inside your vagina, like a tampon. Like the patch, you use three rings for a month (one ring each week, and the fourth week you do not use one). The ring releases the hormones estrogen and progestin, like the patch and the pill, and also prevents ovulation. This an effective method of birth control that you do not need to act on daily.The ring has similar side effects as the pill and patch, such as spotting, breast tenderness, and nausea. It may also cause increased vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, or infection and may affect your sex drive. Serious, though rare, side effects include heat attack, stroke, blood clots, high blood pressure, jaundice, and more. Again, do not smoke while using the ring.
Some health clinics will be able to fill your prescription for you. Otherwise, you can fill it at your local pharmacy.
Without insurance, NuvaRing can cost up to $80 per month.

, An IUD, or inter-uterine device, is a small T-shaped device inserted into the uterus. There are four types of IUDs on the market, and these are divided into two types: copper IUDs (ParaGard) and hormonal IUDs (Liletta, Mirena, and Skyla). The ParaGard uses copper (which sperm hate) to prevent pregnancy and can be used for up to 10 years. Hormonal IUDs use hormones to prevent pregnancy and can be used from three to five years, depending on the brand.


Discuss with your doctor which type of IUD you should get. You may experience pain when the IUD is inserted and for a few days after, as well as cramping. In the first three to six months you may also experience spotting, irregular periods, or heavier periods and worse cramps.Rarely, the IUD may come out (fully or partially), you may get an infection, or, in some very rare cases, the IUD may push through the wall of the uterus and need to be removed surgically.Without insurance IUDs may cost up to $1,000.

, Your doctor can place birth control under your skin in the form of a hormonal implant (a matchstick-sized rod placed under your skin). The most popular brands are Implanon and Nexplanon.A common side effect of this is irregular bleeding, which is also the most common reason it is removed early.
Without insurance, this implant can cost up to $800.
This implant lasts up to four years.

, Diaphragms and cervical caps are both barrier methods that block sperm from entering your cervix. These come in different sizes, so you must be fitted by a doctor. Both diaphragms and cervical caps are used in conjunction with spermicide.The cervical cap cannot be used during your period and it may be moved out of place by certain sexual positions, some penis sizes, or heavy thrusting.Without insurance, a diaphragm or cervical cap can cost around $75, and can be used for up to two years.

Ella emergency contraception always requires a prescription.
Some health care clinics (such as Planned Parenthood) will have emergency contraception available for purchase without a prescription.

, Emergency contraception is most effective the sooner it is taken. When taken within 24 hours from the time of unprotected sex, Plan B is 95% effective. When taken within 72 hours, Plan B is 89% effective. You can take it up to five days (120 hours) after sex, but it loses effectiveness each day.ella (prescription emergency contraception) can also be taken up to five days after unprotected sex, and it works just as well on day five as it does on day 1."

Act smart.",How to Act Like Elle Woods from Legally Blonde," When talking, try to have a high voice, but not so high that it sounds fake. Get a nice girly voice you can stick with and not something what you have to stress over all day trying to keep it in tune. If your voice is naturally low, be especially careful to make the changes gradually and slowly because it's very easy to seem creepy and fake, which doesn't describe Elle at all. Practice in the mirror or even sing more, singing will help tremendously.;
, It is easy to see that the key to acting like Elle is to talk like her. You need to talk with proper grammar, and in a more informal, popular manner at the same time. Greet a few of the people you meet, because it shows your confidence and kindness. It makes people want to talk to you more as well. But in fancy settings, it'd be best to use more formal language. Increasing your vocabulary helps, too, because it makes you sound smarter.

, You need a signature colour. It doesn't matter if it is pink, blue, or even gray. Always dress the part. If you're going someplace serious dress for it. If you're going to the gym dress for it. Whatever it is, show it off. Wear clothes that are appropriate for the occasion, but still reflect who you are.

, Not too big, nor to small. Use whatever style suits you. They block UV rays and show off the shape of your face more, try on different ones to see what looks best on you.

, If it is a pearl bracelet or diamond ring, it will look good on you, and make your outfit look complete. Also, it's better to invest in a few timeless, nice pieces of jewelry than have a bunch of tacky stuff.

, Elle is a vegetarian. That means no meat. If you want to go vegetarian, do this gradually because it may be hard to give up meat altogether for some people. Also, you always see Elle drinking Evian, so drink plenty of water. Water will also keep your skin clear.

, Elle is very physically fit. Try to get some exercise equipment. But, exercise regularly. If possible, get a gym membership and if you're at college, odds are there's free equipment to use, so take advantage of it. Take the stairs, walk to class (if possible) and squeeze in a run to get even more exercise in.

, Before any make-up, put some cream on your face, just in case you get spots. All you really need is mascara, blush, and lipstick or lip gloss. If you're going out somewhere, then maybe add some eye-shadow and foundation. Always remember to wash your face after because leaving makeup on not only can cause acne, but ages you faster. Yikes!

, Have a shower or bath every day. Make sure you wash your hair every other day with shampoo. Do not forget to wash your whole body too. Keep your pores cleared, feet smooth, smelling fresh, hands moisturized, and manicured. If you have one or two zits, don't worry about it, we all get them. However, see a dermatologist if your acne is severe, painful or not going away after a few weeks.

, Your hair should always be clean. This means totally dandruff free. Also, dye your hair warm blonde. If you can't, try to get warm blonde highlights. Ask your hairdresser if your hair is cut in layers. After washing your hair, always dry it upside down. Don't bother straightening it once it's dry. This technique is called feathering your hair.

, You really need to hang round with girls who are just as kind as you. But, make sure that they are both popular and girly. If you can't find the right group then just make your own! It should be at least three girls, and then make friends with other popular people while still hanging round with your own clique.

, Hand in all your homework on time and scent it with your signature perfume. Also, make sure you have all your stuff with you for your lessons.

, Elle's is pink, but yours can be any color you want it to be!

,, Elle's special place is a manicure and pedicure shop, but yours can be anywhere. Even a homemade spa! Take one day a week, preferably Sunday, to pamper yourself.

, That's why everyone loves Elle. She's never rude and is always nice to everyone.

,!

, Even if they're mean to you, don't stoop to their level and be mean back, Elle would never try to hurt anyone.

, Elle has beautiful features, yet still she wears sophisticated clothes and never has her boobs out. Look at magazines for ways to accentuate (or hide) features without revealing too much flesh. An older sister, friend or a person working at your favorite clothing store can help you with this.

, Keep your clothes as appropriate to the occasion as possible, but it's better to be too dressed up than too casual because you can often tone it down. Being not dressed enough is harder to fix, but you should obviously not go running errands in a prom dress. That's a surefire way to make you feel uncomfortable and conspicuous.

, Just an animal that you can talk to and love.

, It does not have to be in your signature color, but it has to be cute.

, Elle is anything but the stereotypical dumb blonde and is a law student with perfect grades. So study and try to pass your classes and get as high of a GPA as you can. If it's a 4.0, awesome! If not, know you tried your best and will just have to do better next time.

Start incorporating more formal words into your vocabulary.,
Avoid the ""seven deadly sin"" words of royal speech.,
Enunciate properly and avoid slurring.,
Learn how to greet people like royalty.,
Practice proper table manners.,
Be courteous and kind.,
Develop more confidence.,
Develop poise.",How to Act Like Royalty," Men should stand with their feet shoulder length apart, women with one foot slightly in front of the other. Proper posture means a straight spine and your chin slightly lifted. Keep your feet flat on the floor and your knees very slightly bent. Your shoulders should be back, with your ribcage in the center of them. Try to keep your hands out of your pockets. , Sitting for men generally means crossed legs, or both legs straight out and both feet on the ground. Sitting for women means ankles, not legs, crossed. As royal women are usually in dresses, it's therefore important to sit and stand carefully, to avoid an accidental flashing of undergarments.In addition, when sitting, your back should be straight, your shoulder should be back, and your buttocks should touch the back of the chair. Keep your weight evenly distributed on both hips., For royal women, usually found in dresses, getting out of cars requires a little bit of foresight. The process typically goes like this:Scoot yourself toward the edge of the car keeping your ankles and knees together.
Open the door or have the door opened forward. Angle your knees toward the door.
With one hand on the seat in front of you and one on the seat you're in, pull yourself out of the car. Keep your knees together and put one leg out of the car.
Keep your body facing the car door as you place your other leg out of the car. Then once both feet are on the ground, stand up straight and close the door.

, Royal clothing includes fairly simple outfits that favor quality over showiness. For women, that means elegant dresses for more formal affairs, and simple blouses, blazers, and jeans for casual affairs. For formal affairs, men wear suits. Tuxedos are for evening wear. Morning dress for men includes a tail coat, striped trousers, and a collared shirt. Causal wear for men includes blazers and dress shirts, and jeans or light-fabric pants, like cotton trousers. Jewelry can be a great way to add to a women's outfit, but keep it understated and don't pile it on. For example, one or two pieces, like earrings and a simple silver necklace, can add class to a cocktail dress outfit.

, There's a name for the gait that the women in the royal family are taught: The Glide. You start with your weight on your back foot, and your feet about a half-foot length apart. As you walk, your knees should cross over each other, and the moving foot should brush lightly against the heel of the other foot, to make sure your feet are perfectly aligned.Your movement in general should be smooth and not jerky. Slow, precise movement shows confidence and calmness, traits exuded by royalty.

, While it's unrealistic to try to never have a hair out of place, you should still try to be as well groomed and styled as possible in most situations. Find a haircut that is stylish without being over the top, which typically means something classic and timeless. Follow a grooming routine that leaves you looking your best everyday, which can include:Teeth care: Brush and floss your teeth everyday. Use mouthwash and put to use one of those tools used to scrape your tongue.
Hair care: Wash your hair regularly and thoroughly, using both shampoo and conditioner. If your hair style requires it, use product, such as pomade or gel.
Face care: Use products such as cleanser and moisturizer to keep your face as clean and healthy as possible. That's the minimum, but you can go above and beyond with any number of skin care products, like pore cleansing strips and facial masks.
Smell your best: Use deodorant daily, and find a good body wash. Consider using perfume or cologne, but remember that less is more when it comes to extra fragrances.
Remove unwanted hair. For guys, pluck excess bushiness in your eyebrows and between them, and keep your facial hair under check. Consider shaving your face regularly for that clean cut look. For girls, keep your eyebrows well shaped and facial hair nonexistent, and consider keeping your armpit and leg hair at a minimum as well.

, Royalty practice politeness at all times, which means leaving profanity out of your speech. Slang words and phrases aren't as necessary to avoid, but an overabundance of them gives off too much of a casual, uneducated vibe.

, Generally, people in higher class societies, especially in Britain, speak with a broader vocabulary, and favor elegant words over more common ones. For example, dazzling instead of pretty, and delighted instead of happy.For more ideas on sophisticated words to improve your vocabulary, try: blunder instead of mistake, loathe instead of hate, yearn instead of want, and cherish instead of like.
Invest in a dictionary and a thesaurus, or use online versions. Take some time to increase your vocabulary with these tools.

, There are seven words that when used, instantly indicate to members of the English upper class that one is purposely trying to sound more genteel than they are.Those words are:


""Pardon"". Royals use ""what?""
""Toilet"". Royals use ""lavatory.""
""Dinner"". Royals use ""lunch.""
""Settee"". Royals use ""sofa.""
""Lounge"". Royals use ""sitting room.""
""Sweet"". Royals use ""dessert.""
""Serviette"". Royals use ""napkin.""

, Pronouncing words correctly is a must, so make sure you know how to pronounce words before you use them. To sound royal, you must enunciate clearly, and speak with confidence, loud enough to be easily heard but no louder. Speak slow enough that you don't slur your words or lose enunciation.You can practice your enunciation by trying to perfect tongue twisters such as ""Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. If Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, where's the peck of pickled peppers that Peter Piper picked?"" Or you can just practice reading out loud from a book when you're alone, and making the words a clear as possible., When meeting someone, a royal always offers their hand for the handshake first. A good handshake means the webs between the thumb and fingers meet, the grasp is firm but not aggressive, and the handshake lasts two to three shakes, maintaining eye contact throughout., When drinking tea or coffee, use a saucer, and keep the handle of the cup pointing toward the right. With tea, you lift the saucer with your left hand and the cup with your right. With coffee, you can leave the saucer down. Contradictory to popular belief, you shouldn't stick your pinkie out. At cocktail parties, keep your glass in your left hand so your right is free for handshakes. Never put a finger on the back of the fork to guide it, or use it to scoop up food like peas. And the fork goes to the left of the plate, the knife on the right.Of course, there a lot more rules to proper table etiquette, such as chewing and swallowing before drinking, putting cutlery on the side of the plate when finished, and not blowing on hot drinks or food.

, Above all, the behavior of royals can be described as proper and courteous. Imagine that you and all your actions represent a large group of people. A prince or princess is going to be watched by the whole country and world, so they need to be on their best behavior at all times in public. Think cool, calm, and collected, charming and always polite, especially to strangers.


Some examples of royal-like courteous behavior include: always use ""please"" and ""thank you,"" always be punctual, compliment others when something about them strikes you and give praise for the achievements of others, and make an effort to engage in light conversation with those around you., To be like royalty, you need to be confident. Confidence is part of what gives royalty their charming manner. Gaining confidence will require self-discipline, practice, and patience. Sometimes, the best way to start is to follow the oft-repeated advice of ""fake it until you make it."" Get out of your comfort zone, take risks, and pretend you've got oodles of confidence. As you notice how differently people treat you, and how much more you get out of social situations, you'll gradually start to become more confident on the inside as well.Another surefire way to increase confidence is to develop skills, and allow yourself to be proud of what your good at. Having confidence in your ability to write, or draw, for example, will carry over into your general confidence.

, Poise is that extra bit of grace and elegance in the way a person holds themselves that can take them from ordinary to captivating. There's a lot that goes into developing poise, but some ways to start include:Be humble. A person who's unsure of themselves will try to overcompensate by bragging or showing off. A poised person has no need for validation from others, and can take criticism well.
Be calm. Being poised means being at peace. Stress and worry will cause you to come across as negative and frantic. Practice taking deep breaths when something starts to cause you stress, and take a step back from the situation. Analyze why you're having this stress and what you can do about it.
Don't rush. A poised person will never be seen rushing across the room to get the last seat. The mindset behind poise means slowing down, and being confident that you'll get where you need to be eventually.
Be gentle. Your body movements should be gentle and careful. Put your cup down slowly. Don't drop your books on the table. When you hug someone don't try to squeeze the life out of them. Just use as much force as is necessary in most situations.

Go shopping.,

Spend lots of time at the beach!,
Don't dye your hair blonde when your hair was just brown two days ago.",How to Be a Beach Girl," Get nice, oceanic friendly attire. Get a few beach dresses, tank tops, long skirts, bikinis or one-pieces, (whichever you're more comfortable in), flip-flops, ripped jeans, big sunglasses, denim shorts, shell necklaces and earrings, hemp bracelets, etc. Also, get some fun beach towels. Bright patterns are always fun, but whatever you like, get it. Stick to these general rules, but get what you want to wear. If you want, you can also check out some popular brands such as Rip Curl, Roxy, Billabong, Rusty and Quicksilver. They can be found in Pacsun, or sometimes T. J. Maxx or Marshalls for lower prices. These can be expensive, but you can often buy them cheaper on Ebay.;
, You want your feet to look good in flip-flops so make sure your feet are soft, smooth, and free of cracks and calluses. Use a coarse scrub, pumice stone, a thick moisturizing cream, and thin cotton socks to cover them with before going to bed. Take off the socks in the morning. Bare nails should be clean, trimmed, and neatly filed. Always wear a shade of nail polish in a nice color such as pink, peach, coral, or red. Always reapply if they become chipped.

, It doesn't have to be very noticeable, but a little color looks good on everybody. A self tanner is the safest way to achieve that sexy sun-kissed glow without putting yourself at risk for wrinkles and skin cancer. Its also a great way to instantly cover up skin imperfections like scars and stretch marks. Whether you're at the beach or pool, always wear a sunscreen with a SPF level of 20 or higher when spending time outside, even if you do not burn. Your skin will thank you for it in the long-run.

, If you do, work on it a lot, never hesitate to take advice or learn a different stroke.

, Curls and waves look cute on the beach. So do fishtail braids and messy up-do's. The key is to look natural so stay away from heat stylers. Although blonde is the ultimate beach hair colour, any color can look sun-kissed when you put a few highlights in it.

, If you don't like using razors, pick up some Nair or a similar product to remove the hair. Never leave the house with hairy arms, legs, bikini lines, and armpits if you wouldn't do so in a swimsuit.

, You don't even have to wear any makeup at all! But if you do, wear a light amount and keep it simple. All a natural beach beauty really needs is two coats of waterproof mascara, a hint of light shimmery eyeshadow at the inner corners of the eyes, a touch of peachy blush or bronzer, and a slick of sheer, nude or pink lipgloss. Save the eyeliner for a night out and other special occasions.

, Swim, surf, or do something else. Have fun too!

, It will only look fake. Natural is key!!

Be mature yet nice.","How to Be a ""Pink"" Barbie Girl"," Barbie is blonde, but it doesn't mean you have to be. However, you can add a few golden or blonde highlights to lighten up your hair a bit. The most important thing here is to always keep it conditioned and healthy. Deep condition your hair once a week or every two weeks, and make sure you style it nicely. Make sure you have a flattering haircut, and get a hairdresser to give you a slightly layered cut, simply to give a better shape to your hair and face.;
, There are Barbies of all skin colors, so no matter what your skin tone is, you can be a Barbie... however, you do have to follow a good skin care routine. Wash your face with face soap everyday, massaging your face in circular motion. Then, rinse it off and pat-dry with a towel. Every two days, exfoliate your skin as well.

, Make sure you cleanse your face very well before applying makeup.



Apply face moisturiser. Place a few dots all over your face and gently blend in.

Apply foundation. Place a few dots on forehead, cheeks, eyelids, under eyes, nose and chin. Then gently blend in with your clean fingers or with a sponge or brush. If you want, you can apply a bit of concealer under your eyes too.

Apply face powder. With a big fluffy powder brush or a big powder puff/sponge, apply face powder all over your face to get rid of shine and make your face look matte and clean. Besides, it sets your foundation better. Just make sure not to apply way too much, or your makeup might look caked on.

Eyeshadow. Apply a little bit, but go for pastel colors like baby blue, light pink, white, beige, etc.

Mascara. Apply mascara on top lashes and on bottom lashes. You can use a bit of eyeliner before the mascara, just to make your eyes look bigger.

Blush. Apply a shade of pink blush that goes well for your skin tone. Lighter skin tones gotta go for lighter pinks, darker skin tones gotta go for deeper pinks.

Lipstick or lip gloss. Always pink... when it comes to lips, you can wear lighter or darker regardless of your skin tone. It depends more on your own taste.

, Barbie is girly yet cool, but always very pink. See what's your personal taste and go for it:



Lady-like Barbie. Skirts, dresses, skinny belts, flats and delicate high-heels. You can also wear delicate earrings, such little pearl studs. Remember, your clothes must be pastel colors always, especially pink.

Diva Barbie. Lots of sparkles. Sparkling big earrings, such as bling bling hoops; sparkling rings and necklaces. Also attention-grabbing high heels, tight jeans or skirts and tight dresses. Always go for deep and hot pinks and bright colors.

Cool downtown Barbie. More-laid back yet extremely cool. Hoops earrings or studs. High heels, boots or flip flops. Jeans, tank tops and little jackets. Can go for sober tones on most of the clothing, but always add a touch of bright color, especially bright pinks.

, Even if you don't feel confident, you gotta act like you do, and everybody will believe it. Stand tall, hold your chin high and walk with a little swagger in your hips. You can watch fashion shows and learn from the models. Practice at home too. Acting confident is a must.

, Don't act goofy nor childish, or else people won't respect you. Try to act serious when it's needed. However, treat people with politeness. Say ""excuse me"", ""thank you"" and greet them with good morning/afternoon/evening/night, and carry a little smile on your lips. These little gestures make a huge difference.

Remember Lydia is only a character!",How to Act Like Lydia Deetz (Beetlejuice)," Big hats, dark veils and plenty of black eyeliner. Lydia is all about the color black. If you want to be as theatrical as Lydia then go for it. The bigger the brim of your hat the better. Express yourself! If you're not looking for a complete overhaul why not use your regular everyday wardrobe to achieve her look. Team a long black skirt with ballet pumps or Doc Martin type boots for a more grungy look. Pair with a black top and cardigan and your sorted.;
, Prefer the practicality of jeans. Simply swap the skirt for a pair of black skinnies or leggings with a short black or denim skirt. Top with a baggy or Boyfriend fit cardigan to complete the laid back look.

, Back comb, tease and spray your hair into a defined and structural style. Try adding black clip in flowers, sparkly headbands or fascinating accessories for an even more over the top look! Lydia has a short fringe (or bangs) which have been styled into defined points , to do this with your bangs, secure into spikes with gel or mousse and keep it in place with lots of hair spray!

, Her fringe is very short and styled in an elaborate style, if you still want to frame your face, try a longer full, blunt fringe, or add layers to soften it. If you really want to capture her style and are wanting a drastic change, why not try black hair?

, If you are not naturally pale, don't try to make yourself look like a ghost. Simply buy a foundation that is perhaps one or two shades lighter than your normal shade and top with a similar powder to give a beautiful matte finish. Swipe a sheer black eye shadow over your lids and line with a black kohl pencil. Draw around your wet line and top lid to frame your eye.Apply black mascara or for an even more dramatic look try fluttery falsies!

, Lydia is wonderfully sarcastic, but be sure not to insult anyone. Sometimes sarcasm is lost on the person your talking to and can be taken as hurtful, however, your friends might be intrigued by your new found funny side and less shocked by your new look!

, Perhaps one to keep to people who know you are joking. A constant new bleak outlook might worry those close to you, but if you are naturally a very deadpan person, this should be pretty easy. When told that her father will build her a dark room in the basement, Lydia replies ""My whole life is a dark room"". Perhaps your dark room should have a sunny window, or at least a very bright light.....

, Or just believe in ghosts. This means you are well on your way to being like Lydia! You don't have to hold a séance in your front room though, research into ghost hunts or ghost walking nights in your area and invite your friends to go along! Virtually every town has some kind of haunted house, so investigate and have fun with finding out about your towns history!

, You should intersperse you new found Lydia characteristics with being your wonderful self. Every now and then its fun to act or dress a little differently. Have fun with your Lydia inspired look, but please try not to get involved with any troublesome spirits like Beetlejuice!

Get the look.,
Be nice, sassy, and sweet.,
Be super smart.,
Focus on gorgeous, glowing skin.,
Please, no outrageous nail designs.,
Shopping time!,
Perfect lips.",How to Be a Black Barbie," Barbie has certain characteristics that you must emulate if you want to pass as her.


Get in shape. Eat right and shed pounds. Barbie is known for her slimness. Do not purge or starve yourself to be a stick-thin girl; that's not attractive. Instead, exercise, eat healthy, and drink plenty of water.
Have nice hair. A simple tip on how to achieve healthy, shiny hair is to rinse with cold water in the shower. Always be sure to brush it, keep it knot-free, and to pull it out of your face when you are eating.
Take good care of your skin. Wash your face with non-oily products. Apply light-weight lotions. This will make your face glow afterwards and is very crucial to looking stunning. Last, brush gold eyeshadow on your cheekbones, on the bridge of your nose and under your eyebrows.
Wear minimal makeup. Mascara and any shade of pink lip gloss is what Skipper and Black Barbie wears. Blush will make your cheekbones look like the jigsaw murderer. An easy motto to remember is ""If you have it, don't add it"". Paint your nails in fun pinks ranging from pastel to light pink. Lavender is okay if that's more your thing.
Clothing. Skinny jeans (not too tight) and any stylish pink, black, or blue tank tops or t-shirts. Items from Pink help portray the whole Barbie look. Wear leggings every once in a while with a cute tank top. Always carry a pink tote bag around with you.
Smile. A smile can light up a room and it's what lets people into your heart, so show those pearly whites. Brush three times a day with toothpaste, and occasionally use a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, fresh lemon and baking soda for extra whitening.;
, For example, if someone says ""hi"" and you don't know them, don't be rude: say ""hi"" back. That's how you'll make new friends. Don't get carried away: get some backbone and stand up for yourself, but in a way where you won't get in trouble at school. You've got to be sassy too. Fluttering your eyes (not too much),crossing your legs and walking like a diva will help boost your inner barbie. Don't get all up in someone's face.

, No one likes a dumb barbie.

, Remove every scar with a cocoa butter stick (acne scars too) by applying it two times each day. Then, for glowing skin, use a shimmering body spray. Don't spray directly: use a blush brush to put it all over. Make sure skin is soft with baby lotion or lotion with cocoa butter. Take a hot shower, but don't scrub your skin with your towel. Lightly pat, make sure you still have some water on your skin, then apply the lotion.

, Keep it cute and simple. French manicure, pinks, purples, golds, silvers and a TWO-toned (not ten-toned) are all perfect. Learn how to cover up a broken nail.

, Dr. Jays, Forever 21, Aeropostale (and similar brands like American Eagle, etc.) and 5-7-9 are good places to get a glam/glitzy look. Have nice shoe collection that is half heels and half Nike's.

, Sculpt those plump lips with lip liner and lipstick, or just lipgloss. Soft, never dark colors. If your lips need a boost, try a limp plumping gloss.

Find out all the tips you can.,
Know what hair types there are - dry/damaged, greasy, fine, and know how to identify them.

,
Know also what hair cuts and colors would suit people.,
Don't tell people how to style their hair when your hairs a tip yourself!,
Blonde doesn't suit everyone so don't dye it that color because you think it's sexy.,
Eyebrows.",How to Be a Cosmo Girl1," I learned this one from my mum - for a voluminous conditioner, mix 2 eggs with milk until frothy, add 2 teaspoons of mayo (yes, mayonnaise) and some honey to cover up the smell and give a healthy glow! Rinse with cold-ish water and towel dry. (only use every 2 weeks max) Here's some more tips...;
,, Examples of hair types:- layered, bangs, bob, feathered, short, mid-length, long, fly-away,teased, razored, curly, straight, etc.

, People won't trust you, same for all these rules so rinse, lather and repeat! Don't think your hair is the best either, but still have confidence.

, My opinion is to keep it natural but maybe add highlights. They’re in the know right now! Brunettes and redheads look also fabulous too!

, Please get them waxed and pluck them every 3-7 days, it doesn't hurt. You kinda get used to it after the first wax! Same as plucking! Only the first time hurts.

"
"
Here's another tip for nails and an obvious tip for skin.,
Wash everywhere!,
Nail polish can damage your nails so get pedicures as much as possible.,
If you're going to use nail varnish (what you should do all the time) then put on some nail voluminous first.,
Don't wear fake nails.",How to Be a Cosmo Girl2," Put your nails in a bowl of shampoo and conditioner to make them stronger. Do this for 10 minutes approx. And drink loads of water - 6-8 glasses a day. And put moisturizing lotion on every night. Here’s some more:

, And shave weekly on legs and every 2-3 days under arms.

, French Manicures are very popular.


=Acne victims: do not use Clearasil as it gives you more spots. Use home made things like vinegar, (add water to about 60% and 40% vinegar) or toothpaste (gets rid of the redness, do not be tempted to eat (lol) leave on all night)

,(you can get this from any so it doesn't harm those cuticles.

, It seriously ruins your nails and then you won't be able to wash your hair properly. It's confusing but you have to trust me, it might look nice but it has it's dark-side too!

"
"
Boys don’t want to kiss a girl with a piece of spinach in your mouth so carry around some dental floss and a small bottle of mouthwash with you wherever you go.,
Bad teeth?,
Brush after meals if possible and never go without minty fresh teeth in your mouth.

,
Don't smoke!",How to Be a Cosmo Girl3," You never know when you're gonna need it!

, Don't use strips and this is not the time for home-made stuff. Use some great whitening toothpaste like Colgate Weekly Clean! It will cost loads but it's so worth it!

,, It's seriously not cool and if you smoke then you should stop... Now! It damages your teeth and disgusting to kiss smokers mouths, I’ve been there! It is gross.

"
"
Finally, just go out with a smile on your face and give people advice, but don't be cocky about it, just if they need help.,
Read magazines like Cosmo girl, Bliss and Mizz and Seventeen to get on top of the high street gossip.

,
Don't swear.",How to Be a Cosmo Girl4," And just be you and soon everyone will see you're not a wacky greasy sub!

,, It's horrible and unattractive. It makes you look like a loudmouth freak. Try using different words instead of swears.

Always live by the ideals that our founders set for us: Love, Honor, and Truth.,
Honor yourself and everyone around you.,
Always be truthful.,
Always know your limits when going out with friends.,
Always look well groomed and taken care of, and appropriately modest.,
Always Be courteous and tender.,
""We are the Phi Mu girls... we wear our pins and PEARLS!!!!!,
Help people.,
just simply be a Lady!",How to Be a Classy Phi Mu Lady," Try to model love to everyone. Obviously it is simply impossible to truly feel love toward everyone - but don't snob someone just because you don't particularly like them. Phi Mu's are known to be kind and humble, so just put on that beautiful smile of yours, hold your head high and keep on walking. (If you have to, clench your teeth together and force on a smile so you won't look rude)-but try not to look fake about it.;
, You are obviously a well rounded GREAT girl if you are a Phi Mu, so take advantage of that!! Don't be conceited or self-centered but take compliments gracefully and feel good about yourself. Having self confidence is a key ingredient to living a fabulous life!

, Lying is ugly-and not appealing. If people hear you lying, they will never feel they can fully trust you...because they will assume you could be lying to them too!

, It can be appropriate to have a few drinks, but not too many. Know how much your body can handle and stop before you lose any sense of control. Being a loud, obnoxious drunk girl is not cute, not appealing, and NOT classy!

, ESPECIALLY if you are sporting that PHI MU jersey! Be proud of your letters, but remember, in pjs or Prada, you're representing Phi Mu. (And your letters should never be worn in an inappropriate place like across your rear - definitely NOT classy).

, There is nothing sweeter than a polite, considerate person.

,""- WEAR PEARLS with your dresses!!!!!!!! That is so classy and fabulous looking!!

, Take a few minutes out of your day to just do something nice for someone! You have no idea how much of an impact you could make on someone's life if you just take the time to go out of your way for them. Helping people not only makes them feel great - it also makes you feel worthy, and good about yourself!!

Manners are a really important thing you need.,
Look like Lili (to a point).,
Be super-organized.,
Be super-busy.,
Act flawless!,
Settle for no less than you deserve.,
Be healthy.,
Secretly (without friends or parents knowing!),
Create a website that ranks all the people in your grade.,
Money is definitely an essential.,
Now that the matter of money is handled, we need to move on to what to do with all of it.,
Act older or act like a little 'princess'.,
Well, it would be good to have good-looking and well-mannered parents.,
Dress up the house.,
Have a rich girl vocabulary.,
Always have gum or mints.,
Have a loyal follower like Lauren who will help you to the top.",How to Act Like Lili from the Ashleys," Start practicing holding the door, not putting your elbows on the table, saying please and thank you.;
, Lili is Asian-American and absolutely gorgeous. If you are Asian, wonderful! Accentuate those beautiful features. If not, don't fear. Just remember the three Ss: Simple, Sensual, and Sensible. Remember, Lili is proud of her beautiful pale skin, so never fake-and-bake. That is SO not Lili. Emphasize one feature at a time, whether in fashion or cosmetics. Always look classy but with a hint of sensuality.

, But be cute about it. Like, for example, for school, color code all your binders, but use only cool colors, like Purple, Teal, Orange, Pink, etc. Also, if you are like Lili, you will be rather busy, so you should have a cute day planner.

, Appease your parents by participating in all sorts of extracurriculars, as well as keeping straight A's. The happier they are, the more freedom (and spoiling!) you get. You can do an instrument, but NOT in school, and if you take a language, Italian, French, or Spanish are the most acceptable. Lili would definitely take ASL (American Sign Language) though, because her parents want her to be humanitarian. Latin is also great because it is valued in high society. Always make your extracurriculars sound really cool, even if they aren't. Never join the math team or chess club though, and if you do a sport, make sure you look the cutest in your uniform. Tennis is one of the best, as is cheer and dance, but volleyball is one of the worst because of what it does to your thighs.

, Most people will be jealous if you have money and no worries in life. Get good grades, look nice, act nice, and always enjoy yourself when you're out. Never tell people about ""bad things"" in your life, this will make people think they are better than you if they have something you don't. If someone has something you don't have or is going somewhere nice, than don't act like it is a big deal, just stay cool, make it seem like it is something normal in your life.

, This applies to clothing, makeup, friends, and guys. Especially guys. If you want him, get him. Be hard to get but kind of shy and cute at the same time. Give your number out, don't get guys' numbers. Make him come to you.

, Work out with cool sports, yoga, pilates, Tae Bo, kickboxing, etc, (Bellydancing is really cool too!) and eat healthy foods only and drink only water, juice maybe once a day and possibly flavored water. Soda is for vulgar people. However, tea is always appropriate and delicious at teatime. Iced tea is good with dinner every few nights, but remember the sugar content. Be careful. But tea is a perfect treat. Try going 2 weeks eating healthy with no cheat days, and although it will seem SO hard during the time, look at yourself and weigh yourself at the end. Then think about if it was really that hard? No.

, watch Sex and the City, and dream of being like them and working in New York. Although Lili dreams of owning a nightclub, you can really dream of any non-traditional New York career.

, Don't tell anyone. Even though Lili didn't do this, it's a fab idea and it gives you a lot more control if you want to ""tweak"" the results a bit. Scare the queen bee out of her skin, smile sweetly, and always be the bigger person. She will have an off day, and you WILL be on, and you will come out on top.

, However, not much is needed. Look for ways to get money. Post adds on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow peoples lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it.

, With the money you have collected (anywhere from about $150-$1000) you need to go shopping. Go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hillfiger, Abercrombie and Fitch, Armani Exchange and even Dolce and Gobanna clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the actually store.(check tips for a minor addition to this section)

, Be pleasant, somewhat coy and mature. Act as if you know what you're talking about and believe in yourself.

, Convince your mum to dress elegantly. Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste/Tommy Hilfinger/Nautica polo's and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford all these, just convince them to look elegant.

, When friends come over, make your ordinary house look 'rich' by printing poster sized pictures of famous paintings, or you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, or your parents' wedding and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a pink or white bedspread, and for your computer, put a cover, (pink or white), over it. The house should be tidy.

, It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word every day like ""aberrant,"" ""culpable,"" or ""capricious."" Having a vocabulary like this increases charm and wit, which can be considered a MUST in higher circles.

, Never get detention though. If you had one and then you switched schools (a good idea for a new start) just never admit you had one.

, Make sure though, that unlike Lauren, her intentions are all acceptable to you.

Morning after pills will likely be among other family planning methods such as condoms.If you don't see the morning after pill on the shelves, visit the pharmaceuticals counter and ask there.There may be generic and brand name options. Both are equally effective and you can decide based on budget and if you’re sensitive to any of the active ingredients.Be aware that some stores may not sell the morning after pill because of the company’s moral code. Consider calling ahead of time if you have reason to suspect the store's owners might be opposed to family planning.;
, You may be able to get the morning after pill from your nearest sexual health clinic or walk-in health center.If you're within business hours, this may be easier and more discreet than a retail outlet.


The morning after pill may not have any cost, or a clinic may price it on a sliding scale for those that can't afford full price.You will be asked about your income and insurance to determine your fee.
If you live in the United States, see if there's a Planned Parenthood Health Center near you: https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center

Most universities have a health center that may offer emergency contraception. If you are not sure how or when it is available, ask a member of staff or talk to the nurse.

, Your doctor can prescribe you emergency contraception. If you’re unsure of your options or have any questions about taking the morning after pill, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Tell the receptionist that the matter is urgent so that you can see the doctor as soon as possible.


You will have to explain the situation to your doctor and she may then prescribe emergency contraception for you. She may also suggest using a regular form of birth control.
The most common prescription pill is Plan B.
NorLevo is not as effective in women with a BMI over 35; the case may be the same with other brands of the morning after pill.Bear in mind that you should get the pill as soon as possible, as the effectiveness decreases over time.

, If you’ve had unprotected sex and are concerned that you could get pregnant, take the morning after pill, which is also called emergency contraception, as soon as you can. In most cases, you can take the morning after pill up to five days following unprotected sex.Be aware that many states require women under the age of 17 to get a prescription for morning after pills.You can take the pill anytime during your menstrual cycle.The morning after pill is a safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy.However, you shouldn’t use this as a regular form of birth control., While everyone can use over the counter emergency contraception, it may not be as effective for every woman and some may be allergic to it. Make sure to read and understand any indications or contraindications that come along with emergency contraception.The morning after pill may be less effective for women with a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 25.Certain medications such as barbiturates, or other supplements such as St. John’s Wort may decrease the effectiveness of the morning after pill.If you are allergic to any component of the morning after pill, it may be less effective., If you use any kind of morning after pill, you may experience some side effects. These usually subside after a few days.You may experience nausea or vomiting after taking the morning after pill.You may feel tired, dizzy, or have a headache after taking the morning after pill.You may have breast tenderness, and lower abdominal pain or cramping after taking the morning after pill.You may experience bleeding between periods or heavier menstrual cramps after taking the morning after pill.Contact your doctor immediately if you experience bleeding or spotting that lasts longer than a week or if you have severe abdominal pain 3-5 weeks after taking the morning after pill. This can help rule out an ectopic pregnancy., One of the most common side effects of using emergency contraception is nausea. If you vomit within an hour of taking the pills, repeat the dosage.Don’t repeat the entire process, just the dosage you threw up.You may need to take an anti-nausea medication to help your stomach., Only use one form of emergency contraception. Not only is using two forms of emergency contraception not more effective at preventing pregnancy, but the different types of morning after pill may actually make the other less effective.You’re much more likely to have nausea, vomiting, and other side effects from using multiple forms of emergency contraception., If you’ve taken the morning after pill and don’t have a regular form of birth control, use a backup form of contraception. This can help prevent unwanted pregnancy.Consider using condoms as your backup form of contraception.Use backup contraception for 14 days after taking the morning after pill., If you take regular birth control pills, and have simply missed a dose, you may be able to increase your dose as a form of emergency contraception. However, you should talk to your doctor or a pharmacist about the number of pills you should take.You can also call 1-800-PLAN to discuss your options with a Planned Parenthood representative.
Depending on the kind of oral contraceptive, one dose may be 4 or 5 pills.

, After establishing how many pills you need, take two doses within 12 hours of one another. This is considered a safe and effective pregnancy prevention method.Take your first dose up to 5 days or up to 120 hours after unprotected sex.
Take the second dose 12 hours after the first dose. An hour more or less won't make a difference.

, You may be tempted to take more than 4-5 pills to make sure it works, but this will not actually reduce your risk. The only thing it will do is raise your chances of an upset stomach.If you experience severe stomach pain, seek medical attention.

, When you decide to use birth control, there are many factors you should consider such as if and when you want children, if you want to take pills or not worry about taking daily medication, and your lifestyle, including if you travel frequently. Thinking about these questions can help you determine the most appropriate form of birth control for you.For example, if you are in a long term relationship and want to wait a few years to have children, you might opt for a long term birth control method such as an intrauterine device (IUD).
If you have multiple partners, you may opt for birth control pills and condoms to protect from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.Consider questions such as “do I want to plan every time I have sex?,” “do I want to remember to take a pill every day?,” “do I want to end my fertility permanently?”.You’ll also want to think about your health. For example, if you suffer from migraines, birth control pills may not be a good choice for you.

, You can choose barrier methods that are put on or inserted right before sex including male and female condoms, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, and spermicide.If used properly, these methods can help protect against pregnancy, but you may want to use a secondary method to help ensure that you don’t get pregnant. For example, if you’re using condoms, which have a failure rate of 2-18%, you may want to also use a spermicide.The advantage to barrier methods is that they also protect against STIs.

, Hormonal birth control, which has a low failure rate of less than 1% to 9%, is a good option if you want to avoid pregnancy and are in a long-term relationship.The different types of hormonal birth control are the Pill, a patch, or a vaginal ring.Birth control pills can have the added benefit that they can help regulate your menstrual cycle., You can choose a long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) method such as an IUD, hormonal shots, or a contraceptive implant if you want to wait to have children. It can take some time to return to fertility after using these methods, but they will not affect your ability to conceive in the long-term., Sterilization is a birth control option if you are sure you never want children. Vasectomies and tubal ligations are generally irreversible procedures and must be seriously considered before making a final decision to go through with them., Every birth control method comes with potential risks, including unwanted pregnancy. Being aware of potential risks and side effects of the different birth control methods can help you choose the best method for you.


Hormonal birth control, such as pills, patches, and vaginal rings may increase your blood pressure and affect your cholesterol.Barrier methods such as condoms, spermicides, and caps can cause allergic reactions and may increase your risk for urinary tract infections or STDs.The risks for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods include perforation of the uterus, increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy, and pain and heavy menstrual bleeding."

Research the different types of ovulation predictor kits.,
Check accuracy.,
Compare prices.,
Look for simple readings.,
Think about convenience.,
Determine which is easiest to use.",How to Choose an Ovulation Predictor Kit1," The main types of ovulation predictor kits use either stick tests, monitors, microscopes or watches. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. You will need to determine which one will work best for what you need and what type of test you prefer.


Stick-based ovulation predictor kits are inexpensive, accurate and easy to read; however, they can be tricky to use for some women and can cause a mess.
Ovulation fertility monitors are electronic or battery-powered devices that can detect ovulation hormones either through urine or saliva. Saliva or urine is placed on the lens screen of the device to determine hormone levels. These monitors often provide more detailed information about hormonal levels throughout the month but tend to cost much more than stick test kits.
Ovulation microscopes test hormone levels in saliva placed on the microscope lens and examined after it dries. The presence of a ""fernlike"" pattern indicates that you will ovulate within 24 to 36 hours. Testing with these small, easy-to-carry devices is simple and convenient but they do cost more. Accuracy rates may not be as high as some other testing methods.Ovulation predictor watches and other devices are also available. They use biosensors on the skin to measure chloride ion level surges in skin perspiration occurring about six days before ovulation. For this reason, this device can provide an ovulation estimate days earlier than estrogen or LH-based tests. It can also offer a six day window of fertility and highlight the most reliable days of ovulation.;
, Ovulation predictor kits have varying levels of accuracy. Look for tests with accuracy rates as close to 100% as possible. This way you can have a high level of certainty when you will be ovulating and the greatest chance of success becoming pregnant. Many ovulation predictor kits are 98 – 99% accurate.

, When considering costs, take into account the fact that some ovulation predictor kits are reusable. If you choose a kit that measures hormones by peeing on a stick, then be sure to get one that provides more tests per kit than the others do. Chances are you will be using your ovulation predictor kit for four to 10 days at least during the first month and possibly longer, especially if your cycles are irregular. While monitors and microscopes are more expensive, you can reuse them multiple times and not have to worry about running out of test sticks.

, The less you have to interpret your kit’s test results, the better. For the most part, you want results that you can depend on with reasonable confidence. This way you can focus on increasing your chances of pregnancy at the most opportune times instead of guessing whether you’re reading the results of your ovulation predictor kit correctly.Ovulation predictor kits that use test sticks often offer either a positive or negative result, so there’s no guesswork involved for you.

, Many kits require you to test around the same time each day during the week you are likely to ovulate based on menstrual cycle length. Other testing methods such as microscopes and monitors allow you to test freely throughout the month at any time of day. This can be helpful in pinpointing your hormone level changes and determining when ovulation is likely to happen in the coming months., Some tests use urine to measure hormones, so you have to either pee on a stick or dip the test stick into urine placed in a sterile container. Monitors use a lens screen to measure hormone levels in saliva or urine. Microscopes work similar to monitors and can detect hormones after saliva dries on a lens.Some women do not like to have to deal with urine or potential messes. If this is you, then consider getting an ovulation prediction kit that does not measure hormone levels in urine.

Consider what's important to you in regards to birth control.,
Research these types of birth control and think about their benefits and disadvantages.,
Choose a method of birth control.,
Visit your physician and get a prescription if needed.",How to Choose a Birth Control Method," Here are some factors to think about:

Effectiveness: Most reversible types of birth control are not 100% effective, but some are more effective than others. If a pregnancy is not possible for you, you would want to choose a method with a very high effectiveness rate. On the other hand, if pregnancy is an option for you, a method that is not as effective may not be such a bad thing.
Effort: Consider how much effort you are willing to put into your birth control. Is it something you want to think about every time you have sex? Every day? Every couple weeks? Every couple years?
Reversibility: If you think you may want to have children soon, you don't want to choose a method that is not quickly or easily reversible: i.e. hormonal methods and surgical procedures.
Cost: Some methods are cheaper than others.
Protection: If you are in a long-term relationship and do not need protection from STDs or STIs, then you may choose to not use condoms. But condoms are the only form of contraception that also prevents the transmission of HIV and other STDs.
Prior experience/side effects: One method may not have worked well for you in the past, so you do not want to choose a similar method to that one. For example, hormonal birth control may have caused side effects for you, and you may want to look into other methods with less side effects.;
, The bullet points below contain overviews for each type of contraception, but if you are considering a specific method you should research it more fully.





  A cervical cap






Barrier methods: diaphragms, cervical caps, male condoms, female condoms, and sponges. These methods are often used with spermicide and create a physical barrier against sperm so they cannot enter the uterus. These methods must be used each time you have sex. Overall, these methods are generally cheaper and have fewer side effects, but they do have a lower pregnancy prevention rate.




 A Mirena IUD or intrauterine device.

Hormonal methods: IUDs, shots (Depoprovera), patches, vaginal ring (Nuva Ring), arm implant (Implanon), and the pill. These methods regulate hormones in the female body (estrogen and progestin) in order to prevent pregnancies. Pills are usually taken every day; rings, shots, and patches every few weeks; and IUD's and implants every couple of years. They are very effective, but may cause serious side effects.

The copper IUD does not use hormones, but it also has side effects to be considered.


All natural methods: withdrawal and Feminine Awareness Method (FAM). These methods have no side effects and are free. However, the withdrawal method (removing the penis before ejaculation) requires a large amount of trust and experience, and may be ineffective. The FAM method can be used successfully, but it requires a woman to chart her cycle correctly using signs from her body for at least six months. It also requires experience and trust. Natural methods are most successfully used with another form of birth control.




 A vasectomy is a surgical procedure performed on men to prevent pregnancy.

Permanent surgical procedures: vasectomy and tubal ligation. These procedures are for couples that no longer want to have children and are 100% effective. However tubal ligation is not reversible. Most couples choose to get a vasectomy, because it is a quick, fairly painless, and cheaper procedure.
Emergency procedures: Plan B. Plan B is a pill that can be taken, up to five days after failure of birth control or unprotected sex, to reduce the risk of a pregnancy occurring. It uses a large dose of hormones to have this effect and is disruptive to a woman's cycle; it's an emergency procedure that is not intended for everyday birth control.

, Also consider using two methods in conjunction with each other. 'Two is better than one' is true in the case of birth control; it lowers the risk of pregnancy significantly., Barrier methods like condoms or sponges and all natural methods do not require a prescription, but it's wise to research them thoroughly and seek education anyway."

"
Understand ovulation.,
Measure LH.,
Determine estrogen levels.,
Check your chloride ion levels.,
Monitor cervical fluid consistency.,
Check basal temperature.",How to Choose an Ovulation Predictor Kit2," Each month during ovulation, a mature egg is released from your ovary and travels to the end of the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized by sperm. The egg will remain there for 12 – 24 hours. If it’s not fertilized during that time, it will be shed with the uterus lining during menstruation. Your most fertile time period is during this window when your egg is available for fertilization.


You can get an estimate of the days you will likely ovulate by determining the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). You can also figure it out by calculating about 12 – 15 days from the day you expect to start your next menstrual cycle. Ovulation usually occurs sometime between Day 11 – 21 from the LMP., Most ovulation kits use luteinizing hormone (LH) surges to indicate the beginning of ovulation. Estrogen levels are low when your cycle begins but rise when your egg is ready to be released. This causes LH to surge and push the egg through the ovary wall within 24 – 36 hours where it moves to the fallopian tubes to be fertilized. Measuring this hormone can be a very effective method of determining when intercourse will likely allow sperm to reach the egg.The day that you ovulate can fluctuate from month to month and can occur any time during your cycle. Each woman’s cycle is unique, so keeping track of your cycle is the best way to tell when your peak fertility dates are likely to be.It is possible to ovulate without having a menstrual period. You can also have a menstrual period without ovulating, which means you would not be fertile that month.Sometimes you can have an LH surge that does not release an egg ready to be fertilized. It is important to remember that ovulation kits do not tell you that ovulation has actually occurred — only that it is likely to occur.

, Many tests that use saliva check for an estrogen surge. This is because estrogen surges around the same time as LH when it is time for your body to ovulate. Estrogen can be measured in your saliva and creates the “fern-like” pattern that can be seen under a microscope.Since a lot of estrogen tests check saliva, you shouldn’t smoke, eat, drink or brush your teeth for two hours prior to doing the test.If results show up as a mixture of fern-like shapes and bubbles, then you are getting near to your ovulation date or right after it — but not quite there. Seeing just bubbles means you are not close to ovulating yet.

, There are products, such as microcomputing devices and watches, that measure chloride ions on your skin. They then calculate the days you are most likely to get pregnant using that measurement and certain algorithms. They give multiple readings throughout the day but must be worn for at least six hours while sleeping to get the best electrolyte measurements., When you are going to ovulate, your cervical fluid will change somewhat and become wetter and more slippery, with the consistency of egg whites. Cervical fluid differences are unique to each woman and is something you will have to monitor throughout the month to get a feel for what the cervical mucus is like at different times of your cycle. The fluid may change gradually but is usually at it’s most “egg-white-like” consistency the day of and right after ovulation occurs., Check your temperature throughout the month with a basal thermometer. When ovulation occurs, temperature usually rises about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 0.2 degrees Celsius. You will want to chart your basal body temperature (BBT) every day and look for changes that indicate you have ovulated. Temperatures are usually lower during the first part of your cycle and a little higher after you have ovulated."

Ask your doctor.,
Talk to your pharmacist.,
Research consumer reports.,
Contact the ovulation kit company.,
Talk to friends and family.",How to Choose an Ovulation Predictor Kit3," Your family medical provider, OB/GYN or fertility specialist is the best source of information regarding ovulation predictor kits. They will often have advice to give you about which products might work well for your needs and which won’t based on up-to-date research. They also often have years of patient experiences with ovulation predictor kits they can share with you.

, Your pharmacist is usually pretty well-acquainted with the products they sell at that particular location. They may have suggestions for you and can answer your questions or concerns about an ovulation predictor kit. They would also know whether some patients report better experiences with some brand names versus others.

, Consumer Reports is a trusted product testing organization that provides consumer information on all kinds of products. They require a paid subscription, though, to access their detailed reports. You may choose to search online for product reviews of the ovulation predictor kits you are considering on sites like Amazon.

, Most ovulation predictor kits will offer manufacturer contact information on the box. Write down some numbers as you browse what is available. Then you can contact each company and get more information about the products and have your questions and concerns addressed at that time as well.

, Ask around for advice on which ovulation prediction tests have worked for others. See if any particular brand seems to have worked well for friends or family members who have successfully conceived. They may also be able to offer suggestions on how best to use certain types of kits and what to expect.

Have a kind heart.,
Be faithful to your belief.,
Have charms.,
Use different tools.,
Use salt crystals and salt.,
Use a wand.,
Understand that herbs can be almost any type of plant.,
Understand that potions and spells have pretty much the same purpose, since both ward off spirits.,
Understand that a Book of Shadows records your accomplishments.,
Understand that an altar is a good idea for an enchantress, since it can organize your tools.,
Understand that using your own way is important.",How to Act Like an Enchantress," A good enchantress always has a kind heart. You must have sympathy and kindness. The form of magic will be tainted if your heart is not kind.



Try to meditate, as it can help your soul as well as your mind. Dark thoughts can roam your mind, but you must never believe any that threatens. The world has many dark things uncovered, so, as an enchantress, you must be aware of the spiritual forms of danger. A kind heart is the best weapon to ward off evil spirits.;
, Belief is also a must. If you do this right, you will feel a power inside you. If you are not religious, a good choice would be to have your own belief. A new belief all to yourself can encourage the widening of the mind, as you will have to learn to build your belief. If you are not willing to trust your religion, you cannot be an enchantress.

, Charms can build confidence and also add spiritual power. A good enchantress has multiple charms that she uses. You must not rely on them, though, as they are not what makes magic, it is you.


Charms should be not too colorful, but a splash of color is fine. Try to use one with a rare gem, or at least one that looks splendid. Try to limit the gold, since it does not ward off spirits. Silver wards off spirits better, so you might want to try using a charm that contains silver.

, Using tools is a very important part of this practice. Tools that perform magic include: salt crystals, salt, a wand, herbs, potions, spells, and a Book of Shadows. Crystals and salt cleanse other tools, and the wand is what makes the magic. Herbs create the potions, and also add to spells. Potions and spells have many uses, mostly to heal and improve. A Book of Shadows is just a spiritual book to record your magic accomplishments and spells.

, Doing this is a must, since all tools (except crystals and salt) may not be pure, and they require some cleansing as well. Only use one out of crystals or salt, since two may cleanse out the good spirits.


Crystals could be bought in crafting stores or homemade. Salt is not the cooking salt in kitchens. The type of salt you shall use is the pure sea salt that has not gone through much processing.

, A wand is where the true magic begins, but do not buy a useless plastic wand. The true wand is a wooden stick that is hard to break and special.


You should feel a connection with it and it should be 9 to 13 inches. A wand does not turn things into something else. It wards off spirits from you or other people. The wand can also make spells and potions work, by giving them a burst of power that cannot be made in any other way.

, From alder bark to zap berries, all of the herbs has a usage. The herbs can give the potion a smell, color, or even a taste!


Herbs can also cleanse tools, but they need to be buried in salt or salt crystals for at least a day before cleansing. Herbs should be bought if you plan to consume it, but for other purposes, you can pick herbs. You will have to dry it if you plan to preserve it, though.

, They make events happen and are used for healing. Potions should be always made with care, and spells should be revised and edited. Both should represent a purpose; if they don't, the purpose may not be correct. Put potions in small bottles with labels, and spells should be written in your Book of Shadows.

, It should contain your spells, recipes for potions, herbs, and thoughts. Another way to think of it is as a journal made especially for magic practice. You can include symbols, facts, pictures, and even leaves or other items. The book should be an old-looking book with slightly yellow pages with no lines. Also, use different colors and different types of pens. Be creative!

, Have a piece of furniture, cover it with a tablecloth, and arrange your tools on it.


Add your charms and a few candles. Put souvenirs and mementos on it as well as statues. It can be simple or super fancy! You do not have to follow these guidelines exactly, but you should have something similar.

, The way you want to learn magic can be anyway. Don't be shy! Do research and branch out. That way, your magic can be the best! Never do what others do if you do not like the method. Never where enchantress-like clothing if you do not like it.

Check the expiration date of the individually wrapped condom.,
Look at the condition of the packaging.,
Press on the wrapper.,
Squish and slide the wrapper to the side.",How to Check a Condom2," Even if you purchased the condoms recently, check the expiration date before you use one. If the condom has expired, then do not use it. An expired condom is more likely to break than one that is in date.

, There should be no tears or holes in the package. If there is a hole in the wrapper, the condom may have dried out, rendering it ineffective and likely to break., You should feel a little bit of air resistance from inside the package. This means the package has not been torn or punctured and your condom is good to go., While still pressing on the wrapper, gently push it the condom inside for a side-slide motion. This slight movement indicates that the lubricant inside has not dried out and, as long as the expiry date has not been passed, is still good.This slide test only works for lubricated condoms. Unlubricated condoms will not slide in the package but you can still do the air resistance test.
A dried out condom will weaken, crack, and break, exposing you to your partner’s fluids, potential pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

Do not use your teeth.,
Keep the package away from sharp objects.,
Feel the condom.,
Remove jewelry if it is in the way.,
Pinch the tip.,
Check your fit.,
Use a water-based lubricant.",How to Check a Condom3," Opening a package with your teeth might be convenient, but tiny rips in the condom can happen that you might not notice before you put it on.Instead, tear open the wrapper by pulling apart the premade notch on one of the corners.

, Never use scissors, knives, or other sharp objects to open the package or you may accidentally puncture the condom.

, If it feels dry, stiff, or extra sticky when it comes out of the package, it might not have been stored properly. Discard a dry, sticky, and/or stiff condom and get a new one., Rings and genital piercings can tear a condom, so you may want to remove them before putting on a condom. Also, be careful when putting on a condom if you have sharp nails., Make sure you have squeezed the air out of the tip. Air in the tip of the condom can cause it to burst open and break during use.


Squeeze the tip between your forefinger and thumb while you roll the rest of the condom down the penis.

, There are a couple of reasons why you need to make sure you have the right sized condom. Your condom should be neither too small nor too big and shouldn’t roll back up from the base once you have it on an erect penis. Measure your erect penis to ensure you buy the right size - it might take a few tries to make sure you have the best fit.You need to have room at the tip to catch the semen. That tip that you pinched to squeeze out the air so the condom wouldn’t burst has to have room for ejaculate. If you don’t have space at the tip, the condom could burst, leaving you and your partner at risk for STIs and pregnancy.
The condom can’t be too loose so as to move around. A loose-fitting condom allows for movement of fluids or could fall off all together, again putting you and your partner at risk.
Measure for fit at home before you buy.Be realistic; don’t go for image. “Small” and “large” sizes have more to do with width than length but you can also get shorter or longer condoms, so practice safer sex and choose wisely.

, Oil-based lubricants can weaken the condom and make it break.Choose a water-based lubricant instead.


Don’t use oil-based lubricants, baby oil, massage lotion, petroleum jelly, or hand cream as a lubricant.

,
Go to a clinic.",How to Buy Condoms Discreetly2," While not necessary, you might feel more comfortable if you buy a few things and put them in your cart before buying condoms. This way, you are not standing at the counter with nothing but a box of condoms. You can also use the other items in your cart to cover up the condoms. This way other people will not be able to look in your basket and automatically see the condoms.

, Convenience stores and gas stations often sell condoms as well. These stores are smaller and have less people. If you purchase from a convenience store, you may have to talk to the cashier and let him or her know that you need to buy condoms, as most times they are located behind the counter. If you do not mind interacting with the cashier, but want to avoid large crowds, this may be an option for you.Sometimes the bathrooms have vending machines that dispense condoms and other small sex-related items.

, Throw away your receipt at the store. You do not want to walk around with a condom receipt in your pocket, wallet, or jacket. If you throw away the receipt as soon as you walk out of the store, you do not have to worry about a parent or friend finding out about your purchase. If your parents monitor your credit card/debit card spending you may want to buy the condoms with cash. You will not have to answer any questions about a charge in your card.

, Instead of using the checkout line, buy your condoms from a store that has an automated checkout, where you scan your purchases and bag them yourself. This will allow you to avoid talking to a cashier. Most grocery stores and large retailers have self- checkout stations.

Always check the expiration date.",How to Buy Condoms," Condoms are made with several different types of material. They all feel a little different, so it's a good idea to shop around and try a few different kinds to figure out which one feels the best and meets your other preferences. When used correctly, they are all equally effective in preventing pregnancy.However, some are more effective than others at preventing STD contraction.


Latex rubber is the most common material used to make condoms. These condoms are cheap and effective (when used correctly), but if you or your partner is allergic to latex, you'll need another option.Lambskin condoms are a natural alternative for those who are allergic to latex and wish to avoid rubber. However, lambskin condoms do not prevent you from contracting STDs. Choose this option only if you're in a committed relationship and you've both been tested.
Polyurethane condoms are stronger and thicker than latex condoms, and they're fine to use for people who are allergic to latex. The material heats up to the same temperature as your natural body temperature, so when you use these condoms it feels like you're not wearing anything. The drawback is that polyurethane condoms are more expensive than latex.
Tactylon condoms are stretchier than other condoms, conforming to the shape of the penis. They are said to have a more natural fit than other condoms. They can also be a little difficult to find and are more expensive than latex condoms.;
, Most condoms fit the average penis, which is four to seven inches long. Try on a regular-sized condom and determine how it fits. If it rolls on easily and stays firmly in place, you're probably fine wearing regular-sized condoms. If feels loose and seems to slip, go for a smaller size. If it's tight to the point of being painful or looking like it's going to tear, try on a bigger size. Trying on different sizes is really the best way to find out what fits you best. You can look up condom sizes online on specialty websites.


The shape of a condom also factors into how it fits. Different brands come in slightly different shapes, so again, it's a good idea to experiment and find out what kind works best with the shape of your penis. In a pinch, any shape will likely fit; it's just a matter of which one ends up feeling the best and most natural.
If you're buying condoms for someone else, getting an average size is usually a safe bet. If you know your partner is extraordinarily large or small, you can get a few backups just in case.
The condom size (e.g. how well it fits) plays a huge role in the condom’s effectiveness. If a condom is too large, it could come off during intercourse while condoms that are too small could break. If a condom is not long enough to cover the entire penis, bodily fluids could be transferred to your partner. All these scenarios would decrease your level of protection.Measure:
1. In order to accurately measure penis size, first you must have an erect penis (since penis size when flaccid is not an accurate measurement).
2. Measure Penis Length with a ruler or measuring tape. Position the ruler or measuring tape at the base of your penis (where it attaches to your body - make sure to press into the pubic bone as far as you can because fat can actually hide the length of your penis).
3. Measure Penis Girth with a piece of string (or something similar) or a soft measuring tape. Gently wrap the string one time around the thickest part of the shaft/body of your erect penis (yes, it still needs to be erect!).Fit:
USA:
Small Condoms
Fits Length: 3 Inches - 6.5 Inches
Fits Girth: 4.1 Inches - 4.7 Inches
Examples: Any condom represented as small or snug.
Regular Condoms
Fits Length: 4 Inches - 7 Inches
Fits Girth: 4.4 Inches - 5 Inches
Examples: Any condom that does not specify a size.
Large Condoms
Fits Length: 4 Inches - 8 Inches
Fits Girth: 4.7 Inches - 5.3 Inches
Examples: Any condom represented as large or magnum.
X-Large Condoms
Fits Length: 4 Inches - 9 Inches
Fits Girth: 4.9 Inches - 5.6 Inches
Examples: Any condom represented as extra-large or XL.
(Due to FDA regulations condoms sold in the USA must be between 47mm and 57mm in flat width at the entrance. Therefore condoms that are correctly sized for individuals with a girth under 4.1 inches or over 5.6 inches are not available in the USA.)
Europe:
Condom packages in Europe are required to be clearly labeled with the condom length and width. Start by selecting the correct width, then ensure the length is sufficient as well. To get the correct condom width multiply your circumference by 0.42 and look for a condom that is +/- 2mm in width from the result.

, Female condoms aren't as commonly used as male condoms, but they can be a great option for couples. Female condoms are inserted inside the vagina and cover part of the labia as well, effectively protecting against pregnancy as well as STDs.


Female condoms can be inserted up to 8 hours before intercourse. This makes them a great option for people who dislike interrupting foreplay to put a condom on.
Female condoms are made from polyurethane, and like male condoms made from this material, many find them to feel natural and less rubbery than latex.

, Some condoms come with lubricant, or ""lube,"" already applied to the condom. Lube helps the condom slip onto the penis and everywhere else with minimum friction, making the experience more comfortable for all involved and preventing the condom from tearing. It's convenient to buy condoms that are lubricated, but some people prefer buying lube separately. If you're going to do that, it's important to know what types of lube work with different condom materials.


Water and silicone-based lubricants work with all types of condoms.
Oil-based lubricants should only be used with polyurethane and tactylon condoms. Do not use baby oil, mineral oil, petroleum jelly, or any other oil-based lubricant with latex or lambskin condoms.
If you want added protection, you can get condoms that come with spermicidal lubricant. The spermicide kills a large portion of the sperm once ejaculation occurs. If you're worried about condom breakage, you might want this extra bit of security. Be aware that spermicides can sometimes cause side effects such as irritation, burning and urinary infections.

, Some people like their condoms to feel like they aren't even there, while others enjoy the sensation of condoms that are ribbed or have bumps. Each texture has the same efficacy, so feel free to make the decision entirely based on your own idea of pleasure.


If you're buying condoms for a first-time experience with your partner, getting condoms without ribbing or bumps is a safe bet. As you get to know each other's preferences, you can try out different textures.

, You'll see some condoms labeled as ""extra sensitive"" or ""ultra sensitive,"" and these are designed to be as thin and difficult to detect as possible, so you can feel the maximum amount of sensation. Some people prefer to be able to feel the condom during sex, so they know it's still securely in place. Either way is equally effective at preventing pregnancy and STDs.

, Standard condoms are usually translucent, so when you put them on they show your natural skin color. If you're looking for something a little more fun, you can buy condoms in every color you can imagine - turquoise, orange, hot pink, blue, tuxedo (black), and everything in between. Condoms also come in different scents, like cinnamon, mint and cherry.

, Any drugstore will be well-stocked with a variety of condoms. Now that you know more about how to choose a type, size and style that you like, you can browse the condom aisle as an informed shopper.

, This is especially useful if you feel awkward to buy condoms in pharmacy or supermarket. Usually you will get professional advice if you send an email, and your package will arrive in a discreet box to prevent embarrassment.

, Buying a small box of condoms is a lot more expensive than buying them in bulk. Once you figure out what you like, look online for a good deal on a large box of 30 or more condoms.

, Condoms don't last forever, so make sure the ones you pick up haven't expired.

Layer on the makeup.,
Get perfect skin.,
Liven up your personality.,
Clothing.,
Have black long hair, not too long.",How to Act and Look Like Nicole (Snooki)," Makeup really gives Nicole her look.



Eyeshadow. Nicole usually wears a black or gray colored eyeshadow. Just never wear any light eyeshadow colors, such as yellow, light blue or light green.






Lipgloss. Nicole's lips are a pale color. Use lip balm and pale pink or a color that matches your lip color, but one shade lighter.







Mascara and eyeliner. With mascara you don't need a lot. Snooki rarely ever puts on mascara, but you could put one layer. For eyeliner just use a reasonable amount. Not too much for people to notice from 5 feet (1.5 m) away from you.





;
, Nicole's skin is not orange! It's a bronze color. Go to a tanning salon and get a tan. Or, you could just either get a bronzer or foundation because tanning kills your skin.


Avoid acne. Snooki has flawless skin. Try using Proactive or cover it with foundation.

, Snooki has a very fun and frilly personality. She also knows how to have fun and party. Just go crazy and be yourself. Don't be afraid to kiss girls and wear no underwear when you go to the clubs. She is also very emotional at times and doesn't enjoy when her friends/men (such as Pauly D) yell at her.

, Snooki can be outrageous but she's not a slut, she's just unique.


Club. When you go to the club, wear tight and short or medium length dresses with a cute little necklace and some hoop earrings.






At home, try wearing a plain black tee, some white shorts, and some big, fluffy sneaker-like slippers!







, Occasionally wear the ""poof"" on your head using a Bumpit hair accessory.

Don't talk about girly things like clothes, guys, shoes, etc...",How to Disguise Yourself As a Guy," Especially if you are a busty girl, this step could mean the difference between the plan working or failing. Do not use an Ace bandage (as these are designed to get tighter and may lead to breathing difficulties). A sports bra can be used for smaller breasts (A-B), sometimes multiple ones must be layered (but again be careful as too tight a fit can cause problems with your health which may lead to you being discovered). A binder can also be used (such as one from ""Underworks"") but this may be too expensive for a prank. Small breasts may not need binding, a loose shirt or hoodie may hide them.;
, Some guys have long hair, and it's becoming more and more popular, but that doesn't mean your current hairstyle will ever look boyish. You could get it cut short, but, if you're just doing this for a day or two, you might try hiding it under a baseball cap or pulling it back very low on the nape of the neck. If you have a darker complexion, you might consider cornrows, braids, or dreads.

, Most guys aren't into that sort of thing, and will think you are weird if you don't fit in.

, The outfit you choose depends mostly on the type of guy you are trying to ""be"". Hip hop guys are going to dress differently than jocks, who are going to dress differently that punks, goths, emos, nerds...you get the idea. Look around to get an idea of what guys are wearing. Hats are popular.

, Find a pair of bigger shoes (skate shoes are blunt and wide, which helps give the effect of manly feet) and stuff the toes with soft napkins or toilet paper; you don't want your feet crackling with every step.

, Girls have very different legs than guys, and they are usually shaved. Try a pair of really baggy jeans to hide your curves and maybe a loose belt slung low on the hips. Couple this with a really big t-shirt, and you can fit in almost anywhere.

, They will help protect your identity from anyone who might have seen you before or might see you again later.

, Guys don't wear lipstick or eyeshadow. No makeup whatsoever, no matter if your eyes are covered up or not.

, Girls don't usually have Adam's apples, but most guys do. It could be a major tip-off if you don't have one.

, But if you are going through puberty, and guys your age haven't changed voices yet, your regular voice shouldn't need much altering.

, Most guys don't have a problem with it, and you might be looked at oddly if you don't comply.

, If the guys you're hanging with start to go girl-watching or begin flirting with the cuties at the bowling alley or wherever, just tag along, but don't participate. If someone asks you why, just say you have a long-distance girlfriend, and you don't want to be disloyal.

,, Say that your family is just passing through town on a business trip, or that you're moving, and you just stopped by to stock up and continue your drive across the country. This way, when you go back to ""being a girl"", you don't have to cover up for 'that mysterious guy that was around for a couple of days'.

, If someone calls you, and you have to talk in a normal voice or disclose what you're doing, it could mess up your plan.

, 'Alexa' to 'Alex', for example. I wouldn't change it completely (like 'Jessica' to 'Thomas') because you might not respond if one of the guys says a name that's way different from your real one.

, These will work as great conversation starters. Also, if you know something about them, you won't be so lost when the topic switches to them.

, They will see through you in an instant.

Take advantage of the boys section.,

Opt for pants rather than skirts.,
Keep shorts in mind when it's hot.,
Play up the plaid.,

Cut your hair short.",How to Dress Like a Tomboy," If you want to dress like a tomboy, you’ll at least need to check out the source. Head to the boys section of your favorite stores and peruse the racks. Look for graphic tees and distressed shirts. More likely than not, the clothes will be a bit baggy on you but that’s not a bad thing. Pick out things you like and try them on. If they are absolutely humongous, you can always try altering them.


Other great stores that have unisex options include Reebok, Hot Topic, and Tillys. Look for clothes that can be worn by both girls and guys.;
, Loose, comfortable t-shirts are one of the most basic aspects of tomboy style. Cotton shirts in boyish colors (forest green, navy, grey, black, brown, maroon, etc.) are always great to have on hand--and go with pretty much every outfit.


You should also buy some stylized tees. Shirts with band names, skater themes, and skulls (among other styles) are all considered tomboyish clothes. You can also look for shirts with sarcastic or funny images or phrases on them.

, While you don’t have to ditch skirts entirely, tomboys are pretty much defined by not wearing skirts or dresses. Instead, wear cool, comfortable pants that have a boyish look. Stores like Gap sell ‘Boyfriend’ pants that are cut like boys’ pants but are fitted for a girl’s body. Skinny skater pants, distressed or boot-cut jeans, and athletic pants are all good options for a girl wanting to dress like a tomboy. Black, opaque leggings are also great tomboy apparel.


If you do have to wear a skirt for whatever reason, pair it with some leggings, some Converse, and a t-shirt with your favorite band’s logo. These additions will play down the girliness of the skirt.

, Instead of tiny Daisy Duke shorts, try rocking some loose distressed jean shorts or longer shorts that go to just above your knees. Shorts that are made of a stretchier or more athletic material (like board shorts) are great for running around.

, Plaid is a unisex fabric that is a great addition to most outfits. It is an awesome material because it can be worn as a shirt or as a light-weight jacket. Throw on a pair of jeans, a plain cotton shirt, your favorite plaid long-sleeve button-up and you’re good to go.

, Hoodies are a great tomboy staple. Zip-up hoodies and regular sweatshirts are perfect for tomboys in a colder climate. Get a plain hoodie in a dark color (black goes with everything) and you will soon realize you wouldn’t be able to live without it. When you heat up, tie your hoodie around your waist for a nonchalant, boyish look.


You should also try on a cardigan or two. Schoolboy cardigans are also a great cold-weather item. Pair a cardigan with low-slung or boyfriend jeans for a cute tomboy look.

, If jeans aren’t your things, wear sports pants and t-shirts for the easiest outfit to run around in. Better yet, wear sports clothes that represent your favorite teams. Tomboys can keep up with guys on the sports field. Why not dress the part too?Get a sweatshirt with the logo of your favorite sports team for cold days.

, While this section of the article has listed different ways you can dress like a tomboy, being a tomboy ultimately means having the confidence to wear what you want and feel comfortable in without feeling like a slob or unkempt. If you consider yourself a tomboy but feel like wearing a dress, do it. The most important thing is that you remember to be yourself.

, Part of being a tomboy is being able to run around with ease. That means high heels are out. Instead, pick up some comfortable, cool sneakers. A good rule of thumb when buying shoes is to keep in mind that if you can’t run in them, they’re probably not the best tomboy shoes.


Brands that make cool sneakers include DC, Vans, Nike, Adidas, Converse, Etnies, Airwalk and Supras, among other brands.

, In particular, printed slips-on are great. Brands like Vans and Toms, among many others, have great slip-ons that have cool designs, are comfortable, and can still be worn to run around in.Look for slips-on with checkers, skulls, funky animal designs, band logos, tribal art, etc.

, One of the most classic tomboy looks is a pair of converse sneakers. They come in a variety of colors and heights from low-cut to high-top.


To add some extra spunk to your shoes, replace the normal white laces with some funky shoelaces. You can buy these at your local novelty stores.

, Baseball caps are generally the best way to go to top off your tomboy look. Not only can they show off your favorite team, they are also super functional-they keep sun, rain, dirt, and hair out of your eyes. Unless, of course, you rock a backwards baseball cap. You can also rock other types of hats like fedoras or beanies.

, In fact, it’s generally just best to avoid jewelry, particularly if you play sports. If you have your ears pierced, wear studs or tiny hoops rather than dangly earrings (which are generally associated with a girlier look.) For necklaces, choose a simple object like a shell or a coin threaded on a leather string. These can be tucked under shirts when running around and are pretty unisex in nature.


If you like wearing bracelets, avoid sparkly ones. Instead, go for leather bands or plastic bands that can be bought at novelty stores like Hot Topic.

, Ponytails and half-ponies are the way to go when running around. French braids are also a great way to keep your hair out of your face when playing a sport. Wearing your hair up will allow you to sprint off at a moment’s notice without having to worry about getting hair in your eyes.

, Of course, this is only if you want to (and if your parents will let you.) Having short hair is good for playing sports--wear a headband to keep any bangs or fly-away strands out of your eyes.

Consider your family wishes and lifestyle.,
Explore the different types of birth control.,
Be aware of potential risks of different birth control methods.,
Decide on the right birth control method for you.",How to Start Birth Control1," When you decide to use birth control, there are many factors you should consider such as if and when you want children, if you want to take pills or not worry about taking daily medication, and your lifestyle, including if you travel frequently. Thinking about these questions can help you determine the most appropriate form of birth control for you.Make an honest assessment of yourself, your partner and your relationship. If you are not in a monogamous relationship this can also influence your choice(s) for birth control.For example, if you are in a long term relationship and want to wait a few years to have children, you might opt for a long term birth control method such as an intrauterine device (IUD). If you have multiple partners, you may opt for birth control pills and condoms to protect from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.If you are in a long-term relationship, involve your partner in the decision so that you can make it mutually and it fits with both of your lifestyles.
Consider questions such as “do I want to plan every time I have sex?,” “do I want to remember to take a pill every day?,” “do I want to end my fertility permanently?”.You’ll also want to think about your health. For example, if you suffer from migraines, birth control pills may not be a good choice for you.;
, There are many different options for birth control that you can use. Exploring the various types of birth control can help you decide which option is appropriate for you.


You can choose barrier methods that are put on or inserted right before sex including male and female condoms, a diaphragm, a cervical cap, and spermicide.If used properly, these methods can help protect against pregnancy, but you may want to use a secondary method to help ensure that you don’t get pregnant. For example, if you’re using condoms, which have a failure rate of 2-18%, you may want to also use a spermicide.Hormonal birth control, which has a low failure rate of less than 1% to 9%, are a good option if you want to avoid pregnancy and are in a long-term relationship.The different types of hormonal birth control are the Pill, a patch, or a vaginal ring.Birth control pills can have the added benefit that they can help regulate your menstrual cycle.You can choose a long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) method such as an IUD, hormonal shots, or a contraceptive implant if you want to wait to have children. It can take some time to return to fertility after using these methods, but they will not affect your ability to conceive in the long-term.Sterilization is a birth control option if you are sure you never want children. Vasectomies and tubal ligations are generally irreversible procedures and must be seriously considered before making a final decision to go through with them.Natural Family Planning, or NFP, avoids medications and more immediate methods such as condoms altogether. This might be a choice if you can’t use other contraceptives or simply don’t want to use other methods. However natural family planning has a high failure rate and should not be used if a pregnancy would be unacceptable. NFP includes the rhythm method, checking cervical mucus and checking basal temperature, or withdrawal.These methods require a lot of planning and diligence but have the benefit of not costing anything or having side effects., Every birth control method comes with potential risks, including unwanted pregnancy. Being aware of potential risks and side effects of the different birth control methods can help you choose the best method for you.


Hormonal birth control, such as pills, patches, and vaginal rings increase risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but decrease risk of ovarian cancer.
Barrier methods such as condoms, spermicides, and caps can cause allergic reactions and may increase your risk for urinary tract infections or STDs.The risks for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods include perforation of the uterus, increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy, and pain and heavy menstrual bleeding.Although there are no particular medical risks to NFP, you are at an increased risk for unwanted pregnancy because this method isn’t as effective as other forms of birth control., Once you’ve had a chance to explore your different options for birth control, make an informed decision which method is right for you. Not only should you talk to your partner, but also consult with your doctor, who will need to prescribe methods such as birth control pills, LARCs, and sterilization.

Taking birth control pills daily, applying the patch or inserting the vaginal ring after four weeks can help prevent pregnancy. This will also help ensure that your cycle remains regular.If you take the pill at the same time every day, it can help you remember to take it regularly, making it less likely that you forgot and get pregnant.
For some pills, such as the mini-pill, it’s important to take them at the same time every day so they have maximum effectiveness.If you travel frequently, it can be difficult to time these methods exactly. If you are unsure because of time difference when traveling, consider using a backup contraceptive method like condoms until you resume regular use of hormonal birth control.

Inquire with your female friend about makeup, the kinds of clothing that might be flattering to your body type, posture, and feminine mannerisms, like how women walk.;
, Likely, you will not have a wardrobe of female clothing available to you in your size. You'll need to purchase clothing that is flattering to your frame in a feminine way. A secondhand store is a good place to shop for affordable women's clothing. You should also consider purchasing:


A basic makeup kit
A panty girdle
A skirt (knee-length or longer)
A wig or hair extensions
Breast forms & bra
Heeled shoes
Perfume
Pantyhose/tights, You can do this by perusing websites and magazines marketed to the female age group you wish to impersonate. Add these tidbits to whatever comes naturally to you while in your female persona, and you're likely to have a winning combination! Remember, the subjects teenage girls are concerned with will be different from those of middle aged women.


Try to talk to a female friend who is around the age you will be impersonating and ask her where you should direct your research.
It's usually safe to talk about likes and dislikes.By focusing on your new female friends, you'll likely come across as genuinely interested, and this will also take pressure off you while you adjust to a more feminine communication style.
Compliments will also serve to ease you into your new social group, something like, ""You have a stunning sense of style! Where did you get that bracelet?"", Though these may seem simple, a lifetime of spreading your legs as a man while sitting down might make this habit hard to break when you're wearing a dress disguised as a woman. You may have to limber up before going out in public and crossing your legs, but you should try to:


Allow your hips to sway
Shorten your stride
Rotate your shoulders while walking
Keep your knees close together
Keep your elbows in
Move with fluidity and grace, Linguistic analysis has shown that women tend to use polite language and formal expressions more frequently than men. Soften direct expressions like, ""I can't hear you,"" with polite expressions like, ""I'm sorry,"" or ""Pardon me."" A lack of social grace can ruin even the best disguise when impersonating the female gender.

, Especially if you are younger, you may not need to change your voice at all, and some people have voices that could naturally be mistaken for either gender. Avoid pitching your voice too high; oftentimes a husky tone will mask the masculine aspects of your voice more credibly.

, Before you can go out, you'll need a name to complete your female identity. It can be helpful to choose a name based off your own name, as this will be more familiar to you.


You might change John to Joanne, Tim to Tammy, or Alex to Alexa. If you are wearing your disguise to school, you should also come up with a backstory for your female identity.
One plausible backstory you might use at school: ""My family had to come here for my dad's work. We might have to stay a while, so my parents wanted me to come to school so I don't fall behind.""

, They might be currently abused at their home, or they're plain jealous at you because you can do something they can't do (ex. cook)

, There's other girls and boys who have been harassed by the girls too or share the same viewpoint as you. You can also recruit allies such as your friends, people who owe you stuff, and if you're lucky, you may get a teacher on your side.

, They are only telling you these things to make you feel bad about yourself, or simply just to get a reaction out of you. Ignore them and you don't have to do anything they say.

, Or they might just be jealous of you. Just remember you are better then them and don't let there words get to you.

, Girls are going to tell you weird things and make fun of you, do what my friend does, just say, ""I don't care that's your opinion, thanks for the comment!"" They may back off seeing how you don't care or keep doing it. That one's risky, but if it succeeds, they may leave you alone.


If they say something to you mean, try not to let them get to you, and don't be afraid to alert your parents or a staff member at your school about their actions. If the girls get too unruly despite warnings from teachers, you can always get a restraining order, press charges or sue them for verbal abuse and/or slander (spreading rumors that aren't true). You may get some neat compensation from their family, especially if they're wealthy.

Slip on your panty girdle.,
Don your breast forms and bra.,
Accessorize yourself!,
Put on your female clothes and pad your curves.,
Get into character.",How to Disguise Yourself As a Boy or Girl2," Women and men have many different physical characteristics, and you'll be a more convincing female with a narrow, tapered waist. A panty girdle is intended to do just this. This is especially important if you have a masculine body type.


In the event that you have narrow hips already, you may only need to wear a laced corset so you can adjust your torso shape to look more feminine.

, This might not be necessary if you are young enough that your female peers have not yet developed breasts. However, most teens, young adults, and adults will have to pad their chest to give the appearance of having bosoms.


Lack of proper padding can lead to your bra riding up throughout the day, which will be a dead giveaway that you're not what you appear to be.
A bold colored bra, like black or pink, will show more easily through your clothing, which will help convincing others that your disguise is genuine.
If you do not have a breast form, padding will likely be necessary. You can pad your bra by cutting a leg from nude tights, putting birdseed into it, and tying a knot to represent your nipple.
Other padding options include: socks or tissue paper (though these can be lumpy), and sponges cut to the appropriate shape.

, If you don't have pierced ears, you might want to consider buying a pair of convincing clip-ons. Lip gloss or colored chapstick can give a feminine accent to your lips. When applying makeup, try to use natural tones and colors. Bold choices require a light touch and experienced hand, otherwise you might end up looking like a clown!


You should get an impartial second opinion of your makeup job before going out in public. Sometimes what looks acceptable under good light in a mirror can look less than flattering from across the room.
Don't forget:

Bracelets
Eyewear (sunglasses, imitation glasses)
Hats
Necklaces
Purses
Scarves
Stylish belts, A long skirt or dress is an excellent choice of garment while you get used to your female disguise. These will cover some of your masculine features (like the muscles in your legs), while the loose parts of your dress will signify where you likely need padding. In addition to your breast padding, you may also need hip and butt padding to give yourself a convincing feminine figure.Keep in mind that if you wear something that shows your legs or armpits and you have thick or visible body hair, you will probably have to shave to maintain your disguise.

, Talk to yourself using your female name, sashay your hips with attitude, pout your painted lips in the mirror, and run over the details of your backstory. Think back to the research you did on common topics for the female age-group you are impersonating, and remember - you are beautiful!

Enlist the help of a male friend.,
Cut your hair or employ a bald cap and male wig.,
Conceal your cleavage.,
Practice male communication styles.,
Purchase male clothing.,
Practice your man-erisms.,
Determine whether you have a passable voice.,
Gender-bend your name.",How to Disguise Yourself As a Boy or Girl3," His advice will be crucial to identifying areas and mannerisms that you need to make more masculine. Ask him to give you pointers with clothing, a general explanation of popular sports (if necessary), and have him look at and correct your posture.

, Shortening your hair will make your look significantly more masculine. The simplest and easiest way to do this is to go to a male only barber and ask for a ""boy cut."" If the barber refuses, saying that he only cuts men's hair, tell him that you need a boy-cut for a sport you're playing, like baseball, and that your long hair gets pulled out too frequently otherwise.


You can also hide your hair with a baseball hat.
If you can't bear to part with your lovely locks, a bald cap and a male wig might be the way to go.
If you live in a rural area and are concerned the local barber might spoil your disguise, you may want to find a gay or gay-friendly salon.Likely, these establishments will be more willing to help you with your masculine cut.

, If your breasts seem too obvious, try wearing a sport's bra or swimming suit top that is small on you to give your chest a flatter, more masculine appearance. Don't use elastic wrap or tape, which can be harmful to your breasts. If the sport's bra/swimsuit approach doesn't seem to be cutting it, layering several of these may make your breasts look smaller.Breast binding, which is the technical term for using constrictive materials to make your breasts flatter, can be unhealthy if done for a prolonged period of time. If you experience back pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, or a rash, you should stop binding your chest and consult a doctor.It is recommended that you don't bind for more than 8-12 hours at a time., Men and women have very distinct communication styles, and by paying attention to these, you will come across most naturally as one of the boys. The main points to keep in mind are:


Don't talk about personal problems
Participate in good-natured one-upmanship

Man: ""I was tearing it up on Call of Duty last night!""
You: ""Yeah? That's great. Sounds almost as good as my 71 kill streak last Saturday. What was your kill ratio again?""


Ask fewer questions
Be direct in your opinions and thoughtsMan: ""What did you think of the assembly we had earlier today?""
You: ""It was pretty lame.""



, A good place to shop for a new, masculine wardrobe is a secondhand store. You should aim to buy plain colors and simple patterns, clothing like jeans, plaid shirts, cargo shorts, and t-shirts. Over-sized sweaters are also a great option if you have prominent breasts.


Baggy men's clothing, like jeans and sweatpants, are suitable for hiding your curves.
Bite the bullet and buy some men's briefs, boxer briefs, or boxers. Even though it's unlikely anyone will get a good look at your undergarments, a thong peeking out of your sagging jeans could ruin a great disguise.
Avoid ""feminine"" colors, like pastels and shades of pink. A stereotypical disguise will be the hardest for others to see through.
Make it a point hide your feminine features beneath clothing, like shaved legs or armpits. Men rarely shave in these places, and failing to hide your bare legs might compromise your disguise.

, Try not to sway your hips or keep your knees together. Men also stereotypically keep their hands occupied while walking. You can do this by holding something or putting your hands in your pockets. When you sit, sit for comfort and not for consideration. Spread your legs even if there is someone sitting beside you. While sitting, lean back slightly more than you normally do.If you decide to cross your legs while sitting, do so with your ankle on your opposite leg.

, Especially if you are younger, you may not need to change your voice at all, and some people have voices that could naturally be mistaken for either gender. Avoid pitching your voice too high, as this might strain your voice. Oftentimes, a light, quiet tone will come across as the most believable voice for your disguise.


Try to inflect the ends of your sentences upwards, as this is a common characteristic of female speech., Using a name similar to your own might make it easier for you to recognize when you're in disguise, though some prefer something completely different to separate the biological identity from the disguise. For instance, you might change Christina to Christian, Alexa to Alex, or Tory to Troy.


If your name does not easily gender-bend, you might want to use common male name, like that of a close family member.

Suit up in your guy garments.,
Remove makeup and earrings.,
Take a good look in the mirror.,
Apply male product.,
Get into character.,
Relax and remember that less is more.",How to Disguise Yourself As a Boy or Girl4," Most men prefer to put comfort over style, so make sure your clothing fits loosely and is comfortable. This will also help with hiding your curves and breasts. Other items to consider:


Eyeglasses/sunglasses
Baseball cap
Satchel/messenger bag
Wallet
Wristwatch, Though men have been becoming increasingly more trendy in the past decade, your disguise might be most believable if you dress to a stereotype.Stereotypical guys don't wear those kind of accessories, so you might want to leave these out of your male disguise.

, Is there anything you might have missed? Fingernails are a likely culprit, as men rarely have long nails. You may want to trim these and remove any other feminine traces you notice.

, If you look the part, sound the part, but don't smell the part, your disguise might not go over too well. Using a men's deodorant and cologne can lend a scent of success to your disguise. Also, consider using men's hair gel to give your haircut a masculine touch.

, Call yourself by your gender-bent name in your head, go over your backstory, including reasons why you might not know things guys typically would. For example, if you don't know sports very well, you might claim to be a fan of a sport that is out of season.

, Especially since men tend to be more reserved in their communication style, the principle of ""less is more"" will serve you well while around other men.Trying to be over-the-top manly can betray your disguise just as easily as forgotten lipstick.

Spend 10 minutes planning the essay.,
Study the essay question.,
Brainstorm your thesis statement.,
Create an outline.,
Take 15 minutes to write the essay.,
Use a hook in your introduction.,
Write your three body paragraphs.,
Summarize your thoughts in your conclusion.,
Use the last five minutes to proofread your essay.,
Create a title for the essay.",How to Write an Essay in Under 30 Minutes," Before you start writing, take no more than 10 minutes to create an outline for your essay. This may seem like a big chunk of valuable time, but it will save you from having to rewrite or restructure your essay once you start writing., The essay will likely be directed by a question or a prompt, like a quote, with a question. It’s important that you read the question carefully and understand what it is asking of you.


For example, you may get a prompt in the form of quotation: “Time has a doomsday book, on whose pages he is continually recording illustrious names. But as often as a new name is written there, an old one disappears. Only a few stand in illuminated characters never to be effaced.” Henry Wadsworth LongfellowYou may then receive a question attached to the prompt: “Are there some heroes who will be remembered forever? Or are all heroes doomed to be forgotten one day?"" Plan your response, and then write an essay to explain your views on this issue. Be sure to support your position with specific points and examples. You may use personal examples or examples from your reading, observations, or, knowledge of subjects such as history, literature, science., A thesis statement will convey to your reader the points or arguments you are going to make in your paper. It acts a road map for your paper and should answer the question, “What is this paper about?” It should take a stand and announce your position towards the topic.For example, you may brainstorm the Longfellow quote/question by thinking of personal examples of heroes who are remembered or forgotten, such as family members, friends, teachers, or peers who have acted as heroes to you or to others. Or you may focus on a historical figure who seems to be a forgotten hero or a decorated hero.
This essay question is asking for two sides of the discussion, the forgotten hero and the remembered hero. Your thesis should discuss both sides and choose one side to argue for or against.
You may choose to spotlight a historical figure who encountered opposition and challenges in her life, such as the suffragette Susan B. Anthony. Anthony worked tirelessly for decades to get the government to recognize women’s right to vote, and was often derided by the government and by individuals within her own organization. She is a good example of a hero who was not recognized as a trailblazer until late in her life, though she is now remembered as a heroine in history. Try to refer back to the quotation in the essay prompt in your thesis, if possible, to show you have read the entire question.
A possible thesis statement could be: “Though Longfellow argues that names, or heroes, may be forgotten over time, one historical figure, Susan B. Anthony, was derided in her lifetime for her beliefs but is now remembered as a heroine of her time.”

, Make a rough outline of your five paragraph essay:


Introduction: Your beginning paragraph should contain an engaging first sentence and your thesis statement. Some writers find it easier to write create a temporary introduction and revise it once they are finished with the essay. This will ensure the introduction is cohesive with the rest of the essay.
Body paragraph 1-3: Each paragraph should discuss one major point of your thesis, with at least one supporting example.
Conclusion: This paragraph should summarize your main argument and restate your thesis. You may also want to include last thoughts around the essay question.

, Now that you have your thesis statement and your outline, focus on composing content for each part of the essay.Try to spend two to three minutes on each body paragraph. Then, take three minutes on your conclusion paragraph and go back to your introduction. Spend the last three minutes revising your introduction so it matches the tone and perspective of the rest of your essay.

, There are several possible hooks you can use in your essay to draw your reader in.An interesting or surprising example: This could be a personal experience or a key moment in the life of the historical figure you are discussing in your essay. For example, you may discuss Anthony’s childhood as a Quaker and her later adoption of more casual dress and growing interest in social reform at the age of 26.A provocative quotation: This could be from a source you used for your essay or one that feels relevant to your topic. For example, you may use a well known quote from Anthony, such as: “Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing to be anything or nothing in the world's estimation, and publicly and privately, in season and out, avow their sympathy with despised and persecuted ideas and their advocates, and bear the consequences.”A vivid anecdote: An anecdote is a very short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. Think of an anecdote that might be a poetic or powerful way to start your essay.
A thought provoking question: create a question that will get your reader thinking and engaged in your topic. For example: “Did you ever wonder how women received the right to vote in the United States?”

, Focus on fleshing out each paragraph with at least one example of your main point. Sign-post each paragraph by beginning with a strong argumentative point that links to a supporting example of your main point. If you use an essay on Susan B. Anthony as an example:Body paragraph 1: You may start by discussing Anthony’s early successes. Look at the establishment of the Women’s Loyal National League in 1863 by Anthony and Stanton. As the first national women’s political organization in the United States, it had a membership of 5000 and provided a platform for women to speak out on issues like slavery and women’s right to vote.Body paragraph 2: You may discuss Anthony’s mid career struggles. Look at the split in the women’s movement in May 1869, with the establishment of the National Woman’s Suffrage Association (NWSA) by Anthony and Stanton, and the rival American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Note how after the Civil War, Anthony devoted her time and life to the suffrage movement, assuming leadership of the NWSA in 1890 and continuing to advocate for women’s rights. Anthony also remained unmarried, which gave her an advantage under the law, as married women at the time were not permitted to sign official documents and had to defer to their husbands.Body paragraph 3: You may discuss Anthony’s later life, including her many speaking engagements throughout the United States on the need for women’s suffrage and equal rights. Though Anthony died in 1906, and did not live to see the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution, affording women the right to vote in the United States in 1920, her forty years of tireless work paved the way for the legal precedent and gave women a strong sense of empowerment and equality., Make your conclusion clear and to the point. Avoid introducing new ideas or arguments in your conclusion. Instead, restate your thesis and your main points.


For example, you may restate your thesis: “Throughout her life, Susan B. Anthony’s sacrificed her time, energy, and personal livelihood to advocate for women’s rights, proving that though many heroes may be forgotten, their actions will live on in history.”

, Look for any spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors. You may want to read your essay backwards to check for any spelling issues, as you will only be focusing on the words themselves, rather than the meaning of the sentences.

, It can be easier to create a title for your essay once you have finished it. You could use a quotation from the essay, a phrase or term you refer back to often in the essay, or a summary of your main point.


For example, an essay on Susan B. Anthony could have the title: “An Unsung Heroine” or “Susan B. Anthony: An Advocate for Change”.

Get a “work-study” position.,
Look for job opportunities within your department.,
Assess the number of hours you can work per week.,
Consider not working while class is in session.,
Remind yourself of the benefits of work experience.,
Consider non-traditional methods of generating income.",How to Work and Study at the Same Time1," Many colleges and universities offer work-study positions that provide the perfect opportunity to work and study at the same time. Some of these positions are associated with a financial aid award that goes directly towards your expenses as a student, and some are jobs that are only open to student applicants. Types of work-study positions and the specific parameters these positions entail will vary by country, state, and type of institution. Begin your job search by researching opportunities associated with the institution you are attending.Not only are these positions designed for students, they are also more likely to fit into a student’s schedule. Your superiors will be well aware that you are also a student, and will likely take this in to account when scheduling and other specific issues arise.
Examples of positions you may be eligible for as a student include working at the library or in a residential hall.
Keep an eye out for a position that may even offer the opportunity to study while on the clock!
You can likely register on an email list that will notify you when new student positions are posted.;
, For example, if you’re pursuing an anthropology degree bachelor’s degree, see if they anthropology department has any part-time positions open. At larger universities, specific departments will often employ several students to help with administrative tasks, etc.


Working for the department in which you are studying is also a great way to expose yourself to the faculty and students in the department, and stay-up-to-date on any opportunities relevant to your course of study.
Alternatively, ask your favorite professors about good entry level jobs with relevance to your interests. They may even know of a few gigs that other students with your interest have held previously, and may be able to point you in the direction of a potential employer!

, If you’re spending time, money, and energy on an education, it should probably take priority to your job. The important point is that you should make an honest assessment of the time you have available to spend working. Fortunately, you’ve got plenty of options regarding types of jobs to consider. If a weekly part-time seems to be a bit too much, you could always work during breaks in your academic schedule.

, If, for instance, you’re beginning an education program that is extremely involved – such as law school or med school – it may be worth taking out loans to cover you expenses and focusing on your studies. Similarly, if you want to avoid needing to work while studying, consider deferring going to school for a year and work full time to save some money.


If you're studying within an extremely competitive program wherein your success will likely determine the quality of the job you get, it’s likely worth prioritizing your studies. Depending on your discipline, the job you'll end up landing could potentially make short work of your debt.

, If you’re on the fence about working while studying, or if you’re hoping to work more for the sake of experience than financial compensation, there are a few important factors to consider. The “real-world” insights offered by a job are often seen as equally – if not more – valuable than a degree. While many professions will want to see both, getting your foot in the door somewhere may also lead to an easier job search following graduation.Even if your work and studies are completely unrelated, work is still providing you with experience prioritizing responsibilities, communicating, etc.

, One of the classic examples of quick gigs for students is participation in academic studies – some of which pay surprisingly large amounts of money. You can also potentially tutor other students, particularly if you know a language that other students are studying."

Cut and layer your hair.,
Wear a small amount of makeup.,
Wear the right kind of lens in your glasses.,
Don't dress girly.,
Accessorize.,
Get your picture taken.,
Don't expect to change your personality or race.,
Have fun with the style.",How to Be an Ulzzang Tomboy," Many Ulzzang tomboys have short layered hair very similar to the Ulzzang boys. But you don't have to cut all your hair off to achieve the short look, you can tie your hair in a ponytail and tuck it in a hat or tuck it behind the rest of your hair. Many Ulzzang tomboys also keep their hair long at the back and short around the face.


You can style your hair with gels and hairspray. Try keeping it soft and messy with light spikes. It really doesn't matter what colour your hair is but you could dye it a light ginger brown which is very popular with all Ulzzang's.
Remember you don't have to have stick straight hair all the time, as some tomboys like light waves and curls. Keep your hair in good condition and its sure you will look great.;
, Not all tomboys wear make up, but some do to enhance their looks. Its almost always all about the eyes. Use brown or black eyeliner to lightly frame the eyes, you can also make a wing at the end of your eyes to get a more Ulzzang look and maybe some white eyeliner in the bottom water line. You could also try to create Aegyo Sal (the cute eye bags on some Asian Ulzzang's) with white eye shadow, light brown shadow and a very blended brown line around it. Keep it very blended and mixed or you may look silly or tired. Most Ulzzang's apply BB cream to get a smooth and paler looking face and concealer for blemishes.


You can mute out lip colour and make them appear smaller with lip balm and a touch of foundation blended. You may use a black/ grey eyebrow pencil to get thicker neater eyebrows which always looks good on Ulzzang's. Be sure to not cake on the makeup, keep it as minimal as you can't try to get a natural Ulzzang look when you can hardly see your real face!

, Quite a lot of Ulzzang's like to wear circle lenses to get a more wide dolly look. But you really do not have to wear them to look good! Not all tomboys wear them and look amazing without them. If you wish to wear them buy them from a reliable website or shop and clean them with great care. Do not exceed the time you are meant to wear them, you don't want to damage your eyes! Buying black or brown lenses look great and enlarge your eyes more but it can look nice with blue or green ones. Just try to refrain from buying pink crazy lenses. Keep thinking natural. Brands like Geo are recommended.

, For an Ulzzang tomboy look anything can look good. Just don't wear skirts and dresses as it's not very tomboy. Graphic tees, shirts, jeans and boots is a simple idea for a tomboy outfit. There are many videos on youtube which can help you when choosing out an outfit for the style. Do not be afraid of shopping in the men's section you can find some great things in there. Hoodies always look nice. Gmarket and Zipia are great websites for buying and getting inspiration for Ulzzang outfits. You could also try to get your hands on some Mr Rich clothes but it is a very hard task unless you want to bid or go to Korea for them. Don't show loads of skin as it can be seen as quite inappropriate in Asia. Some tomboys bind their breasts for a more boyish look. Websites like T-Kingdom sell good quality binders.

, Accessories can make an outfit! They make it a whole lot more fun and interesting. Buy colourful belts, beanie hats in different colours, belt chains and dog tags, boots and sneakers, wrist bands, boot socks, other awesome hats, ties, glasses. A lot of Ulzzang's wear glasses which look cool. Black retro oversized glasses are very popular. You can pop out the lenses if you don't need them as they can create glare in photos and remove focus on your eyes. Earrings, some tomboys have a few ear piercings which can look great with colourful studs but don't feel you need them. Don't be afraid to accessorize but not too girly, you are wanting to be a tomboy!

, Ulzzang's are popular all over the world because of photos. They want to be seen but of course you don't need to post pictures of yourself all over the internet if you don't want to! Pose for pictures with your friends in different settings and angles. You don't have to look serious in any of your pictures just smile or make a funny or cute face. Make sure you are having fun and don't ever feel you need to always take pictures of yourself as you will just end up looking vain. You can edit pictures to get your desired look but be true to yourself and don't make yourself unrecognizable.

, Being an Ulzzang doesn't have to mean changing yourself completely to fit Korean/ Asian ideals. Any race can be Ulzzang and look lovely. Keep your own personality and don't let yourself become obsessed with everything Korean and Asian.

, Don't put yourself down if you think it doesn't look exactly right. You don't have to stay in this style all the time, mix it up, its your own body and mind!

Get a badass job.",How to Be a Tough Girl," If you want to be tough, you first have to start accepting yourself for who you are. If you prefer staying up late to read science-fiction, as opposed to keeping up with the hottest television show, so be it. If a group of people think something’s funny, but you don’t, so what? Pretending to be someone you’re not is an obvious sign of insecurity or weakness. People can easily pick up on it, and you surely won’t look so tough if someone calls you out on it.;
, This goes hand-in-hand with step 1. If you’ve accepted who you are, then you have the groundwork you need to become self-confident. What does this have to do with being a tough girl? Easy. If you’re confident and comfortable in who you are, then you can confidently handle any situation that comes your way. You’ll be confident in your beliefs and the decisions you make. And you won’t be afraid to let others know it. Here are some ways you can improve your self-confidence.Make a list of things you admire about yourself, your strengths, and achievements on a sheet of paper. Turn a blank sheet of paper horizontally and either fold into thirds or simply draw two vertical lines to create three columns. In each column, write at least five things you like about yourself, at least five things you feel you’re great at, and at least five things you’re proud to have achieved. Do you think you have a great smile? Do you have a knack for making people laugh when they’re feeling down? Are you proud of the evening you spent feeding the homeless? Write down whatever comes to mind. Read over your list often as a reminder of how great you are.
Think positively about yourself. Pinpoint a couple qualities about yourself (maybe some that you wrote down in your list) and think about them often. Another tip: take those negative thoughts and reverse them. If you’re thinking, “I hate the way I look,” you could say: “My eyes are really pretty.”
Dress to feel better about yourself. If you feel your wardrobe doesn’t reflect the real you or make you happy, find clothes that do. If you have a favorite top, find more tops with similar qualities. Choose clothing that enhances the physical features you admire. If you have a great pair of legs, put on a pair of shorts or find a dress that lets you show them off. Part Two on how to look like a tough girl will show you how to update your wardrobe to reflect your new tough girl persona.
Exercise regularly. Go walking or jogging daily. Take up a sport or participate in a group exercise you might enjoy. While this will help you feel better about yourself, it will also help you feel tougher as your muscles grow.

, Tough girls could care less what others think of them because they realize one very important thing: what another person thinks has nothing to do with them. Tough girls don’t measure their self-worth by other people’s opinions. Once you let go of the importance of what people think, you gain power in difficult situations, and you become tougher., When you learn not to take things personally, you become better able to deal with rejection and criticism. Most people who don’t feel tough, feel they can’t handle challenging situations. Being tough means you push through those difficult moments. So when faced with a situation where someone confronts you, be cool and calm. Don't let it faze you. Act as if that person is wasting your time.

, Being tough isn't about looking mean and having bulging biceps, it's about being able to take whatever comes. Cultivate an inner calm that can't be unsettled by other people. You can walk around acting tough all day long, but if you are easily upset, your toughness will be perceived as a façade.

, If you want to be tough, then you need to surround yourself with tough people who can give you advice and backup if needed. You can learn from these friends by listening to and watching how they hold their ground in tough situations.

, Intimate relationships are a good place to gauge how tough you are. There’s usually one person in the relationship who takes on the more dominant role. It’s a good idea to make sure the dynamic of your relationship is a healthy one.


Take notice of how you act around your significant other. Do you find yourself mostly doing activities, watching certain movies, or eating meals that appeal only to your sweetheart? If so, you need to toughen up and take a more assertive role as a partner.
To be tougher in your relationship, start by speaking up about what you like. If you’d prefer to a nice hearty burger instead of sushi, let your significant other know. If you want to watch a romantic comedy instead of a thriller, suggest watching your preferred movie one night and your significant other’s the next. Healthy relationships have balance. Allow equal time for your significant other and you to explore both of your interests together.
If you have a disagreement, don’t think you need to scream and shout just to stand up for what you believe. Let your significant know that you acknowledge his or her feelings or point of view, and then be honest and open about your feelings and needs. State your opinion directly, without being apologetic.

, Tough girls aren’t known for their bubbly personalities. An easy way not to smile is to scowl. To do this bite down on the insides of your cheeks, which will turn the corners of your lips downward., If your current wardrobe consists primarily of floral prints and bright colored frocks, you’ll need to make a change.The color black is a primary color in the tough girls’ wardrobe. So consider wearing all-black outfits or outfits in which a primary piece is black. Wear ripped denim, and clothing with a skull and bones theme.
Pick out ripped denim and clothing with a skull and bones theme.
If you don’t already own these two items, make sure you purchase a motorcycle jacket and a nice pair of leather boots.
Incorporate tough-girl accessories. Accessories will help pull your outfit together, and help emphasize your tough-girl image. Spikes are a common accessory that can be found on bracelets, rings, or parts of your clothing, like the collar of a blouse or the sleeves of a jacket. You can also look for jewelry with the skull and bones image. Pick up a pair of dark sunglasses to toughen up your look. Hiding your eyes will make you seem mysterious and unapproachable.

, Some noticeably tough-looking hairstyles include short, spiky hairdos and fauxhawks or Mohawks. You can shave one or both sides of your head. Or ask your stylist to give your hair a pop of color, like neon blue or purple.

, Choose a bold (typically dark) lip color, dark eyeshadow, and thick mascara. The heavy colors will darken your expression, and give you the “don’t mess with me” look you want.

, Tough girls choose their words wisely, and speak only when necessary. By not talking, they come off as mysterious. People tend to fear mysterious. How to communicate without talking? Respond with body language, like a turn of your head or a grunt., Assertiveness is the essence of toughness. If you want people to take you seriously, and if you want to appear tough, then you must learn how to be assertive.


There are two ways to be assertive – through your body language and by what you say.
To show your assertiveness towards someone: face them directly, keeping your back straight, and look them straight in the eye.
Remain calm, but firm when you speak. Make sure whatever you say is direct and honest. State your point of view without being hesitant and without being apologetic.
To sound tough, start off by saying to someone ""Listen...” Speak strongly and get right to the point. And then at the end say ""You understand me?"" and wait for their response.

, When things need to get handled, tough girls step in. You must be willing to take control of a situation.


If you’re with a group of friends, move to the front of the pack, so people know you’re the leader and the one they’ll have to deal with.
If you and your friends are getting picked on or treated unfairly, speak up.
Stand your ground by standing in their way or getting in their personal space. You can do this without expecting things to suddenly get physical. At about a foot and a half from someone you’re considered to be in their personal space. Once you get close, speak firmly., Physical activity is a great way toughen up physically and mentally. You’re not only strengthening your body, you’re also developing the discipline you need to handle difficult situations.


Lift weights to tone your body and build muscle mass.
Join a self-defense class like kickboxing or martial arts. While you’ll not only learn how to better protect yourself, you may also gain a new group of tough-girl friends.
Participate in a contact sport, like flag football, roller derby, or soccer.
Participate in activities that force you to push yourself. Being tough is about being able to handle what comes your way, and being able to hang in there even when you’re outside of your comfort zone. Marathons are a great way to do this. Join 5K marathon, if you’re just starting out. If you’re daring, or looking for something more adventurous, look for a themed marathon. The Dirty Girl Mud Run is a good example.

, Consider becoming a police officer, bounty hunter, self-defense instructor, or a member of the military. With one of these jobs under your belt, you’ll never be accused of not being tough enough. All require you to achieve a heightened level of physical fitness. And there will be moments where you’ll have to be aggressive and even confrontational.

Make your posture relaxed, but erect.,
Repeat this to yourself in your head: chin up, neck long, shoulders back, chest out, abs tight, pelvis forward, and buttocks tight.,
Make a conscious but discreet effort to arrange your body as slightly pigeon-toed (i.e.,

Also, pretend that there is a string attached to your sternum (breastbone) that lifts your chest toward the sky to hold your ribcage up off of your pelvis and to pull your navel into your back.;
, At first you may feel that you are leaning back a little and you should be able to feel pressure and length in the small of your back (i.e. the lumbar area of your back which curves between your ribcage and pelvis). Stand tall and breathe calmly through your nose.

, toes pointing forward and inward and heels outward) and slightly knock-kneed (i.e. knees bent and pointing forward and inward and hips outward) and slightly knock-elbowed (i.e. elbows bent and pointing backward and inward to meet behind your spine and bent wrists outward). Let your arms hang with your elbows bent. Your wrists should fall near to the back of your thighs. This stance enhances stability, flexibility and places emphasis on the ultimate feminine attribute (i.e. curvaceous hips).

The four main classes of the feminine form are the hourglass, the pear, the ruler and the apple based on the shape and proportion of the ribcage the waist and the pelvis. Traditionally, the classic ideal figure has the vital statistics 36-24-36 in inches for the measurement of the bust-waist-hips. Feminine sex appeal, according to scientific research corresponds to a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 (obtained by dividing the narrowest waist measurement by the widest hip measurement).Keeping healthy and maintaining good muscle tone and personal fitness will enable you to carry yourself with charm, simplicity and elegance with any frame.

, Allow your soul to come out from your eyes, relax your jawline, relax your lips to form an ideal shape. Focus sharply on the present moment, on your personal performance, and on your immediate surroundings (i.e. focus exclusively on one moment at a time, one breath at a time, and one step at a time, as you are immersed in your environment). Present the best possible you in each and every present moment.

, The majority of weight shifts should occur near your center of gravity, which is between your thighs and belly button. Aim for your footprints to form a single line as if you are walking on tightrope. This motion dictates the extent to which your hips and arms swing. Keep your head and shoulders relatively still as your body moves and try to appear as though you are walking into the wind to push your shoulders back and force your pelvis to lead you forward.

, ball-flat footwork), to make the steps feel and look like you are pushing into the floor. Synchronize the motion of each bent knee with that of the ball of the foot below it for greater control. Alternatively, you can instead synchronize the motion of each bent knee with that of the heel of the foot below it if you prefer to execute a heel-to-toe strut.

, Lift your foot a moderate distance off the ground with your knee bent, and then place it down a moderate distance in front of the supporting leg. As a knee bends, the same hip drops (and causes the other hip to rise), and as a knee straightens, the same hip rises (and causes the other hip to drop). If you wish to add a bounce in your walk, do it by making complete weight changes (i.e. allow each hip to abruptly drop when you bend and raise the knee on the same side of your body as your weight is transferred to your hip from the foot below it).

, For example, if you wish to look over at something or someone, move your eyes first until they cannot move any more, then move your head, then your torso and adjust your lower body last and only when necessary. Always return to your most relaxed state and never maintain a tense position.

, Arrange your left foot slightly in front of your right foot (your left knee should be slightly bent), and these toes should point forward and slightly inward with only some of your weight bearing on the ball of this foot. Your right foot should be almost directly behind your left foot and turned to the right to be perpendicular to it, and these toes should point to your right and slightly inward with most of your weight bearing on the ball of this right foot. Attempt to gently bend your knees toward each other to exude more panache. Additionally, your body should be turned to position your right elbow behind your right hip, and you should delicately turn your head toward your nearest shoulder (i.e. your left shoulder) to complete the pose.

Assess the number of credit hours you can handle.,
Take advantage of any crossover.,
Keep your boss informed.,
Consider switching jobs.",How to Work and Study at the Same Time2," You want to make sure the time, money, and energy you’re investing in your studies are worth potentially working less or having an extremely busy schedule. For instance, if you’re going to school to earn a higher degree while working a career-oriented job you already enjoy, your job may take precedence.Some students work full time while attending school part time. This may work especially well for supplementary degrees.
Talk to a counselor at whatever school you’re considering about class or program options that will work for your work schedule.

, If you have solid job, you likely want to keep it, and may even be working towards a promotion. Having a degree may even help you pursue the career goals you’re already working towards. Fortunately, you may be able to incorporate the experience you’re gathering at work into academic assignments as well.


For instance, if you your job requires you to monitor the business’s social media account, you can likely apply the knowledge you’re acquiring at work to a marketing assignment in a business class.
You may even be able to select topics for assignments based on your job. For example, if you are assigned a project on designing a new marketing campaign, you could model the campaign on the business you’re already working for, and win points with both your professor and your boss in the process.

, Avoid inundating your employer with the specifics of your schedule outside of work. However, it is worth telling them ahead of time when you know you’ll be tied up with academic responsibilities. Especially if you’re only studying part-time and working more consistently, you should remind your boss when finals are coming up. Let them know as early as possible to make it easy for them to accommodate a bit more time off for you., If you need to work but are trying to acquire some credits towards a degree, consider switching to a job that will offer a more flexible schedule or a lower time commitment. Particularly if the job you have now is unlikely to allow for career advancement, you may be able to find a job that will keep a paycheck coming while allowing a bit more time for work.


For instance, lots of service industry positions can allow for evening-and-weekend-only work schedules. Accordingly, they may also allow you to take an extra class.
Consider a job bartending or serving at a popular restaurant or bar. These positions, though sometimes challenging, have the potential to earn you a high hourly wage, and are potentially less likely to be a source of distraction when you’re not at work.

"
"
Keep a detailed schedule.,
Schedule time to work on specific academic tasks.,
Establish cooperative relationships with your classmates.",How to Work and Study at the Same Time3," Get in the habit of keeping a weekly plan for yourself and ensure that you set aside time for your studies every day. This can be written in a tangible calendar, or electronically with one of various electronic scheduling programs. Vary the study times to fit in with other commitments, including your job as well as exercise and social engagements., As soon as you receive assignments or are made aware of an upcoming test date, schedule specific blocks of time to prepare. You may also need to adjust your work schedule to ensure you don’t work the evening before a big project is due or an exam is scheduled.At the start of the term, transfer everything from each class’s syllabus into your calendar, so you know exactly when important dates are coming up.
One good practice to try out is studying for an hour or two either right before or after each shift you work.
Once you’ve got a good week plan in place, try to stick to it. For example, don’t pick up a shift if it will cut into time you intended to study, unless you know you can make up that study time the next day.

, The proliferation of easy-to-use communication and information sharing technologies has made collaborative learning not only more feasible, but more beneficial. That said, it’s even better to sit down with other students and work through challenging material together.Include cooperative studying sessions in your weekly schedule – perhaps at the campus café every Thursday evening?
Make use of group message boards, which are often even facilitated by the class itself. If one does not already exist, make one and invite your classmates using their school email addresses.

"
"
Find or set up a reliable place to study.,
Commit to several study sessions per week.,
Study with a specific goal in mind.",How to Work and Study at the Same Time4," Find a go-to spot where you can know you can go and focus on your studies. This applies to getting quality study time in general, which is all the more important if you’re working as well. Whether it’s a particular nook in the library or a clean desk in your bedroom, make sure the time you spend studying is productive by placing yourself in an environment free of distraction.Make sure to avoid rooms with televisions or other things that may draw your attention.
Turn your phone off, and put on headphones if other people are around. If you listen to music, choose music without lyrics to help you focus.
Get in the practice of keeping everything you need to study all together, perhaps in the place you study or in a backpack.

, It may be tempting to get all of your school work done in one or two marathon sessions each week. However, your memory and focus will work better in one or two hour sessions. Accordingly, avoid trying to get all of your schoolwork done in one sitting.To keep sessions consistent, get in the habit of studying at the same time four or five days a week.
The regularity that results from a consistent study schedule will also make your study sessions more productive. Your mental focus will be improved, as your brain will anticipate focusing on schoolwork for that part of the day.
Having regularly scheduled study sessions also means you can occasionally miss a study session as long as you get back into the routine as quickly as you’re able.

, This will help you avoid procrastinating, and it will make your study sessions more productive. Sitting down with a specific task or goal in mind will provide direction that can help you get right to work. Further, if you have multiple tasks to complete, you should start with the most challenging or most important task first.Since more emotional and mental effort will be required to comprehend challenging material, address it first while your mind and body are fresh and focused. More routine, busy work can be accomplished as you coast through the later part of a study session.
Revisit your class notes before starting an assignment. It’s very important to fully understand the specific requirements, as well as the learning objective, or assignments before you begin.

"
"
Take time to decompress.,
Exercise.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Eat with health and energy in mind.,
Know your limits.",How to Work and Study at the Same Time5," In other words, schedule time for casual play as well. Even if it feels like you don’t have the time to spare, it’s important to take a break to let your mind recuperate. You can’t always work and study! Ideally, plan social activities with friends – the more physically active, the better.Even on especially busy days, take breaks. Go for a walk around the block, and leave your phone at home. Try not to think about what you’re working on. Instead, appreciate the way the sun and air feel on your skin, the color of the leaves, the angles of a building you’ve never noticed before.
Try working for about 50 minutes, and taking a 10 or 15 minute break before hunkering down for another 50 minute session of focused studying or working.
Plan a trip – whether to Vegas, or a campsite just out of town – to follow an especially busy period of time. Not only will the trip allow you to decompress, it will provide something for you to look forward to in the meantime.

, Your body requires maintenance to be able to run on all cylinders, and to allow your mind to stay focused throughout the day. In particular, make a point of scheduling three to four 30 minute cardio sessions every week. If you don’t know when to schedule them, try getting up a bit earlier and going for a jog before you start the day.Though it may be challenging to include exercise in your routine initially, stick with it! You’ll soon be looking forward to each session!

, It’s often tempting to stay up later, cramming in a bit more study time or a final prep session to prepare for work the following day. However, it’s often more important to ensure you’re getting enough sleep. Specific requirements vary from person to person, but shoot for eight hours a night.Learn the specific amount of you need by sleeping without an alarm for three days in a row next chance you get. The amount of time you naturally sleep for on the second and third nights is likely what your body requires.
Try to get at least seven hours a night.
If you find yourself sleeping in on the weekends, this is a sign your need more sleep during the week.

, Another trap of busy work and study lifestyle is eating grab and go meals that may be quick, but are often unhealthy. Instead of hitting a fast food restaurant for lunch, slip into a grocery store and grab some hummus with veggies or a pre-made salad. Grab a few pieces of fruit as well, to eat later in the afternoon, both as a healthy treat and an energy boost.Eat breakfast. Not only will this help sustain you throughout the day, it keeps your metabolism in a healthy rhythm. Try whole grain granola with Greek yogurt, sweetened with honey or fruit.
Keep healthy snacks with you. Raw or lightly salted nuts are a great option.

, If you’re constantly stressed, tired, or otherwise not feeling well, you may need to slow down a bit. Whenever you’re feeling overworked, talk to your boss about taking a week off from work. Use the time to catch up on rest and focus on your school assignments. On the other hand, if the amount of coursework you have is detrimentally affecting your standing at work, talk to a school counselor about your options or plan to take less credit hours next term.

Work closely with your advisor to balance your course load.,
Understand how much time you’ll need to spend studying.,
Read your syllabus carefully.,
Sit in the front of the classroom.,
Take advantage of your professors' office hours.",How to Study During Engineering So That You Pass in Exams1," If you are planning to take 12 course credits, make sure they aren’t all engineering courses. Give your brain a break from math by adding a humanities course to the mix. Your advisor can help you to balance your schedule between engineering and non-engineering courses. , Most professors expect that for every engineering course credit you take, you will spend 2-4 hours studying. So, if you have two engineering courses in a standard semester, that’s six credits. That means you will need to spend an average of 18 hours studying outside of class per week. Make sure you have the time before you commit to the courses!

, Find out up front what the expectations will be. Make a note of important items, such as:


The policy on tardiness and absences. If a professor will fail you after three tardies or unexcused absences, you’ll want to pay close attention to be present and on time.
Assignment due dates. Is there homework due weekly? Daily? Make sure you understand how the coursework is structured.
Tests and test dates. If you aren’t a good test-taker, and the course grade is solely based on three test scores, this might not be the right class for you.

, This will eliminate the urge to fall asleep or get distracted. You will also be able to see and hear better, and it'll be easier to ask questions. Your professors will also be more motivated to see you succeed if you appear to be making an effort.

, You can usually find these at the top of your syllabus. Don’t be afraid to connect with your professors and ask them questions! They want to help you learn. And sometimes they can give you extra clues on what to expect to see on the test. "
"
Take good notes.,
Read ahead.,
Attend class and pay attention.,
Study the material that is being covered, as you go along.",How to Study During Engineering So That You Pass in Exams2," Don’t try to rely on your memory! You will be able to refer back to those notes later when you get stuck on a homework problem or while studying for a test. You can also highlight any parts that you might need to discuss with a tutor. , Come to class having already read the material that will be covered. This will give you an opportunity to ask more effective questions, and go back over anything you didn't understand while you were reading through it. But, you don't necessarily need to understand it all during the first read-through.

, Even if you don’t understand everything that is covered, you’ll be able to take notes and ask questions, and it’ll make more sense when you go back over it later. You will learn more by being present than you will by trying to catch up later. Engineering is a language of its own; the more time you spend listening to it, the easier it will be to understand it over time.

, Don’t wait until just before a test to begin studying. Engineering classes build progressively, and tests tend to cover both old and new material -- if you don’t understand something, address it immediately and work to fully understand it before moving on. This way, the days before a test can be spent going back over the things you need the most help with.

"
"
Study with a group.,
Prepare study materials.,
Do as many practice problems as you can.",How to Study During Engineering So That You Pass in Exams3," Chances are, some of you will understand things that others don’t, and vice-versa. In a group, you can trade knowledge and help each other through things. It will also help you stay alert and focused.


Talk to other students in your class, fraternity, or sorority to form a study group, or contact the Academic Services office at your school to find other students who are interested in forming a group.
Meet in a quiet, private place where your group can focus.
Come prepared to your group meetings, with an idea of the content that needs to be covered.Be an active participant -- listening to others work through a problem will not prepare you to work through it yourself.
Offer your knowledge. Teaching someone else how to work through a problem can cement your own understanding.

, Engineering courses range from calculus to chemistry, and require different tools depending on the information you need to study.


Use flash cards to memorize definitions.
Keep a “cheat sheet” of formulas that you can memorize and refer to as you’re working through practice problems.
Draw and study any relevant diagrams.

, You can’t rely on memorization for engineering and science classes. Repetition is key; how you work through problems in practice is how you will work through them on the test.


Work through as many types of examples as you can to make sure that you can apply your knowledge to multiple scenarios and variations. You can rework assigned homework problems or look for extra problems in your text book.
Assess each problem to determine what kind it is: general derivation, straight calculation, or design problem.Determine what formulas you need for each problem.
Engineering problems tend to have multiple parts. If you get stuck on one, identify and solve for any elements you do know.Always double check your math, including the numbers you’re working with and any units of measurement.

, Jerseys and band t-shirts can work. If you want your boy clothes to seem a little more scene, wear accessories and dress a little more colorfully.

, Eyeliner is usually all people need, it brings out the eyes. If you don't want to wear too much makeup your can go for the natural scene kid look just like lee lightning does. Eyeliner can be applied in many ways, it doesn't matter which one you choose, as long as it's applied well. It's a good idea to carry eyeliner everywhere with you.

, Pink converse would be girly. Blue, gray, black or any with designs would be good. High heels wouldn't give you a tomboy appearance either. However, high heels are acceptable for formal occasions.

, People don't seem to notice it, but girly girls laugh a tad more differently than tomboys. Stay down to earth (don't cry over a broken nail, or an eyeliner smudge, etc).

, Love everything, don't diss the stuff you don't like. Especially in music, scene kids tend to listen to bands like Cobra Starship, The Academy Is..., Panic! At The Disco, etc. However, they're also seen listening to hip-hop and pop music. Always listening to emo bands, will obviously make you seem emo and not scene.

, Once again, a scene kid is not an emo kid. Emo kids are known for being depressed and dark. To make sure you don't give away that image, smile and laugh.

, This can mean getting a Myspace, Buzznet, Facebook, Live Journal, etc. There are many websites out there. This step is optional since many people might not be allowed to for safety concerns. However, if you do get/have a profile, pictures of you being scene would be nice.

, Sure, you can stand in the back and smile, or just make a kissy face, but scene kids often have unique poses when it comes to photography. Standing in front of a mirror and showing off hair is fairly annoying to people, and it's also too common. Pictures of you being goofy with your friends, or writing something on your hand and showing it off (hopefully it's appropriate) can work. You need to be creative when it comes to posing.

, This too, is optional as many people won't be allowed. Piercings have been a part of the scene culture for as long as the stereotype has existed. Over doing it with many piercings can be a little un-pretty sometimes. Even a simple nose ring can work. Piercings that scene kids tend to have are septum, eyebrow, nose, lip, labret and monroe.

Save assignments that you can complete quickly and easily near the bottom of the list. Try to do these towards the end of your night when you’re exhausted.
Any assignment that isn’t due next day should be completed on another night.

, Figure out what time you need to complete your work by. If you have school the next day, you’ll need some time in the morning to shower and prepare, so factor in an hour to get ready.

Schedule high priority assignments early in the evening, when you’re still at your best.
Schedule in a ten minute break every two hours. Use this time to get up and walk around and give your brain a break.

As the night goes on, increase the time between caffeinated beverages.
If you feel yourself falling into a slump, take a multivitamin.

Don’t do a full workout – instead, do some quick exercise in the form of 10 pushups, 10 jumping jacks or 10 sit ups.

Turn off your phone, move out of the room with the TV in it and stay away from the Internet as much as possible.If you know you can’t go all night without checking Facebook, deactivate your account for the night. You can reactivate it as soon as all your work is done.
Give your social media passwords to a friend or parent for the evening so you can’t break in to check your accounts.

, Staying up all night is already challenging enough – it won’t help you to try to work on more than one assignment simultaneously. Stick to the schedule you created earlier and don’t jump around between assignments.Use your priority list from earlier and cross every item off the list when it’s completed.
When an item is crossed off the list, move on to the next assignment.

, Staying up all night is hard and you deserve a reward for doing so. The reward can be big, like buying a new shirt or DVD for completing all your work. Or you can reward yourself intermittently throughout the night.Every time you finish an assignment, throw a five minute dance party. You’ll get some exercise in and you can listen to your favorite song.
Give yourself five minutes to check your phone after completing an item on your to-do list.

, When you're working hard, taking a break might seem counterintuitive, but it's actually very important. Breaks keep you from getting bored, help you retain information and give you a moment to evaluate your work from afar.Take 10 - 15 minutes every two hours to grab a snack or take a walk.
If you feel overwhelmed, take a 10 minute break to meditate.

It might not be the best idea to get a binder for every class.,
Find a personal preference.,
Clean out your folders every month.,
If you keep a day planner to keep track of assignments, rip out the pages once a week.,
Have fun with it!",How to Stay Organized in School," Most of the time your teachers will give you a list of supplies needed at the start of the year, but bring a few things like a pencil and some paper for the first day if you're not sure exactly what to bring. Also, a binder with a pocket is awesome.;
, If your teacher wants you to have a section for each part of class, make sure that you have the space for the separate things.Tip: Buy a folder that has many pockets and have 1-2 sections of it for each subject.

, If you want to, bring a portable pencil sharpener, but that may not be necessary as most teachers generally have pencil sharpers available for you to use. You could also get a pencil sharpener for your house, but bring 3-5 pencils to class. Also, make sure you have a spare pen if you run out of ink. If you have a locker, get a pencil holder to put in your locker. Put extra pencils/pens in there so that if you need an extra and you don't have one, it's in your locker.

, What if you have no homework except for a few worksheets? Why bring all of them home? Try combining a few subjects into one larger binder, by using dividers.

, Your teachers may want you to get big binders, but others might not care. Find what suits you and use it for whatever classes you have a choice in.

, Often homerooms will set aside a homework or study hall time, and you can clean out your binder during this time. Recycle anything you have tested on or covered already. Often (especially in middle school) the topics in a class will last only a week or two. Unless the teacher specifies to keep a worksheet, copy the information into your notebook and then recycle the worksheet. This way, if you happen to drop a notebook, papers don't fly all over.

, Make sure to keep the current week intact. If you rip out the old pages and keep papers in a folder instead of your planner, the load will not be as heavy.

, Organizing and getting your papers neat CAN be fun. If you have a HUGE binder, take everything out, organize it, put it back in, and look at what you did! You could make it half as big as it was before! That's also better for you, because it's half as heavy!

, Have an imaginary conversation with someone you love that has passed on. What would they say about where you are in life now? What would they say about what the afterlife is like?

, Imagine the world as it is now but with some vastly different change. For example, what would your life be like if you lived in a world where vampires ruled the different countries? What about if whales could talk?

Change the language setting on your friend's cell phone.
Spread a layer of cream cheese or melted white chocolate at the top of your roommate's deodorant.

Invest in a pirate ship.,
Recruit a pirate crew.,
Get a talking parrot.

",How to Be a Pirate Girl1," This can be any kind of boat or ship. You must fly the Jolly Roger. Cannons are optional, but highly recommended.;
, Salty sea dogs are preferred, but landlubbers will do as well.

Wear a lot of bandanas!,
Choose appropriate colors.,
Select a suitable fabric and design.,
Wear ""gold"" jewelry.",How to Be a Pirate Girl2," Especially ones with skull and crossbones designs or red and black ones. When not wearing a bandana, make your hair a bit messy. You can also use an eye patch; get one at your local costume store.

, White, ivory, beige, cream and tan peasant shirts are great for the look. Skull t-shirts are also great. Plain black, white or beige shirts with cut-off sleeves are a great addition to your wardrobe. Brightly colored long sleeve button ups are piratey. Just make sure they are loose, not stiff like a shirt a corporate executive might wear to the office. And make sure you leave all of it untucked but the very front, creating a sagging look (regardless of how it's finished) and unbutton the top few buttons.

, Capris, capris, capris or large cotton harem pants. These are incredibly piratey if they have the right knicker-looking characteristics! Avoid denim and other recent additions in fabrics. Stick to hemp, cotton, wool and other natural fabrics. Keep them in brown and natural colors. It's a good idea to tear of the hem to make them look a bit more tough, but also keep them baggy, because they would have been real knickers, stolen from men. If you live in a cooler climate, you should probably wear long, flowing pants in the winter. Avoid short skirts. You could wear calf length skirts with harem pants and tall boots.

, Costume jewelry is perfect for this--what would you have pilfered from another ship?

Style your hair.,
Consider getting a tan if you have fair, beige, or golden skin.

,
Wear a warm blush, a shade or two darker than your natural skin tone.,
Use subtle eyeshadow; stick to earth tones, or don't wear any at all.,
Make your lips a shade of red, flesh colored, a natural color or no color.,
Use nail polish sparingly.,
Keep your hands and feet rough and callused.,
Don't even dare to try to act ""cute"".",How to Be a Pirate Girl3," If you have dark skin, then dreadlocks are good. Black, light brown, dirty blond and red are all great, but your natural shade will work too. If dreadlocks do not work for you, braid your hair into numerous tiny braids to achieve a similar effect. This can be done at a hair salon, with an electric hair-braider. If you have a very patient friend with nimble fingers, this will also work. Alternatively, you can just wear your hair messy, and kind of sloppy.

,, It should be swept under your cheekbones to make them stick out.

, Mascara is okay, as long as it's black or brown. The same goes for eyeliner.

, Keep the shine to a minimum if any. Avoid lip liner. You don't have to wear lipstick or gloss at all.

, Pirates never had nail polish, but if you feel naked without it, wear a clear, black or flesh toned coat. Keep your nails about the length of a well-groomed guy's nails. Let the dirt build up underneath!

, Walk around barefoot to improve this. Avoid wearing any footwear.

, Pirates are not cute, and your goal in this is not to be a ""sweet but kind of sexy pirate-ish gal"". That will just be embarrassing.

Have a pirate personality and have pirate hobbies to complement your pirate looks.,
Strut like you are absolutely arrogant but not too popular.,
Gesture a lot, and talk with your hands.,
Talk like a pirate!

,
Be proud, be strong, an' flaunt your pirattitude!,
Never never hit, kick, or insult the ones you love.,
Do NOT go overboard or you’ll get wet.",How to Be a Pirate Girl4," Be funny and witty as much as possible. Act tough and like you're popular. Pirates are always somewhat arrogant. Have fun boating. Fencing is also great. You can play cards and dice, but don't use real money, use ""pieces of eight"" (pirate currency). Practice lock picking if possible, although it is illegal to carry a lock pick kit in most states.

, Keep your head up high, but don't stick your nose in the air. Stomp a little, but go quickly. Keep in mind that pirates tended to remain inebriated for long periods of time, so you may want to wobble a bit, as well.

, On a ship, most of the time, a person couldn't get her point across with just words.

,, Pirate girls come in all shapes and sizes. The important thing is that their bodies are their own, to do with as they please.

, Respect them deeply, but don't baby them like they're not self-sufficient.

, Sometimes coverup, mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss are too much and make you look less piratey.

If you are going to a place really early in the morning and you don't have time to eat breakfast, go to Starbucks and show up at this place with Starbucks.,
Share that food around.",How to Be a Popular Tomboy," Brush your teeth twice a day, and (if you can be bothered) use mouthwash afterwards. Shower after school or dinner or whenever you want to. Wash your hair whenever you feel it needs a wash. If you can't tell, ask your mother to let you know, and if you can't do that for whatever reason, wash it every three days. Before you get dressed, put on deodorant.


Use pimple cream if needed. The best time for this is usually right after you have a shower or brush your teeth––put the gear on the bench next to the faucet in the bathroom.;
, Some girly-girls will get up crazy early to style their hair, but let's be real. The more time spent in bed the better, right? So apart from washing your hair every three days, what else do you have to do? Pick a signature style. Two easy favorites are messy plaits/braids or a high ponytail. These are really simple and take about five minutes to do.

, Again, who has time for this? If you want to wear it, you could wear foundation, lip gloss and mascara. For school, maybe a little mascara but definitely don't wear anything else. If you're a true tomboy, you won't really feel the need for eyeliner and blush and eyeshadow, because it really takes away from the casual look.

,  You don't want to wear anything skin tight or hard to move around in. Comfort always comes first but be sure to look cute. Jeans, oversized sweaters and tees, Uggs, Converse, flowing shorts, form-fitting blouses, and crop tops are nice.


Do not go out and buy all the latest trends, or read *shudders* fashion magazines.
Try tracksuit pants, ripped jeans, leggings and shorts for pants, and t-shirts, tank tops or crop-tops for shirts.
For shoes, three pairs is enough––Ugg boots, high tops and Converses. Literally wear whatever is comfortable.
Don't wear shorts in the middle of winter!

, Maybe wear one bracelet with your thing on it, such as a yin and yang symbol on it. You may wish to wear something on your head, whether it be a cap, a bow or a headband. Accessorizing is something to have fun with. Don't fuss though, there is no need to be into jewellery at all.


Yes, it is okay to wear beanies throughout the entire year.

, A few starter pack traits for popular tomboy are to be: Funny, sporty and friendly. Have a smile pretty much glued to your face. When people are around you, say hi, and think of something to do instead of just standing there. You could even start dancing the YMCA dance completely randomly. We dare you!

, As an ice cube. It's really important to keep your cool, and above all, never see yourself as popular. If people know you know you're popular and can see a lack of humility, they won't want you to be popular anymore. Don't take advantage of it!


If insulted, walk away or make a witty comeback. Yes, 'witty'. Deal with it. Don't stand there and take it, just shrug and walk away, or tell them to 'chill'.

,  A big part in being a tomboy and popular is maintaining somewhat boyish hobbies. Sports are a big deal.  Play as many as you can, and don't be afraid to get down and dirty while playing them.  Run around, laugh, don't be afraid of getting hurt, and just have fun while playing! Track, soccer, swimming, basketball, and dodgeball are great.

,  If you want to be popular you have to open yourself up to new people.  Talk to everyone, and get to know everyone.  It doesn't matter who they are, it doesn't matter what their personality is, as long as their a worthy friend, then make friends with them!  Just say hi.  Also be sure to talk to a lot of boys and hang with them too.

,  Boys are known to be more daring and strong than girls, so don't be afraid to take risks!  Your favourite quote should be YOLO (you only live once).  It's true, and it never hurts to try, and you might fail or get hurt, but it's worth it! Enjoy your time here.

,  Okay, school is very important, as it can affect your future a lot. Always do your homework before having fun, pay attention in class, take notes, ask the teacher about things you don't understand, and participate. Just put the studies first and then do whatever you want after. Tomboys don't fail school, they enjoy it especially when it comes to sporty things.

, Let all your emotions out, and don't be afraid to get rough!  Life is too short to live with worries, so smile everyday!  You will fail multiple times, but keep on pushing through! You may not be awesome today, but you can be awesome tomorrow so don't let it ruin your day. Keep that mindset forever.  Just be yourself, confident, and rule!

, It can be helpful to carry with you a small black backpack. In it, carry:


Mints and gum
Chips
Deodorant (and sometimes perfume)
A book
Your laptop (and chargers).
Phone, wallet, keys. Simple, but effective. Make sure to have on hand your wallet, phone and earphones, and keys to your house. This is pretty much the essentials.

, If you're cheap, don't have time to stop at Starbucks, or live in a place where there is no Starbucks, buy coffee cups from the supermarket and make yourself a hot chocolate. Then rock up to drama in the morning with your messy hair (on point obviously), tracksuit pants and Ugg boots and an absolutely chill coffee cup. This works almost every time.

, Everybody is friends with 'the kid with food'. Even if you don't want to share your food, know that the easiest way to become popular is to bring a bag of chips, or a pack of gum and be like, ""Hey want some?"" Come on guys, who says no to free gum?

Find out what they’re into.,
Match their sense of humor.,
Grow thick skin.,
Be straightforward.",How to Act Like One of the Guys1," Learn about the things the guys in your group bond over. Do they have long conversations about the horsepower of their favorite cars? Do they spend hours reciting the statistics of their favorite football team? To join the conversation, you’ll need to have a deep understanding of what they’re talking about.


Guys may express their friendship by quoting their favorite movies.Watch the movies your group likes so you know what to say back.
Guys gossip about their interests, be knowledgeable enough to join in.;
, Humor is subjective. One person may find a joke hilarious while another person may find it juvenile or offensive. Some people are offended by everything, and will be triggered. Guys who hang out together tend to be amused by the same things. The guys will think it’s really cool that you can make them laugh.Try not be offended if the guys have a crude sense of humor. Learn to appreciate their grossness and remember that it’s all in good fun.

, When guys hang out, they rip on each other (in more ways than one ;)). If you’re seen as one of the guys, they’ll tease you quite a bit. Guys love trying to get a rise out of each other. Show them you can take the heat. Just laugh it off.


See if you can dish out the pain. Try to rip on them as bad as they rip on you.
There’s a fine line between teasing and bullying. They should never cause you physical harm or make unwanted sexual remarks toward you. If you feel like they’ve gone too far, it’s okay to be upset or leave.

, When you argue with guys, tell them exactly what bothers you. If they ask for your opinion on something, tell them exactly what you think. When you have something to say, get to the point. Men are brutally honest because they care and they hate to beat around the bush.If you have a crush on one of the guys, don’t be offended if he has opinions about you that are hard to swallow. Guys are more worried about helping you improve long-term than they are about your feelings.
Remember, just because they’re honest doesn’t mean they’re right. Trust your own intuition.

Get good at guy stuff.,
Be low maintenance.,

If they love playing video games, start playing the games that they're into. Guys take pride in their hobbies. Work to get better at whatever it is you do with the guys.


Remember to have fun. Don’t be too obsessed with being the best.

, Guys get irritated if it takes you two hours to get ready to do anything. Men like to get up and go. Don’t be too picky either. Guys get agitated if you have to have everything your way.Make decisions quickly. Guys don’t want to wait to eat because you can’t decide what to order.
If you like one of the boys, you especially want to show him you’re low maintenance. Guys can find dating high maintenance girls exhausting.

, Show the guys you’re down to experience new things. Guys love adrenaline. A rush of adrenaline releases dopamine which makes you feel good. The feeling is amplified when you experience it in a group.Don’t be afraid if the guys invite you to go skydiving or to ride a huge roller coaster.
Use your better judgement. If something really does make you feel unsafe, it’s okay to decline the invitation.

, Men like to have everything ready in advance. Show the guys they can count on you to cover all your bases. Organize all your supplies before you go camping or on a road trip. Talk to the guys to see what you should bring to every event. If it’s your job to bring snacks to a party, prepare them the day before so you’re not scrambling.


If you’re travelling by plane, have your boarding pass handy so you’re not digging through your purse in line.

Whether you’re playing a pool tournament with the guys or seeing who can hit a tree with a rock, always give it your best effort.
It’s not about winning. Your goal should be to perform to the best of your ability.

, Don’t try to impress the group by pretending to be someone else. They’ll eventually see through your facade. Be confident enough to share your unique personality.


Sincerely learn to connect with your new friends.

, Show the guys you can let go of your worries and enjoy hanging out with them.If you’re focused on the things that bother you, people will pick up on it. Focus on having a good time.


You can confide in your guy friends if something really is bringing you down, but be sure to do it at the right place and time. Wait until you're alone with the guys in a private setting like one their homes. Don't try to tell them you're problems at a party or any other social event.

, Guys don’t like girls who are too judgemental. Don’t focus on what you don’t like about people or how you disagree with their lifestyle. If you judge other people, the guys will know you’ll judge them. Everyone has their own personal values, and if you impose yours on other people, you’ll kill everyone’s buzz.


Be cool to everyone. Don’t act like you’re better than people.
If you like one of the boys, show him that you’d be a fun, accepting girlfriend.
If someone makes you feel threatened, follow your instinct and get away from them.

If you can find flats or sandals that you like and fit your image, go ahead and try them. Get your shoes in black if necessary. Otherwise, get them in colors like blue, yellow or gray. You could also get them in cool patterns.;
, You could wear your shirt fully tucked in, half tucked in or you could just leave it out. Don't buy very tight or very loose shirts. Go for shirts that make you feel comfortable. If you want to, you could leave the collar button open and pull your collars to both sides. You could do the above with Polo shirts too.

, Don't wear very long or very short skirts. Opt for ones that fall till your knee or just above. If your skirt is really long, roll it up at the top. If it's very short, take it to the tailor's and have it lengthened. You could also wear black or cool patterned half-leggings underneath. You could also crumple your skirt before wearing it to create a cool 'I don't care' look.

, If you wear pants, then make sure that they cover your legs. Don't go for pants that are 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) too short. You could either buy very tight pants for a cool skinny jeans look or you could wear it very loose for a baggy trousers look. You could also wear it normal if you feel comfortable like that.

, There are many different ways to wear ties. You could wear it formally with the tie put on properly or you could go for a more cool look by leaving your collar button open and wearing your tie very loose. Don't wear ties that are very short and don't go for those extremely long ones. A desirable length would be till the middle of your stomach. Make sure the tie doesn't choke you if it's tied on tightly. Go for ties in dark colors if they are allowed.

, While wearing a jacket/blazer, you could either leave it closed or go for a more cool look by leaving it open. You could also roll up the sleeves till your elbows.

, If you have to wear stuff like chains with crucifixes on them, go for it. When it comes to earrings, keep it minimal. Wear studs, small hoops and such. If you want to, go earring-less. A great way to pull any outfit together is with the help of watches and wristbands. You could get a wristband with your favorite singer's or band's name on it or you could go for a normal or a digital watch with medium sized straps in colors like blue, red and black. You could also go for patterned watches. You could also wear a baseball cap or a fedora if you are permitted to.

, If you feel comfortable wearing makeup, feel free to express yourself. Make sure to limit how much you use, especially for school. Concealer is useful for blemishes, and eyeliner can create a cool punk look. .

, You could tie your hair in a high, low or side ponytail if you have long hair or you could just comb through with gel or create spikes if you have short hair. Don't leave your hair open because it's kind of girly and you might sweat a lot in the neck area.

Members who want to be part of a pack should join a pack with at least five people or more.;
, Miniature packs do not have ranks. There must be a leader, and the fairest way to do this is to hold and election, remember you cannot vote for yourself, if there is a tie, have a mini wrestle or rock-paper-scissors battle, then after let the audience vote for who they think is the best. The rest of you can decide whether you want to be a standard member, elder, nurse, or pup/kid.

, These can be acted out as mini wrestles or rock-paper-scissors battles, these will not hurt the other person very badly, but will give you more excitement. If one of the animals leading the raid backs down, the other pack will win.

, Create posters to put near your school, but not on school premises. Make sure it is on a tree or something, so everyone can see. Make sure they know how to contact you if they want to join. You could even design a time where wannabe pack members can visit you at your house!

Be confident.,
Stop caring what people think.,
Love your body.,
Love your style.,
Be cool -- with everyone.,
Wear the right tops.,
Wear the right pants.,
Wear swag shoes.,
Have swag accessories.,
Have swag makeup and hair.",How to Have Girl Swag," If you're not confident, you won't be able to have a drop of girl swag -- not even if you steal Nicki Minaj's entire wardrobe. The first step toward having the right attitude for swag is just to be comfortable in your own skin. Everyone who sees you or talks to you for a minute should know that you love who you are, who you're with, and where you are. If you show confidence, people will trust that you know what you're doing when you pick your swagtastic outfits and show off your moves on the dance floor.


Have the right body language. Strut into a room with your head high and your posture straight, looking ready for what's ahead for you.
Wherever you are, look like you want to be there. Don't check your phone every two seconds or look around for somebody better to talk to -- you should look like you're exactly where you want to be.
Don't spend your time examining your makeup or adjusting your clothes in the mirror. This will make it look like you're not happy about the way you look.;
, If you really have girl swag, then you're so happy with who you are and how you look that you don't care if people think you're too loud or look ridiculous. Just be yourself and let the haters hate. If you spend all of your time trying to suck up to people, dressing like all of your friends, or asking people if you look good, then you'll just look insecure.


There's a difference between not caring what people think and being catty or mean. You should still treat people with respect -- just stop trying to please them and meet another person's standards of beauty or of how a girl should act.

, There's no way you can rock a killer outfit if you hate the way you look or are trying to cover up your curves. You don't have to have a perfect body to recognize that every girl is unique and to find the parts of your body you love the most and be proud to show them off. If you wear bulky clothes to cover yourself up, keep your arms folded across your chest, or generally try to hide how fabulous you look, then you'll never be able to love and accept your body. If you never accept your body, it means you aren't confident.

, There is no one outfit or uniform that means you have swag. Having swag just means being comfortable with your own style, and wearing whatever makes you feel good. Find an original style that works for you, and have fun experimenting with clothes that take you out of your comfort zone. The important thing is that you act like you love what you're wearing, instead of asking your friends if you look ridiculous, or trying to rearrange your hair or outfits in the middle of the day because you think you look too crazy.

, If you really have swag, then you're cool enough to be comfortable with anyone, not just trying to social climb and only talk to the people who will make you look better. A true sign of a girl with swag is that she can strike up a conversation with anyone, be comfortable meeting new people, and make almost anyone laugh or smile.


When you meet a girl, don't look her up and down, but be friendly while maintaining your cool. This will make you have much more swag than being stuck up and afraid or jealous of new people.

, You can have swag while wearing any top at all, as long as you look good. You can wear t-shirts with cool graphics, belly shirts, tank tops, or whatever makes you feel good. Even the right hoodie can be a great addition to your swag wardrobe. Here are some other tops you can wear to have swag:


T-shirts. Try a shirt with a logo, a graphic tee, or just a big baggy t-shirt. You can also wear a t-shirt that isn't quite a belly shirt but which shows off just an inch or two of your belly.
Tanks. Just rock a halter or tank with spaghetti straps. You can show off your abs with a belly shirt or a half-top too.
Wear a little top barely bigger than a bikini under a flashy jacket.
Put on a hoodie or sweatshirt with a known logo like Adidas on it.
Be bold and wear a gold jacket with a lot of pockets and zippers.
Wear a leather or Letterman jacket. You can pair this with a tank.
Jerseys. Wear a jersey with your favorite current basketball player's last name on the back, or wear a Jordan jersey for a more retro look.
Have nicer dresses and flaunt your style off during parties.
Have two-three pairs of cropped leggings, leggings and long tops.
Have sleeveless or half sleeved tops and match it with shorts.No look can ever be cooler than this!
Dresses with colors like golden,purple,black,red, and green look very awesome.
Try belts.If your t-shirt is very baggy,then tuck it in and wear on a white belt.That looks awesome on anyone!
Go for brands like American Eagle, Hollister, Reebok, Nike, Rue 21, Bare Denim, Diesel, etc.These brands offer a wide collection of well-fitted hoodies, shorts, t-shirts, graphic tees, tops etc.
Wear band t-shirts or the ones with funny messages.Try going for a tomboy look once in a while.

, You can wear many different types of pants to have swag, from well fitting jeans to basketball shorts. It's up to whatever makes you feel good -- and whatever looks good with your top. Don't wear a tight top and super tight pants, or a really baggy shirt and cargo pants, or your outfit won't look balanced. Here are some other kinds of pants to try:


Baggy basketball shorts
jeans
Anything bright or loud
Leggings
Anything with animal print
Drop-crotch pants
Chachi pants
Baggy sweats with a tight top

, Your shoes can be nice and subtle or they can be the most ridiculous part of your outfit. They can match or completely clash while still looking fly. To have swag, you can dress up your feet or go for a casual look with sneakers. Here are some types of shoes to wear if you want to have swag:


Jordans
Nikes
Supra
Adidas
Huaraches
Converse
KD's
Black and white Converse
Chunky black, silver, or gold heels

, From hats to jewelry, accessories can help add swag to your outfit and to tie your look together. Here are some accessories you can try to spice up your swag look:


Gold or silver hoop earrings
Diamond earrings
Chunky black necklaces

, Managing your hair and makeup can help complete your swag outfit. You don't have to wear a ton of makeup or spend hours on your hair to have swag. Keep it simple and fun. Here are some things to try as you complete your look:


Put some hairspray or chocolate mousse in your hair
Wear funky gloss or lipstick
Create smoky eyes with black or dark eyeliner and shadow

Sit differently.",How to Act Like a Guy for Girls," One characteristic that people often notice about guys is that they tend to seem confident and self-assured in all circumstances, even if they're faking it.To make yourself appear more confident:Stand up straight, keep your head and chin up, and look ahead instead of at the ground
Make eye contact with people
Speak slowly and clearly when you talk
Don’t fidget
Keep your arms at your sides instead of crossed in front of you
At work, don’t be afraid to speak up if you have a good idea. Practice these confidence techniques when you speak to your co-workers and bosses.;
, Guys don’t typically shy away from physical activities and sports, so you can act like a guy by participating too. Some activities that are traditionally associated with guys include:Fishing
Watching sports
Biking
Camping and hiking

, It seems that men are more willing to take risks when it comes to things like gambling and recreational activities, so part of acting like a guy can include being a little more willing to take risks than you might otherwise feel comfortable with.This might include:


Choosing to do something you know you might get in trouble for from your parents, such as playing good-natured practical jokes on friends and family. Just be careful that you don’t do anything illegal, because that’s not a good kind of risk.
Engaging in activities where you could get hurt in a way that won’t be life-threatening, such as skateboarding, mountain biking, or trying weird new foods.

, Don’t be afraid to ask for something you want or need, and be specific about what it is. You can do this without being bossy or rude by still being polite and saying things like “please” and “thank you.” You can make your needs clear:


When you're at restaurants. Don’t let somebody else order for you, and be specific with the wait staff about what you want. For example, if you want your food a certain way, say “May I please have the veggie burger, hold the mayo, with a side-salad, and the dressing on the side. Thank you”
When you're working on a project with others. If you know certain tasks need to be completed, don’t be afraid to delegate certain roles to your friends, co-workers, or classmates.Just make sure you're doing your fair share of the work as well! For example, you can say something like, “We’ll get this done faster if we divide the tasks. I will take care of the food preparation. Jill, can you handle the guest list? And Andrew, can you take on the decorations? Thanks everyone!”
In relationships. Being clear about your needs means asking for help when you need it and telling friends and loved ones how they can best support you. For example, if you feel your significant other hasn’t been doing enough around the house, say, “I feel like I’ve been responsible for most of the chores around here, and I need your help. I’ve made a list and divided the housework between us, and I would appreciate if you could take care of the items on your list.”

, Assertiveness is all about being considerate of others while also expressing yourself.It’s compared to passiveness, where you allow others to tell you what to do, and aggressiveness, where you dictate to others.


You can be assertive by making your beliefs, feelings, and opinions clear to others without saying that someone else is right or wrong.During a school discussion, for example, you can say to a classmate, “I understand your opinion, but I believe that global warming is real and that it’s caused by humans because the scientific research backs that position.”
Be assertive in all aspects of your life, including at work, with friends and family, in relationships, and in your dealings with strangers. For example, if a friend is doing something you don’t appreciate, you can say, “We’re friends and I respect you and our friendship. I would appreciate if you did the same, and stop calling me that name, because it’s rude and offensive.”
Part of being assertive means being able to say “no” when you don’t agree with something, and standing up for the things you believe in. If someone tries to get you to do something you don’t agree with, just say, for instance, “I feel that everyone has a right to share this country, so I will not participate in your protest.”

, Men and women tend to walk differently because of biological, physiological, and social differences. To walk more like a guy, make sure you:Swing your hips less and your shoulders more
Walk with your legs a little farther apart than you normally would
Keep your elbows slightly winged out
Project your head and chest slightly ahead so you're leading your walk with your upper body

, It’s always polite to have a firm handshake, but many people consider it even more important for guys than girls. To make sure you have a firm grip, don’t let your hand become limp when you're shaking. Keep your hand strong and engaged.


Don’t forget to make eye contact when you're shaking hands, as this is a sign of confidence and respect.
A firm handshake is important any time you shake someone’s hand, including when you're first introduced, when you want to greet or bid farewell, or when you're congratulating.

, Again because of biological and social differences, men and women generally sit differently, and this includes on chairs, couches, seats, and on the ground.


To cross your legs, don’t cross one leg fully over the other. Instead, spread your knees apart a little and cross one ankle over the other.
If you don’t want to cross your legs, keep your feet flat on the floor and your knees and feet slightly apart.
When sitting, rest your hands on your knees or on the armrests.

Decide what kind of cat you want to pretend to be.,
Choose clothes that will emulate your chosen cat breed’s coloring.,
Use eyeliner to give yourself whiskers and cat eyes.",How to Pretend to Be a Cat1," Different breeds of cats all have unique features and personalities. Are you refined like a Persian cat or are you wild like a Manx? You can even pretend to be a big cat like a lion, tiger, or a cheetah.;
, There’s no need to buy a costume (although you can if you really want to!). Check your closet to see what you already have that could give you the same coloring as your chosen cat breed. If possible, pick something fuzzy or at least soft to the touch.


Buy or make your own pair of cat ears to wear.
Buy or make your own tail to wear.

, You can use a black or brown eyeliner to give yourself cat eyes and whiskers. Choose the color that best complements your cat breed’s coloring.


Line your eyes all the way around with eyeliner and extend the line beyond your upper and lower eyelid so that the two lines meet on the outer corner of your eye and form a point or a tail.Use the eyeliner to draw an upside down triangle on the tip of your nose. Fill it in completely. Then, give yourself whiskers by drawing three or four lines extending from the bottom of your nose (near your nostrils) out onto your cheeks.

Use cat speech.,
Use cat body language.,
Communicate annoyance and affection with your eyes.,
Perfect your cat walk.",How to Pretend to Be a Cat2," The meows, chitters, purrs, hisses, and yowls that cats make all have different meanings. Learn what these sounds mean and use them to communicate to cats and humans that you encounter.Meows should be used for greetings and for when you want something.
Chitters should be used to express excitement.
Purrs should be used to show others you are happy or content.
Hisses should be used to show others that you are angry or nervous.
Yowls should be used to show others that you are in trouble or hurt.

, Cats also communicate using their bodies. Learn what different cat body language means so that you can use it to show cats and humans how you feel.Arching your back shows that you are angry, frightened or, in some cases, that you want to be pet.
Lying on your back while purring means that you are very relaxed, but lying on your back while growling means that you are ready to attack.
Rubbing against objects or people means that you are marking your territory.
Kneading a person, pillow, or other soft surface means that you are very happy.
Lifting your head, then curling your lips back and breathing through your mouth (known as the flehmen response) means that you are gathering more information.

, Cats have different ways of showing that they are angry at you or that they love you. Learn what cats do to show these emotions so that you can express yourself this way too. Staring means that a cat is angry or challenging someone. Don’t hold eye contact for a long time unless you want to show anger towards someone or challenge their authority.
Blinking slowly is how cats show affection. Blink slowly at cats or humans to show them you love them.

, Notice how cats walk and try to copy their walk. Walk fast when you are excited, walk slowly and silently when you are on the prowl, and run straight at your prey when you want to catch something or someone.

, Try to learn things by yourself instead of asking others. Make this a habit for every time you walk into a room.

, While owls aren't actually that smart, they're a symbol of wisdom. Have your own brand of wisdom, though. Look between the lines, seek out the grey in a black-and-white situation, and just generally think more about your actions.

, Owls are not afraid of darkness because they have night vision.

, Get to know about their behavior. If you have owls near you, watch them.

, Learn to appreciate nature. Most owls live in coniferous forests, deserts, mountains, and plains and like to nest in high trees. Try exploring places like these.

Choose your dog breed.,
Wear clothes which give the impression of your dog breed, but still look cool.,
Get some dog ears.,
Paint your face to look like a dog.,
Change your hands and feet into paws.,
Tie it off with a tail.,
Accessorize to make your costume stand out.",How to Cosplay as a Dog1," Often times dog owners will choose a breed of dog which looks a lot like them. This might be a good place to start when you are considering which breed of dog you want to dress as for cosplay. If you already have the look of a certain breed, it will be a head start on your costume.


If you have curly hair you may want to try a Cocker Spaniel or a Poodle.
People with straight hair can pull off the look of shiny, short haired dogs like Dobermans and Dalmatians.
Thin people could dress as Greyhounds or Whippets.
For a tough strong look, try a Bulldog or Pitbull.;
, Cosplay costumes are different from your average halloween costume in that you don’t want to cover yourself in a big dog outfit. Instead, you want to highlight that you, yourself, are the dog.


Wear some shorts or leggings and a shirt in the color of your breed.
You could even choose a full, short skirt or tutu if you are dressing as a poodle or another fun, fluffy dog like a Pomeranian.
Add little elements to your outfit to suggest you are a dog. Try tufts of fur on the shoulders, or spots on your shirt.

, A popular option for getting an animal look is a Spirit Hood. These are large, furry hats with long sides which drape down and end in mittens with paws prints on the underside. This is a great start to a dog costume.You can also find dog ears on a headband or make your own by gluing felt to a headband.
If your hair is long enough to put in pig tails, you can make ears out of your own hair.

, You will want to focus on painting the nose and mouth of a dog by tracing around the tip of your nose in black, brown or pink paint, depending on your breed. Also create the dog muzzle between your nose and upper lip using a lighter color. Here you can add some whiskers.For a playful look, paint a red or pink tongue over one side of your bottom lip and extending past it to look like your tongue is hanging out. Outline the tongue with a thin black line.
Spotted dogs can paint a big spot around one eye.

, If you have a Spirit Hood, your front paws are already covered. If not, it is simple enough to use a pair of mittens, which you can wear on their own or decorate with furry material or felt. Boots are very common in cosplay. Find a pair of boots which matches the look of your breed.


Choose a nice sleek, tall boot for a short haired dog.
Find a fluffy boot like furry Uggs for a long-haired look.

, No dog costume is complete without a tail. Depending on the breed you chose, you may want and thin tail or a fluffy tail. You can achieve these looks using felt or yarn in the appropriate colors.For a fluffy tail, cut 10 pieces of yarn 5 inches long and tie them together in the middle to make a sort of tassel. Make several of these tassels. Using the string tied around the middle of the tassel, tie these tassels to a longer string which is a little longer than the length of the tail. Tie this to a belt or use more yarn to wrap around your waist and tie the tail on.Make a tail out of felt or another material of your choice. Cut the material five inches wide and the length you would like for your tail. Roll the material starting with the end of the tail, which should come together at a point, ending at the top, which should be left open. Sew the edges together to create a long cone shape. Stuff the tail with cotton stuffing and place a flexible wire in the center if you would like to be able to adjust the shape of the tail. Sew the top together and sew an additional loop to the top to thread a belt through.

, The accessories are what will really give your costume personality. Think of different accessories and props you can add to your costume.You probably want a collar or at least a necklace of some kind.
Wear dog tags and have your name etched into the tag at the pet store.
Maybe instead you want to get creative and use a bow tie as a collar to class up your dog costume.
Some props you can consider would be a big stick or a dog bone.

Stay loyal to your companions.",How to Cosplay as a Dog2," Assess your own personality traits and determine which kind of dog you most resemble in the way you behave. Are you nervous or confident? Are you social or secluded, friendly or aloof, hard-working or lazy? Match your answers to different breed personalities to choose the best dog breed for your cosplay.Working dogs include herding breeds like Collies and Shepherds.Nervous dogs are often the smaller or toy breeds like Chihuahuas and Toy Poodles.
A guard dog may suit your personality, in which case, you should look at breeds like Rottweilers and Boxers.
Super friendly people want a dog breed to match, like a Labrador or Retriever.

, Dogs don’t really sweat except through the pads of their feet, so they pant to release heat from their body. They also pant when they get nervous or are in pain., Dogs originally came from wolves and hunted in packs -- they are social animals. With domestication, dogs have learned to rely on and bond with human companions. Be friendly, surround yourself with other and work together like a dog would., Dogs naturally love to play. You can choose to do the types of things that dogs do when they play. Some great options are playing catch or tug of war with your friends, or playfully wrestling with a buddy. Hey, if you’re alone, take yourself for a walk., Dogs can’t tell you what they want and what they are feeling, so they use a lot of body language to communicate with people. Study a dog’s body language and mimic what dogs do to communicate.When someone is speaking to you, tilt your head to one side.
Wag your tail when you’re happy.
Dodge out of the way when you are mad at someone who is about to touch you.
Whine for attention.

, Dogs rely on their human companions and bond closely to them. Be consistent in your friendship and always have your companion’s back. Be quick to forgive your close friends and family members.

Use makeup to get a wolf-like appearance.,
Fix your hair.,
Wear wolf's clothing.,
Observe wolves.,
Walk like a wolf.,
Learn to run like the wolves.,
Jump like a wolf.,
Pounce.,
Be playful and active.,
See in the dark.,
Interact with people the way a wolf does with other wolves.,
Sniff the air.,
Howl.,
Eat like a wolf.",How to Act Like a Wolf," Eyeliner is a must in this as it creates a dog like or animal like appearance to your eyes and causes them to pop more. People will be more drawn to your eyes as well. Making a small pointed wing off of the corner of your eye with a fine tipped black liner is the best way to achieve this look.


Another way to achieve the look through makeup is with eyeshadow. When applying eyeshadow, be sure not to apply much. Only use a light amount normally in earthy shades or even shades that may match a wolf's fur. These include blue, white, black, or brown.;
, If you want to, you can style it like your favorite werewolf character, but you can also make it your own unique style. For girls, a loose and slightly messy wavy style cam fit well as it makes you look as if you've been wandering the wilderness. For guys, a fluffy yet slightly spiky look may work better.

, Clothing is the smallest detail in looking like a wolf. However, if you would like to add this aspect as well, you can dress like your favorite wolf character or wear things in plain earthy shades or things with nature patterns on them.


Wear a suitable costume. It will help the effect if you dress as a wolf; less guesswork from your fellow humans will be involved. Add the teeth. If you need inspiration, look at pictures from the story of Little Red Riding Hood; the wolf depictions are quite vivid.

, Visit the zoo or rent out some videos, or look at YouTube. Observe how wolves run, roll, walk, interact with each other, eat etc. What can you imitate after watching them closely?

, You could try:


Changing down to walk on all fours. Walk on your hands and feet, all fours, as a wolf would do. If this proves too difficult, then improvise with knees but it may feel less realistic.
Adopting a ""loping"" walking style. Wolves run gracefully, which may be very difficult for you as a human on all fours, but you can aim to give the effect of a wolf loping or stalking slowly, like when they are hunting.

, Wolves are always running through the woods to stalk prey or simply for sport. Wolves and werewolves are also fast and efficient runners. Try running at least once a day for 20 minutes if you don't run already. Slowly increase this rate to help your skill level rise. After a while, you will run quickly and easily like a wolf!

, This is important to acquiring your hunting skills. Wolves jump high and can also cover long distances with a simple spring off the ground. It may be difficult at first, but practicing jumping over small objects such as logs and chairs can help you increase your height with every jump. Over time you will increase your distance and height and jump over things without even thinking.

, Put a toy rabbit on the floor. Get on your hands and feet and try pouncing toward it.

, Wolves are like dogs; they are playful together.

, This is a must have trait for any wolf. Wolves are predators and they are always stalking through the woods at night. They can be nocturnal and it is also pretty stereotypical to see a wolf in the night. Start off by turning off lights when you want to practice. Open your eyes and look at something for a while until your eyes adjust. Do this every night in your bedroom to help your eyes get used to being in the dark.

, This involves staring down your enemies and growling at them. Now if you don't want people to catch on to you being wolf like, then don't take it too far. People may find it strange.

, This is another thing wolves tend to be doing as they have very good noses and like sniffing out their prey to track it. Sniffing the air like an animal will help you act like this when you smell something you like or something you don't. Be sure to make it obvious you like or hate a smell by smiling or grimacing.

, This is the most common trait people think of when they hear the word wolf. Howling at the moon or when you feel the urge is a good behavior to use. Being in the wilderness when you do so is just an added bonus, but you can just howl in your yard if you'd like.

, Eat a diet of mostly meats. Wolves are, yes, carnivores. This does not mean that they won't eat grass and herbs and such. Watch how wolves would eat meat, fish, and other things on YouTube. But remember you're still human, and that you need to eat other things too!

, Try to play so much that you tire yourself out for a the rest of the day and all of the next day too. To do this try these activities: going for really long walks and runs, run around in a field, play Frisbee, play tug of war (only sometimes though, not too often), play catch, play tag, play keep away, wrestle and weed your garden(try it without a weed whacker if you can). Also, to playfully tease people who you are friends with, stick out your tongue at them, gently grab their hair (only if it's okay with them), and pretend to punch or kick them. However, don't really punch or kick someone.

, Never betray them or leave them when they 'aren't fun anymore' or when they need you. Or anytime actually, unless they are dangerous or potentially dangerous.

, Of course you should get down and dirty sometimes, and roll down hills and all that, but make sure that you always take a bath or shower afterwards. Wash your hair regularly, and comb or brush it a lot. Also brush your teeth. Golden have bad breath sometimes, and don't need baths so often, but you aren't all dog, sorry you're also a human. Besides, Golden have a beautiful fur coat, so you should take care of your alternative to fur: hair.

, Golden are not good guard dogs, unless the victim hates being licked, but, like any dog, they can always protect the ones they love if needed.

, They are the leaders of your pack. No dog ever challenges the pack leader.

,, Do cute things and say cute things as much as possible.

, Also, try to be friendly, playful, nice, and good with kids.

Sleep a lot and take cat naps.,
Do yoga to stretch your muscles out.,
Clean yourself often.,
Spend time playing outside.",How to Act Like a Cat1," Cats are notorious for sleeping anytime and anywhere. To be like a cat, make sure you get a full night’s sleep as well as other quick naps throughout the day. A quick catnap should take about 15 to 20 minutes, so you can take several throughout the day. If you can't sleep during the day try to rest early in the morning.


Find a nice sunspot for a warm, cozy nap.
Curl up in a comfy cushion or a fresh pile of warm laundry in a ball or the fetal position. Cats protect their stomachs when they sleep as this is their vulnerable spot.;
, After waking up from a satisfying nap or a long night’s rest, stretch out your body. Like a cat, take your time stretching every muscle and waking your body up. A quick sun salutation is a great stretching routine and it has poses that resemble a cat’s.Yawn to stretch your face muscles and look like a cat waking up as well.

, Cats groom themselves by licking and pawing their faces to clean off food, odors, and excess hair. Shower at least once a day if not more to keep yourself free from dirt and extra oils. Throughout each day, check your appearance in a mirror and clean up after mealtimes.Some cats are declawed and others aren’t, but growing your nails out and having them shaped into a point is another way to be like a cat.
Brush your hair so that you don’t shed hair throughout the day and it stays free from tangles and matting., Watch birds, practice climbing trees, and get out and explore nature around you. Be active to keep yourself healthy and in the mindset of an adventurous cat. Once you’ve worn yourself out, take a nap in the sun.Cats like to be entertained and around other cats. Spend time playing and lounging with others.
Hunting is an activity that will get you in the mindset of a cat. Even an indoor cat will hunt and chase after toys."

Use body language to communicate your feelings instead of simply your words.,
Experiment with the tone of your voice.,
Have a signature scent.,
Blink slowly to show that you like someone.,
Swat someone who is irritating you to warn them.",How to Act Like a Cat2," Without saying a word, you can communicate your moods, just like a cat. Turn your back and walk out of the room if you’re bored or tired. Sit close to someone if you’re enjoying their company and close your eyes when you smile to show that you’re content and happy.


You don’t have a tail or ears like a cat, but you can still use your face to express your emotions to people without talking.
Or for example, you can pace back and forth when impatient for dinner to be ready or back away when you don’t want someone to try and touch or hug you.

, Talk in an upbeat tone when you’re happy and content and incorporate a growl into your voice when you’re mad. You don’t have to meow exactly like a cat, but you can copy their sounds. For example, cats chirp and mew at things they like so you could make high pitched, happy squeals when you see someone or something you love.To show displeasure, you can hiss like a cat does when it’s threatened or irritated.
If you want to be able to talk with cats, mimic their meows and sounds the best you can. Listen to how they talk and mimic them.

, Cats communicate with pheromones that humans aren’t sensitive to pick up to attract mates and warn other cats to stay away. Pick out a perfume or body spray that smells good so that others will want to be around you.In the chance that you want to repel someone, make a point to cook with garlic and onions or handle other foul smelling materials and don’t wash them off.

, Oftentimes people think cats are glaring at them when in reality, cats blink slowly to show that they like someone. Blink slowly and evenly to show affection. This is especially effective when you’re getting to know a new cat and want to communicate that you’re a friend.Some people may not recognize this behavior and it may look more like glaring.
Consider batting your eyes slowly instead to be less intimidating.

, If you ever need to fight, hold back from going all out and physically attacking someone. Instead, quickly bat someone on the arm to alert them of a coming altercation. Cats will swat at other cats, dogs, and humans at the start of a fight and sometimes it won’t need to escalate to a real fight.A warning swat doesn’t need to be hard, just swift and sharp enough to get someone’s attention.
If a real fight does break out, cats will bite and scratch their opponents. Just be cautious and consider the consequences of using these methods in a real fight with someone.

Stay alert and aware of your surroundings.,
Be shy around people you don’t know but warm and welcoming once you’ve met.,
Ignore people and then request attention when you want it.,
Gently head-butt and nuzzle people you like.,
Bring people presents.,
Be mischievous.",How to Act Like a Cat3," Cats have highly sensitive hearing and smell so they’re aware of the world around them. Whether you’re doing nothing or in the middle of a project of conversation, pay attention to what’s going on around you. It’s a good practice for being safe but also being as observant as a cat.Reacting erratically and jumping at things that startle you is another way you can imitate cats.
If you hear a weird sound or smell something fishy, investigate it. Cats are curious and you should be too.

, Cats are generally cautious and sometimes standoffish with people at first. Don’t just be friends with everyone you meet right away, that’s acting more like a dog. Make people earn your trust and friendship. This way, you’ll have valuable friendships for life.

, Be picky with how much time you spend with people. Cats don’t always like to be showered with attention and therefore neither should you. Walk away from someone if you need some alone time. You can simply rejoin a conversation when you’re ready to be social again.Demand your own personal space. If you need to be alone, don’t let people bother you. Cats will let you know by hissing or growling if they’re tired of attention.
Being talkative will let people know you want to socialize, and refraining from talking will also alert people that you’re done with socializing, just like a cat.

, Once you’re close with someone, you can show them affection, especially physically. Cats like to massage people with their paws and rub their heads to mark their territory. You can give friends back rubs or nuzzle your significant other to show them that you like them.Only do these things to people you’re close with, or they might not understand what you’re doing.

, You don’t have to go as far as trapping mice and pests to leave on friends’ doorsteps, but giving gifts and providing fresh kills are how cats show affection. Dead mice are the equivalent of giving a small trinket to show your friend you’re thinking of them.Cats also hunt and leave their kill to provide food to their owners. You can take care of the people you like by feeding them, such as cooking full meals or sharing part of your lunch.

, Make little messes by knocking things off of counters, sit on people when they’re trying to work on something, or be nosy and poke around in cupboard and behind doors. Cats are adorable but can get in your way and be inconvenient. Have a little fun for example and block someone’s view of the television when they’re trying to watch something.


Don’t be obnoxious. If someone asks you to stop, respect their space and dial back the cat mimicking.

Determine why you are late.,
Figure out how long it takes to get to your bus stop.,
Get to the bus stop 5 minutes early.,
Pay attention while you are waiting.,
Have a backup plan if you miss the bus.",How to Not Miss the Bus for School1," Before you can change your behavior, try to understand the reason that you are missing the bus. Do you get out of bed late? Do you take too long to get ready in the morning? Do you lose track of time when you are getting dressed? Do you not give yourself enough time to walk to the bus stop?


The solution to your problem depends on the reason that you are missing the bus.
For example, if you always oversleep and have a hard time getting out of bed, you may need to go to bed earlier.
If you think your issue is your morning routine, time yourself and see how long it takes to get up, get dressed, eat breakfast, and make it out of the door. You can then make adjustments to your schedule based on this.
If you lose track of time, have clocks in different places to keep yourself on track. You may have a clock in your room, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, and wear a watch.;
, Unless your bus picks you up from your home, you need to figure out how long it takes you to get to your stop. Time yourself as you walk and/or ride to the bus stop.Once you know how long it takes to get to your bus stop, you will know what time you need to leave your house to catch the bus.
If you both walk and get a ride to your bus stop, you should time yourself doing both. For example, it may take 10 minutes to walk to your bus stop, but take 3 minutes if your parent drops you off at your stop.

, Arrive to your bus stop at least 5 minutes early. If you arrive at your stop at the exact scheduled pick up time, you are more likely to miss your bus. Your bus driver is on a schedule and has other kids to pick up.The bus cannot wait for you if you are late.


If your bus is scheduled to pick you up at 8:00 am, be at the bus stop by 7:55 am.
Do not forget to factor in the time it takes to get to your bus stop. For example, if it takes 10 minutes to get to your bus stop from your house, leave by 7:45 am to catch the bus on time.
If it is raining or snowing, give yourself some extra time to get to the stop.

, Try not to get distracted as you travel to catch your bus or wait for the bus. If you walk to your bus stop, do not make any extra stops on the way. If you plan to make extra stops during your walk, leave your house at an earlier time.


If you walk with your friends, it can be easy to get distracted, goof around, or walk slower than usual.
Also, do not try out any new routes to your bus stop. You cannot predict how long it will take you to get to your bus stop. If you want to try out a new shortcut, do it over the weekend instead.

, If you miss the bus, you need to have a plan in place to get to school on time. Maybe your parents, neighbor, or another classmate's parent can give you a ride to school. Talk with your parents about what to do if you miss the bus. You do not want to panic if you miss the bus.


Do not rely on you backup plan. You still need to do everything you can to not miss the bus.
If you miss your stop, some schools may allow you to get on at a later stop.You should contact your school to see if this is a possibility. Do not assume that it is alright for you to do this.

Get a good night's sleep.,
Pack your backpack the night before.,
Give yourself plenty of time to get ready.",How to Not Miss the Bus for School2," If you oversleep, you are more likely to miss your bus. Go to bed at a reasonable time so that you are not sleepy when you wake up. Your sleep needs will depend on your age.If you are between the ages of 6 and 13, try to get 9-11 hours of sleep each night.
If you are between the ages of 14 and 17, try to get 8-10 hours of sleep each night.

, Get everything you need for school together before you go to bed. Your morning will be crazy if you are trying to pack your backpack, get lunch/lunch money and get anything else you need for the day all before you get on the bus. You are also more likely to forget something or drop something if you are rushing out of the door.Place all of your stuff by the door so you can pick it up on your way out of the house.
You can also sleep later if you have all of your stuff together. If you are unable to get your things together the night before, wake up earlier than you normally would so you do not run behind schedule.

, Everyone goes through a morning routine to get ready for the day. Your routine probably includes, showering, picking out your clothes, and eating breakfast. Figure out how long it takes you to get ready, and then set your alarm. If you need to be out of the house by 7:45 am and it takes you an hour to get ready, set your alarm for 6:30 am. This way you have an extra 15 minutes in case you over sleep or something goes wrong.
If you tend to sleep through your alarm, have multiple alarms that go off at different times. You may set an alarm for 5:30 am, 5:45 am, and 6:00 am.
You can pick out your clothes and shower the night before to cut down on the time it takes to get ready.

Do not chase the bus.,
Be aware of the bus driver's blind spots.,
Look for moving cars.",How to Not Miss the Bus for School3," If you miss the bus or are running late, it can be tempting to chase after the bus. However, this is a terrible idea. The bus driver probably will not see you and you will be putting yourself in danger.Once the bus starts moving, you need to be still.


You may accidentally run into traffic and get hit by another car on the street.
The bus driver probably won't turn the bus around to pick you up anyway.

, If you stand too close to the bus, your bus driver may not be able to see you. If you need to cross in front of the bus, take 5 giant steps before you cross. If you are on the side of the bus, stand 3 giant steps away.


Never walk behind your school bus.
Take 3 giant steps back from the curb when your bus approaches.Make eye contact with your bus driver before you cross in front of the bus. This will guarantee that the bus driver sees you., Although cars are supposed to stop when you board the bus, some drivers may forget. Always look for moving cars before you get on and off the bus. This is especially important if you have to cross the road to get on the bus.If you are crossing the street, wait until the bus driver signals that it is safe for you to go.
Stand on the sidewalk instead of the street when you are waiting for the bus. If there is not a sidewalk, stand as far away from the street as you can.

Prioritize academics.,
Hire a tutor.,
Take advantage of free time.","How to Manage High School Classes, Homework, Sports and Keeping Up with Household Chores1"," The reason you are in high school is to learn, so that has to be your primary focus. If you are balancing a full class load as well as a full practice and game schedule, that can be incredibly tricky. Make sure that both you and your coaches know that your schoolwork comes first.If you know you’re going to be missing class because of an away game, talk to your teachers ahead of time to find out what assignments you’ll be missing.
Plan to turn in your assignments early if you’re going to be missing class, or if that’s not possible, ask your teacher for an extension.;
, Student athletes often miss class for games, and this makes it easier for you to fall behind. If you feel that you’re not fully understanding your class work, hire a tutor to help you keep up with the rest of your classmates.If you can’t afford a tutor, ask your teacher if you can come in for extra help after school.
The more you fall behind, the harder it will be to catch up later. You’ll save yourself a lot of time and stress by staying on top of the work.

, If you have a study hall in school, don’t use that time to goof off with friends. Instead, use it to cross a homework assignment off your list. If your teacher gives you time to work on homework in class, take advantage of that time as well.If you’re traveling on the bus to an away game, use the time on the bus to work on assignments or do your class reading.
Learn how to multi-task: do your reading while eating breakfast or study for a test while blow drying your hair.

",How to Organise Your Schoolwork," This is a problem and that you want to fix it. You are reading this now, so that's a big step forward. It means you want to fix this yourself, not because one of your parents is forcing you to.;
, Yes, every scrap of paper, and everything else, including your week-old lunch.

, Take a small, clean cloth and simply brush off dust from the bottom and ends of your backpack or bag. Turn it inside out if you can to get rid of all the crumbs, dirt or whatever else has gathered in there.

, If you have any pieces of paper left in the backpack, take them out and recycle them. If they are important notes keep them or copy them on to a separate piece of paper.

, Organise your books in order of the lessons. Don't cram the books inside. Be patient.

, If possible, keep your food and drink in a separate compartment to your school books.

, Now that you've finished organising your backpack, it's time for studying! Find a neat, clean, fresh, place that you are comfortable in.

,, Active studying is the only way to remember the information. That means taking short notes or key words, highlighting or underlining important sentences. Read it out loud to yourself or make a recording of yourself reading it aloud which you can play back to yourself as part of your revision. Then quiz yourself or ask someone to quiz you.

, Take a five minute break then take another lesson to study for forty minutes. Set a timer to motivate yourself.

, If you're not that hungry, at least have a glass of water or milk. It will refresh your mind. You can also do about 5 jumping jacks to make that blood flow!

, This time, choose a slightly difficult subject like science or geography perhaps and start revising actively.

, Try your absolute hardest to understand everything. Make out a timetable so that you cover every subject at least twice a week and spend time at all your subjects.

, At school ask your teachers about this and that. Question them and make your weakest subject your best subject!

, That night, after the teachers have explained everything, go over it and give yourself a pop quiz (if you are creative, then make an exam cover with your name written on it for fun).

, It will help you remember everything. Trust me, it works.

Keep your bedroom, your locker, your car and your backpack neat and you won’t waste time looking for assignments you have lost or jerseys that have gone missing.Create a filing system that will help you keep track of all your current assignments.
Color code your folders and assignments by using different colored labels for each class.

, It’s very easy to look at all the work you have to do and the little time you have to complete it and get completely overwhelmed. Buy a calendar or paper planner and use it to make a weekly schedule for yourself.Mark off all the time you have classes or practices, then look at the rest of your schedule and figure out when you have free time to do homework and chores.
Make sure to give yourself some free time each week to relax, or you will get burned out.
If you have trouble getting organized, ask a parent or guidance counselor to help you.

, If a teacher assigns a project a month in advance and you know it’s going to be due just as basketball season is heating up, get that project out of the way early. The earlier you can get something done, the less stress you’ll feel.Try to split up the work – work on your project for 20 minutes every day, instead of working on it for a three hour chunk on one day.
Don’t cram. Cramming the night before a test is far less effective than actual studying and will exhaust your brain and stress you out.

, Your weekends are incredibly important – they give you time to reset, catch up on sleep and provide much needed “me time.” But you don’t need to spend your entire weekend chilling out.Spend two hours on Saturday getting a jumpstart on your assignments for next week.
Spend an hour on Sunday getting organized and making a to-do list for the upcoming week.

, If your parents are comfortable with it, do all your chores on one day. Getting all your chores done at once is more efficient and you’ll feel better knowing that you’ve finished them all and don’t have to worry about them for another week.If your chores are daily chores, like making the bed, try to do them first thing when you wake up to get them out of the way early.
Multi-task during chore time. If you have a book to read for English class, get the audio recording and listen to it while doing your laundry.

Take something off your plate.,
Stay healthy.,
Stay away from social media.","How to Manage High School Classes, Homework, Sports and Keeping Up with Household Chores3"," Sometimes, life gets too busy and it’s impossible to get everything done. If this is the case for you, consider quitting or going on a temporary hiatus from your team.You can’t exactly quit going to school or doing homework or chores, so sports are the easiest commitment to eliminate.
If you’re incredibly busy at school or with practice, ask your parents if you can take a week off from doing chores (tell them you’ll do double next week to make up for it).

, If you’re constantly falling ill because of how strenuous your life is, you’re not going to be able to keep up with everything that’s going on. Eat a healthy diet, get between 7 – 8 hours of sleep each night and avoid drugs and alcohol.Have a water bottle with you at all times. Drinking water will help keep you hydrated and feeling good.
Eat fruits and vegetables. These will help your immune system and make you less susceptible to falling ill.
Make a bedtime and stick to it. If you’re not sleeping regularly, it will be impossible for you to function at the top of your game.

, Facebook is fun, but it’s also a distraction from everything else you have going on. Give yourself 30 minutes every day to be on social media, and other than that, stay away from it.Use social media as a reward – if you finish all your work for the day, you can spend more time checking Twitter.
Give yourself an hour on social on weekends as a reward for working so hard during the week.

Ask for help.",How to Manage Time As a Working Student," Provide the management at your job with a copy of your school schedule and ask that they arrange your shifts around these times. Most companies that employ students are happy to work with them on coming up with a schedule that allows them to work while taking care of their academic duties. If you’re a full-time student, try formatting your schedule to concentrate multiple classes in a single day, giving you a day or two off during the week to work and study.If you have to work on a school day, make sure your employer knows what time your classes end and schedules your shifts accordingly, so that you’ll have time to change clothes, have a snack, navigate traffic, etc.;
, Have an idea of how much money you need to make every month in order to pay your bills and expenses and work an average number of hours per week. You might sometimes have to work more or fewer hours depending on scheduling, business and seasonal activity at your workplace, but strive to hit the mark with regular hours. You can use your remaining time to study.Certain students, like those with high living costs or children, won’t have as much freedom when it comes to working flexible hours. If you have to work a lot, make the most of your time at school, and try setting aside a block periodically to take care of school work on the weekends.

, Rather than spending your break time at work idly texting or talking with coworkers, crack open a textbook while you eat your lunch. You’d be surprised how much reading and note-taking you can accomplish in 15-30 minute intervals, and every little bit helps. Get a little extra studying in at any point that you have downtime and are tempted to squander it., While working is essential, it’s important to remember that school is preparing you to build your future. College isn’t cheap, so don’t let that time and expense go to waste—whenever you’re presented with a choice, your education should come first. Chances are, the job you’re working to help put you through school is not the one you plan on having once you graduate, so keep your endgame in mind and buckle down on the scholastic front. You’ll be glad you did.Remind your boss that you’re not available to work overtime if it will interfere with studying.
If you don’t manage your class workload and maintain the grades you need to succeed, you may have to repeat a section, which just means time, effort and money down the drain.

, Stay focused in class and make an effort to learn the material you’re studying as it’s being taught to you. It sounds obvious, but many busy, stressed students let their minds wander during lectures or concentrate too much on taking notes, thinking they’ll study on their own time later, only to eventually be faced with a mountain of ideas with no context for learning. Follow along with lessons and try to absorb as much knowledge as you can. The less time you spend cramming and deciphering pages of notes later, the more time you’ll have to devote to working and studying for your other classes.If the material you’re presented in a lecture is particularly dense, ask your professor for permission to record the lesson. Most professors are fine with students making an audio recording of a lecture to help them keep up, or make their presentation notes available for review online via the school’s website.Pick up some shorthand techniques to help you jot down notes faster and more efficiently. This can save you a lot of time writing and reading and prevent you from getting behind.

, If your schedule is consistent enough, carve out a period to study at the same time every day. This can be as little as an hour in the morning, afternoon or evening as your timetable allows, but use this time solely for the purpose of studying and completing homework assignments. Studying is a habit, like anything else, so get into the habit of planning study sessions so that you’re not stuck desperately stealing snatches of time later on.Growing research suggests that retention and comprehension drop significantly after the first hour of studying. Take this into account when scheduling your study sessions so that you don't burn yourself out and end up wasting time retreading the same material over and over again. If possible, cycle between different course material for an hour at a time., Come up with a system to help you allot the appropriate amount of study time for your various classes. For instance, many college professors and advising experts recommend that students spend around two hours studying for every credit hour that a course is worth; if you're enrolled in a course worth three credit hours, that's six hours of studying for that course over the span of the week. You might also devise a ranking of your classes based on how difficult they are for you, and distribute your time so that you're able to study more for the classes that give you the most trouble.Take care of complicated projects and assignments that are worth a larger percentage of your grade first to ensure that you maintain your grade point average.
Most of effective time management practice is portioning your time and knowing what’s most important to do when—a regular schedule can provide a dependable structure to help you accomplish daily tasks on time.

, Put away the smartphone or tablet, turn off the TV and, unless it’s for homework, unplug the laptop. You need uninterrupted time to get into a “flow state” while you study in order to maximize how much you’re able to get done. Mute, unplug, block or shut off as many distractions as it takes for you to be productive. Netflix can wait, and your Facebook notifications will be there once you’re finished.Focusing is a skill. As ubiquitous distractions cause attention spans to get shorter, it becomes easy to lose the ability to focus. Work on developing this skill and applying it when it’s time to take care of business.

, It can be hard to do when you’re already pushed for time, but sleep is non-negotiable when it comes to feeling and being your best. Aim to get a minimum of 5 hours per night; 6-8 is ideal for the young and the constantly busy. You may have to sacrifice other uses of your time, like unwinding in front of the TV, in order to get the sleep you need. Consider this a bodily necessity, the same as eating and drinking.Take a short nap sometime during the day if your schedule doesn’t allow you to sleep through the night. 15-20 minutes may be all the you need to refresh your mind and body., Since you’re constantly on the move from school to work and back, you should be fueling your body to keep up with the demands you place on it. All too often, busy people convince themselves that they “don’t have time to eat,” and as a result they feel sluggish, fatigued and unmotivated. Get at least two solid meals a day, and snack to keep energy levels up when you have the opportunity.Pack a lunch or a light snack that you can take with you to school or work so you don’t go hungry.
Doing meal prep in large batches at the beginning of the week and refrigerating it will save you a lot of time preparing and cooking food later on, especially in the mornings when time is short.Don’t overlook the importance of staying hydrated. Water nourishes all the cells in your body, including the brain, so if you’re feeling drained after a long shift or study session, stop and take a few deep gulps., If your schedule allows it, make some time every week to get together with friends or spend some time with your family. Many students make the mistake of allotting too much time for socializing while they’re in school, but a little face time with the people you care about can be great stress relief and give you a welcome break from the grind every once in awhile. Plan a coffee date with a friend for the weekend, or use a Friday night to go see a movie if you’re not working. Social time can be a big morale boost and leave you feeling recharged and ready to dive back into your duties.Socialize moderately. Spare as much time from working and studying as you can to enjoy yourself, but don’t make it a top priority. Once your important work is done, then you can let your hair down and hang out with your friends.
Avoid excessive partying. Not only does it eat into your valuable time, it can often leave you feeling tired and less prepared to deal with the following day’s work.

, Find positive ways to alleviate stress when you start feeling overwhelmed. Take a bubble bath, exercise or meditate instead of having a drink at the end of a long day. Use a day planner or notebook to help you keep track of what needs to be done so you can relieve your mind of some of the burden. Even something as small as cooking a nice meal for yourself can help you re-center and blow off steam. Stress destroys your well being as it accumulates, so give yourself a way to get free of it.Regular exercise promotes the circulation of endorphins in the bloodstream, which can cut stress, improve your mood and even enhance your body’s metabolism, giving you more energy and keeping you from burning out.Take a few minutes of quiet time before bed every night to shut off all electronic devices and relax. Too much sensory stimuli can make it difficult to fall asleep, so turn the lights down low, stretch out and let your brain breathe after a hard day., If you just can’t keep up with your coursework or you’re putting in too many hours at your job, talk to your manager or professors. There’s no shame in asking for help. See if there’s any part of your curriculum or work schedule that can be simplified to accommodate your numerous obligations. There’s a big difference between expecting special treatment and asking for a little aid or guidance. In all likelihood, your boss or teacher will be happy to work with you when they see how much you’re balancing in your life.Ask your professor in advance to grant you a small deadline extension on an assignment if you don’t think you’ll be able to finish it in time.
If you work a sales or service job, consider swapping shifts with a coworker to strategize your academic productivity.

Take frequent breaks.",How to Make the Most of Your Time when Studying," Having a schedule makes you see that you have certain things to do and will give you an allocated time that you should be focusing only on your studying.;
, This can vary from individual to individual. Study when your brain functions best to help maximize its performance and reduce redundancy.

, Distractions slow down performance because they defocus the mind.

, Perhaps one of the greatest skills in studying is being able to do this well as it improves test scores and saves time.

, Everyone's brain is wired differently, and we all learn in different ways. Some of us are visual learners others are auditory or kinesthetic learners. Find out what you are and increase the method which you brain learns from best to save more time. For example, if you are an auditory learner listening to lectures on tape and going to class may be more important than reading the text. If one is more visual the textbook and notes become the most important aid in studying.

, Stay on the look out for new ways to study and create some for yourself. After time studying will become easier and more of a routine than a challenge.

, Try to study up on the material before class so that you can refresh your memory in case the teacher calls upon you.

, One of the cornerstones of education and life is being able to and knowing how to study. There are many things in life that need studying whether it be a homework problem, a hole in the wall, building a model, putting a puzzle together or solving a relationship obstacle. The better one know how to study the more time one will save and the greater one will achieve when it comes around to testing time.

, Of course, there are instances where you will need to study or work on homework for much longer than a few hours. In these cases, make sure that you are taking frequent breaks. Every 30 minutes to an hour, get up and stretch your legs to avoid stiffness and muscle cramps. Moving around a bit will get your metabolism going and leave you feeling more energized. A small snack that is high in protein and low in sugar is also a good way to boost your energy. Also try to not spend all your time eating

Daydream a bit.,
Doodle in your notebook.,
Enjoy some creative writing time.,
Make rhymes.,
Count your way to freedom.",How to Make School Time Fly1," If you've got a few minutes before the bell rings, let your mind wander a bit. Think about what you're going to do after school or where you'd travel in the world if you could go anywhere. Make believe you can fly or have some other super power. Just let your mind wander, and take a little break. When you come back, you'll realize more time has passed than you would have expected.








Don't let your imagination wander too far. Try to refocus on class material by incorporating it into your flights of fantasy. For example, if you're bored in math class, try to include the day's lesson in a fantasy about robots to keep you grounded and learning. Do these robots battle each other using the quadratic equation?;
, If your teacher doesn't make the rounds to see what you're writing, you can try drawing in your notebook as the teacher talks. If you tilt the notebook toward you, you'll look like you're taking notes, but you'll actually be making the time pass more quickly.







, This method may work even better than doodling. As long as your teacher doesn't look too closely at what the words are, it will definitely look like you're taking notes. Write a journal entry or write a note to your best friend. Alternatively, try writing a short story based on something you see in the room. What's that stapler's life story, for instance?







, With everything your teacher says, try to turn it into a rhyme. For instance, if your teacher says, ""The climate in Spain is very wet."" You could think, ""When in Spain, it will rain."" As an added bonus, you'll still partially be paying attention.







, Pick something to count. You can count the number of times your teacher uses the letter ""z"" or the number of times she says ""Listen!"" Counting forces you to stay awake and can help you lose track of the time.

Come to class ready to learn.,
Interact with your teacher and classmates.,
Ramp up your listening skills.,
Take notes well.,
Try to state it your own way.",How to Make School Time Fly2," If you don't know your stuff ahead of time, you're going to be bored to tears in class because you won't understand what's going on. When you're bored, time passes more slowly. If you are ready ahead of time, class will seem more interesting, and time will pass faster.








Do your homework before class, including all the reading. It can also help you to review your notes from last class when you're waiting for class to start so you remember where you are.It can also help to be physically ready for class. That means that you've eaten a good breakfast or lunch and gotten enough sleep, so that you can focus on what's going on., When you're given a chance, speak up in class. Join in with what people are talking about. If your teacher doesn't allow small group discussions, she probably at least encourages you to ask and answer questions. Being engaged instead of sitting there bored can help time pass faster.







, Engaging in class doesn't just mean you talk more. It also means you listen better.








Try to block out other sounds besides what your teacher or other students are saying. That is, try not to listen to the pencil tapping in the back of the round, the student next to you rustling paper, or the car alarm going off outside. Force your attention on the teacher., Note taking is not a skill you are naturally born with. You have to learn how to do it well, and it takes some practice. Fortunately, you have time to do that while you are still in school.








Focus on the main points. It's impossible to take down everything your teacher says word for word, unless you can bring your laptop to school, and you're a super fast typist. That means you need to focus on writing down the main ideas. Your teacher should help you with this by emphasizing what's most important a few times. He or she may even say what you should be writing down.Additionally, pay attention to what your teacher writes on the board or projector. You know those ideas are important.

, One way to keep your brain going in class is to think about your crush or someone you like. Maybe think about memories or write your notes in your own words. If you're just writing it exactly as the teacher says it, you may not be actually taking it in. Plus, you're not engaging your brain, so you're more likely to get bored. However, if you try to put it in your own words, you'll be more engaged and learn more at the same time.








For instance, if your teacher says, ""One of the major wars of the 20th Century was World War II."" You could write, ""Big war, 20th century, World War II."" You don't need to write complete sentences, just enough to get the idea down.
In fact, don't be afraid to use abbreviations you understand so you can get down more information."
"
Break your classes into chunks.,
Figure out why you find school so boring.,
Try to find solutions for your problems.,
Challenge yourself.",How to Make School Time Fly3," When you're looking at one boring length of time, it can seem to stretch on forever. However, when you break your time up into smaller pieces, it may seem to go faster as get through smaller chunks. Of course, you're just doing this in your head, but this little mind game can make it seem like you're getting through school faster.For instance, you could break up periods into ""starting class,"" ""getting information,"" ""taking notes,"" ""getting the homework assignment,"" and ""preparing to leave."" You could even write these sections in your notebook and cross them off as you get through them. Alternatively, you could do specified chunks of time, such as the first 15 minutes, the second 15 minutes, and so on.

, Write down things that you find annoying or boring about school. Maybe it's certain subjects you don't like. Maybe you just don't like sitting still for so long. Maybe you can't stand not talking for that period of time. Whatever it is, write it down., If you can't sit still for very long, ask your teachers if your class can take short stretch breaks in the middle of class, so you can move more. If you're bored by certain subjects, try to find things that interest you within that subject. For instance, you may hate history, but you may find it more interesting when you read the individual stories of people in that time period, rather than a general overview.You can't change everything you dislike about school. However, you can change some things. Don't be afraid to talk to your teachers about things that would help you. Some teachers may not be willing to change the class up, but others will want to do everything they can to help you.If you do approach your teacher with a request, make sure to do it when you're not in class. Try coming after school. You could say something like, ""Hi, Mrs. Jones. I came here to ask you to consider a favor. I know class is already short, but I was wondering if maybe we could take a short stretch break in the middle. Moving around a little can really help me focus better, and I think other students might feel the same. I completely understand if you don't want to do it, but I'd appreciate it if you thought about it.""

, Sometimes you may feel a little bored because you're waiting for other students to catch up. If you are bored for that reason, it's fine to ask your teacher for something a little more challenging while you wait. She may be able to give you something that will help you use your brain and keep you entertained at the same time."

Write down your goals on a white board.,
Clean up your areas of work.,
Get a planner.,
When you take something out of it's place, put it back.,

Take some time in your day to overview what has been done and what has to be done.,
Keep notes of things.,
Step back and look at your life.",How to Have an Organized Lifestyle (Teens)," The goals can be something like Stop talking in class, Exercise more, or to improve grades by report card time. These goals can be on different topics of life from health to behavior to school.;
, This may include your bedroom, locker, desk,bookbag, etc. Make sure they're cleaned out before you think about starting to get organized. This will help you feel like one part of organizing your life is accomplished.

, If you already have one, awesome. Write down your daily events. Let's say you're going to a friend's house at 3:30 on Tuesday. Write it down. It keeps things more organized when it comes to homework. If you're at your friend's house until 7:00, that gives you until 10:00 to finish that page of homework. It will keep you from forgetting your projects, too!

, Don't wait until ""later"" to do it, or that rainfall will turn into a hurricane. It's way easier to just keep it neat as you go throughout your day!

, For example: 6:00 - Wake up; 6:05 - Get dressed; 6:10 - Eat breakfast. Make sure you stick to the schedule, don't skip some things or don't press the snooze button, as that will ruin your schedule. However, keep things flexible, or it will be too confining. The best way to do this is to create a schedule on a white board so you can change it every day and not waste paper.

, Have you changed your behavior the way you wanted to? Or have you raised your grade in science class?

, If Track is canceled, write it down. It lets you recall things easier.

, Does it seem more organized? Have you done everything you have needed to do? If so, congratulations!

Talk it over with your partner.,
Contact coworkers that are parents too.,
Ask a relative to help out.,
Find a babysitter or daycare nearby.,
Consider bringing your child to work.",How to Manage a Snow Day As a Working Parent1," If you know you won’t be able to stay home with the kids, see if your partner can. If both of you have to work and can’t work from home, you may need to find another option, but make sure to communicate with each other as soon as you hear the kids have a snow day.If you live in an area with regular snow days, consider setting up a system where you and your partner alternate weeks as the “on-call” parent for snow days.
Even if you both need to go to work, someone will need to make arrangements regarding the kids' care.;
, If you know some of your coworkers have kids too, call them to see what their plans are. You may even be able to watch everyone's kids this time around and let your co-workers go to work, with the understanding that they’ll watch your kids on the next snow day.Reach out to trusted neighbors for the same reason. A similar situation can likely be arranged with other families nearby.

, One of the unspoken benefits of living near relatives, especially retired relatives, is the potential for free babysitting. Don’t hesitate to ask anyone you know won’t be working. Ask if they’d prefer to come to your home or have the children brought to their home., Even if only as a last resort, it’s worth keeping a phone number for a nearby babysitter or daycare on hand when you can’t find another option. The closer the better, since the weather may make traveling harder and you may not have the time to wait for a babysitter to come from across town., This won’t work for everyone, but it’s worth considering. If your child is of grade school age and can occupy themselves for significant portions of time, they may be content to spend time at your place of work.Be sure to ask your employer if bringing your child to work is appropriate.
Bring along books, toys, and games they enjoy.

Plan your day together.,
Get outside early in the day.,
Incorporate quiet time in the afternoon.,
Allow more screen time.",How to Manage a Snow Day As a Working Parent2," If you’re able to stay home with the kids, it can prove challenging, especially if you’re hoping to work a bit from home. It can help to plan the day together in the morning, and talk with your kids about the day’s activities.For instance, you can make plans to play outside in the morning, then come in for lunch, then have some quiet time, and then work on an art project or watch a movie.
Get input from your kids by asking what they want to do. Including them in the plans will get them excited to see the plans through.

, One of the best parts about snow days, in many kids' eyes, is the snow itself. Whether building snowmen, digging snow forts, or sledding is their favorite snow day activity, they’re likely hoping to play outside. Equally important: the time spent in the snow will tire your children out and keep them from getting too rambunctious while being indoors the rest of the day., Regardless of the age of your children, afternoon quiet time is a good idea for everyone. Young children can nap, and grade school children can study or read a book.Don’t take the “quiet” part of quiet time too literally. If one of your children wants to practice an instrument or listen to music, allow them to do so as long as they won’t interrupt you or their siblings.
This will also provide you an opportunity to get a bit of work done.

, You may try to regulate your children’s screen time by limiting them to a certain amount each day. On a snow day, however, you can relax these rules. Do note that a snow day is a special circumstance before allowing kids to watch an extra episode of their favorite show or play longer than normal on the computer.Just say something like, ""Since it's a snow day, it's alright if you want to play Minecraft a little while longer than normal.""
Extended screen time will give you the chance to get a bit more work done too.

"
"
Plan office hours.,
Establish a specified work space.,
Check the forecast for the following days.,
Enjoy the unexpected time together.",How to Manage a Snow Day As a Working Parent3," If you need to stay home to watch the kids but still need to work, sticking to your routine as much as possible will help. Of course, watching your children will include some inevitable distractions. To limit these, plan to spend certain hours with them, and set aside other hours to work on specific tasks while they do planned activities.For instance, spend an hour in the morning together outside and then set the kids up with their favorite toys until lunch.
In the afternoon, set them up with some sort of screen entertainment for a few hours in the afternoon while you work some more, and then go outside again for another hour altogether before dinner.

, If you don't have a home office, it's worth establishing one room or table in your home as off-limits for your kids on a snow day. Set up everything you need to work here, and make it clear that you don't want to be bothered during your planned working hours unless necessary.If younger children need to stay close to you, set them up at a nearby table with a task of their own, such as a homework assignment or coloring book.

, If this snow day caught you by surprise, make of point of trying to check the weather in the evening. This is especially important the night of a snow day, because the poor weather may continue into the following day and you may need to plan for another snow day.Another benefit of checking the weather ahead of time is the potential to schedule your work responsibilities accordingly. For instance, if you ever see that the end of the week looks like bad weather, work on your more important assignments early in the week.

, While your initial reaction to the news of a snow day may be frustration, it might help to take a deep breath and remind yourself how quickly your kids are growing up. Yes, it may be a challenge if you fall behind at work, but you may find yourself having a great time at home with your children."

, Lay it out somewhere that you can remember to find it in the morning.


Include accessories if you want to wear these.

, Wake up at least thirty minutes or earlier before school starts, so that you have plenty of time to get ready. It's also helpful to use an alarm clock or radio to wake up.

, This is a good start for keeping nice and clean during the school day.


If you want, take a shower. It will make you smell and feel better throughout the whole day.

, You'll be glad that you laid out your clothes the night before.

, Style it any way you like or just leave it as it is.

,, Make sure you like what you have for breakfast. And always remember, any breakfast is better than none.So eat up!

, For example:


Move your siblings! Help them get up in the morning. They might be the reason that you're late.

, If you live far from school, you should wake up at least an hour and a half before you set off. For example, if you need to be in school by 8:35, wake up at 7AM.


Make sure you go to bed a little early, but not too early, so that you don't oversleep the next day. Ten or eleven PM is a good time if you're a night owl.

, When you finally do, go to the bathroom and wash your face, and brush your teeth; although, some people prefer eating, then doing this. It's up to you, really.

, And don't forget to spray some deodorant! If you don't have a school uniform, set out your outfit the night before.

, Spend some time fixing it up! If you're a girl, curl it, put it in a high pony, or do overnight beach waves. Boys are usually good with simply combing it out.

, Bring pens, pencils and rulers, for example.

, This boosts your metabolism and performance throughout the day. Have a good cereal, or make yourself some eggs. You could even have a smoothie if you have time. A great fast filling smoothie recipe is one banana, a handful of cut-up strawberries, and a splash of milk., It is always useful to have a bag hanging around for any loose papers and homework. Bring your homework, your pencil case with pens, a couple of mechanical pencils, an eraser, your lunch or your lunch money, your makeup bag filled with touchups, and your emergency kit.

You can also include some things that you won't need every day, but might need occasionally. Here are some good survival supplies for the classroom:


A spare pencil and sharpener, or extra pencil lead
A small stapler with extra staples
A pink eraser
Paper clips
A highlighter
A flash drive
Post-It notes
A copy of your schedule;
, The nurse is always available for serious injuries or problems, but if you want to take care of a small cut or other issue yourself, it's good to have some basic first-aid stuff:


Band-Aids
Ibuprofen or aspirin (check with your parents/school nurse)
Antacid tablets
Antibiotic ointment
Tampons or pads

, Feeling clean and confident is essential to school survival. Keep a few hygiene supplies in your kit to make sure you can make it through the day with little touch-ups, if necessary:


Deodorant
Breath mints or gum, if permitted
Perfume, cologne, or body spray
Face wipes or oil pads
Hand sanitizer or lotion
A toothbrush or some toothpicks
Chapstick

, In-between class snacks are a great way to help get yourself through the day. If you need a little boost, try keeping one of the following healthy snacks and treats in your survival kit:


Granola bars
Some dried fruits or fruit leather
Some nuts or sunflower seeds
Chocolate, for an occasional treat

, Even if you've got most of your numbers in your phone, it's important to have a list of important contact numbers in case of an emergency. If you lose your phone or your phone dies, make sure you've got a hard copy of the following numbers:


Your parents' work numbers
Your doctor's number
Your neighbor's numbers, in case of emergency
Other important numbers

, If you wear make-up to school, you might have some touch-up stuff already in your purse or other bags. Still, if you want to have back-ups, keeping a few little things into your survival kit is a good idea:


Neutral lip-gloss
A small eye shadow palate
Eye pencil
Mascara
An applicator brush

, If you forget any of the following, you'll be happy to have some back-ups in your survival kit. These might be going above and beyond, but in an emergency, they might be essential. Consider throwing any of the following into your school survival kit:


A water bottle
Hair ties and bobby pins
A brush or comb
Spare socks and underwear
Some spare cash and change
A few batteries
A spare phone charger

, Depending on how much stuff you want to keep in your survival kit, any number of different containers might be appropriate. Make sure your survival kit can fit in your locker comfortably, or inside your back-pack if you'd rather keep it there. Any of the following make for great survival kit cases:


Tupperware containers
Lunch boxes
Small fishing tackle boxes
Old toolboxes with different compartments
Small make-up or pencil bag
Extra back-pack

, There's a lot of stuff you could put into your school survival kit, but it probably doesn't all need to be there. Only pick stuff that you're likely to need to use, and take out stuff that you end up never using. If you've never used a highlighter in your whole life, don't put one in your kit. Only you know yourself and what's best for you.


Revisit your survival kit after a few weeks of school. If there's a stapler always available in the office for students to use, you probably don't need to have your own in your survival kit.

, Depending on what kind of kit you've got, it can be fun to decorate it. If you're a creative type, decorate your kit with stickers and markers to personalize it.


Check out Pinterest for a lot of creative ideas about how to organize and decorate your kit.
Alternatively, it might be fun to make your survival kit look like something else. Put it in an old First-Aid kit to make it look like one, or a Fishing tackle box. Nobody will know the difference.

, If you keep food or other perishable items in your survival kit, make sure you go back into your kit and change them out to keep everything fresh.


Check your kit before you leave for vacation, especially. You don't want to come back from Spring break to find a bunch of dried up or rotten stuff in your survival kit.
Facial wipes and other types of pads can dry out, making them useless. Check on them regularly to make sure they're still fresh for when you need them.
Make sure you keep your caps and lids all shut, to avoid spilling or drying out any of the hand sanitizer and lotion you have in your kit.

, After you get your survival kit decorated and organized, put it somewhere you'll be able to access it regularly and easily if you need it. Most school kits are best kept in your locker at school, but you can also keep smaller ones in your back-pack or in your purse.


If you'd rather, you could even keep a kit in your car, if you drive to school, or in your cubby box at school if you don't have a locker.

When you’re finished, double-check.,
Take a break.,
Ask a parent or an older sibling to check your work.,
Check in with your study buddy.,
Consider getting a tutor.",How to Get Math Homework Done Fast," You may want to get a special agenda book for this purpose, but in a pinch, a small notebook or the Notes feature on your phone can work. Check this before you leave school every day so that you bring everything you need home with you. If you’re not sure what problem sets you’re supposed to do, or you left your worksheet in the cafeteria, then you’ll waste valuable time trying to figure out what you’re supposed to do.;
, No, you won't be using it unfairly in exams: a cheat sheet is a piece of paper with your most important notes on it. You'll want to record key ideas, theorems, and formulas on it, as well as any notes or diagrams you find particularly helpful. Make a new cheat sheet for every new unit, and update it at the end of class (or soon after) if you've learned new things that day.You might want to include sample problems with the solution and steps needed to get there.Don't write down too many examples, though--the beauty of a cheat sheet is in its brevity.
Make sure your cheat sheet fits you. You probably have some areas of math that come really easily to you. Conversely, you probably have some that are more difficult. Structure your cheat sheet around them! You might want to emphasize a subject you need to focus on (like multiplying fractions) or a studying strategy (like remembering to check your work).

, This will make it easier to find your assignments, and will help make sure that you hand them in looking good rather than crumpled up. Also, it will keep you from getting distracted by mess when you should be studying instead.


Clean out your locker on a specific day every week. If you organize it regularly, the mess won't have a chance to build up.
Some people find it helpful to color-code their supplies (a blue folder, notebook, and textbook cover for math; a green folder, notebook, and textbook cover for science…)--experiment until you find a system that makes it easy for you to remember important things!

, Choose a classmate you respect for their conscientiousness, and check in with them before you leave school. If you both agree on what you think the homework is, there’s a good chance you’re both right.

, Gather everything you need, then pick a spot to do your homework. Ideally, you’ll want a solid surface (like a table, desk, or hardwood floor) to write on, and a comfortable seat. Check the lights, too. You won’t be able to do your best if you can’t see the numbers.Your supplies might include: a calculator, pencils, a compass, a protractor, a straightedge, scratch paper, graph paper, lined paper, your textbook, the assignment.
If you’ll need water or snacks, set those out as well. This way, you won’t be tempted to use a trip to the kitchen as procrastination.
Remember that there is such a thing as too comfortable when you’re doing homework! If you’re in bed or curled up in an armchair, it’s all too easy to doze off.

, The only way to get your homework done quickly is to get down to work. Get rid of anything that's going to tempt you to waste time and drag out the homework process longer. This might include TV, your phone, or your computer or tablet.


If you’re working at home, your parents will probably be thrilled to hang on to your phone for you until you’re done.
If you’re in a public place, try stashing your phone in a hard-to-reach spot, like an inside pocket of your backpack. If it’s not easily accessible, you’ll be less likely to mindlessly grab it.

, Homework is often stressful, and math can be frustrating if you don’t feel like you know what you’re doing. Before you put pencil to paper, tell yourself that you’re capable, plan to work hard, and will finish the assignment, no matter what. (And keep reminding yourself of that if you need to.), You’re trying to get your homework done quickly, but making sure that you know what you’re doing beforehand can help prevent careless errors. This is especially important on word problems and story problems.

, If you tend to get bogged down with a single problem, just skip it (for now). Finish the problems you know how to do, and return to the tricky question with a fresh set of eyes later. You might have new ideas on how to deal with it, and even if you don't, at least you're much closer to being done with your homework than you were before., Some teachers require you to do this. Even if yours doesn’t, pretend it’s extra credit and write down the steps you use to solve each problem on scratch paper. This takes a little extra time, but it’s so useful that it’s worth it.If you’re not feeling confident about an answer, or you’ve checked it and know you got it wrong, having your work in front of you is really useful--you can go through each step and see where you went wrong.Showing your work for a correct answer can save you time as well! If you have another problem that uses a similar process, you can refer to your previous work to check it.

, Scan your work to make sure that you’ve solved every problem and recorded it correctly. Try running through a couple of the problems you struggled with to see if you get the same answers. If everything is neatly written down, and you feel like you could confidently explain any of your answers, then you’re all done!

, Even though you want to finish as soon as possible, taking a break can save you time by saving your brain. If you've got a long assignment of complicated problems ahead of you, help yourself by planning to rest every half hour. Step away from your study space if possible and do something else for 5 or 10 minutes.Physical activities--like jumping rope, dancing, bouncing a basketball, or braiding your hair--are great breaks.Talk to another human being (even if it’s your mom)--that’s helpful, too!

, Having another set of eyes to check over your work after you've already done it can be great. Even if you've chosen the right equation and gone about the problem in the correct way, you might have added wrong or made another small mistake. This isn’t cheating: you’re not asking them to do the work for you, just for their support.

, After you’re both done with the assignment, it’s okay to compare notes with a classmate. Everyone’s brain works differently, and so you might each understand different parts of the material more easily. Try explaining difficult concepts to each other, or practice sample problems in front of one another.


It’s best to pick someone you already have a friendly relationship with, so they’re not surprised that you’re contacting them.
Don’t lean on your study buddy too often, or you may forget how to be independent.

, If you’re struggling to finish your work quickly every day, you might benefit from one-on-one help. Tutors are great because they can help you with exactly what you’re struggling with, and can concentrate on you for a full hour session.


Ask a teacher or counselor about tutoring through your school. Many schools have volunteer or peer tutoring programs, so you can get individualized help for free.
Talk to your parents about getting a private tutor. Many of them are advanced math students or even teachers themselves, so they’re very equipped to help you learn difficult concepts. However, they can be expensive.

Work in a comfortable, well-lit environment.,
Eliminate distractions by putting away your electronics and isolating yourself.,
Set a timer.",How to Get Your Homework Done Fast1," Try sitting at a desk in a padded, comfortable chair. Avoid doing homework on the floor or on your bed, because these areas are more likely to make you sleepy and distracted.Also make sure that you’re working in a well-lit area so you don’t have to strain your eyes to read., Turn off your cell phone, log off of your computer (unless you will need it for your homework), turn off the television and close the door. Let your family and friends know that you do not want to be disturbed while working so they can respect your privacy.Download website-blocking apps such as Freedom or SelfControl to stay focused while using your computer for homework.

, At the start of each assignment or subject, start a timer with however many minutes you’re aiming to complete your work in. You can regularly glance at the timer to stay aware of how much time is going by and how much you have left. This will help you realize when you’re spending too much time on something, and will quickly snap you back into focus when you get distracted.If one subject or type of assignment is taking much more time than the others, you may want to ask for a little extra help in that area from your teacher or parent.

Get your supplies in order.,
Make a homework plan for the evening.,
Start your homework soon after you get home from school.,
Prioritize by due date and importance.",How to Get Your Homework Done Fast2," To avoid wasting time looking for things, have all your books, papers, writing utensils, and other materials readily available and easy to get to. Clean out your backpack and binder(s) weekly or monthly to stay organized.


Consider consolidating your multiple different subject folders and notebooks into one big binder separated by tab dividers. This way, all of your schoolwork will be in one place., Instead of just grabbing the first book in your backpack and starting the work, plan ahead. There are several ways that you can plan out how to do your homework for the evening, including:


Decide how much time you want to spend on your homework collectively.
Make a list of all the different tasks you need to finish.
Estimate how much time you’ll be able to spend on each task to finish your homework when you want to.
Work straight through your list and cross tasks off as you go., Waiting too long in the evening to start may result in working late into the night, which isn’t good because it’s much harder to work quickly when you’re tired. Similarly, waiting until the next morning to do your homework will probably result in a rushed or incomplete end result., As you write assignments down in your planner throughout the week, make sure to write an “A” next to high priority tasks, a “C” next to lower priority tasks, and a “B” next to tasks that fall somewhere in between. An assignment that has to be completed by the next day would probably take priority over one that’s due next Tuesday. Also prioritize bigger assignments over smaller ones.


A ten page essay that’s due in a week that you haven’t started should be labeled an “A” or “B” while a short five question worksheet due in three days may be labeled a “C”.Make sure you don't wait until the last second to get assignments done.

Take breaks.,
Eat snacks and drink water.,
Reward yourself with a fun post-homework activity.",How to Get Your Homework Done Fast3," Focusing for hours and hours without stopping will most likely just slow you down. Every 25 minutes or so, take about 5 minutes to stretch and walk around to give your brain and body a quick rest., Drink plenty of water and eat light, healthy, tasty snacks while you work to enjoy foods that you like, enhance your memory, and revitalize your brain and body. Stay away from soda, sugary junk food and energy drinks while you work to make sure that you won’t crash halfway through completing your homework.Try eating celery sticks and apple slices with peanut butter.

, Plan to go over to a friend’s house, play your favorite video game, shoot hoops in the driveway, or go out for a sweet treat with your sibling(s) once your homework is done. Remembering that this fun activity is coming up will help you stay motivated to focus and work efficiently.

When choosing lockers, try to get a locker that is close to the majority of your classes.,
Keep your locker organized!,
Ask the main office for a map of the school.,
Make sure you know when to go to your locker.,
Get to school early so you have some time to organize your locker.,
If you aren't very assertive, you may get held up in the hallway.,
Avoid having to go to your locker between classes.,
If you need to go to the bathroom, ask a teacher about 2 minutes before the bell rings so that you can still have enough time to go to the bathroom without being late to your next class.

,
Wear a watch.,
Do not socialize in the halls!",How to Get to Class on Time," This way, in the morning when you come, you can go straight to your locker and get about enough books for three periods. This will help you avoid hallway traffic during each passing period.;
, Keep a calendar, an organizer, perhaps a locker shelf, and pens and pencils in your locker. A pad or a white erase board can assist you also. This way, you can get in and out of your locker and to class quickly.

, This will help you can mark your classes and your routes to each of them. Use different colors for different classes, and draw arrow marks to which direction you're going and at what time.

, You shouldn't go to your locker too often. If you pass your locker on the route to one of your classes, get your books then. Try not to move out of your pathway to access something.

, Put your books in the order of your schedule to cut off on in between-classes time. Get your books for your first few classes (or the classes that you have until you can get to your locker) and put them in your bag. Then go to your first class.

, Sometimes you may need to excuse yourself as you push through people.

, If you can, it's always better to go to your locker before your lunch break (since you can't be late to that period) and get the necessary materials for the rest of the day. It will make it easier for you to get to your classes after lunch, while avoiding crowded hallway staircases.

,, Knowing the time can easily help you keep track of how fast you need to move. Train your watch to the same scheduling as your school bells.

, It’s almost unavoidable, but the only way to make it to class on time is to go straight to it. However, you can walk with a classmate who has the same class as you and talk.

Breaks!,
Concentration!,
Discipline!",How to Get Your Homework Done Right After School," If you think positively and realistically about your homework as soon as you get home from school, you will be much more likely to get it done. Plan ahead. Will you have the whole night free? Make sure you don't spend your time playing (if you do your homework first you won't have to plan this as much). If you are someone who needs pressure to get things done, plan activities after school so you will be productive inside and outside of schoolwork. Even just seeing the great benefits from following these steps means you are serious about becoming more responsible and are heading in the right direction. Good for you!;
, As soon as you get home, it's important to act quickly so that you do not fall into the temptation of the computer, or whatever else is preventing you to complete your homework as soon as you get home.

, It's important to be organized, so you do not have trouble finding things and become frustrated. Write assignments down so you know what you need to get done. Gather everything that you need so that you don't have to walk around the house, looking at all the temptation available. Keep your work space free of distractions, such as electronics or the refrigerator.


Put all the supplies you will need to do your homework in your room, on your desk, or wherever you do your homework.
Grab a bottle of water the morning before, and a pack of something or a piece of fruit- nothing that has to be refrigerated -and put them with the school supplies, so that you have a snack in case you are hungry after school.

, It's great that you'd like to do your homework with your precious after school hours, but it's important to keep determined. Although the weather might be nice, or that new something or other is begging you to play it, you have to stay determined, or you'll be back to square one.

, Although you want to do your homework as soon as you get home, it's important not to overwork yourself. Take a ten minute break every hour, and get some water, take a short walk, or even check your Facebook/Myspace. Just don't start going onto Facebook/Myspace if you aren't yet determined, or you'll probably spend your night on there.

, It's important to concentrate when you are reading that book for your book report or writing your history essay. If you have a cell phone beside you, switch it off and don't use it at all until you have finished your homework. If you are watching a television program while doing your homework, do not do that because you will be looking at the television all the time and you will never get any homework done. If you are surfing Facebook or Twitter while doing your type-out essay, quit the Internet.

, When you get home from school, immediately shower, have a nice little break that lasts for about 20 minutes and start your homework immediately. Check to see what homework you have so you don't remember to do something at the last minute (a planner might help keep track of your different assignments). Try to get what you can done- do not tell yourself, ""I'm going to play that new video game. I can always do my homework later."", because often times you'll get carried away with playing. You can plan a timetable of your activities or think ahead and plan a schedule beforehand. Keep a notebook with you to do these, e.g. if you want to start your homework at 2.30, write down 2.30-4.30PM - Homework and make sure you stick to your schedule. Reward yourself if you follow that schedule, and do it every day.

Always have a plan and know when your due dates are for assignments.,
Don't procrastinate!,
Use the extra time in between activities.,
Get to know your teammates!,
Let your coach know when you are not going to be at a practice or game.,
Remember that every sport has some topic of school in it.,
Remember that good grades equal scholarships.",How to Get Good Grades in IB While Doing Extra Activities," If you haven't already heard from your peers, IB is very challenging. And adding the extra responsibility of sports is like another 20 pounds on your back. But the thing that is most helpful is having a plan for everyday. Schedule things early, and stick with that decision. Know what you are going to be doing the next day and the night before get all your materials together. When you get the schedule for your games and practices,write them down in an agenda or calendar.;
, Procrastination is in the top 5 reasons why students drop out of IB. When you leave things to be done during last minute, it totally tears you apart. Doing assignments that are due the next day will bore you and WILL stress you out because you will have other things on your mind like ""Am i going to get enough sleep"" or ""Man, I have a test i forgot to study for tomorrow"". When you procrastinate it's pretty much like digging a hole and everyday it will get deeper, and then you have to try to climb out of it. So, do your homework the day that it is giving to you. Do not wait for the day before its due to start and do it.

, Us humans don't really use all the advantages life gives to us. So, next time you are alone think of all the extra time that you have and instead of just sitting and staring at the walls or clouds, DO SOMETHING USEFUL TO YOU IN THE FUTURE! Like on the way to and from school or the grocery store or practice....you are most likely sitting and that it!!! Take out your homework and do it in the car. Read a book or go through your planner. Use the extra time that you have, while you STILL have it!

, Even though you may think that on the field or court your teammates act stupid, they actually mat be very smart. If you are having trouble in a subject, go around and ask who is understanding that material and will agree to tutor you. If they do not have the extra time, have them go through the lesson during practice while you are with them. There is bound to be someone that is good at your weakness. And your stronger subject is someone else's weakness.

, This is the number one rule besides treating your coach with respect. This does also kind of fall in the respect category. You need to let your coach know about all the other activities that you are in besides of that team. The difference from telling and not is maybe being on the bench for a game or two. Everyone has a certain role on a team and when that coach has practice, they plan out what they want done, and with out certain people, their whole plan may have to be changed to something different. And if the coach doesn't know that you are not going to be there, practice may move slower and nothing will get done., EVERY SPORT HAS SOME TOPIC OF SCHOOL IN IT! When you play a sport, there are certain things you must do. And while playing that sport, you have to be smart and think about the steps that you take to do well and be the best at that sport. So for example, a goalkeeper in any sport must know geometry because they need to keep the ball or object out of the goal. Therefore, they need to cut off the angle from where the object is coming from. Leading to them saving the goal from the object going into it. So even if it is math, science, history or any other subject, try to find how it occurs in your sport.

, Being a great athlete and student is a double plus. You are more likely to get a scholarship because you are good at multiple things. And going to college with a free ride is a great way to save money and have fun. In IB, B's and C's are alright, but your main goal is trying to get straight A's. Because then you are guaranteed a scholarship. And also when you are on a team,you need to meet a criteria in order to stay on the team. And when you DO NOT meet it, you WILL get kicked off of that team and can only do your studies.

Take a moment to consider what you want out of a summer job.,
Think about your past experience.,
Consider the goals you have and the skills you want to acquire.,
Add to your list of goals as you gain more experience.,
Ask for advice if you are having trouble getting started.",How to Find a Summer Job As a Student1," The type of summer job you apply for should be based on what you are hoping to get out of it. Ask yourself questions that will help you to determine what kind of job you should be applying to. Ask questions like:

Do you want to get some experience in your field of study? Look for internships and assistant positions where you can learn the basics of your industry.



 


Are you hoping a summer job could turn into a full time job at the company once you graduate? Look for entry-level positions that you can continue to work part-time while you finish school.






Are you simply hoping to make some extra money during your summer break? Then broaden your search to cover many fields that pay well or that offer plenty of hours.





;
, When trying to figure out what sort of jobs you should apply for, take a moment to think about the jobs and experiences you have had in the past. In particular, think about the skills you have and what sort of job they could be useful for.Ask yourself:


What skills have you learned from those experiences? How can they be applied to other jobs?
Is there a particular job that you loved, and you would like to find another one like it?
Is there a job you hated and want to avoid in the future?

, Take a moment to create a list of goals for yourself that you want to achieve through a summer job. Also consider the skills that you are hoping to develop while working during your break. Make a list of these goals and skills. Refer back to the list when you begin applying for jobs. If the job you are applying for won’t fulfill these goals or skills, you might want to consider applying to a different job.What type of projects would you be really excited about working on?
What type of working environment are you hoping to be a part of?
What companies you would specifically be targeting
What sort of people or teammates do you want to learn from?

, Your goal and desired skill list should be an ever-changing document. While you might have an experience or hold a job that allows you to cross off one of the goals on your list, you should also be adding new goals as they arise.

, It can be hard to start up a job search, particularly if it is your first one. Don’t be afraid to as for help from people who have applied to jobs before. They might be able to give you personal tips that could completely change your job search. Talk to people like:


Your parents and relatives.

Consider starting your job search in late winter or early spring, as most company’s will begin accepting summer job applications around that time.

, Some countries may have legal restrictions for students who are hoping to work. In particular, if you are younger than 18 years old, there is a chance that you will have to obtain working papers (ie. employment and age certificates) that will make it legal for you to start working.


Talk to your guidance counselor at your school about whether or not you need working papers.
If you are in the United States, you can also contact the State Department of Labor to find out more about working papers and if you need them or not.

, Many companies will ask for references along with your resume when you apply for a job.

Teachers.
Academic advisors.
Coaches.
Volunteer leaders.

, When applying for jobs, you should try to apply to positions that will help you to achieve one of your goals or hone a desired skill. Interviewers can often tell if you are passionate or excited about a position.

, When you have a large network of professionals, you are likely to find a job more quickly than people who do not know anyone in their field. To expand your network and find out if anyone you know knows of available jobs, talk to teachers, former employers, friends, parents, and coaches.Talk to these people about any job openings they might know of, or if they have recommendations about who you should talk to or what companies you should look into.

, There are many websites out there that list job openings. You can search these websites for jobs in the field you are interested in.

Doing this can help you to stand out from the sea of faceless online resumes the company receives.


When you go into the office, talk to the receptionist about what positions are available, and if there is anyone you can talk to right away about setting up an interview.

, If you go into an office and ask about available positions, you may be asked to do an interview right then and there. That means that you need to be prepared before hand.

Tell me a little about yourself?
What experience do you have in this field?
Where do you see yourself in five years?
What do you think your strengths are?
What do you think your weaknesses are?
When can you start working and how many hours do you think you could work each week?

Prioritize your assignments by dividing your homework into categories.",How to Do Your Homework on Time if You're a Procrastinator1,"


Choose a quiet area that is free of distractions (e.g. computers, phone, music, etc). You may also want to avoid busy areas as background noise can snap you out of focus.
Make sure that you have your supplies. Get out your books, your notebooks, your writing utensils and anything else that you need for this assignment.
Avoid doing homework on your bed. Do homework at a desk or at a table so that you aren't tempted to sleep.
Choose a well-lit area. Dim light tends to make focusing on your assignments more difficult. Also, a well lit area makes you see your work better.;
,



High Priority: This category includes homework that you have to turn in tomorrow. It may also include homework in subjects that you find more difficult. Do the work in this category first while you are more mentally focused.

Medium Priority: This category includes homework that is due later, including larger research projects. Divide these assignments into sections and do 1 or 2 sections every day until the due date.

Low Priority: These assignments include subjects that are very easy for you. Save them for last so that you can concentrate even when you are tired.
Skip extra credit assignments unless you're desperate for a better grade. Even you need a break sometimes. These can also be extremely helpful if you've been sick, failed a test, or didn't do a major homework assignment.

You may prefer to work in short time blocks. If staring at a book for 2 straight hours without a break makes you miserable, then don't do it. Work for 1 hour when you get home. Then, take a break, eat dinner and work for another hour after dinner.

, Then, write times for when they need to be started by. For example, you could put ""Math Worksheet 5:00"". Take any extra time you have in between the times and when you finish the assignment for yourself.


You may want to start studying and work until you are finished. Make sure that you at least stand up and walk around about every 45 minutes to refresh your mind and body.
You may learn best when you work with others. However, be honest with yourself. If other people distract you instead of helping you, then you need to work alone. Also, a lot of assignments require you to work individually.

,


Avoid putting off large or difficult assignments until the last minute. You might not be able to finish them.
Never do your homework between 2 class periods. Rushing through an assignment usually results in a bad grade.
Avoid doing homework during a class. You might end up missing something important.
Save ""late homework"" passes (if you get them) for true emergencies.
Never copy another person's work. You are capable of doing better. Besides, your teacher will catch on eventually.
Block the internet. Research shows that taking control and blocking the internet when you do your homework means you get it done more quickly, leaving lots of time for fun. Don't pull an all-nighter to finish an assignment. You'll make more mistakes when you're sleep-deprived.


,


Do 50 minutes of homework and then look at Facebook for 10 minutes. Just set a timer for yourself so that you don't procrastinate.

Look for locker shelves and racks that look sturdy, and take up the least amount of space. Buy small notebooks, if your teachers would allow it, so that if you have a lot to carry between classes, they won't take up so much space. (You can look up some good related articles on locker space and school supplies for more tips.) If you have any friends or siblings who were recently in your grade, ask them about any additional things they needed to be prepared. Also get things you will need specifically for each class, like a scientific calculator and ruler for math, a composition notebook and editing tips book for English, or extra reeds for band (that type of thing!) When you get everything, organize your locker when you are allowed to.

, Keep a small, somewhat flat zipper pack in your binder/bag to keep a few pencils, pens, highlighter, calculator, etc. so you aren't caught off-guard during class. Keep your textbooks upright, in the order you will use them. If you don't have much time to go from class to class, think ahead and carry what you can (where you can walk without easily dropping anything) the class before. Organize your binder/bag regularly so that you can access papers quickly without wasting time or space. Label things. Take things to and from lunch if you are allowed to-keep the bulk out if you can, but you can still carry something so you don't take as long to get to your next class. Who knows, you could even work on homework if you finish eating early! It isn't hard to work on something and be in a conversation if you focus. And don't work on homework WHILE you eat-it can get very messy and make you rush.

, In class, listen and work efficiently. Work on your handwriting so that you can write quickly and still read it! That is very important. Work on homework at school as much as you can (as long as it doesn't disrupt you/others DURING class), and don't be afraid to ask teachers for help on an assignment that troubles you. Just think of it as professionally enhancing your work! Also, work on homework right after school. Grab a snack, maybe turn on the radio softly, and/or adjust the lighting to your satisfaction, and start and finish your homework in a space where you are not distracted OR discouraged. If you have block scheduling, (4 classes a day, a total of 8 classes) do most, or all, if you can, of your homework the first day, and finish the rest as quickly as possible if it isn't done the first day. If you happen to have an assignment you didn't complete that is due that day, make sure to take it to school and work on it in the morning in the bleachers, or esp. the library before class. You may still have a chance at completing it, or at least getting some credit. It is especially good to have a folder for homework that you need to finish urgently, so you don't lose them in other binders, folders, or papers. Finally, write in your agenda every single day, so that you won't forget anything. You don't have to write what happened in the class if you have a limited amount of time to write, but at least write down everything you need to know for your assignments that you don't already have written down.

, If you find your grades are slipping, or you have too many other activities to finish your homework, don't pull yourself down so much... drop activities that are not very important to you or take up too much time for you to commit. If you have done that and still can't finish your work, find some time you were wasting originally, or didn't realize was useful, and work then, or get a tutor of some sort.

Make a list.,
Set a Time.,
Prepare.,
Concentrate.,
Relax.,
Make the session as enjoyable as possible.,
Prevent the situation from happening again.",How to Catch Up on Your Homework," of what you need to get done, and when. Also, write down the essential stuff-what needs to be finished first. This will instantly help you clear your head and give you a solid idea of what kind of situation you are in. It'd probably be better to draw this list up on the computer, as you may be correcting or adding to things.;
, You might have a list, but you can't just start attacking your homework right away. No doubt you may be busy with other things-school activities, family outings...set some time/s for yourself when you know you'll be free and uninterrupted.

, Before you sit down for your homework session, make sure you prepare for it. Make sure you have all the tools required-pencils, pens, erasers, rulers, books...and make sure that people know you shouldn't be disturbed. Taking the time do this beforehand will not only give you extra time, but ensure that the session is less stressful.

, Don't put the session off, and don't let yourself be distracted. Avoid anything that may steal your attention. This includes the TV, cell phones, gaming devices, computers (unless you need it) and anything that you know may disrupt your homework session. Try not to think about anything else, but to focus on what you need to do.

, If your hand is shaking, you're sweating all over and your temper is short, you aren't going to get through things very fast, and the session certainly won't be an enjoyable one. Calm down. A relaxed, focused attitude will help you get through your homework faster, and prevent any other problems-such as distracted mistakes-from occurring.

, That doesn't mean you should be talking to somebody on the phone and have the T.V on the whole time. However, to have an effective homework session, you don't have to be strict. Have some snacks with you, and a drink. If it doesn't distract you, having a pet in the room can relax you more-or de-stress you. Take breaks regularly to avoid straining yourself.

, In future, make sure you are always on top of your homework, and that you are always prepared for something unexpected to happen. Hand your homework in on time and try to have regular homework sessions instead of just letting it all pile up.

Talk to your instructor in person.,
Explain the situation.,
Ask for an extension.,
Accept the instructor's response.",How to Buy More Time on an Overdue Assignment1," Instead of dashing off a quick email, take the time to talk to your teacher face-to-face. This will demonstrate that your request is sincere and necessary.


If you're in college or graduate school, drop by your professor’s office hours.
If you're in high school or middle school, ask to speak to your teacher after class or set up a time to met with them.
If you're making up an excuse, your professor might be able to see right through your lie. It might better to skip the face-to-face meeting and email them instead.;
, When you talk to your teacher, your reasons for needing an extension should be as specific as possible. Vague explanations sound fake; detailed reasons have more legitimacy. For example:


If you are struggling with depression and/or anxiety, don’t just say “I am overwhelmed.” Instead, explain how your mental health is affecting your ability to complete the assignment. “I’ve been struggling with depression all since midterms. I’ve learned that when I feel depressed, I have a very hard time focusing on my assignments. It has been very difficult for me to sit down a complete the paper.”
If you took on too many responsibilities this semester, don’t just say “I have so much on my plate.” Instead, explain how these additional responsibilities are preventing you from finishing the assignment on time.

“Due to my financial situation, I had to start working this semester. My work schedule and class schedule are very demanding. I am struggling to manage both.”
""My parents are both working overtime right now. I have been watching my little siblings for them. I am having a hard time balancing school and my responsibilities at home""
""I am training for a big competition. My practices are going way longer than expected and by the time I get home I am too exhausted to do my work."", Once you’ve explained your situation to the teacher, request a brief extension for the assignment. Requesting too long of an extension may indicate that you’ve neglected the assignment all semester.


“May I have the weekend to complete the assignment?”
“Can I have three days to finish my paper?”, Ideally, your teacher will grant you the extension without a penalty. But remember, your teacher has the right to say “no” to your request or penalize the late assignment.


If they say “yes,” thank them profusely and work hard to meet your new deadline.
If they say “no,” thank them for their time and start working on the assignment as soon as you can.
If your teacher says “yes” but attaches a grade penalty, accept the grade penalty, thank them for the extension, and work diligently to meet your new deadline."
"
Blame technology.,
Cite a lack of sources.,
Explain that you have “too much on your plate.” Students are very busy.,
Fake an emergency.",How to Buy More Time on an Overdue Assignment2," While technical difficulties are frustrating, experiencing problems with computers, USB drives, and printers can provide very valid reasons for extensions. Explain the situation to your teacher (real or fake) and hope that he or she grants you an extension.


If you have to print out your paper, experiencing “printer problems” may grant you a few extra hours to work on the assignment.
If you typically store all of your work on a USB Drive, tell your teacher the thumb drive was stolen or misplaced. They may give you a few days to search for the missing drive., Often times, high school teachers and college professors require students to analyze a variety of primary and secondary sources in their research papers and projects. If you attend a small school, you may have to request the books, articles, and documents you need from other institutions. In an attempt to get an extension, you can explain to your instructor that these sources did not arrive or arrived very late. Asking for a few additional days to wait for and/or analyze the material is a very reasonable request.

, In addition to taking several classes, you may also have a job, play on a sports team, and/or be studying for standardized tests, like the ACT, SAT, or GRE. If you explain your situation thoroughly, your professor may accept this excuse and grant you an extension.


“I am taking the MCAT next month and have been studying for the test non-stop. As a result, the assignment for your class fell off my radar. May I have a few days to complete it?”
I am taking the SAT on Saturday and I really need to study for my Latin subject test. Can I have a few more days on my project?""
“I have three papers due at the same time. I am struggling to devote attention to each assignment. May I please have an extension so I can produce a paper I am proud of?”, Life is unpredictable. If you are desperate for an excuse, use this unpredictability to your advantage. Come up with a believable emergency involving a friend, family member, or yourself.


Be prepared for your professor to ask for proof or to look into your situation."

Get to know the way your body experiences stress.,
Identify the source of your stress.,
Take 3 deep breaths.,
Ask for help.,
Practice thought-stopping.,
Move away from the situation if you can.",How to Deal With School Stress1," Do your shoulders get tense? Do you start to breathe rapidly, or notice a sour taste in your mouth? If your stomach feels tight, or your palms start to shake or sweat, you're likely feeling stress.By learning to recognize the signs of becoming stressed, you can more easily connect the feeling with its source.
The sooner you start to notice signs of stress or tension, the more rapidly you can take steps to remove yourself from the situation or calm down.;
, Is there a certain person, situation, or environment that's causing you to feel stressed out? An important tool in learning to handle your stress is to find out more about what's causing it. Sometimes it will be easy to identify one cause, and other times you might find that your stress is the result of a combination of stressors.Common sources of stress at school include homework, grades, sleep deprivation, packed schedules, peer pressure, and bullying.If you are being bullied, talk to your parents, your teachers, or a school counselor to get help.Identifying your stressors is the first step in defining your situation as manageable. If you feel like you can find a solution, this in itself should decrease your feelings of stress.
Try to avoid judging yourself as wrong or bad for feeling stressed. When you locate the source of the stress, keep an objective attitude. Tell yourself, ""I'm feeling stressed right now. That's a natural response. I am not my stress.""

, Taking deep breaths from the diaphragm triggers the relaxation response in your body, which comes from the parasympathetic nervous system. Taking in air through the nose, breathing all the way down to the belly, and allowing breath to escape slowly through the mouth will help you calm down in a stressful situation.It might help to raise, lower and roll your shoulders, or gently turn your neck. Your body often holds these muscles tense when you're feeling stressed. By relaxing these muscles you're also decreasing your feelings of stress.
Taking deep breaths before entering a stressful situation can help you stay relaxed and focused.

, If you don't know how to respond to a stressful situation, find someone to help you. If you're at school, you might ask a teacher, a counselor, or a peer for help. If it's a problem that you need help with right away, talk to someone in your classroom or ask for permission to talk to someone in another part of the building. If it's a long-term problem, consider asking your parent, your teacher, or a counselor for help.Everyone has to ask for help at times. Asking for help doesn't mean you're not independent or intelligent. In fact, it's a sign of genuine intelligence to recognize your limitations.
When you ask for help, include as much information as you can about how you've identified the problem, and things you've tried to make the problem better.

, Sometimes feeling overwhelmed in a stressful situation results in rapid, or ""racing"", thoughts. If this happens to you, try a strategy called ""thought-stopping."" This means what it sounds like: interrupt your thoughts, stop, or ""park"" them out of your immediate attention, and temporarily turn your attention to something else for a while.


You might try saying (either out loud or to yourself): ""That's enough of those thoughts for now. I will get busy (doing something else) and come back to this after lunch.""
This strategy is also known as ""adaptive distancing"".

, If you're unable to cope with a particular situation, person, or place, one method of handling it is to leave. Physically removing yourself from a situation provides relief from stress and worry.


You can take a break by taking a walk outside, going to the bathroom (always an option for taking a private moment), or something else. You might invent a story about forgetting something in your car, which will give you a reason to leave the immediate situation and walk outside.
Having favorite, safe, places in your school setting will be helpful. For example, if you feel better in quiet spaces, go visit the library when you're feeling stressed.
There are times when this is not appropriate. For example, you should not leave an exam or presentation in the middle of it. However, you could decide to leave the situation if, for example, you are having a conversation with someone that is stressing you out. Try saying something like, ""I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now. I'm going to take a little break, okay?""

Make a schedule.,
Keep a calendar in a visible, central location.,
Create an organized workspace.,
Turn off your phone.,
Set reasonable times for studying.,
Turn large assignments into small steps.,
Don't wait until the last minute.,
Ask for help.",How to Deal With School Stress2," A daily schedule should include plenty of time for your daily activities, study time, and even time to plan what you're going to wear. A lot of stress is the result of feeling rushed or hurried. If you aren't a morning person, schedule time every evening to plan ahead what you'll be wearing to school the next day. Set aside time for completing homework assignments every afternoon.A schedule can be written down for you to see, or it can be memorized. The benefits of writing a schedule down is that it's more likely to make you feel accountable to holding to it. Also, there's the benefit of being able to ""check off"" items that are finished.
You can also use a variety of schedule apps to create structure for your day.
The reason that using a schedule addresses stress is because it allows you to know what work you're supposed to be doing, and where you're supposed to be doing it. You won't have the stress of making those decisions at the last minute.

, A calendar is a great organizing structure for reminding yourself of project deadlines, events that will disrupt your daily schedule (such as doctor appointments or visits from Grandmother). Keeping it in a public place allows for your family to know what you have scheduled.If you have a project that will take several days or weeks to complete, use a calendar to divide your larger project into smaller steps.
Using a calendar for accountability helps prevent the feeling of stress that comes from last-minute cramming for a deadline.

, Setting aside a particular work area for yourself will help you feel less stressed. Find a workspace that's free from noisy distractions, where you feel you can focus on your work. Have a supply of visual reminders, markers, and materials you might need while you're studying.Remember that your organizational system doesn't have to look like anyone else's. The important thing is that it works for you.
If you're working on a computer, consider turning off your internet browser, or setting limits on yourself so that you don't end up spending your study time on other online activities.

, Having your phone nearby when you're studying can prevent you from staying focused on your schoolwork, even if you're not looking at it. If your phone is on, you can get texts or messages from friends - and even if you're not, your attention will be distracted by the possibility that someone might call. Instead, turn your phone off (or put it in ""airplane mode"") so you can be fully attentive to your studies.If you are too distracted by having your phone nearby, consider putting it another room (still turned off).
This is also true for your other screens, including tablets and computers you're not using for your schoolwork.

, The most effective length of time to schedule for studying is 40-90 minutes. If you study more than that, your attention will be weaker. If you study less, you won't have sufficient time to focus your attention. Use a timer if you need to to set limits around your study time.Take a 10-minute break away from your workspace after every study session.
During breaks from studying, stand up. Move around. Exercise helps with your concentration when studying.

, If you have an assignment that feels overwhelming, break it down into smaller parts that you know how to do. Be specific. Rather than scheduling ""work on history test,"" write, ""read pages 112-224, and write 6 study questions on the material.""If you have a long paper, you might start by writing an outline. Then write 5-8 pages on each topic listed in your outline. Combine these short papers to make your long paper.
If you're studying for a large test, break down the material into manageable steps. You can study by topic, by chapter, or by subject.

, If you are the kind of person who waits until the night before a major project is due to get it finished, or reads the whole book the night before a test, you know how stressful that can be. An extra burst of intense studying at the last minute can help you get through exams, but the best studying relies on information learned in the weeks beforehand.Use a calendar to schedule study time for a major project 2-4 weeks ahead of time.
You might need to become a little bit of a hermit for a time, but using a calendar can remind you that you'll be free to socialize after the deadline has passed.

, Everyone needs help sometimes. If you can't figure out how to get organized, ask someone to help you. Another person can take a fresh look at your workspace, and see ways to organize that you can't.


You can always borrow ideas from the way another person has learned to organize her workspace. Look online for ideas, or notice the way your friends organize their own study spaces.
If hiring a professional organizer is a possibility for you, this might be an effective way to get a new system in place. The difficulty is that, unless you learn how to use this organizational system, you'll bring your old habits into the new space and quickly develop the same habits you always had.

Figure out how you're feeling.,
Learn to say no.,
Figure out what you can put off.,
Try to set attainable short-term goals.,
Think about your long-term goals.,
Don't let social pressures stress you out.",How to Deal With School Stress3," If you're the kind of person who doesn't prioritize her own feelings, you might end up feeling overwhelmed and stressed more quickly than someone who notices her stress level inching up. You might need to include checking out your feelings as a part of your daily schedule.


Try using a ""feelings thermometer"" to take your emotional temperature.Your thermometer might range from ""Piece of cake!"" to ""Out of control!"" or similar. If your temperature is too high, do something relaxing. If it's too low, it would be a good time to try something new.
If identifying feelings is hard for you, try looking at a ""feelings chart""that can help you remember the different emotions, and identify the one that's true for you.

, It's great to be involved in a variety of activities, but if you don't have enough time to do them all, you'll end up stressed. Learning to say no is an important quality of living independently and successfully.Remember that saying no isn't always selfish, and saying yes isn't always healthy.
As you learn to practice saying no, you're also learning to prioritize your own mental well-being.

, If you won't be taking the SAT within the next year, you might be able to put off studying for it. If you have a major project due in one subject, see if you can put off studying for a test that won't occur until next week.If you've planned well, you should have scheduled adequate time for both. But don't waste time blaming yourself if you find yourself in a bind. Make the best of it, and prioritize what needs to be done first.
Remember that not everything has to be done perfectly. If you're taking a class ""pass-fail"" then you don't have to make a perfect grade in it. Doing something ""good enough"" is an important life skill for a perfectionist to master!

, It's a lot less stressful to set goals that you can actually accomplish, rather than setting goals that describe the kind of lofty ideals that you might prefer. If your goals are attainable, you'll be encouraged by the feeling of success that comes with completing a goal.For example, if you're in a new school, you might feel overwhelmed by how much you don't know about your new setting. An attainable short-term goal might be to learn your way around, and perhaps find one new person to talk to.
Setting goals that are attainable means that you'll have to know your own strengths and challenges.

, You might make a list of what you'd like your life to contain in the future. If you're in high school, you'll need to start thinking ahead to what you want to do after graduation. If you want to be a veterinarian, for instance, you'll need to think about how to balance your love of animals with your need to study trigonometry in order to get into a good veterinary college program.Post images, words, and reminders of your long-term goals near your study space.
If you aren't sure what your job goals are, that's okay. Instead, think about your priorities and values. For instance, if you know working outside is important to you, explore careers that are based in nature.
Talking with your parents, a career or guidance counselor, or another trusted person can provide some good support for this process.

, School stress isn't limited to academic pressures. Peer interactions, personality conflicts, subtle bullying and discrimination can all interfere with your ability to learn. To counterbalance the stresses that come from daily pressures, find someone to talk to. You can talk to your parents, trusted friends, a mentor or a professional counselor. Consider telling your teacher about any social issues that she may be able to help with.Try using role-playing around the situation, or develop scripts to use that can help you avoid conflicts.
Learning to stand up for yourself can help you feel less stressed over time.
Try to use ""I"" statements to talk about your responses to social pressures. For example, stating that ""I feel anxious when you do this, because it makes me feel left out."" This provides clear information about your experience while still identifying the problem to another person.

Get exercise.,
Find ways to blow off steam.,
Schedule relaxing activities.,
Make time to laugh.,
Try singing away your stress.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.",How to Deal With School Stress4," Research shows that not only is exercise a great stress-reliever, it improves your ability to concentrate and study. Find something that you love to do, and try to set aside part of every day to do it. You might like running, bicycling, walking, dancing, or another exercise. Both aerobic exercise (exercise that makes you breathe more heavily) and anaerobic exercise (like weight-lifting) can help you get rid of stress.Regular exercise actually changes your brain chemistry to get rid of stress, according to research.Exercise will improve the quality of your sleep, an important factor in preventing stress.

, If you're stressed, you'll need to find healthy ways to get rid of it. Punch a pillow, or take a deep breath. Take a short run. Your goal should be to recognize when you're stressed, and find ways that you can use to not take out your frustration on other people.Pretending that you're not stressed isn't really a successful long-term solution.
You can literally ""blow"" off steam by blowing on a pinwheel or a feather. The way this works is to encourage deep breathing and distracting your attention from the thing that's upsetting you.

, Even when you're feeling stressed, taking time to schedule relaxing activities for even short periods of time will help you avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking short walks, bubble baths, or setting aside time every day for meditation are all ways to include relaxation as a healthy part of your daily schedule.Find relaxing activities that don't take very long to do, such as jumping on a trampoline for the length of your favorite song, or spending 10 minutes playing with your dog.
Remember that doing things that make you feel relaxed and happy are essential part of living a successful life. They shouldn't make you feel guilty.

, Laughter is consistently shown to be one of the best ways to counteract stress. Taking 30 minutes to watch your favorite sitcom, or reading from a humorous website to relax are great ways to deal with stress. Browse through a joke book, or watch a scene from your favorite comedic movie when you need a break.Laughter serves to relieve your stress response, and stimulate relaxation. It even releases pain-relievers within the body.
Laughter Yoga is a new trend that is becoming popular. Look for videos of laughter yoga online if there's not a class happening near you. Chances are, even watching other people engaged in laughter will cause you to chuckle.

, Singing serves to reduce stress by lowering your heart rate and releasing endorphins that help you feel better. Whether you sing in a choir, or only in the shower, singing is a great way to lower your stress.Singing loudly maximizes the benefits that come from singing. If you life with other people, you might feel shy about doing this. Possible solutions are to sing when you're alone in the house, or go to the car and sing there.
Sing along with the radio or with your favorite artist if you're too self-conscious to sing alone.

, If you're feeling stressed, chances are you're getting less sleep than you need. Most people need at least 8 hours of sleep per night, and some may need more. Some common ways that stress interferes with sleep are racing thoughts as you settle into sleep, and repetitive and persistent thoughts that cause you to feel stressed as you try to get to sleep.Avoid strenuous exercise within 2 hours of sleep.
Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule on weekdays and weekends. Sleeping late on the weekends may seem pleasant, but it interferes with your circadian rhythm.

, A common response to stress is overeating foods that are high in calories, sugar and/or fat. However, poor eating habits result in more stress overall, spending more on foods and overeating, often resulting in weight gain. Maintain a healthy diet by sticking to foods that are high in nutritional content and fiber.


Instead of chips, try snacking on healthy things like apples, carrot sticks, or raw chopped up vegetables.
If you crave sugar when you're stressed out, make a smoothie from a banana, some blueberries and some non-fat yogurt. Other fruit combinations will also help satisfy your sweet tooth without resulting in more stress.

, Both caffeine and alcohol deplete the stress resources of your body and result in a higher level of stress. Caffeine interferes with your ability to get to sleep at night, while alcohol affects the quality of sleep you get.


Be aware than many products contain caffeine. Tea, coffee, sodas, and energy drinks are all possible sources of caffeine. The Mayo Clinic suggests that you limit yourself to no more than 100mg of caffeine per day (about the amount in a cup of brewed coffee) if you're an adolescent, and no more than 400mg per day if you're an adult.Both caffeine and alcohol may be used in moderation in times when you're not stressed. However, in stressful circumstances, these substances have a negative effect on the body.
Do not use alcohol if you are underage. People who drink underage are more likely to engage in other risky behaviors, including drug use and unsafe sex. They are also more likely to fail out of school.If you are of drinking age, consume it in moderation, which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines as no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men."

Have fun!",How to Win a Student Government Election in Middle School," Having a position in the Student Government can be stressing. There is a lot of work and responsibilities that you can't just forget about. There are other things that have to be done to like homework, chores, etc. Just make sure you have the time and you will be committed to it.;
, It is important to get permission from your parents or guardians before you run. Being class president is a huge deal and you may need their help.

, If you don't follow every detail of the rules, you may be not be able to run.

, You'll need items such as poster board, markers, glue, etc.

, Some Student Governments require someone to nominate another for a certain position. Sometimes, you can even nominate yourself. If you can't, get known so people think you will be good for a certain position or ask a good friend to do it for you.

, Think about talents you have and how you can use them to benefit your campaign. If you're crafty, make buttons with your photo on it, or even tee-shirts with your slogan.

, For example: ""This isn't a game; you can't dodge the fact I'm the best choice for president!"" or ""Vote for Kate! She is Great!"" Look online for ideas.

, Make yourself known. Sometimes, these elections can turn into a popularity competition but if you really want the position, become well known in your school.

, Use the materials to make an epic poster. Make sure there is a picture of you on it. That way everyone will know who you are at first glance. To make awesome posters, you have to make them attractive and stand out. Add glitter or a funny picture which goes along with the quote you use on it.

, The best way to win is to give out free things, such as pencils, buttons, jewelry, cupcakes, cookies, etc.


If you make a motto to put on your products, people will think you are creative and want to vote for you even more. Quotes like ""Don't be silly, vote for Lilly!"". You can even make a quote to go along with a product.
If you get small cartons of milk, you can tape a quote saying ""Got (Your Name Here)?, she/he's good for the Student Body!"".

, These should state why you want to be voted into that position and why you would do a great job. You could even set up a table at lunch or in the morning so you can talk to the students one on one and let them ask questions!

, Make it funny, serious, and make sure you tell the crowd who you are and why you are running for that position. Most of all, be confident.


Have some back up jokes if you think the crowd is getting bored.
It will be easier to do it if you look above their heads so it looks like you're looking directly at them and you're confident.

, If you're really into it, you'll have a ton of fun doing this. And if you lose, you will be happy that you at least had fun and that you tried. Nothing is worse than regret.

Store bigger items by the door.,
Prepare your breakfast ahead of time.,
Set your alarm.",How to Be Early for School1," Setting out all your texts and materials in advance will save you time. Invest that energy in the evening and you won't have to frantically search for your science homework in the morning or panic because you can't find your protractor. Just pack ahead of time and concentrate on getting up, dressed, and out the door.;
, Clothing decisions, while important, are not so crucial as to make you late. Set out your outfit the evening before. That way, you can try the clothes on calmly and make a decision. It will also give you the chance to make sure that your chosen attire is sharp and matches. No one likes to end up with mismatched socks!Make sure that your clothes are clean and crisp. Pick out items that need laundry or ironing in your downtime – these tasks are too time-consuming to manage in the morning rush.
Check the weather forecast for the following day on television or online and dress to suit. Choose an outfit to match the weather, especially if it might be cool or rainy., Keep track of all of your minor morning tasks with a daily or weekly to-do list. If you need a permission slip for the next day, get it signed and stowed away in your book bag. If you need lunch money, get it the night before. Organization is the key. Keep close track of what needs to be done each day.


A to-do list might be in your head or an actual list. Similarly, it might be for one day or something that you go through each and every day.
If you do keep a physical list, try putting it in a prominent place where you will see it, like the refrigerator or the bathroom mirror.

, There is nothing as frustrating and time consuming as searching for lost keys or a cell phone. Put all those small personal items in a set place, those things that you tend to lose. Try a basket on a counter or end table, or even the pocket of the jacket that you always wear. Put them in the same place every day so that you know where they are., Make the door your loading area for the morning rush. Put your shoes, coat, gloves, hat, lunchbox, backpack, and anything else you might need in the entryway so that you can quickly up, dress, and out., Making food can eat up a lot of time, but don't think you have to choose between something quick and something healthy. Set out your breakfast the evening before or keep it ready-made in the refrigerator. If you are really short on time, grab something to take with you on your commute.Oatmeal is both delicious and nutritious. You can make enough for a whole week on Sunday evening and keep it safely in the refrigerator. Single packets of instant oatmeal are also just that -- instant. It only takes a minute or two to cook.Breakfast smoothies are great convenience foods, as well. Just find a balanced recipe (try ones with a good balance of fruit and protein), blend, and enjoy.People often say that fruit is nature's fast food. It comes prepackaged, ready-to-eat, and can be taken on the go. Bananas, apples, oranges, or grapes are good ideas.

, Getting up late will put you at an immediate disadvantage in your quest for punctuality. It will foil all your best laid plans. Have a reliable alarm clock or two. Know how to set it and do so every night.


For heavy sleepers, louder alarms might be more effective. Choose an alarm setting that will shake you out of bed.Radio alarms follow this rule. Choose a rock station over easy listening or talk radio.

Plan your morning ahead of time.,
Get up at an appropriate time.,
Don't spent too much time on any one activity.,
Avoid getting sucked into television, electronic devices, or other distractions.,
Don't miss your ride.,
Cooperate with your family.,
Keep a clock in every room.",How to Be Early for School2," It can be hard to think in the morning hours, particularly when you are rushed or without your daily fix of caffeine. Knowing what to expect ahead of time can help you navigate these stresses and stay on time. A routine can be very helpful.

, Set the alarm so that you have enough time to fully prepare for the day. Your wake up time should allow you to complete your routine without feeling rushed or panicked. At the same time, you shouldn't wake up so early that you will be fatigued.


Avoid pressing the snooze button. The temptation to sleep just five more minutes can be irresistible. Resist it! It will make you late. Worse still, it often leads to multiple snoozing.
Set two alarms if you are a compulsive, multiple snoozer. Put one out of reach, maybe even across the room!, Between showering, dressing, eating, and putting on makeup, you won't have the luxury of extra time. Consider tracking yourself during these activities to see how long you spend on each one.Keep grooming at a reasonable minimum. Doing your makeup and hair and dressing is a time killer, and your ambitions to be punctual may well die in front of the bathroom mirror. This doesn't mean neglect your yourself. Just resist the urge to be perfect.
There may be occasions when you should look your absolute best. On those days, plan to spend the extra time. Otherwise aim for efficiency., Mornings ought to be about luxury, about watching the news, reading the paper, checking your texts, or nursing a cup of tea or coffee. Most of us can only afford a small indulgence, unfortunately. Resist the urge. It will cost you precious time.


Limit your morning television carefully. The local traffic and weather should be enough until you can catch the 5 o'clock broadcast.
If you like to read the paper or the news online, leave it as a treat for the afternoon or between classes. It, like television, will wait for your homecoming.

, Many times a student has chased the school bus down the block at least once. Don't be that person. Be outside and at your stop on time. Missing your bus or carpool can set you back by a good twenty minutes or more, depending on where you live.

, It may be that your lateness comes from living in a full house - from daily confusion, chaos, and bottlenecks for space. Talk to your parents and siblings honestly and try to come up with a system.Take turns in the bathroom. The bathroom is prime real estate in the morning for washing, dressing, and tooth brushing. Establish time limits for its use, negotiate slots, or organize it better.If you have siblings, help your parents. Your mom and dad may have the best intentions but struggle to get your younger brother, or your teenage sister, up and moving. Be considerate. Try to make their job easier and lend a hand.

, Let the ticking of the clock be your constant reminder. Keep clocks in every room if you can, so that it always possible to see the hour. Waterproof clocks can even be installed in the shower.

Overestimate how long you will take.,
Set your watch fast.,
Find a healthy sleep schedule.,
Don't sweat being early.,
Remind yourself of the importance of punctuality.",How to Be Early for School3," The chronically late are often chronically optimistic when it comes to time, and how much they will need to get ready.Your intuition may be wrong. Always try to err on the side of more time.

, Trick yourself into being early by moving your watch ahead by ten or fifteen minutes. The result should be that you arrive earlier by that amount of time.


This tactic doesn't always work. Some people automatically subtract the time, knowing that they have a few more minutes in reality.

, Getting up on time doesn't just involve setting the alarm. It also involves a good sleep pattern. Going to bed at the same time each night will get your body into a habit, a rhythm that should make you sleepy and wakeful at the right times.Go to bed at a reasonable hour. One reason for lateness is oversleep and sluggishness caused by fatigue. Getting enough sleep will make you fresh in the morning. You may even start to wake up with, or before, your alarm.
Do homework as soon as you get home. Don't put it off your work until the evening or the wee hours of the night.
Aim for at least 8 hours each night. This can be higher in the case of teenagers. Unfortunately, the natural sleep patterns of teens often do not match those of schools.This may be part of why you tend to be late!

, Punctuality can require a basic change of attitude. Some people sabotage themselves because they think that being early will create an awkward situation, be uncool, or just waste time. They may do it to defy authority or to assert themselves. None of this is a good reason, however.Your time is not wasted if you know how to use it. Review your homework or notes from the last class. Bring a book or magazine with you if you fear awkward social interactions.Lateness shows a disregard for social norms. This is not really a desirable quality to have, if you happen to make yourself late out of defiance or ego.

, Timeliness is almost always a desirable trait – one that shows dependability, seriousness, and dedication. It is appreciated by employers, teachers, peers, and others. They take it seriously.


Punctuality helps organizations work properly. Your school, and later your job, functions by doing certain things at certain times. Lateness bogs down this machine. If one person is late, it slows. If everyone is late, the machine will not work at all.
Being late too often can lead to problems. It can land you in detention. Later on, it may lower workplace morale, cause your co-workers to resent you, or even anger your employer.
On the contrary, studies show that punctuality is a valued trait in workers. Managers are often less likely to promote chronically late employees.

, It doesn't matter if the last section stopped halfway through a page, that subject of notes has ended and you need to start a new page. This will prevent any confusion about what subject is what when going back to your notes to study off of later.


When a subject is continued onto a new piece of paper, add the word continued next to the title. For example, ""The Civil War Continued.""
And make sure you title your page at the right-hand side of your paper and date it on the left-hand side of your paper.
Use an arrow-preferably in a different color, such as red (which works the best)- at the bottom of your page to indicate that your notes are continued onto the next page.
And always, always, always use the back of your paper, not only will it save trees, but it will also save money too. And who doesn't want to save money?

, Taking notes isn't inscribed in ancient text, and there is no right way to take notes. But there is a more efficient way depending on where you taking notes from, such as a lecture, book, or textbook. There are four good ways to take notes and they are:


An outline. An outline is good for when you taking notes in class because you have an organized format to layout subheadings, key concepts, keywords. vocabulary, details, summaries, etc.

Cornell Method. The Cornell Method is a good note-taking strategy for taking notes during a lecture because of the way it is designed. The Cornell Method divides your paper into three sections: the ""Cue Column"", the ""Note-Taking Section"", and the ""Summary Row"". The Cue Column is written before class because this is where you write any questions you may have, anything you do not understand, and for key details. The Note-Taking is taken during class, this is where you write all your notes. and the Summary Row is written after class because you will summarize everything in the Note-taking Section and the Cue Column.
The ""T"" Method.The ""T"" Method is good for when you are taking notes in class because of the way it is formatted. The ""T"" Method divides your page into two section instead of three like the Cornell Method. The right-hand side is used for subheadings and key concepts of that subheading. And the left-hand side is used for an expansion your notes in the right-hand side.
The SQ3R Method.The SQ3R is a useful note-taking method for taking notes from a textbook because it makes you really think and comprehend what the text is about. SQ3R stand for: S.urvey, Q.uestion, 3 or the three R's R.ead: R.ecite, and R.eview.
Mindmapping.This note-taking method is good taking notes on a book, textbook, or lectures/in-class discussions. Mindmapping is a good note-taking method for visual learners because it is a way to visualize your notes.

, SQRRR or ""SQ3R"" is a reading comprehension method named for its five steps: the survey, question, read, recite, and review. The method was introduced by Francis Pleasant Robinson in his 1946 book Effective Study. The method, created for college students, can also be used by elementary school students, who can practice all of the steps once they have begun to read longer and more complex texts. Similar methods developed subsequently include PQRST and KWL table.


Survey. The first step, survey or skim, advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead glance through a chapter in order to identify headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features in the text. This is in order to identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter.
Question. Formulate questions about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and subheadings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated:
What is this chapter about?""
""What question is this chapter trying to answer?""
""How does this information help me?""
Read. Use the background work done with ""S"" and ""Q"" in order to begin reading actively. This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under ""Q"". Passive reading, in contrast, results in merely reading without engaging with the study material.
The second ""R"" refers to the part known as ""Recite/wRite"" or ""Recall."" Using key phrases, one is meant to identify major points and answers to questions from the ""Q"" step for each section. This may be done either in an oral or written format. It is important that an adherent to this method use his/her own words in order to evoke the active listening quality of this study method.
The final ""R"" is ""Review."" In fact, before becoming acquainted with this method a student probably just uses the R & R method; Read and Review. Provided the student has followed all recommendations, the student should have a study sheet and should test himself or herself by attempting to recall the key phrases. This method instructs the diligent student to immediately review all sections pertaining to any keywords forgotten.

, A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order, sometimes described as a project artifact. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events labeled on points where they would have happened.


Timelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data. Most timelines use a linear scale, where a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This time scale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over million of years whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes. While most timelines use a linear timescale, for very large or small time spans, logarithmic timelines use a logarithmic scale to depict time.
There are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on graphic design, and the ability of the artist to visualize the data. In historical studies, timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies. Examples include:

Timeline of the American Civil Rights Movement
Timeline of European exploration
Timeline of imperialism
Timeline of Solar System exploration
Timeline of United States history
Timeline of World War I
Timeline of religion



,  A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The term itself is derived via Latin from Greek, meaning ""additional manner of expression"". The act of paraphrasing is also called ""paraphrasis"". A paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased. For example, ""The signal was red"" might be paraphrased as ""The train was not allowed to pass because the signal was red"".


A paraphrase is usually introduced with a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in ""The signal was red, that is, the train was not allowed to proceed,"" the that signals the paraphrase that follows. A paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct quotation, the paraphrase typically serves to put the source's statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared.
A paraphrase is typically more detailed than a summary. One should add the source at the end of the sentence, for example: When the light was red trains could not go. A paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential meaning of the material being paraphrased. Thus, the  reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as ""original research,"" and not as a paraphrase.

, Summarizing a text, or distilling its essential concepts into a paragraph or two, is a useful study tool as well as good writing practice. A summary has two aims: (1) to reproduce the overarching ideas in a text, identifying the general concepts that run through the entire piece, and (2) to express these overarching ideas using precise, specific language.


When you summarize, you cannot rely on the language the author has used to develop his or her points, and you must find a way to give an overview of these points without your own sentences becoming too general. You must also make decisions about which concepts to leave in and which to omit, taking into consideration your purposes in summarizing and also your view of what is important in this text.
Include the title and identify the author in your first sentence.
The first sentence or two of your summary should contain the author’s thesis, or central concept, stated in your own words. This is the idea that runs through the entire text--the one you’d mention if someone asked you: “What is this piece/article about?” Unlike student essays, the main idea in a primary document or an academic article may not be stated in one location at the beginning. Instead, it may be gradually developed throughout the piece or it may become fully apparent only at the end.
When summarizing a longer article, try to see how the various stages in the explanation or argument are built up in groups of related paragraphs. Divide the article into sections if it isn’t done in the published form. Then, write a sentence or two to cover the key ideas in each section.
Omit ideas that are not really central to the text. Don’t feel that you must reproduce the author’s exact progression of thought. (On the other hand, be careful not to misrepresent ideas by omitting important aspects of the author’s discussion).
In general, omit minor details and specific examples. (In some texts, an extended example may be a key part of the argument, so you would want to mention it).
Avoid writing opinions or personal responses in your summaries (save these for active reading responses or tutorial discussions).
Be careful not to plagiarize the author’s words. If you do use even a few of the author’s words, they must appear in quotation marks. To avoid plagiarism, try writing the first draft of your summary without looking back at the original text.

, In your notes, write only necessary words. Never write words like ""the"" or ""a"" or any conjunction (""and"" or ""but"") or simple prepositions (""near"" ""at""). You can assume these words in the context of what you write. Omit only standard and obvious words.

, Abbreviate all words you can, but make sure your abbreviations are standardized and obvious. Always use the same abbreviation for the same word, and make a list of those abbreviation somewhere, like the inside cover of your notebook. After a while, you will need to refer to this list only to add new abbreviations. Make generous use of whatever symbols you wish. Obvious choices might be a slash (/) when you want to compare two things, w/ for ""with""; or if you think you need to use the word ""and"" somewhere, use an ampersand (&) instead of the entire word. Other symbols might include such things as @ for ""at"", # for ""number"", or math signs (i.e. ""+"" for ""also"").

, When you get home from class take out your notes and revise and edit them. This is time to color-code, highlight, underline, circle, etc. your notes. This is also when you can do research on things you didn't understand and expand on it, if its going to be on an exam.

, If you study your notes for 5-10 minutes a day you will improve your test score because you're rock solid on the material. It has been studied by many people, and at the end of each studied it has shown that students who study there notes every night for 5-20 minutes a day improves their grade.

Make sure the withdrawal won’t affect you financially.,
Ensure your eligibility is safe.",How to Withdraw from a Class," The deadline to withdraw is typically set three quarters of the way through the semester For a full semester, 12-week class, the withdrawal deadline will be around week eight. If the deadline has passed, you will have to stick with the class and receive a letter grade. Check your school’s website or administrative offices for the official deadline.Early on in the semester, before the term or the class itself begins, you can drop a class instead of withdrawing. Dropped classes don’t show up on your transcript and can be replaced with other classes.
If the withdrawal deadline has passed, you may be able to attempt a late withdrawal. This must be done through the registrar’s office. You will most likely not succeed with this unless you withdraw because of military service or medical issues.;
, Log into your student account and go to the class registration area. Look for an “add/drop” tab. You’ll see a list of your classes. Click on the “withdraw” option in the drop-down box.Each institution has its own withdrawal process. Yours may not allow withdrawal this way.

, If online withdrawal isn’t an option, you will have to speak to someone. Go in person to the registrar’s office to get a class withdrawal sheet. Some institutions also accept withdrawals through email. Look on your school’s website for an email address for the registrar’s office or the academic advisor’s office.When in doubt, contact an academic advisor. They can help you submit the proper forms.

, What you need to submit depends on your school. You will need your name, student ID number, and the name of your class. You may also need explain why you are withdrawing or get a signature from your teacher or advisor., Submit the withdrawal form to the registrar’s office or send the email. The office should quickly notify you that the withdrawal process is complete. Check your student account and transcript to see that the withdrawal is official.


Go to the class until you are certain you’ve withdrawn. Missing class doesn’t count as a withdrawal and can lead to a failing grade on your transcript.

, Ask yourself why you need to withdraw. Withdrawing is better than getting a poor grade, so if you know you can’t succeed in a class it’s a good option. However, it may be better to continue on with the class now rather than take it over again.A withdrawal means a W grade on your report card. A W won’t be a big deal to employers unless they see a pattern of withdrawals through multiple semesters.
When stress is the problem, consider making other changes. Step back from extracurricular activities and leadership roles, for example, or set a better study schedule.

, An academic advisor can help you understand the withdrawal process. They may also be able to help you manage your situation so you don’t have to withdraw. An advisor may steer you to different options, such as taking the class with a pass/fail grade, receiving an “incomplete” grade, or tutoring.Check in with your instructor or teaching assistant too. Either person may be able to work out a plan to help you succeed in the class.

, While withdrawing is a valid option, your financial aid or credit load may still be affected. When you fall below a certain amount of credits, you may lose financial aid or have to give back money. Consult school policy and the terms of your financial aid agreement.Some schools may charge a fee for withdrawing or repeating a class. In addition, you will have to pay to take the class again and may need new books.
For some students, staying in the class may be cheaper. For example, you may gain more from reducing your work hours and getting an emergency loan from the school instead of retaking the class.

, Athletes and international students must adhere to a credit load minimum set by the school. Because the withdrawn class won’t count for credits, you may lose athletic eligibility or your visa status. Be sure to check with coaches and international student advisors first.Also, withdrawal can cause you to fall behind as a student. If this is a required class, you’ll have to take it again, which delays your progress towards completing your program."

Speak to a guidance counselor or academic advisor.",How to Balance School and Social Life," Whether it’s your nightly homework, a big project or an exam, it’s important to use a clear schedule to get it all done. You’ll want to plan out your schoolwork throughout the week, as well as plan each day more specifically:


Make sure that you prioritize your tasks according to their importance and due dates. For example, completing your homework for the following day would probably be at the top of your list, while working on a paper that is due a few days later would be next in line.
Choose what classes you’ll work on during each day of the week. This helps you stay more focused within a particular field, and can help you retain information better.
Use a day planner to set up a specific block of time daily for your schoolwork. This will help you build a habit and ensure you have plenty of time to get your work done. Schedule in some fun time as well to ensure that you get a break now and then.
Consider when you do your best work as you schedule your schoolwork. For example, if you are not a morning person, then working on important tasks for classes might be better left for sometime in the afternoon or evening.;
, This type of planning involves using a particular situation or time of day as a trigger for schoolwork. However, it is important to have deadlines for yourself as well because using “if-then” planning alone may lead to not finishing those tasks. If used properly, this kind of thinking is shown to build lasting habits.Examples of this kind of thinking include:


”If I’m on the bus, I’ll work on my math homework.”
”If I finish dinner, I’ll start studying for my next exam.”
”If it’s Friday night, I’ll start my homework for next Monday.”

, As you go about your day, you might find that you have some spare time now and then when you could be working on school projects. Carry your schoolwork with you at all times so that you will always have the option of working on it.

For example, you might be able to get 15 minutes of schoolwork in while waiting for a doctor’s appointment, or while riding on the bus.

, Not only does having your cell phone nearby mean your assignment takes longer to complete, but you’ll make more mistakes and retain less information.When you dedicate time to studying or homework, make sure to do the following:.


Turn off your cellphone.
Turn off the TV.
Find a quiet, isolated spot. People can distract you as well.
Let friends and family know that you will be working on your schoolwork. It is okay to say “no” to invitations when you have schoolwork to do.
Stay off the internet, unless you need it for research. If you’re having difficulty staying on the right websites, you can use apps such as StayFocusd to block the distracting parts of the internet., If you’re still having trouble getting all your work done after doing your best to be more efficient, talk to your teacher about it. It’s possible they’re not aware of how heavy the workload they’re giving is, or they might be able to help you get through it more efficiently. It’s easy to think of your teacher as an adversary when they give you a lot of homework, but remember that they want to help you succeed. It’s important to frame your questions properly so your teacher understands you’re having difficulties rather than simply complaining:


For instance, you could tell your teacher: ”I’ve spent several hours on my math homework and I feel I’m not getting as far as I should, can you help me work more efficiently?”
If you’re having difficulty planning your work, you can ask: ”I’m having a hard time completing coursework for all my classes. Can you help me prioritize my work better?”
For difficult exams, you can ask the following: ”Could you give me tips on getting through this material? I feel like studying for this exam is pretty daunting.”

, Many schools provide a variety of different educational support resources, which may be available to you for free. You may also ask your parent about paid resources, such as a private tutor if your school does not offer the resources you need. Some resources your school might offer may include:

Learning or writing centers
Study groups
One-on-one tutoring
Study halls
Academic advisors

, When you decide to focus on your academic achievements, anything less than straight A’s can feel like a failure. Rather than trying to perfect your academic career right away, focus on smaller, incremental steps. For example, if your average in a particular class is 60%, don’t aim for 90% right away. Try to set goals that will incrementally take you to 90% in 5% portions. This will keep you working at your goals, rather than being demoralized.

, If you’re committed to being a high achiever in school, you won’t be able to hang out the night before an important test. Understand that sacrifices have to be made if you aim to reach your goals. Set aside a day each week particularly for socializing. Saturday is a particularly good choice: you can stay up later since it’s not a school night, and you don’t yet have to prepare your homework for the next week.

, You’re likely to get overwhelmed if you start thinking about all the things you need to do while you’re trying to focus on a particular task.


When you schedule time for studying or schoolwork, try to remain completely focused on what you’re doing. This will help you complete your work more efficiently and retain more information.
When you’re spending time with friends and family, don’t start stressing about the test coming up next week or the homework you still have to do.
Trust in your ability to schedule the things you need to do, and dedicate your attention to whatever you’re doing at the time.

, Your family and friends can help you with balancing academics and leisure. Talk to them, making sure they know what your academic goals are. That way, they’ll understand when you can’t make plans with them or do all the chores they ask of you.They’ll also be there to help you if you get a bad grade on a test or feel overwhelmed.

, There’s nothing wrong with going to a party or hanging out with friends, as long as you don’t feel forced into it. Don’t succumb to peer pressure because you want to fit in or be cool.


Before you start trying to balance your social life with your academics, make sure the things that comprise your social life are activities you actually want to take part in.
Focus on things that bring you enjoyment and a welcome distraction from your schoolwork. Try some new activities. For example, you could try signing up for a Zumba class, or take a watercolor painting class. You can try new activities with friends or on your own.

, Make sure the people you allow in your life are supportive of your academic goals. If they make you feel guilty for not hanging out with them, they’re not being supportive of what you’re trying to achieve.


Talk to them about your goals, focusing on finding a middle ground between the involvement they expect of you and your academic schedule.
If they seem more focused on getting what they want and not helping you achieve your goals, you might have to start asking yourself if they’re a real friend.
Try out some new activities to meet people who share your interests and who may also make supportive friends.

, You might find that some of the clubs and organizations in your school have the kinds of activities you want to participate in. Joining a school club gives you the ability to spend time with like-minded students, building relationships that can help you during your academic career as well as giving you a needed social break.Additionally, since club activities often follow a fixed schedule, it’ll be easier to fit them in around the schedule you’ve set for your schoolwork.


If you want to stay in good health, you might want to join a sports team or a fitness-focused club.
Clubs centered around artistic pursuits, such as sculpture or painting, can help you diversify your skillset while expressing yourself.
Clubs focusing on math and the sciences can help you improve your skills in a way that’s directly useful for your schoolwork.
Keep in mind that you can always start a club of your own if you can’t find a club that you want to join.

, While a teacher can help you with your schoolwork, a guidance counselor or academic advisor can help you with the overall balancing of your schoolwork and social life. They can serve as a good reference point for any questions you may have. Don’t hesitate to turn to them for help with all aspects of your academic and social life:


Guidance counselors are usually trained to help you set academic goals, study more efficiently as well as helping you resolve conflicts with family and friends.
Some guidance counselors also provide therapy and counseling services that can prove helpful as you straighten out your social life."

Pay attention in class.,
Be prepared for school at all times.,
Follow instructions.,
Study.,
Become more organized.,
Finish your homework on time.,
Prioritize.,
Take down notes in school.,
Mix with the right friends.,
Sleep early.,
Never let anyone bring you down.",How to Be a Smart Student in School," If you don't, you might not understand what your teacher is teaching you. Do not talk to your friends or pass notes. Refrain from daydreaming as this can cause you to lose focus completely. Dedicate yourself to studying and learning the curriculum.;
, Eat your breakfast and bring everything you need before leaving home. In class, make sure all books that you need are with you.

, If you follow the instructions your teachers are giving you, you will be a smart student in no time! If you don't follow instructions, you may misread a question, which will affect your exam grades.

, Always study so you can memorize what you have learned. Your teacher might give a little quiz from time to time about everything you learned before, and if you're not prepared, you will not do well.


Study for all your exams and tests. Don't do it one day before the test/exam, though. You will never remember anything after the test.

, Being organized will help you find the right papers at the right time. Being unorganized will probably lead to missing papers and homework.

, It's very important! It gives you the practice that you need to prepare you to be ready for a test or an exam. Treat all homework like a test paper. Think homework as crucial, and if you don't finish it you're not going to graduate.

, Which is more important, Facebook or your homework? Always set up a schedule and plan ahead. Do the stuff that is more important first before anything else.

, Whenever the teacher is talking non-stop and you can't remember your lessons, write down whatever he/she is saying. Go home and revise lessons. If you have problems you can always ask the teacher after class hours.


Don't copy everything down, though. The teacher will probably be talking too fast. Instead, write the main ideas and then ask the teacher about the rest.

, Don't mix with those friends who call you a ""nerd"" or a ""study freak"". Sometimes it can bring you down, leaving you upset and, in some situations, you may let go of your studies completely because of them. Just be nice to them and tell them why you want to study hard. If they can't accept it, then it's fine. Socialize with different circles of friends who have the same interests like you and accept you for the person you are.

, Sleeping early can help you become fresher in the mornings and can help you think clearly. If you don't sleep early, you will be very sleepy in class and you will lose focus.

, If you're planning to go to a good college and you're always reading books in school because of that, never let any of your friends demoralize you. If they call you a ""nerd"", that is fine; but you can choose to ignore them instead of absorbing their teases or stopping your studies. They are the ones who will regret when the exam results are out and they didn't score well.

",How to Be an Organized Student in Elementary School," Have an established routine and stick to it. Eat breakfast every morning to insure a great start to your day!;
, Make sure your bedroom is tidy, and you have a clean, distraction-free homework environment.

, Planners are crucial to be organized. Most schools give students a planner at the beginning of the school year. Not only should you use your planner to schedule assignment due dates, also schedule extracurricular activities, play-dates, family get-togethers, etc. Make sure you check your planner daily to take note to any up coming activities.

, There is a reason for homework. A student who does their homework assignments is always better off in class then the student who doesn't.

, You never know when your teacher might throw in a pop quiz. Act as if there is a quiz every day.

Be realistic: Give yourself plenty of breaks.,
Realize that teachers will try to talk you into things.,
Compile everything.",How to Balance Your High School Schedule," Give yourself plenty of time to think over your future schedule and make changes as needed. Don't leave anything until the last minute.;
, Different high schools have different systems: Some require four credit (one for each year) in core courses, others require only two or three credits in a certain subject.


Determine how many credits you need for electives (such as band, art, or computer tech) as well. Most schools require you to take at least one course in fine or applied arts, and some make a music program mandatory.
Look into the lunch, study hall, and gym system. Some schools require that you take a lunch, others encourage you to substitute lunch with another class. You may have a maximum limit of study halls you can take. You will probably have to take gym all four years, but various high schools offer summer gym or an after-school gym program. You may take gym twice a week, alternating with a health or wellness class, or you might take gym every day.
Remember: these requirements are the bare minimum that you must meet. There are very few, if any, ways to get around this.

, This will help you focus the classes that you should load up on or take higher-level courses in. For example, if you want to go to Harvard, you should expect to take harder courses than if you want to go to a more modest university. The same goes for careers: If you want to be a mathematician, take a lot of honors math courses; if you wish to be a teacher, it would be desirable to take a child development course.


Talk with others at that college or in that field, and ask what courses were most useful to them in high school.
Talk to your guidance counselor about courses that are good preparation for a certain major. Some high schools offer a whole string of courses on engineering, architecture, or another focus area.

, Most of this is common sense: If you love algebra, and find it simple, that would be a strong point. If you despise reading, and struggle in English class, that would be a weak point.


Consider taking a harder class in your strong areas: Because you are good at it, it will seem easier, and you will enjoy it.
Slow down in the areas you struggle in. I don't suggest taking honors Spanish III if you had a C in Spanish II.

, These are classes that you can take as electives. If you are musical, take band, chorus, or orchestra! If you doodle a lot, take art! If computers fascinate you, take an HTML or Java programming course!


These are your 'fun' periods. They should be more relaxed and have a lighter workload than regular core courses. Take these classes in subjects that you enjoy. The class will be a blast if you like the subject!
Don't be afraid to learn something new. If it won't stress you out, consider learning a new skill, whether it be playing an instrument or computer programming.

, Take a lunch, and/or a study hall! Feel free to take these courses. You are not superhuman, you need breathing room. These offer you some time to de-stress and work through homework or assignments, they are valuable resources. Do not overlook these.


Realize that you are not superhuman!

, Your Spanish teacher will want you to continue Spanish, and your English teacher might tell you to take honors next year- but then you realize that you are already taking two other honors courses. You don't need to listen to them.


Every teacher thinks that their subject is most important: You don't have to take your teacher's recommendation. If you are taking enough honors classes, you don't have to take that honors English as well.

, Look at required courses, your strengths and weaknesses, your aspirations, and your breathing room. From this, you should be able to go through each subject and decide what class to take at what level. From this point, perfect and tweak it until you have a balanced schedule that you can definitely handle.

Relax.,
Sleep.",How to Balance School and Life (Middle School)," If you do, you will avoid getting in trouble from your parents (socializing is tough when you're grounded), or the time crunch of trying to make it up at the last minute.;
, This may sound overrated and boring, but your grades in middle school really have a huge impact on your future.Book more time than you'll think you need just in case. Learn more now and you'll be able to balance your time better in high school too, because it won't be as difficult.

, Study a subjects at least 2 a week for 10-20 minutes minutes. If you have trouble in one class, study 3-6 times a week until you get it.

, Most middle schools have study halls to do homework or other work. Also, many teachers don't mind if you do the night's homework in their class. The more you get done in class,the less you have to do at home.

, Try to have a good outlook on school. Usually, middle school kids hate middle school because they don't realize how fun school can be if you're creative.

, You will be social and you will also be learning. Just make sure that person won't goof off or waste too much time.

,,, You should be exercising regularly, but if you're not, try to set aside time to do so for at least 60 minutes 4 times a week. Most middle schools have P.E., so you can add this in as well. If you can, try to join a team sport. That way you can socialize and exercise at the same time.

, Try to fit in socializing activities at least once a week. Take advantage of times to socialize such as when switching classes or at lunch.

, For example, let's say you have to study but your friends want to go shopping with you. The smart thing to do is say no. Save things for other times if you need to.

, If you are like most middle school kids,you probably spend more time looking at a screen then you need to.Limit it to no more than 2 1\2 hours every weekday and 5 hours every weekend.Fill this empty space with exercising, socializing, studying, or other activities. This does not include school-related things like researching things online.

, You can also do this step in the morning if you want.

, Try to find at least 30 minutes a day (best if right before bed) to relax and wind down. Draw, read, whatever you want to do.If this is right before bed avoid exercising or anything that might wake you up.

, You are probably under 14, so get at least 9-10 hours of sleep a night. So if you have to wake up at 7:00, go to bed at 10:00 at the latest.

Get involved at your child’s new school.",How to Transfer to a New Elementary School," Check your city’s website to see what school districts they have. Your city or town may have as little as one district, and a large city may have several districts. Ask your neighbors what schools their children attend, but be aware that boundaries can divide what district you and your neighbors are in., If your school district has several elementary schools within it, you may or may not be able to transfer your child. Find out what school choices your district offers. A transfer request may be easier, if your district offers open transfers. In New York City, for example, they offer what is called a variance and you can use that to apply to different schools within a district., Many school districts offer inter-district options, where different schools across neighboring areas take applicants from a large pool. Inter-district options are common in larger cities.Magnet schools are normally very competitive, have special programs, and high expectations of students.Charter schools may be competitive and require certain grades.
Some schools use a lottery system, where applicants are chosen randomly.
Some schools accept students by a combination of lottery and competitive requirements.

, Look at district rankings in your area or state. Many schools within a district can be evaluated by looking at their school accountability reports. Many places use a grading scale and this information should be posted on a district website., Selecting a school that fits best may require informal principal interviews and tours of the school. Matching a school with a student can mean reviewing extra-curricular activities, discipline policies or classroom size.Look for signs of a good school, like engaged students and high expectations., Find out how integrated a school is by looking at how much variety it offers economically, socially and racially. It's important for a school to offer a rich learning environment, and that includes different viewpoints from peers and teachers. Look at demographic statistics to determine whether a school has a student pool that is mostly homogeneous or varied., Once you have a projected move date, you can contact a new school for information about their enrollment process. The early you can do this the better, because you will need to fill out paperwork and show the school important documents. It can take anywhere from one day to several days to fully enroll in a new school.

, Your child’s new school will want to know what curriculum your child has been studying. Special programs your child is in, such as band or foreign language learning, will be things the new school will want to know about in order to accommodate you. Some things at the new school may not be offered, or they may offer more classes, such as advanced placement options., Your new school will want proof that you live in their zone. Proof of residency can be as simple as having a piece of mail addressed to you. It can also be as complicated as having to show a lease agreement or mortgage paperwork, and hard proofs of I.D. The school district can tell you exactly what you need to show as proof., If you’re moving to a new district, they will likely have important information about their enrollment process online. Search through links for parents or new enrollments to get an idea of what the school will ask for. You may be able to find what enrollment fees the school has online.

, Even though you may know the specific school your child will attend, it’s important to contact the district office first. They will have the most up-to-date information about how to get your child enrolled, and they can tell you important things you need before you contact a school.


Sometimes, you can fully enroll your child at the district office and start immediately at a new school.
Other times, you may need to make an appointment at a new school and file enrollment papers there.

, A new school district may ask to see copies of the same documents you needed to enroll your child in a current school. Make sure you have documents handy, like current shot records and a copy of your child’s birth certificate. You will also need your child’s social security number.

, You may have to time your child’s new school start to a new district’s calendar. It may also be wise to have mid-term or semester grades completed at an old school before starting a new school. This will make it easier for teachers to know where your child is at in his or her studies.

, Thoroughly fill out all necessary documents to initiate the transfer process, and submit them on time. A missed deadline can mean a missed approval from the school. Be mindful that some districts will require you to turn in the transfer request forms to the school, while others require you to turn them into a district office or mail them.Sometimes transfer requests will not be granted until the start of the upcoming school year.
Transfers from one district to another typically require permission from both the current school and the desired school.A transfer may be denied if insufficient reason for a transfer is given or a school is overcrowded.

, Fill out necessary forms for your child at the school. You can call ahead, if you didn’t have to make an appointment. Some schools offer online enrollment, and if they do, they can tell you over the phone. The new school will have applications and forms to fill out. It’s also a great idea to have key documents on hand, such as birth certificates, immunizations, and proof of residency.

, Remember that a new school may have different policies on things like clothing, lockers, or physical education. Read the school handbook and go over any differences with your child several days before a new school start. This will ensure your child is not surprised or stressed at the last minute, if he or she has to wear a uniform or use a locker., The sooner you tell your child about a new school, the sooner they will have time to accept the change. Be positive when you tell your child by saying something like ""Mommy got a new, exciting job that will help us do more things, but you will have to change schools."" It’s important to let your child openly express any anxious or sad feelings about a move. Be sympathetic to what your child is feeling and point out anymore positive aspects of the move.

, It’s a good idea to show your child the school they will be attending, before the first day. Take your child with you, when you fill out any enrollment paper at the new school. Set up a time to take a school tour with your child and possibly meet teachers and counselors.

, Plan to enroll your child in any sports teams or clubs at a new school. If you enroll your child in activities before a move, it will give him or her something to look forward to. It will also be a great way for your child to make new friends., Join the school’s Parent Teacher Association and volunteer in your child’s classroom. You can get to know your child’s teacher or teachers and network with other parents. It may also be comforting to your child to know you’re close and supportive.

Learn official study words.",How to Train for a Spelling Bee1," Try to read something every day, even if it’s not much. Read anything that might put you into contact with new words. Don’t worry if you are not able to finish something you’re reading. Your main goal is to find words you don’t know and increase your vocabulary.


Read books, magazines, news articles, pamphlets, and packaging.
Keep a list of new words. It’s a good idea to use a dedicated notebook or folder to keep track of new words so you can always easily access it and refer to it when you need.;
, Buy a dictionary and look up the meaning of any word you don’t know. You can also use an online dictionary or a phone app to discover the meaning of unfamiliar words.Practice understanding the word by using it in context. Use an example from your life that makes sense to you and will be easy for you to remember. For example, say you learn the word ""bombastic,"" which means important sounding but essentially meaningless. You may watch a local political debate and think to yourself, ""Senator Sheridan's speech was bombastic.""
If you're looking up new words online, make sure you use a reputable source. Instead of something generic, like Dictionary.com, use something like the Merriam-Webster website.

, Mnemonics are types of techniques used to remember difficult pieces of information. You learn to associate words with images, places, sounds, or other pieces of information to help you better remember them.You can use a mnemonic technique to learn new words. Simply trying to memorize a list of words is not especially effective.


Group words based on common characteristics. Then, link words using visual association. You can also use the method of loci, which is the technique of imagining a familiar space and placing an item you want to remember in that space.You can also make a rhyme or song out of words or create acronyms. Acronyms are a word or abbreviation created using the first letters of words.For example, say you need to remember the definition of the word ""capricious,"" which means whimsical or unpredictable. The beginning of the word - ""capri"" - can remind you of capri pants. You can try envision someone wearing capris while also dancing or laughing in a whimsical manner.

, A great technique for learning how to spell new words is word mapping. This involves looking for patterns in words instead of thinking of words as arbitrary strings of random letters, which makes memorizing words very difficult.First, speak the word out loud. As you go, exaggerate or stretch a word by individual phonemes, which are the smallest units of a word that express differences in meaning. For example, you may say ""capricious"" as ""caaapriiiiciouuuus.""Break up the word into individual syllables. For example, ""ca-pri-cious.""
Count the phonemes of a word. There are three phonemes in ""capricious.""
Write individual phonemes of a word. There are three phonemes in ""capricious.""
Write the word using cursive handwriting and then study the spelling of the word.
Recite a word’s meaning out loud. For example, ""Capricious means whimsical or unpredictable. Capricious means whimsical or unpredictable..."", Find out if your spelling bee is registered with the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

Learn spelling rules.",How to Train for a Spelling Bee2," Learning the origin of a word will help you learn certain rules about the way word spelling functions in the English language. For example, many English language words have their origins in Latin. The Latin root ‘reg’ means king, which means that the word ‘regal’ or ‘regicide’ are in some way related to a king.Take your spelling bee list and divide words into language of origin. As you do so, pay attention to common parts of words. See if you notice any roots that point to the word's meaning.
Download a free study guide from the Scripps National Spelling Bee website. These lists include the etymology of common spelling bee words: http://myspellit.com/


, A word changes its meaning when you add a prefix to the beginning of it. Since each prefix has its own meaning, knowing common prefixes will help you more easily understand the meaning of new words. Common prefixes, include:


Anti- = against
De- = opposite
Inter- = between
Non- = notPre- = before
Semi- = half
Sub- = under, A word can changes its meaning when you add a suffix to the end of it. Suffixes can also be useful for helping you determine what part of speech a word belongs to.Knowing common suffixes will help you more easily understand the meaning of new words. Common suffixes, include:


-able = can be done
-ed = the past tense of a verb
-en = made of
-ful = full of
-ing = present participle verb form
-less = without
-ly = characteristic of
-ness = characterized by, Many words in the English language include letters that are not pronounced. This can make things difficult for contestants in a spelling bee.Common examples of silent letters, include:


Silent B at the end of a word in the combination MB, for example: bomb.
Silent B in the combination BT, for example: doubt.
Silent D in the combination DG, for example: edge.
Silent H when it follows a vowel at the end of a word, for example: cheetah.
Silent H between two vowels, for example: vehicle.
Silent H after the letter R, for example: rhyme.
Silent K in the combination KN, for example: knife.
Silent N at the end of a word in the combination MN, for example: autumn.
Silent P at the beginning of a word in the combination PS, for example: psychology., Anyone training for a spelling bee needs to learn common homonyms, which are words that are spelled differently and mean different things but share the same pronunciation. This is why it's important to ask for a word's definition in a spelling bee. Study common homonyms and make sure you know the definitions for different homonyms.Commonly misspelled homonyms, include:


accept and except
affect and effectbow and bough
elicit and illicit
principle and principalweather and whether

, There are many spelling rules that will help make spelling unknown words easier for you. Remember, there are always exceptions to the rule so look out for words that must be memorized separately. Study some of the most important spelling rules in the English language. For example:


The letter I always comes before E unless it comes after the letter C.
Add -ES to plural words ending in -S, -SS, -Z, -CH, -X.
Drop the silent E for most words when adding vowel suffix endings.
Change Y to I when adding vowel suffix endings.
Most words that end in -F or -FE change to -VES when made plural.No English word will ever end with the letters I, U, V, or J.
The letter I will never follow another letter I."

Take a look at official spelling bee word lists and identify words that you have trouble spelling and words that don’t seem so difficult. It’s important to know what level you’re at so you don’t try to learn words that are too advanced., Write yourself a list that highlights what you expect to learn. Include a timeline for your learning. Make your objectives challenging but realistic. Since there are so many words to learn, having a set of learning objectives will help you stay on track and keep you focused. Plus, you’ll be able to tell if you’re meeting your goals, need to revise your goals, or work harder., Figure out when you study best. Research shows that many people study best during the day and early evening. Find a place that is free of outside distractions. Break up your study periods so you don’t study for too long and begin to forget important words., Take a look at your calendar and determine how much time you have before the spelling bee.

Be aware of social aggression in your classroom.,
Monitor your students' physical health.,
Be patient with your student's mental development.,
Learn about stress and your student's brain.,
Forgive your student's selfishness.",How to Teach Middle School Students," Research has shown that middle schoolers learn best when their lessons are divided in 7-10 minute chunks of different activities. Lessons should be a combination of learning from lecture and processing activities.A processing activity is one in which students must manipulate information or relate the information to something they already know. This might be an activity like writing an alternate ending to a story they have read, conducting a lab experiment, or participating in a debate with their fellow classmates.;
, Studies show that middle school students can only handle 10-12 minutes of direct instruction (or lecture). After 10-12 minutes, their brains begin to filter out information of the lecture and turn to other thoughts. While lecture is an important component of teaching, you need to supplement it with processing activities.If you are giving a lecture, be sure to present it in an engaging way. Don't just read off of a worksheet or set of notecards. Read as if you are telling a story.
Be sure to make eye contact with your students as you are presenting the material. Make sure they know that you are speaking directly to them because you want them to understand the material.

, Research has shown that middle school students respond most positively to visual images when they process information. Visual images give students concrete, easily digestible information as opposed to abstract information (which they won't be able to grapple with until they are 18-20 years old).Dynamic visuals -- or visuals that move as opposed to remaining static -- have been shown to have the most significant impact on students. Look for charts that have moving elements, films, or a series of interactive images as opposed to just one or two static images.
You should also consider using manipulatives, which are physical objects that students can touch in order to learn material from the lesson. They are commonly used in math (such as using blocks to teach geometry), but you might also consider using objects in other areas, like bringing in an old copy of a magazine from the 1930s if you are teaching history., Middle school students need to interact with information directly in order to fully understand it. They no longer view you, as the teacher, as a fount of knowledge; they need to form opinions about the material on their own.


Incorporate the Think-Pair-Share method. When you are teaching a particular lesson, ask the students a question about the material. Have them write down a response to the question and then share their ideas with a partner. Then, as a class, discuss your responses out loud., As middle schoolers, most students will relate to the world around them emotionally rather than through logic or reason. As you teach your material, be sure to present it in terms of its emotional impact.The extent to which you can do this in each discipline will vary. But you should incorporate methods such as storytelling into appropriate disciplines like English, social studies and even subjects like science and mathematics.
Humor is also a key element in connecting with your students emotionally. Make sure your jokes are appropriate and avoid anything bordering on snark or sarcasm.

, Above all, make sure your lessons incorporate a wide variety of activities. Ask your students to take notes, write reflection pieces, work in groups, conduct investigations and play games. This will prevent boredom and help your students develop a broad range of cognitive skills.Be sure to incorporate activities that require memorization and repetition on the part of your students. This is a valuable skill that still needs development in the brain at this age. You can use flash cards, rhyming games or simply ask students to repeat vital pieces of information out loud to practice this. , Encouraging time for your students to write in a journal about what they have learned or how they experienced the lesson for the day will help them see the broader goals of the class., Young adolescents might begin to test the boundaries of authority, but they still need a clear set of rules and boundaries in order to learn.On the first day of class, include your students in the creation of the rules and make sure they understand why they need to be in place. If one of your rules is to respect each other, you should ask your students what this would entail (for instance, taking turns when talking as opposed to speaking over each other).Establish regular routines in your class so your students know what to expect. For instance, you might start each day with an inspirational quote or story relating to your lesson for the day. You can use this routine to warm up discussion amongst your students.Giving your students a syllabus will also help them develop their abilities to plan and organize their study schedules. A syllabus should include the dates of the classes, what you plan to teach on each date, and any reading or assignments that your students should complete before attending that class.

, In middle school, students often start to form deep friendships and social hierarchies. Students can be harassed or ostracized for things ranging to their appearance to their the race, sexuality or religion. Be sure to look out for this toxic behavior and shut it down whenever you see it occurring between students in your classroom.If a student is acting in a disruptive or disrespectful manner in class, then pull them aside (either after class or at a natural lull in the lesson, like when students begin to work independently), to talk with them. Do not express frustration with them but rather, empathy. Say, ""I noticed that you are having trouble focusing on the assignment. What can I do to help you?"" The student might not respond well to a scolding but they will respond to a question that asks them to reflect on their actions and ask for help.Discuss bullying directly with your students. Have them study its damaging effects and ask them to explain why they must avoid hurting their fellow students.
Talk to your administrators about implementing a zero tolerance policy toward bullying at your school. Familiarize yourself with any district policies on bullying or disruptive behavior in the classroom.

, The adolescent brain and body needs 10 hours of sleep in order to fully develop. If you have students who consistently struggle to remain awake and complete their work, then you should notify their parents about your concerns. There might be a larger medical problem involved.Encourage your students to drink water. The pre-adolescent brain needs to be well hydrated in order to develop. Encourage your students to drink water in class and at lunch., Between the ages of 11 and 13, students are juggling a huge range of physical and psychological changes. In addition to the increase of hormonal production in the body, they are also dealing with the delayed development of the neo-cortex. The neo-cortex is a frontal lobe in the brain that handles executive processes such as making plans, setting goals, and thinking of long term consequences. This part of the brain is the last to develop and is often not fully functioning in early adolescent students.Until the neo-cortex is developed, the brain processes language through the amygdala, or the emotional part of the brain. This is why adolescents often make impulsive decisions based on emotion rather than reason., The increased production of hormones in the early adolescent's body enacts a number of changes on your students. But one change that might be overlooked is an increased sensitivity to stress.In particular, your students may become stressed by the physical changes in their body, such as the awkwardness of a growth spurt or the development of breasts, pubic hair, facial hair, etc. These changes can make your students feel like they have lost control over their own bodies.

, The early adolescent brain is still developing its social development functions. That means that your students will often be most concerned with themselves first and foremost.Early adolescence is a period where students will need to practice moral reasoning in order to develop empathy and compassion."

Additionally, having set starting and stopping points can make studying seem less daunting. Break down each subject and assignment into small chunks and make a schedule to complete each of these smaller tasks., Set aside an area in your home designated for course work. This makes it easier for you to refocus your attention on studying and avoid distractions. Additionally, using the same space each day lets people you share space with know right away when you are studying. If you find it impossible to study at home without distraction, try to find a good spot at a local library. Libraries are quiet, adequately lit, and free from distractions.


Choose a space removed from distractions and out of the way of other people.
Make sure you are comfortable enough to stay in the space for long periods, but not so comfortable you’re tempted to fall asleep.
Use appropriate lighting, so you’re able to clearly see any books, notes, or other documents., The biggest mistake students who want to study online make is not investing in reliable, fast internet service. This is essential to access all the necessary documents, course schedules, and other information throughout the class.


Do your research. Find online specifications for a variety of providers in your area, read reviews from people who use the services, and contact providers to compare pricing.
Ask fellow classmates who live near you what provider they use and whether or not they would recommend the service.
At the first signs of trouble (frequently dropped service or slow connection speeds) contact your service provider. If they’re unable to provide an adequate explanation and solution, switch to a different service.
If you’re unable to access adequate internet service in your home, go to the school or public library. In most cases, library card holders have access to complimentary internet services through the library. Libraries are also excellent places to study., Don’t let temptation to visit social media, check email, and click the latest top ten list distract you from studying. Set boundaries for yourself. Use a timer to track time spent on non-course websites, and limit yourself to five minutes at a time. It’s good to take breaks, but make sure you’re aware of how long you’re spending on breaks.Turn off your wifi, turn off your phone, or set a ""distraction"" timer. Make procrastination more difficult than the work itself, and you'll get more done!If you need a little extra help with your anti-distraction methods, there are a number of websites and apps that can help. Anti-Social is an app that helps you limit time on social media and other distracting sites. StayFocused is a Chrome-based internet blocker that removes your web access during preset times.
It's also important to step away every so often. That's where apps like Time Out come in. This app reminds you take a break at set intervals, so you don't push yourself too hard., It’s important to take time to develop a clear understanding of the overall purpose of the course. By reviewing the course outline, you’ll be able to prepare for your ongoing studies by understanding how each component relates to the course objectives.


Review the entire course outline, take notes, and ask questions right away. The goal is to make sure you understand how every section of the course contributes to the overall goal.
Reassess how assignments fit into the overall outline of the course throughout the class. This is especially beneficial if you feel frustrated or are struggling with any specific assignment.
Track changes to the course syllabus carefully. Most instructors provide adequate notice, if there are syllabus changes, but check in at least once a day to make sure there’s nothing new., Most online courses offer a variety of options for communicating with instructors and classmates, as well as storing and organizing information. Before the class starts, take about an hour to explore the entire course system online. This will help you be more prepared to successfully complete tasks associated with the course such as turning in assignments, communicating with peers, and taking tests.


If you have questions, read any help or user manuals that should be accessible as part of the system. Typically, these are designated with a question mark, light bulb icon, or a “help” tab.
If you’re interested in finding out specifically how the system will be utilized for your course, review the syllabus and talk to the instructor for more course-specific information., If you can, use online resources that are sponsored by a university, library, or government agency. If you are taking a course online, you will likely have access to many reference sites as part of the class. However, by taking a few moments to review the source, author, and other information, you can determine the accuracy and legitimacy of any online resources.Double check accuracy by comparing facts across websites. If you find the same statistics or information on numerous websites, it’s likely the resource you’re using is accurate.
Find out who maintains the site. Blogs are one example of typically inaccurate or opinion-based websites, but if the blog is part of a professional organization or written by an expert in the field, they may be trustworthy resources.
Avoid sites that are selling a product. Even if the information from these online resources seems authoritative they are likely skewed to support the sale of a product.
Check the date on all resources. If the site was accurate ten years ago but hasn’t been updated since, it’s likely no longer a reliable source of information.

, One of the many benefits of online learning is almost instant access to teachers and other students. Most online courses and trainings include a chat application, discussion forum, and email communication with professors and other students. Take advantage of this ease of communication, and don’t hesitate to ask questions.


Try not to ask the professor for information readily available in the syllabus or other course materials. Check these resources first, and verify with the instructor, if necessary.
Let the professor or course leader know right away if you’re struggling to understand the materials. They can offer guidance, and direct you towards helpful resources.
If you experience a personal or professional concern that effects your ability to keep up with the course, talk to the professor right away. You may be able to adjust your course schedule, and make up assignments at a later date., If you’re taking an online course through a local secondary school or university, you should have access to library resources online. If not, talk to your local public library about online reference materials. Libraries offer students free access to a number of professional journals, periodicals, and search tools that could otherwise cost hundreds or thousands of dollars each year.


Visit the library’s website and search for any log in or access instructions. If you already have a library card, you may be able to access the information right away. Contact the school library. Ask what the process is to gain access to online resources.
Ask if there is a librarian who specializes in the topic you’re studying. These librarians offer assistance in fully utilizing the library’s resources and information on that subject.
If you’re taking a course for professional or personal development, you may not be doing so through a school. In this case, you should visit the website and reach out to librarians at your public library., Many web-based courses require group discussions or forums. Even if group discussions are not mandatory, participation gives you another opportunity to evaluate what you’re learning. Listening and responding to the perspectives of others is a great way to develop your own knowledge.


Read blogs that your peers or professors write. If you're feeling extra confident about the material, you can even start your own blog.
Participate in webinars. Watch them, but also ask questions, take notes, and make them an effective use of your time., If you’re worried that you’ll lose information or study better with a physical document, don’t hesitate to print out online resources. Some students simply learn better when they’re able to hold a document, mark and underline text, and otherwise interact with resources. For these types of learners, printing a physical copy may be beneficial., Your instructor should provide an overview of the course that may come in the form of syllabus or list of course objectives. However, taking the time to create your own outline can help you better understand the main concepts as well as incorporate the course schedule into your personal and professional schedules.


Make the outline fit your existing schedule. Start with any syllabus, checklist, or concept overviews provided by the instructor, and add details like, “I’ll need to do the assignments for week 5 in advance because I’m out of town that week.”, Whether you use your computer, tablet, or a physical pen and paper journal, keeping notes on readings, reference materials, and classes is a great way to better understand and remember what you study. If you take notes on a computer or tablet, they will be easy to search later, when you’re looking for specific information. If you prefer writing notes on paper, take time to keep them organized, so you’ll be able to find the information you need quickly., Whether you’re completing readings that are assigned for the whole class or you’re studying articles and resources independently, take time to carefully read, evaluate, and comprehend. The goal should be to only read a document one time, and have a basic understanding of the main concepts following this reading.


Highlight, underline, or make margin notes. This allows you to quickly find the information that is most important. You can do this on your computer or tablet using most eBook applications, if you don’t have physical copies of the materials.
Rephrase the big ideas in your own words. Imagine you’re explaining the main idea of each section to someone who isn’t studying the same subject you are, and provide a short, clear synopsis of the information. This can be done in writing or mentally as you go along., At the end of every chapter or section, take a few moments to test whether or not you’ve retained the knowledge. Most course manuals will include quizzes or tests. If not, you can search for practice tests on a variety of subjects online. Another simple way to test your knowledge on the material you cover is to review each heading in your readings and mentally summarize the content and main concepts of that section, making notes when necessary., If you’ll be busy or out of town when an assignment is due, complete the course work in advance. Set deadlines for yourself to complete work before it’s due, and whenever possible, complete work beyond these deadlines to stay ahead and make it easier to keep up with assignments."

Finding out exactly what you material you need to study can help you formulate a plan to effectively get through the night.Check your syllabus and carefully read through the instructions or information on the material you need to know. Check your class notes to see if the teacher or professor made any special announcements you should consider when formulating your plan.
Make a list of all of the material you need to cover over the course of the night. Prioritize which information is most important for your exam or assignment and put that at the top of your list. You may also want to put less relevant topics for later in the night.;
, Lecture notes and course readings are an integral part of any class. Having these materials at your fingertips can help you keep your work flow going and, in turn, study more efficiently throughout the night.


Make sure you have your notes, books, and any other materials you might need. This includes extra paper to take notes, pens, your computer with power cord, and any snacks and beverages you need. This will keep you from getting up unnecessarily and disrupting your concentration and schedule.

, Since you know you only have a set number of hours to study at night, it’s a good idea to make a strict schedule for yourself to follow. This can help you stay focused and on task throughout the night.Dedicate time to the most important material you need to study. Conversely, you might want to spend more time on material with which you’re less acquainted. Consider putting either earlier in your study session or after a break so that your brain can retain the information more effectively.
Be as specific as possible for each section of time and remember to build in breaks. For example, you could write: “8:00pm to 9:00pm: read pages 60-100 of history textbook; 9:00 to 9:15pm: break; 9:15 to 10:15pm: read pages covering primary documents 4-10 in history sourcebook; 10:15 to 10:30pm: break.”

, Every person has a different style of learning. Knowing how you study best can help you tackle getting through the night in the most effective way. It may also help you retain information better.Think about when you’ve pulled all-nighters in the past or the conditions under which you’ve studied most easily. For example, you might need total silence, so you could study in a library or at home. If you need a little noise or commotion to focus, consider working at an all-night café.

, Having a notebook and pen handy can help you retain information as you study through the night. It’s important to take your notes by hand, though, because you’ll learn and understand the material much more effectively than if you type them into a computer.Write only the most important points or keep a list of keywords or headings with a short 3-6 word explanation.Keeping notes may also help you stay awake and alert throughout the evening.
Review your notes the next day before the exam or when your assignment is due.

, It’s important to work methodically and stick to your schedule as much as possible through the night. This will ensure that you get through the material you need to cover without getting tired.


Review your schedule before you start to remind yourself what you need to accomplish.
Break down each assignment into manageable sections. For example, if you have to read 40 pages in an hour before a break, aim to read 10 pages every 15 minutes. Likewise, if you’re working on math problems, you might want to get 15 problems done every 30 minutes. Your pace might require a bit of tweaking throughout the night, but sticking to a basic and manageable formula may help you most effectively get through the material.

, If there are several people studying the same material, consider asking some to make a study group. Having a group that does work together or exchanges ideas may help you stay awake and alert and get through required material in a more effective way.


Consider splitting up the workload among participants and then presenting individual sections to one another. Every person has different learning styles and strengths. Material you may not know well someone else may have studied or understood better. When each person presents, ask questions to clarify points you don’t understand.Be aware that study groups can often turn into social groups as members get tired. Sticking to a schedule and a work plan for every person can make sure that you learn the material effectively. You may find that just having people around you to study is sufficient to keep you awake and alert through the night.

, After about 8-10 hours of studying, you’re likely to be very tired and may be stressed and confused by your work. Set aside your study materials and allow yourself to get a few hours sleep if you can. Remember that even a nap of 90 minutes can help you refresh and refocus for the day., Bright white light stimulates your body to stay awake. Making sure there is enough bright light in the place you chose to study all night can keep you from getting drowsy and may help you concentrate better on the material you need to cover.Find a place with a bright white light source. If you are studying at home, consider switching out your normal light bulb for higher watt, clear option.
Consider getting a mini-light or lamp to illuminate the material you are reading or consulting. This may provide further stimulation to your brain to keep you awake and alert.

, If you’re up all hours studying, it can be tempting to keep your devices and chat messengers open for stimulation. This can distract from your study session and ultimately harm your performance on the test or assignment.


Turn off your phone or tablet if possible. If not, consider switching the sound to silent so you’re not tempted to check it every time it sends you an alert.
Let your friends and family know that you need to study and they should not contact you during the evening unless it’s an emergency.

, Having something to occupy your mouth may help you get through the night. Mint gum or candies can also improve your mood and increase alertness.Chew any kind of gum because it will help you stay alert.
Consider keeping a small vial of peppermint oil close by to smell. Its scent can stimulate your brain and help you memorize more information., If you find your ability to concentrate waning, try drawing or doodling on a spare sheet of paper. Doing something creative like doodling, drawing, or even rolling a piece of clay may make you more alert and relaxed.Doodle, draw, or do something else for no more than 10 minutes. Consider rolling something in your hand or gripping a stress ball while you’re reading. This may soothe you and help you focus better.

, Studying all night can require a lot of energy. Eating a snack every couple of hours can help you stay alert and give you a chance to relax.Eat something light with protein like a piece of cheese, fresh fruit, a granola bar, or some pretzels. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is also a good option.


Make sure to have a cup or bottle of water with your snack to stay hydrated.

, If you are concentrating on material and information diligently, you’re likely to get tired and lose focus. After 60-90 minutes of studying, you should give yourself a 10-15 minute break to refresh and refocus.Go for a short walk, pace the room, or do some light yoga or stretching. Any activity will circulate your blood, oxygenate your brain, relax your body, and help you get back into the flow of work.
Take the opportunity to use the bathroom if necessary.
Avoid pushing through the 60-90 minute time frame without a break. This could make you more tired, affect your mood, and even less efficient at learning.

, You may know in advance of an upcoming assignment or test that may require you to stay up all night. Anticipating this by slightly changing your sleep patterns may make it easier to stay awake all night when the time arrives.Remember to not bank sleep too often because it can backfire and hurt your stamina and ability to effectively study.


Go to bed earlier or wake up later in the days before you know you’re going to have to study all night. You don’t need to alter your schedule by much, just an extra hour or two can help you stay up all night. This extra time can cue your body to the all-nighter as well as give you some extra hours of sleep reserve on which to draw when the night comes.

, If you didn’t anticipate having to study all night, you can take a “prophylactic nap” to help get yourself through the evening. This can not only help you push through the night, but may also boost your memory, creativity, mood, alertness, and cognitive performance.Sleep for 90 minutes between 1 and 3 pm for optimal performance. If you decide to take a brief nap during the night, napping between 1 and 3 am can also help your study session. Either way, a 90 minute nap can be as effective as napping for three hours.
Be aware that the effects of napping last only 8-10 hours. You might want to consider taking a brief nap just before you begin studying to get you through the night.

, If you’re going to be up all night, you want to keep yourself not only comfortable, but also properly fueled. Make sure to drink water throughout the day to keep yourself hydrated, which can also improve the way you feel and keep you alert. In addition, making sure to eat light meals will promote alertness and fuel your study session without weighing you down or making you feel lethargic.


Drink at least 8 ounces of water every hour throughout the day and during your all-nighter. Dehydration can cause fatigue and decrease alertness. It may also cause headaches or dizziness that could prevent you from studying effectively.
Feel free to drink coffee or tea, but be aware that it may not help you stay awake longer or be more alert.In fact, if you’ve been drinking a lot of caffeine or even energy drinks, they may make you jittery and unable to effectively study.Avoid alcohol in the days and hours before an all night study session. This can make you drowsy and unable to concentrate.
Stay away from heavy meals the day you have to pull an all-nighter. Heavy foods divert blood away from your brain to aid in digestion. Consider lighter choices such as soup and a salad with a protein like chicken. These can increase your energy to get through the night without weighing you down.
Avoid foods with too much sugar, which may decrease your alertness and negatively affect your mood. Consider going for a ten minute walk instead. This can give you more energy, relax you and improve alertness., Not being comfortable can make an all night study session drag on and feel like torture. Choose comfortable articles of clothing that allow you to move and won’t get tighter over the course of the night.Choose pants and tops that are not form fitting. For example, a pair of skinny jeans instead of sweats or yoga pants could make your legs fall asleep.Consider layering your tops depending on where you are studying. This can keep you from getting too cold or too hot during the night. For example, wear a light t-shirt with a sweatshirt or sweater and a light scarf. You can add or pull off each article as you need.
Wear comfortable shoes. If you’re sitting for a long period of time, your feet might swell. This can make any shoes you wear uncomfortable. Consider wearing slippers, running shoes, or flat shoes., Sitting up straight can keep you alert and help you avoid tension in your neck and shoulders.Maintaining proper posture throughout the night may help you study more effectively and get through the night more easily.Make sure you are in a chair with a back, which offers support and will help you sit properly and stay alert. Keeping your feet on the floor will help you sit in a proper position. Keep your head and neck in a neutral, straight position. Pull in your abs, straighten your back and push back your shoulders, all of which will help you get enough oxygen to keep you awake and alert. Avoid slouching as much as possible because it may make you drowsy.

, Every hour, get up or do small stretching movements with your legs. This can not only give you a much needed mini-break, but also help you stay alert by circulating blood throughout your body.Try different movements and stretches such as pushing your legs forward, pushing and pulling your toes towards and away from you, and doing ankle and wrist circles.
Consider getting up to stretch if it doesn’t interrupt or bother anyone in your general vicinity.

Find the right time to ask.,
Show gratitude.,
Provide a concrete reason.,
Give them time to decide.",How to Stay up on a School Night1," When you’re asking your parents to stay up on a school night, timing is everything. If you ask them when they’re in a bad mood or feeling particularly stressed, you’re likely going to get an automatic “no.” However, if you ask when they’re in a good mood, you have a better chance of getting permission to stay up.Pay attention to when your parents are usually in a good mood. For example, if your dad is always happy after he watches her favorite TV show, that’s a good time to ask him if you can stay up.
On the other hand, if you know your parents are upset about something, wait until later to talk to them. For example, if your mom tells you that she’s had a bad day at work, you should give her some time to relax before you ask about staying up.
Make sure that your parents have time to listen to your request too. Don’t ask them when they’re about to head out the door or working on an important project around the house.;
, Parents usually don’t respond well if you act like you entitled to something just because you asked for it. When you ask your parents to stay up on a school night, be sure to show gratitude so they know you appreciate all that they do allow you to do. Instead of just asking “Can I stay up late tonight?”, start by saying something like, “I know that you let me stay up sometimes for special occasions, and I really appreciate that.”Don’t just pretend that you’re grateful what your parents do for you. It’s important to genuinely appreciate what they allow you to do, so you don’t take for granted that they’re going to let you stay up whenever you want.
Avoid whining when you ask too. Be as polite and calm as you can manage.

, When you’re asking your parents to stay up on a school night, it helps to have a specific reason why you want to do it. They’re more likely to say yes if they know why it’s so important to you. For example, there might be a TV show that you really want to see or a late baseball game that you want to watch. Explain why you would like to stay up as clearly as possible, so your parents have good reason to allow it.Your reason for wanting to stay up late on a school night doesn’t have to be a one-time-only event. You might feel that because you’ve reached a certain age, it’s time that you be allowed to stay up late every night.
If you’re asking for a permanent change to your bedtime, you might say, “I really feel that because I’m 12 years old now, I should be able to stay up until 10 o’clock.”
It may also help to cite examples of friends who are allowed to stay up on a school night. For example, you might say, “Ryan’s parents decided to let him stay up late on Thursday to watch the playoff game,” or “Marissa and Katelyn are also 13, and they’re allowed to stay up until 10:30 on school nights.”

, You probably want to know right away if your parents are going to let you stay up, but try your best to be patient. If you put your parents on the spot and ask for an answer right way, they’re probably more likely to say “no.” Instead, tell that them that you want to give them time to think about your request.You might say, “Don’t say yes or no right away. Take some time to think about it before you let me know.”
Being patient can be difficult, so it’s a good idea to settle on a specific time when you’re going to get your answer. For example, you might say, “You don’t have to let me know right now. Let’s talk about it again tomorrow afternoon.”

Get your schoolwork done.,
Rest up beforehand.,
Offer to do chores.",How to Stay up on a School Night2," If you parents are looking for reasons to say “no” to you, school will probably be their biggest concern. Prove to them that your schoolwork won’t suffer by getting all of the necessary projects and studying done in advance of the night that you plan to stay up.When you get home from school, homework and studying should be your first priority. If your parents see that you take school seriously, they’ll be more likely to believe that you handle staying up late for the night.
If you’re asking for a permanent change to your bedtime, make sure to stay on top of your homework and do well on any tests for several weeks to a month before you ask your parents.

, If you know that there’s a certain night that you want to stay up, try to get some extra sleep beforehand. Your parents will want to know that you’re well-rested if you going to lose a few hours of sleep, and being sleep-deprived before the night even starts will only make it that much harder to wake up the morning after. Go to bed as early as possible the days leading up your big night, so you won’t be tired when you start.You might want to make a point of going to bed early the night before, so your parents know that you’re trying to take care of yourself.

, If you want something from your parents, offering to do some work around the house can often help because they’ll see that you’re willing to earn the privilege of staying up. That means doing more than your usual chores, though. Tell your parents that you’re willing to take on a little extra work in order to stay up.When you’re talking to your parents, you might say, “I’m willing to wash the dishes every night this week if I can stay up” or “I’ll walk the dog for the rest of the month if you let me stay up tomorrow.”
If you’re negotiating for a permanent change to your bedtime, you may need to take on extra responsibilities indefinitely. For example, you might offer to be the one to take the garbage out from now on or to wash your parents’ cars once a month.

Have some caffeine.,
Plan to catch up on sleep the next day.,
Try to be active.",How to Stay up on a School Night3," The morning after a late night, a little caffeine can help get you going. It’s important not to overdo it, though. Most people only need 100 to 200 milligrams (mg) to get an energy boost, so start with a single cup of coffee at breakfast. The effects last for three to four hours too, which means you won’t need to have more caffeine until about lunch time if you’re feeling tired again.If you aren’t used to having caffeine regularly, it’s especially important to stick to small doses so you don’t wind up jittery and unable to concentrate. Don’t have more than 100 mg, or a 5 ounce cup, at a time.
If you don’t like coffee, you can swap it for your favorite energy drink, soda, or tea. Just make sure to check the label to see how much caffeine is in your beverage so you don’t overdo it.
It’s a good idea to drink your caffeinated beverage with a meal or snack. The food will help slow the release of caffeine in your body, so it doesn’t hit you all at once.

, If it’s possible, plan to give yourself plenty of time the following day to catch up on sleep. When you get home from school, take an hour long nap to recharge. Don’t sleep longer than that, though, or you may ruin your chances of sleeping at night. After you’ve finished with dinner, homework, and chores, get to bed as early as possible. You want to make sure that you get a solid 10 hours of sleep if possible.Your motor skills will probably be affected after staying up late the night before, so make sure not to drive or do anything else that requires a quick response until you’ve caught up on sleep.

, It may not seem like it makes sense, but moving around regularly after a late night can help improve alertness. You probably won’t have time to fit in a workout before school, but consider walking there if possible or doing some light stretching before you head out. It can also help to fit in some activity during lunch, such as a quick walk around the school track or building. Even jogging in place or doing some quick jumping jacks can help get your blood flowing and boost your energy.If possible, aim to take an activity break every 45 minutes or so. That can help ensure that you stay awake and focused all day.

Arrive in lab with long pants and closed-toe shoes.,
Don a lab coat during experiments.,
Protect your eyes with goggles.,
Wear safety gloves.",How to Stay Safe in a Science Lab at School1," One of the most important aspects of lab safety is preventing your body from being exposed to contaminants. The first step in wearing proper protective equipment (PPE) is coming to lab prepared with long pants and closed-toe shoes. Shoes with a hard top are preferred in case you drop something on your feet.Once you get to lab, you will put on the rest of the PPE that will cover any other exposed parts of your body.
Tuck in loose, baggy clothing and roll up long sleeves.;
, The lab coat is essential for protecting you and your clothes from spills and other chemicals. It can quickly be removed in case of a spill. The lab coat needs to fit you well in order to be effective. Wear your lab coat whenever you are doing anything in the lab.


If the sleeves are too long they can get in the way and be cumbersome while working.

, Goggles do not have to be worn at all times, but they must be worn when handling chemicals or working with anything with a splash or explosion hazard.


Goggles must wrap around the sides of your face to protect the eyes from all sides.

, There are a number of different types of gloves that you may need to wear depending on what you are working with. For basic safety and protection from harmful chemicals, disposable latex or nitrile gloves will be worn. This is most likely what you will be using in your lab at school.


If you are working with extremely hot or extremely cold substances, you will need to wear special gloves that are temperature appropriate.
When working with anything that conducts electricity and could be a shock hazard, you need to wear rubber gloves.

"
"
Listen to your teacher and follow instructions carefully.,
Never eat or drink in the lab.,
Tie your hair back and remove all jewelry.,
Store coats, chairs, and bags out of the way.,
Report all spills, breakages, or accidents to your teacher immediately.",How to Stay Safe in a Science Lab at School2," Before a lab begins, your teacher will discuss all of the necessary safety precautions for that specific experiment. They will have also detailed all safety procedures at the beginning of the year.If you are unsure of the correct way to handle something, always ask the teacher so you do everything safely.
At all times, follow any safety guidelines posted in the lab.

, Eating or drinking in the lab or during an experiment can be extremely hazardous and lead to injury. If you have a hazardous chemical on your hands and then you touch your food with those hands, you could ingest that chemical. The same goes for drinking beverages.If you need to eat or drink anything, remove your gloves and lab coat, wash your hands, leave the laboratory and then consume the food or drink.
Chewing gum is also not allowed in the lab.

, Hair and dangling jewelry can present a hazard if they catch on anything. You can also accidentally catch your hair on fire if it falls into a flame without you realizing it. Chemicals that are corrosive or irritating can get underneath a ring or a bracelet and cause irritation.


Try to come to class without any jewelry so you don’t have to store it and potentially lose it.

, When you first get to the lab, put all of your things in a place where they will be out of the way and not create a trip hazard. Under the lab bench or in cubby holes at the front of the class are the two best places to store them.


When leaving class, remember to grab all of your things from under the bench or wherever they were left.

, No matter how trivial it may seem, everything must be reported to the teacher. They will know how to handle everything safely and make sure no one gets hurt.If glass breaks or something spills, do not try to clean it up until you have told your teacher about it. There might be a special way the clean-up needs to be handled.

Know where the safety equipment is located.,
Point test tubes away from you when you are heating them.,
Pour acid into water, not water into acid.,
Keep your workspace clean and tidy.,
Avoid replacing excess reagents in the original container.,
Take precautions with all flames.,
Use a vent hood when handling volatile chemicals.,
Wash your hands after practical work.",How to Stay Safe in a Science Lab at School3," Get instructions from a qualified person on use of the safety equipment needed for the planned procedure before you do any lab work. If you are not told about safety equipment for your procedure, ask. It is best to know about what might go wrong before it actually does. That way you will be able to respond quickly and correctly. Typical safety equipment includes:eye wash stations
overhead showers
fire blankets (to suffocate fires)
fire extinguishers for different types of fires
vent hoods
solvent cabinets and containers
lockouts for moving apparatus
aprons, goggles, neoprene gloves, asbestos gloves

, Heat the test tube slowly to avoid rapid boiling and liquid splashing out of the tube. Never heat a plugged or stopped tube because pressure can build up inside and cause the tube to shatter.Pointing the test tube away from your face will avoid injury in case the tube does boil or splash over.

, The reaction between water and acid is exothermic meaning it releases it heat. Acid must always be added directly to the water because if you add water to the acid it can explode.The acid can splash and get in your eyes and on your person causing serious injury.

, Making sure everything is tidy will help you avoid spills. A clean workspace also ensures no contamination between experiments.Clean and disinfect your workspace at the end of every lab session.

, Once a chemical has been removed from its container, it cannot go back in. This is to avoid contaminating the chemical with other chemicals, dirt, or dust.If you do have excess chemical, properly dispose of them using procedures detailed by your teacher.

, A Bunsen burner is an open flame and must be treated with extreme caution. Make sure there is nothing flammable near the burner and you don’t bend over the flame. Turn the flame off immediately when you are finished using it.


If your clothes catch fire, remember to STOP what you are doing, DROP to the ground, and ROLL until the flame has been smothered.

, Many chemicals emit noxious fumes that are extremely toxic if inhaled. Working in a fume hood allows you to open the chemicals and not be exposed to the fumes.


If you are unsure if you need to use a fume hood, err on the safe side and use the fume hood just in case.

, At the end of every experiment, it is essential that you wash your hands before leaving the lab. This ensures that you have washed any chemicals or contaminants from your hands.Wash hands after removing all of your PPE.
Wash them with warm water and scrub with soap for at least 30 seconds.

Get a good night’s sleep.,
Wake up to music.,
Stretch your body and mind.,
Eat breakfast daily.,
Take a shower.,
Wear comfortable clothing.,
Light up your workspace.,
Use proper posture.,
Stretch your legs.,
Take short breaks.,
Boost energy with a snack.,
Avoid heavy lunches.,
Stay hydrated.,
Smell or chew on peppermint.",How to Stay Energized at Work," Aim to sleep for 7-9 hours every night before work. This can recharge and relax yourself. It also can help you start off the day on the right foot and ensure you have energy throughout the day., Getting up can be the hardest part of your day. Play soothing and cheerful music instead of an alarm. This can help you wake up in a calm and relaxed manner and invigorate you throughout the day.Set your alarm time based on your work time and morning routine. For example, if you have to be at work at 9:30 and it takes you a ½ hour to get ready and a ½ hour to commute, you need to wake up no later than 7:30am. Incorporate an extra 15 minutes so you can snooze or if you’re running late., Instead of hopping out of bed immediately, gently stretch in bed or do some light yoga. This can relax you and get your blood flowing.Take a few deep breaths by inhaling through your nose and exhaling from your mouth to further wake up and relax you. Then sit up, put your feet on the floor and perform one or two more stretches., There is a reason that people say, “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” A healthy breakfast gives you a boost of energy and the nutrients you need to stay energized through the day. It also can prevent a mid-morning slump or low blood sugar that may decrease your energy or make you cranky.Include one choice from the four food groups: bread and grains, dairy, and fruits or vegetables. For example, have whole wheat toast with avocado, a cup of low fat Greek yogurt with berries, and a cup of coffee. You could also eat a whole grain bagel with a piece of turkey bacon and lowfat melted cheese, a cup of mixed berries with banana, and tea with milk. Adding a ½ teaspoon sugar in your coffee or having a small glass of orange juice may also help your memory throughout the day., Stand under a warm shower before or after your breakfast. This can also refresh and rejuvenate you after a night of sleeping, and maybe a little sweating.Shower in water between 36 and 40 degrees Celsius (95 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit).Alternate between warm and cold water to further wake and energize you. Wash with a body wash or soap in a scent such as lemongrass, lavender, or black pepper. Their smell may give you another boost of energy., Being uncomfortable can make working feel like torture. Choose loose, comfortable clothing that you can layer. This allows you to move easily and may not get constrict you during the day., Bright white light stimulates your body and mind. Open up any curtains and turn the lights to high in your workspace. Consider placing a small lamp in darker spaces. Having lots of light can keep you alert and from getting drowsy.Use higher watt, clear light bulbs if you are able.

, Hold your head, back, and neck in a neutral, straight position. Pull in your abs, push back your shoulders, and keep your feet flat on the floor to reinforce this proper sitting and standing position. This can oxygenate your blood, which keeps you energized, awake, and alert. It can also prevent tension.Check your position every hour to prevent slouching, which can make you drowsy.

, Every hour, stretch your legs. This can give you a mini-break and also boost energy by circulating blood throughout your body.Do different stretches including pushing your legs forward, pushing and pulling your toes towards and away from you, and doing ankle and wrist circles.
Consider asking for a stand-up or moving desk to keep you body moving. This can also stimulate your brain and relax your body.

, Give yourself a 10-minute break in the morning and again in the afternoon. Do something you enjoy such as rest on a park bench or going for a walk. This helps circulate your blood and push oxygen to your brain. It also refreshes your body and mind, promotes relaxation, and eases stress.Draw or doodle on a spare sheet of paper, roll a piece of clay, or grip a stress ball. These can make you more alert and relaxed., Your energy and mood may wane before and after lunch. Have a mid-morning and mid-afternoon snack to stay energized. This can also improve your mood.Choose nutritious snacks such as:


Mixed nuts
Low-fat popcorn
Fresh fruit with a cup of yogurt or cottage cheese
Pretzels and avocado dip
Protein bars
Cut veggies and hummus
Boiled egg
Apple slice and almond butter
String cheese

, Pack your lunch or pre-select a salad or other light dish if you are eating at a restaurant. Consider lighter choices such as soup and a salad with a protein like chicken. This can keep blood from diverting to your belly, which causes energy to flag. Avoid foods high in sugar, which may lower your alertness and energy., Drink at least 8 ounces of water or another beverage such as 100% juice or tea every hour during the day. Dehydration can sap your energy and lower your ability to concentrate on work.Drink caffeinated and sugary beverages in moderation. These may give you a momentary energy boost, but too many of them can make you jittery and unable to concentrate.Avoid alcohol during work. This can make you drowsy and unable to concentrate.

, The scent of peppermint can stimulate your mind, keep you alert, and relax you. Chew or suck on mint gum or candies during the work day.Keep a bottle of peppermint essential oil at your desk to smell when you like."

Find out your teacher's open hours, or email them asking if you can see them at a certain time.,
Don't be nervous!,
Let them your goal in the class, and tell them that you're concerned by your current grade.,
Ask how you can do better, and if there's any way they can help you.,
Thank your teacher for their time, and follow their advice.",How to Tell Your Teacher You Don't Like Your Grades2," Open hours can often be found on a teacher's website or in the syllabus, and if you choose to email them, make sure you include a specific time and be flexible to their plans if you can.

, Feel confident in your ability to talk to them. Write down some notes ahead of time so that you have an idea of what to say, and approach them with confidence. Your teachers are there to help you, and they want you to succeed!

, Showing your teacher that you have a vested interest in furthering your education lets them know that you are serious about doing well.

, Your teachers want you to succeed, and if you've told them that you aren't happy with your grades, it's a great idea to follow up by showing an interest in improvement.

Make a list.,
Create a schedule.,
Maintain a clutter-free room and homework space.,
Keep homework in separate folders.,
Use your free time to finish homework early.",How to Balance Homework and Chores1," A great way to see the things you need to complete is by making lists of your chores and homework. Do this when you wake up on a daily basis so you have a good understanding of the best way to manage your time that day.


As you complete each task, cross it off on the list so that you remember that you don’t have to do it anymore.
Create your list on a piece of paper or your cellphone. Storing lists mentally leaves room for you to forget what you need to do.
During the day you may get additional chores or homework assignments. When you do, make sure to add them to your list.;
, Having a schedule of your day will allow you to manage time efficiently. If you find yourself running over schedule on a certain task, you know you’ll have to make that up somewhere else in your day.


Your schedule doesn’t need to be as specific as an hour-by-hour schedule, but the more specific you are the better. A day-to-day schedule will allow you to plot out important chores per day so that by the end of the week you’ll have completed all of them.
A good list will have each chore listed with how long it will take. A good schedule would have this information:

4:00 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. - Homework
5:45 p.m. - 6:15 p.m. - Vacuum Dining Room
6:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. - Clean Room
7:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. - Socialize!



, Having a cluttered workspace or room interferes with your brain’s ability to process information.This means that a cluttered room can prolong the amount of time it takes you from doing your homework. By keeping up with the cleanliness of your room, you are eliminating a chore on your list.


Throw things away like empty bottles of water or loose pieces of paper as soon as you don’t need them anymore. .
The more you stay on top of your clutter, the less work you have to do all at once.

, When you spend your time looking for things that could be easily available, you are wasting valuable time that could be spent having fun. Organizing your materials per subject will help you locate any homework or study guides that you need.


Keeping a binder or trapper keeper with separate compartments can help you keep any important homework.
Make sure to keep things you don’t need anymore in a separate place. You don’t want your folders to become cluttered and unorganized.
Be careful when you throw away things you get in class. You may need it for a quiz or test in the future.

, Make sure that you are utilizing all the time you have in order to finish your homework. Times like study hall, waiting for a class to start, or riding home on the bus are all times you can start a portion of your homework. The more you do during these times, the less you have to do when you get home from school.


Reading assignments can take a long time if you wait to read the material. By using your free time to read, you can start working on the essay portion of the assignment quickly.

Eliminate any distractions.,
Don’t procrastinate.,
Prioritize what you need to do.,
Learn to say no.,
Negotiate less chores.",How to Balance Homework and Chores2," Even if a distraction doesn’t seem like it’s occupying your time, the cumulative effects could be affecting your productivity. Instead of answering an unimportant text message, or catching 15 minutes of your favorite show, turn off all distractions until you are done with everything that’s on your list. If you like playing video or computer games, save it for after your homework. You want to keep your mind sharp so you can get good grades and still get it done as fast as possible.
Social texting is pretty normal, but every time you break your concentration and do something else you’re making the time you have to spend on homework longer. Text the person back and let tell them that you’ll get back to them when you’re done.

, You might be tempted to wait to do your chores, but you shouldn’t. Some chores, like cleaning your room or washing the dishes build up over time and will take you a longer time if you wait. Doing your homework as soon as you get home will make it so you don’t get distracted before finishing it.


The more you procrastinate the more that you’ll be stressed about not having enough time to finish all of your chores and your homework. Do it early so you can sit back, relax, and have a good time with your friends.

, Some things are more important, and some chores take longer to do than others. It’s important to get the most important chores out of way first.


Even though chores are important, education comes first. Do your homework before you do your chores when you get home.

, Peer pressure can sometimes pull you away from actually getting homework accomplished. Getting good grades is crucial to a successful future, so you should learn to say no if someone is trying to pull you away from doing homework.


Don’t be rude. Explain to the person that you need to get your homework done or else it will affect your grades. You aren’t trying to be mean, you just want to stay on task.
If you’re not used to telling people “no,” the only way to get used to it is to practice. Your friends will understand.

, Sometimes our parents can assign us chores without thinking of our school workload, but education should always come first. Try talking to your parents about the amount of chores that you have, and explain to them how they are interfering with your school work and social life.


Offer something in return for less chores, like better grades or A’s on your report card.
If you have siblings try to trade chores with them.
Don’t get mad at your parents if you realize that you have too many chores to get everything done. Simply explain to them first and then negotiate the alternatives.

"
"
Exercise in your free time.,
Take breaks while you are working.,
Maintain a healthy and balanced diet.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Balance Homework and Chores3," When you exercise, our body feels good, and you end up in a better mental state. Also, you’ll have more energy for the more physical chores like picking weeds, raking leaves, or mowing the lawn, which will allow you to do it faster and more efficiently.


Exercising can also be a hobby, like a sport that you enjoy. As long as you are getting out there and moving, it’s better than sitting around!
Gym isn’t enough exercise for most people. Make sure that you take up another physical hobby like basketball, hockey, martial arts, tennis, dance, or something else that’s challenging. Try out different things to see what you like best. , If you work too hard for a long period of time, it’s limits your mind’s ability to do your homework quickly. You may think that you’re working hard and getting through all of your chores and homework but the reality is because your mind is dull from being overworked, you’re completing these tasks slower than normal.


Going outside and taking a 10 minute walk to get fresh air is a great thing to do when you take a break.

, Your nutrition affects how well you can do physical and mental tasks. If you are taking too long on homework or chores, it might be because of your diet. The better nutrition you get, the more energy you’ll be able to have to finish chores and homework early and have time to hang out with your friends.

, A lack of sleep limits your cognitive function-the thing you use to do your homework! If you aren’t getting enough sleep at night, try to get to bed earlier because it could be preventing you from doing your homework quickly, and may even be increasing the time it takes you on more physical chores.


If you are between the ages of 14 to 17 you'll need around 8 to 10 hours of sleep to feel fully rested. If you are over 17 you'll need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep to feel good.

Decide how much time you have available for homework after school for each day of the week.,
Consider using your mornings.,
Take advantage of your travel time.,
Use your study halls or homeroom times well.,
Use free periods.,
Make Fridays count.,
Select your environment carefully.,
Make sure you have all your stationery and books (including textbooks) needed before leaving school.,
Make a list of all the homework and activities you have for that day or week.,
Write your assignments down accurately and promptly when they are given.,
Estimate how much time will be needed to complete each assignment.,
Prioritize your earliest deadlines first (EDF).,
Break down your homework time.,
Write in break times.,
Stick with the schedule.,
Avoid procrastination.",How to Plan a Homework Schedule," For example, Monday - 1 hour, Tuesday - 1 1/2 hours, Wednesday - 1/2 hour, etc. On days where you have other planned activities, whether it's an extracurricular activity or chores or quality time with your family, you will have less time for homework.;
, At the end of the day, if you're really tired and still have homework, go to bed and set your alarm perhaps an hour or two earlier than what you usually do. This way when you do your homework you will have more energy and be able to complete it faster. You also won't have to worry about it after school, when you are tired.

, If you don't get motion sick in the car or on public transportation, try to do some of your homework on your way to a basketball game or on your way home from school. But be careful, as your writing may be messy.

, Don't be fooling around with your friends and then come home annoyed that you have a lot of homework. This will make you more grumpy and you will probably get told off by your teachers as well. Don't let your friends distract you.

, If you have a free period, don't use it to hang out with your friends at a local pizza place, use it to catch up on your homework. You will have time to hang out with your friends after school or on a weekend, make homework your first priority.

, Unless you have plans on Friday after school, try to do all your homework for the weekend then. It will be easier to enjoy the weekend without having to worry about your homework. What a lot of people do is not do their homework on Friday, and wait until Sunday night to do it so you have all weekend (including Friday) to do whatever. This may sound like a good idea now, but while you are going out to a party or whatever on Saturday night, all you will be able to think about is having to do your homework the next night. Then on Sunday, you will be tired and won't have a good attitude to do your homework.

, If your environment is in your living room with all your siblings and parents around, that probably isn't the best choice of environment. You will easily get distracted by your siblings asking you questions or the TV noise in the background. A good choice will probably be your own bedroom (with the door shut) or, if you have one, a study. Make sure your family knows you are doing your homework, otherwise they might walk in while you are working on studying for your math test tomorrow.

, Obviously this helps because you don't want to get home and when you are about to do your homework, you realize you have left your textbook at school.

, List games, projects, essays and more. It will be easier to know what homework you have and the details. Then sort out what times and what days you have your out of school activities. Write down the time periods of when you don't have something planned. Assign a subject of homework to that time period. This leads to using your spare time. If you don't have an activity one day, try to do your homework for other days also to get it out of the way.

, You cannot plan your homework time effectively if you do not know exactly what to do. Record the following information:


The subject or course in which the work is assigned (for example, Spanish, algebra, French or English)
Know what you're expected to hand in or do and ask if you do not understand (for example, turn in an essay, develop a PowerPoint presentation, or take a test.)
The details of your assignments (for example, double-spaced or single-spaced, blue ink or black).
Page numbers (which pages you need to read, study, or refer to complete your assignment.)
Due date of the assignment.

, Be realistic. It is better to block out more time than less. If you finish early, you can use your bonus time for another subject. Remember that if you have extra time left over, you can reward yourself by doing something other than homework.

, This is an optimal dynamic scheduling policy. If it is humanly possible to meet all the deadlines, earliest deadline first policy will work. That means, if you get a new assignment due the next day, you need to suspend all work due in 2 days and work on the next day's assignment. However, if you cannot meet any deadlines, you will miss them randomly with EDF. To solve this problem, if you cannot meet all the deadlines, use a static priority rate-monotonic policy. Find the course that releases new homework the most frequently, and list it the highest (do the work first), and so forth. This is mathematically optimal among all static-priority scheduling policies. In other words, if ANY static priority scheme can meet all the deadlines, the rate-monotonic static priority scheme will meet all the deadlines, too. When the static priority scheme misses deadlines, it is deterministic - the lowest priority class assignments will be skipped, so it behaves predictably when you are overloaded. If certain assignments have the same due date, then start with the one(s) that are hardest or will take the longest.

, Look at your assignments and consider how much time you need to devote to each. Find time in your homework schedule to get it done, preferably a day early.


If you have a five-page English paper due on Friday, evenly spread the total amount of hours you believe it is going to take to complete the paper between each day.

, This will stop you from getting too overwhelmed and frustrated during long stretches of homework time and will help you to keep your mind focused. A ten-minute break for each hour of homework done is a good guideline. Use this time to stretch, wash your face, walk around the block, unload the dishwasher for your parents, get something to drink, or do anything that won't tempt you to delay your return to homework. Do not extend the time you take to refuel (such as getting your juice) and do not start with activities that relate to goofing off.

, Once you have your schedule, follow it, or else all the planning in the world is useless. Your plans won't work if you won't work.

, Don't spend the first 20 minutes at home complaining about your homework, because in that amount of time you could have done some homework. It really is pointless complaining, because you are going to have to do it anyway.

Keep pictures safe.",How to Stock Your Locker," Before you put anything in a new locker, or before you reorganize an old one, make sure it's clean. Toss out any trash or old assignments. Wipe the inside with a slightly damp cloth, paper towel, or wet wipe.;
, Locker shelves are cheap wire racks that can give you a lot of extra storage space. You can find them at department stores and hardware stores that sell schools supplies.


Measure the width and height of your locker first before you buy a locker shelf.
You can also make a jank ""DIY locker"" out of three small planks. Lean two of them against the right and left walls of your locker, and place the third on top of them.

, Pencil cups are great for keeping track of all your small school supplies. Find a strong magnetic cup to save the most space by keeping it up near the top, attached to the side of the locker. Otherwise, keep it up on top of your locker shelf.

, Some lockers already have built-in pegs or hooks for hanging your backpack, coat, or lunchbox. If yours doesn't, magnetic hooks probably won't be strong enough to hold these heavy objects. However, you can use them to hang light fabric bags, keys, and other small objects to make better use of the space at the top of your locker.


You can sometimes find ""locker ladders,"" or hooks with fabric pockets hanging down from them.

, If you think a place for reminders would be useful, buy a magnetic whiteboard and keep it on the back or side walls of your locker. Otherwise, just put a copy of your schedule, or other papers you look at daily. Use tape if your school allows it, and magnets if not.


Whiteboards are also useful if you share the locker with someone else, so you can trade messages.

, A magnetic mirror at eye level lets you check your appearance and reapply makeup during the day. If your locker is dark, a ""locker light,"" reading light, or small, magnetic lamp can make it easier to find supplies. Set these aside and add them after stocking your locker with supplies, so you can find an out-of-the-way spot where textbooks and lunchboxes won't break them.


Use a low-power light or a light with a self-timer to avoid starting a fire or melting supplies.

, Store heavy textbooks, binders, and notebooks on the lowest shelf of your locker, since they're the heaviest objects. Keep these organized based on when you need to use them, so you can quickly grab the ones you want.


Try not to use two notebooks or binders with the same color, and label everything clearly.
Shelve your books with the spines upright. Don't stack them, which makes it hard to grab one quickly and keep them organized.

, On the top shelf of your locker, or in a magnetic pencil cup, store extra pencils, pens, and erasers. You can add optional supplies like sticky notes, white-out, or extra pencil lead, but try to limit yourself to one container to save space.

, Put in some deodorant, body spray, breath mints or gum, or whatever toiletries you use daily or would want in an emergency. You might use hand sanitizer, lip balm, moisturizing lotion, makeup, and hair bands, clips, or scrunchies.


If you are female, feminine hygiene products are always a good idea to keep around. Even if you do not need them yourself, your friends might ask for one in an emergency.

, Put in tightly wrapped food only, so there are no crumbs or smells that could attract animals. Granola bars are east, compact energy boosters, while chocolate are candy can help your mood on a rough day. Keep your lunchbox in your locker if there's space on the top shelf, but avoid cramming it somewhere where the food inside could leak out and stain your supplies.


If you have night classes, include something more substantial such as a microwavable noodle box.
A water bottle can be useful, if you have the space and remember to fill it up daily.

, Put in a coin purse, pencil box, or other small container at the back of your locker. Stock this with items you don't use often, but could really regret not having access to. For instance:


a small container of over-the-counter pain relievers
enough spare cash to buy a lunch or take a bus home
USB keys

, If you have the space, roll up a spare T-shirt and/or sweatshirt in case you get caught in the rain. You may also need to store your gym clothes here, although some schools provide a second gym locker. Store these at the bottom of your locker, underneath your lowest locker shelf, or hang them up at the back if there are spare pegs.


If you have a large locker and are bundled up for winter weather, put down a fluffy towel so you can store wet boots, hats, and mittens at the bottom of your locker without flooding the locker or floor below.

, Exam season can sneak up on you, and you might be too busy to organize this kit at the time. Unless your locker is already packed with stuff, add a sealed zipped lock bag with supplies that you could take into a test:


Several pencils, several pens, a pencil sharpener, and a good eraser
A cheap calculator, if your teacher allows it
Blank index cards, for tests that allow notes
Cough drops and tissues in case you need to take a test while sick

, Start decorating only after you've got everything else into your locker. Now that you can see how much space you have left, go easy and give yourself plenty of space on the walls. Assume your locker will become more full as you get busy and add more assignments to it. You don't want bulky or heavy decorations that will fall down and get mixed into your supplies.


Avoid using anything magnetic on the door of your locker. Magnets can easily be knocked off and drop your belongings all over the floor.

, If you want to make your locker more interesting with ""wallpaper,"" scrapbooking paper from a craft store will work fine and can easily by attached with magnets.

, You can pick up a photo album from a dollar store or thrift store, cut out the pockets, and use them to keep pictures safe in your locker. Use flat magnets to hang up these pictures, since bulky or oddly shaped magnets can be damaged when you toss heavy books into your locker. Use tape only if your school allows it.


To be extra safe, keep copies of precious pictures at home or on your phone.

, If you are struggling to remember, set an alarm on your phone, computer, game system, etc. so you won't lose track of time with technology.

, Say nicely ""In order to get homework in on time, I really need you guys to leave me alone from 3 o'clock to 4:30"" or something like that. They'll understand and be proud of you for trying to solve your problem.

, If you feel too tempted, turn the devices off or put them in a separate room.

, Have a folder for every subject and one for random items. Avoid shoving papers into your desk or backpack aimlessly. Of course you will lose them that way.

, It may take weeks, but soon you will get into a rhythm that is hard to break.

Make sure that pulling an all nighter is unavoidable.,

Eat protein-rich foods to stay energized.,
Play hardcore metal music.,
Squeeze and massage your ears.,
Turn off all of your devices.,
Work with the windows open.,
Avoid working in comfortable places.,
Maintain an upright posture.,
Acknowledge your limits.",How to Pull an All Nighter," You should not stay up all night just because you need to study; your sleep is the time when memories are properly processed. Denying yourself sleep can make your brain less effective at retaining information. In most cases, it is better to get at least a little bit of rest during the night rather than none at all.To remain healthy, never stay awake for two whole nights in a row. Pull an all nighter as infrequently as possible.;
, Thoughts such as: ""I am almost done,"" ""This is actually not too hard,"" ""I will get to see the sunrise,"" ""I will get a good grade,"" or other affirmations can help. Negativity will only slow your productivity, so assure yourself that you will be rewarded for your time and effort., You can decide to reward yourself if you make it to certain checkpoints throughout the night. For instance, if you stay awake to finish an assignment, you can reward yourself with chocolate or a brief Netflix break. These small motivators can guide you toward completing your overall goals for the night.

, This will allow you to have more energy during the night. If at all possible, make this a two to three hour nap and limit any potential distractions during this time. Be sure to take out your contacts if you wear them, since leaving them in could harm your eyes and prevent proper sleep.Set a timer if you're going to nap. Don't nap for more than 20 minutes during the all-nighter itself, and stay half-awake. Be aware that napping during the night could lead to you to staying asleep, so it is best avoided. The afternoon nap should suffice to see you through.

, Do a simple movement, like tapping your feet. If it becomes a habit, it might just save you from falling asleep during those final dire moments and it can keep you awake without being distracting., Avoid a decreasing sense of energy and motivation by setting a constant pace for yourself: For example, try 40 to 55 minutes of work, and taking a 5 to 20 minute break, or perhaps a quick walk around outside in a safe and well lit area., Take a short break to watch a part of a scary movie if you think it will help your productivity. Scary movies can keep one alert, but don't watch if it becomes a distraction; it's enough to watch a little during a 5-20 minute break., Coffee or tea may seem like an ideal solution at the time, but you may get a temporary buzz then crash badly the following day (perhaps halfway through your test or meeting). Try staying hydrated with water instead.Drink two glasses of ice-cold water every 30 minutes. Not only will the cold water help to keep you awake, but you'll need to urinate often, which will keep you alert.
Non-caffeinated herbal tea will also naturally keep you awake due to tea's extensive amount of herbs.

, Foods like sandwiches, cheese, and other dairy products can allow you to feel more alert. Sugary foods may make you feel awake for a little while, but will eventually make you crash and feel drowsy. Apples keep your blood sugar stable so you're able to stay awake longer. Any fruit or healthy food is better than eating sugary foods.Avoid eating a heavy meal the evening of the all-nighter. This will leave you feeling lethargic and sleepy. Eat a light, healthy meal, such as a stir-fry.
Avoid alcohol, as this depressant will make you sleepy.

, You may not enjoy it, but harsh and a arrhythmic music will keep your mind alert. Try to stick to instrumental music, which is less distracting. This will keep you from being lulled to sleep.


If others are sleeping around you, clearly you'll need to keep the level of the music low. Use earphones if necessary.

, There are acupressure points on your ears, and when stimulated, send electrical signals into your brain. Placing pressure on the tip of your ear can relieve pressure in your back and shoulders. Pinching the upper-middle part of the ear can help to relieve pain in your joints. After doing this, you'll feel buzzed and more awake., Distance yourself from your cell phone, the TV, and other electronics. Do not surf the Internet.Download an application that blocks distracting websites, such as SelfControl. You can also turn off your Wifi connection if the Internet is an overall distraction to you. Do not be tempted to turn it back on until you have completed your work.Set your cell phone to Airplane mode so that any incoming messages will be received when you are ready for them.

, Cold air will help to keep you awake, while warm air knocks you out. Think of the nights you can't sleep because of being cold compared to the nights when the cozy warmth of a room causes you to nod off. If you find the cold air is effective in keeping you awake, you can even go to the bathroom and splash your face with cold water.


Not everyone improves their alertness in cold air and feels sleepy in warm air. For some people, it works the other way around. Obviously, choose whatever works for you best.

, Do not set up a workspace on your bed, on a couch, or on the floor. If you work in any other place than a cold, hard table and chair, you will feel very tempted to sleep and the more comfortable the location, the worse you'll feel. If possible, work somewhere far away from your sleeping area or bed, so that it's an effort to go back and sleep. Try to be around some other people, too, so that you do not feel comfortable sleeping in your chair.

, Careful of slumping! When you're tired, slumping your body becomes a natural habit. However, make yourself sit up straight. It increases your state of alertness and helps you to feel better.


Try sitting in different places around the room.
Don't lay in bed with your eyes closed. You will fall asleep, falling into a crazed dream state in which you convince yourself that the work has been done already.

, If you can't even remember what you just read or you're nodding off involuntarily, you need sleep. Sometimes it is better to get three or four hours of sleep and cram what you can in the morning, rather than be in a complete daze the next day."

Be prepared to face hostility.",How to Start a Gay‐Straight Alliance at Your School," Establish a GSA the same way you would any other group or club. Look in your Student Handbook for your school’s rules regarding clubs. Some schools require students to go through a process for establishing a club, this could include writing a constitution or showing student interest.;
, It can be very helpful to have them on your side. They can work as liaisons to teachers, parents, community members and the school board. If an administrator opposes the GSA, provide them information about the Federal Equal Access Act (EAA).

, School groups often require a teacher be involved to oversee things in order for a group to be officially recognized. Find teachers or staff members who you think would be supportive or who have already shown themselves to be an ally around sexual orientation and gender diversity issues. Let them know this is something you are serious about and how important it is to you.


See your school rules for more information about who can be a club advisor.

, With the help of your teacher or staff advisor, write a mission statement which outlines explicitly what your GSA will and will not be. This can make it clear whether the GSA will be a club that will only be a safe space, or whether the club might get involved in activist events.

Make sure it says it is all inclusive and non-discriminatory. Be sure to mention that it is for the purposes of peer education and support.
Outline the type of activities you plan to have, as well as the reason a GSA will be an asset to the school and community as a whole.

, If you can demonstrate that there is a significant enough portion of the student body interested in joining or supportive of a GSA at your school, you run a much better chance of getting the club to start. Work with a diverse range of students who are interested in such a group. You may check with other existing clubs for students who might have an interest.

, You may wish to find a meeting place within the school that offers some level of privacy, yet is still accessible.

, There are many ways to advertise – think about how you’ve seen other clubs advertise. This could be any combination of using your school bulletin, announcements, flyers, or word-of-mouth. Advertising your group and having words up such as “gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, two-spirit and queer” or “homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, cissexism, cisgenderism, heterosexism etc..” can be part of educating the school, and can actually make other students feel safer – even if they never attend a single meeting.


If your flyers are defaced or torn down, do not be discouraged. Plan to have people check on them throughout the day and replace if necessary. Eventually, whoever is tearing them down will give up, or be reprimanded by the school.

, Of course you want to have a good meeting, so plan ahead of time. There are tons of things you can do, from discussions to inviting speakers, workshops to games. Visit Student Pride online for ideas.


Obviously, you can't plan out the details of every single meeting well before they happen, but you'll need to plan out your first meeting, as well as the general ""format"" that your GSA meetings will take.

, You may want to start with a discussion about why people feel the group is needed or important. You can also brainstorm what things your club could do this year.

, Many groups have ground rules in order to ensure that group discussions are safe, confidential and respectful. Many groups have a ground rule that no assumptions or labels are used about a group member’s sexual orientation.

, Develop an action plan. Brainstorm activities. Set goals for what you want to work towards. If you haven’t already done so, contact GLSEN's Student Organizing Department so that you may share ideas, resources and information. You can also look into local GSA Networks in your town or city.

, While it would be nice to believe that students and teachers at your school will be completely supportive of your GSA, this probably won't be the case. You will likely face hostility from the community and from students and parents, and possibly even school staff. But don't let this discourage you. Just remember you are helping hundreds of students have a better understanding, support and change of opinions about being LGBT+, and overall providing a more friendlier environment and community."

Ask your teacher for a class schedule/timetable or make your own, you should also have a little notebook to write notes down to help you with homework.",How to Schedule Classes1," Secondly, a big thing for students is going to the toilet, but try to schedule your toilet stops for lunch breaks. Therefore, you won't miss important details in classes.

Choose fun, interesting classes.,
Consider taking an honors class.,
Make sure you have time for extra-curriculars.,
Take any prerequisites you might need later.",How to Schedule Classes2," The classes you take will not be heavily scrutinized by others. Take classes you know you'll enjoy. In addition, do not choose difficult classes for you.;
, If you are even considering going to college, it is a good idea to take at least one challenging class. Now is the time to make mistakes, and if you get in over your head, dropping the class won't be as big of a deal. Do the best you can and don't worry so much about your grade in the class. Later, when you're deciding what to take in high school, you'll appreciate knowing what to expect in an honors or AP class.

, Do as much as you can in Middle School. You may not have as much time later, and if you have to cut back on extracurriculars, you'll know what you really enjoy, and what you don't mind dropping.

, Though it may be hard to think ahead, some classes require you to take a class before you can take it. For example, if you want to do your school newspaper, you might have to take journalism, photography, or maybe even a business class. Thinking about that now will save you a lot of stress later.

"
"
Take as hard a schedule as you can handle.,
Think about college.",How to Schedule Classes3," Your 8th grade year will greatly influence your 9th grade schedule. You will have more options on what classes you are going to take just by taking 1 or 2 honors classes.

, While college may seem an eternity away, it's really only a few more years. You should start to think about whether you intend to go to college, or if you want to start working right out of high school. If you don't want to go to college, see about any vocational opportunities available for you next year, or even this year if your middle school is big enough. If you intend to go to college, think about programs that might be able to help you. If you come from a low income family or are a member of a minority group, there may be programs at local colleges to help you.

"
"
Decide whether you want to go to college.,
Talk to current students.,
Take prerequisites.,
Avoid dropping classes.",How to Schedule Classes4," If you think you might possibly go to college, take at least one honors class in your strong subject(s). Take as many as you think you can possibly handle.

, People who are still in the school or have recently graduated will know the teachers pretty well. They will also be able to tell you how difficult classes are. Believe it or not, all honors classes are not hard. In fact some of them will be about the same as the regular class, but you'll get a weighted grade for it. An insider's perspective will help you take advantage of those opportunities. Avoid people who graduated more than 2 years ago, however, as curriculums and teachers change fairly quickly. What was hard then might be easy now and vice versa.

, Your options for electives will probably be pretty limited, so take classes that have to be taken before classes you really like. Even if you aren't so excited about taking a class on how to use Microsoft Word, take it anyway if you'll need it later to take a programming elective.

, Dropping classes is often frowned upon by colleges if they find out. Do your research at the beginning of the year so you aren't trying to put in more work than you can handle and if you do find yourself struggling consider getting a tutor rather than dropping the class. Only drop a class as a last resort if you truly cannot cope.

Take the hardest schedule you can.,
Drop classes in the summer.,
Research colleges.,
Avoid study halls.,
Maintain communication with your guidance counselor.,
Schedule your humanities classes for the afternoon.,
Avoid taking classes just because your friends are taking them.,
Alternate difficult classes with easier ones.,
Consider taking an online class.",How to Schedule Classes5," The harder your schedule, the better your chances of getting into college. Don't take a class just to try it and if it's too hard you'll drop it; instead do your research beforehand. Talk to students currently taking the class and ask if you can see an assignment. You might even want to try doing the assignment if you have time to see what the class will be like.

, If you must drop a class, try to do it before school starts. Most schools have faculty members working year round, so if you call or email your guidance office, someone will probably be available to help you. If you drop during the summer, chances are it won't show up on your transcript.

, Once you know what type of school you want to go to, you can schedule accordingly. Check out a couple schools and see what courses you might want to take. College Board has a great search engine where you can compare what you are planning to take with colleges you are considering. You can also line up colleges side by side and compare them (This service is free, but if you want to save your searches, you need to make an account).

, If you don't need a study hall, don't take it. Take another class instead. Study halls won't give you credit, and you'll probably be bored a lot of the time. If you decide to take a study hall and you can choose the order of your classes, request a last period study hall. That way you'll have all of your homework assigned. If you have a morning study hall, you'll be more likely to put off homework until the morning, which has its risks. If you are only taking a study hall to get ahead in class rank, realize that colleges don't put as much stock in your class rank as they do your schedule. They'll be far more impressed if you have an extra AP class, but have a .001 lower GPA than you would have had you taken the study hall.

, Your advisors job is to keep you on track. He/she will be able to help you choose a schedule that's right for you. Even if you think your schedule is bullet-proof, take it to your advisor to look over and discuss. Your counselor probably knows more about the college admissions process than you do, and will have a different perspective to offer you.

, Nobody, your teachers included, wants to sit do AP Chemistry at two in the afternoon after already having dealt with the rest of the day.

, You might not end up in the same class as your friends anyway. Especially if the class is taught by multiple teachers at several different times. Undoubtedly you'll meet new people in your classes and if you don't, you'll have plenty of time to talk to your friends between classes.

, If you are able to choose which class period you have a class, try to give yourself an easy class between hard ones. You'll appreciate the break and be refreshed for the next class.

, Online classes can help you get ahead, but they can also put a strain on an already difficult schedule. If they are available to you, talk to your counselor to see if they might be right for you.

"
"
Take interesting classes.,
Consider a vocational program.",How to Schedule Classes6," College isn't right for everyone. Some people prefer to start working instead. You can enjoy high school best by choosing classes that you think you'll enjoy.

, Some schools offer a vocational program that will allow you to gain valuable work skills. If one is available to you, consider it's benefits.

Always have a pencil to underline important things in the book ( which you can remove later) or a pen and paper to make important notes and diagrams of ideas.Then draw a big star or a house with a happy face or something else.,
Journal Articles.,
If you can't face reading a journal article or a book, try to find a book review, this will be a few paragraphs long and will contain some of the key ideas and a critique of them.,
Read Books.,
Pick a number between 1 and 9.,
If in doubt, always read the introduction to any book and then reward yourself with a little chocolate, or bit of cake, or a cuddle, or a bath or going out or playing a computer game or anything fun that is not wholesome but also not too dangerous and is in moderation.

,
Consider taking one difficult book or two difficult articles and going out for an entire day alone by the sea or other peaceful place, read and break things up with walks, coffees, snacks, etc.

,
If you really don't want to read a book, talk to someone who has and ask them if it is worth reading, talking and socializing are good and will encourage you to maybe look at that book finally.

,
If you are very fed up but have to read, try reading out loud in a range of crazy accents.Try reading Philosophy in the style of Mr. Spock, Anthropology in the style of Inspector Clouseau, Mathematics as Neil from the Young Ones, French in the style of Adolf Hitler, Geography in the style of Emma Peel, History in the style of Bob Dylan.

",How to Read Academic Texts in Fun Ways,";
, If you can't face to read a whole book then try to find a journal article by the same writer on the same subject and read just the opening abstract, any illustrations or tables and the conclusion. Repeat until some ideas sink in. Now, skim through the rest, if using your computer use the ""find"" tool to search for relevant words to your work.Then find a very bad music video like Madonna, Britney, Michael Jackson and do bad sexy dancing to relieve the tension.

, Then make a cup of tea with milk and two sugars with a ""chockie biccie"" ( UK academics find this fun).

, Read the introduction, the conclusion, and use the index to find specific words and always make notes or diagrams for each main idea. Then have a little nap...that doesn't sound like fun so here goes to the next section.

, Go on public transport on a reasonably long journey. If you picked ""7"" , read page 7, then page 17, then page 27, etc..when you arrive at your chosen destination, go for a walk, see a friend or whatever, then get back on your mode of public transport and read p.37, p.47, etc..Continue before bed, and in the morning, and instead of watching TV or checking your emails until you get to the end of the book. By now you will have read 10% of the book in little chunks and will have a good idea of what it contains. Now you can go to p.8, 18, or go back to the chapters that interested you and read them fully.

Pick the tape of your choice.,
Replace scissors with a refillable tape dispenser.,
Gather the other material to be used.,
Tape the ribbons.,
Stick glitter.,
Use thicker tapes for bigger designs.,
Tape the paper cutouts.,
Highlight the title of your project.,
Make a customized nameplate.",How to Replace Glue with Tape," There are a variety of tapes available depending upon usage. You can choose from a wide variety.


Glossy transparent tape or matte finished ""invisible"" tape with width ranging from 1cm to 5cm.
Double sided, double stick tape, sticky on both sides transparent tape.
Colorful tapes available in any color of your choice. You can use these to make a beautiful border on your project or chart paper.
Fabric tapes with various prints like cartoon figures, flowers, superheroes on them etc. You can use these tapes to hold images together by generously taping the images from either all four sides or just the corners.;
, You can get these tape boxes with a pre-attached blade on them. All you have to do is open it and place the tape in it with a little tape pulled out till its blade. To use it, all you have to do is pull as much tape as you need and press it against the blade carefully.


To avoid any cuts to your fingers while cutting the tape, you must make sure your fingers are away from the blade and only the tape swipes through the blade.
This tape dispenser also allows you for greater control and creativity as you can fasten or hold your decorative material on paper with one hand and ready the tape with another hand.

, Assemble everything you need to make your school or work project. You can fix the base material or a chart paper if that is the main surface to add all the other material on and fix it on a sturdy table.

, Place the ribbon of your choice on paper, pull a small portion of the tape to hold the ribbon in place. Once the ribbon is in place you can cut longer strips of tape to cover the entire surface of the ribbon.


Remember to cover the ribbon with the tape which if you don't, the in between gaps may get tangled with something and eventually rip the ribbon off.

, To stick glitter (or powdered color) on surface, all you have to do is place the glitter on the surface in any pattern of your choice. You can use a stencil to form beautiful shapes..


To place the tape without distorting the glitter, all you have to do is placing a bigger tape than the size of the design and stick it on the design starting from one end to another.
While sticking glitter, you must be careful of two things -

To use the glitter only as much as needed and not as much to make a lump.
After taping it, press the corner or the ends slightly to remove air gaps inside the tape.



, To avoid using more layers of tapes on a single item, you can opt for the broader tapes and stick the object in one go.


Do not fret if the tape creases in between as it won't show very clearly. In case of bigger portions of tapes being stuck elsewhere, you can either cut it off or conceal it with a design on it and then taping that as well. Using tapes leaves you with many possibilities to cover errors creatively.

, Place the cutout in the desired place. You can either tape on it directly without fixing it temporarily with a small tape underneath the cutout or after fixing it in place for your ease.


If the cutout is bigger than the tape, you can use two or more strips of tape. Remember, it won't look messy because it leaves a transparent and shiny look while rendering your work water proof.

, You can highlight a key point, a heading and the title of your project by writing on another colorful sheet and taping it aesthetically on your project.

, Make your project or assignment stand out with a customized nameplate instead of a regular label.


Place a cutout of any color o material of your choice and tape it on all ends. You can use this method to write your name on your school supplies or stationary if you tend to lose them often.
You can write on the tape with a permanent marker.
You can also beautifully write your details on a colorful cutout and stick it to add two layers to the nameplate.

Contact your teacher, to see why the unfair mark was given.,
Talk to your teacher about any concerns.,
Make no excuses (ever) when pointing it out to neither your teacher, nor yourself.,
Expect the imperfections.,
Clarify your points well.,
Settle on a better solution with the teacher.,
Relax and keep your cool.",How to React to an Unfair Mark," Before submitting your work always refer to your rubric or guidelines for the project and make sure you included all the points in your project.;
,,, When you first see a bad mark or an unexpected mark, don't let your emotions get the best of you. Try not to show that you are disappointing until you read the teacher's notes. Most teachers provide an explanation on what you may have missed out on. If you think your mark is still unfair, keep reading.

, Never just accept a mark you think you don't deserve. Stand up for yourself and confront the teacher about any mistakes. Have a good reason for your argument, such as:


""Teacher, I put in a lot of time, and I think you should review this specific part of my project.""






""I think you may have skimmed over this part too fast.""






""I am very sure I met all the requirements on this part, can you clarify?""






""Can you please review the project with me so I can improve next time?""







, Never present yourself with a lame excuse like "" I spent so much time, like, give me a better mark!""

, Teachers aren't perfect and they may have made the mistake. Don't be upset if they did, show them your appreciation for fixing the mistake.

, If the teacher still didn't quite give you the explanation you were looking for, ask other students how they did on the paper/project and compare. When you go to the teacher it is best not to mention names, this may be considered rude. Try not to sound superior to others by saying ""But everyone else sucked and they got better than me"" Always be professional when reasoning, not arguing!

, If the teacher still is not being fair, it is a good time to contact your parents. This would not be considered taking it too far if there will be a significant drop in your mark. Your parents may be able to communicate to your teacher more effectively. It will also make your teacher realize that you take your work seriously.

, Even if your teacher continues being stubborn, leave it at that and keep trying your best on every other assignment. Do not give your teacher attitude or dirty looks about it, just continue to be polite. There will probably be more assignments to make up for your bad mark.

Keep looking at the clock in the room so you don't lose track of time and end up being surprised by the alarm if you know ahead of time.,
When the fire alarm sounds, stand up and push your chair in.,
As for belongings, leave them or in some situations take what you're already holding with you and keep moving.,

Attend meetings of your school board.,
If you (or anyone in your group) is over 18, then consider RUNNING for positions on the school board.,
Write a letter to the principal or school board (if the problem or concern is wider than just your school).,
Wear your protest.,
Circulate a petition.,
Call on a board member at his/her office (make an appointment).",How to Protest in School," Most states have laws requiring agendas for public meetings be posted prior to meetings. You can ensure that you and your classmates are present when issues important to you are considered.


Most meetings have time set aside for the public to speak. DO SO. (You may have to put your name on a sign in sheet.)
If the issue can have an economic impact, on the district or the students, discuss how supporting such a measure can save money or is worth the money. For example, uniform dress codes were supposed to lower the cost of clothing for school. Discuss how, in actuality, stores are charging more for the same items because the items are ""uniforms"" for school.
Talk about how the benefits of current policy either do not exist or are non-existent. Example: The school cafeteria has a light that turns red when the noise becomes too loud, which is supposed to deter loud talking. Instead, students are louder because they are afraid they will not be able to complete their statements before being compelled (by the light) to be quiet.
Try to get teachers on your side, adding their voices to the students. It will add legitimacy to your statements.
Show how what you are protesting, harms people. Example: The dress code requires dark blue pants. (Bring the pants to the meeting). For example: tell about how someone's younger brother got hand-me-down pants that were a little bit faded (not bleached) and got in trouble (or a warning) for that.;
, School Board elections generally have small turnouts. The school board may reconsider its position if it knew the graduating class had candidates for all the positions and/or the class would turn out fully to vote.

, If the letter is about what could be a political issue, send a copy to the local newspaper (Make sure you indicate in your letter that a copy was sent.). Have someone proofread the letter first.


Letters sent to the paper should be about ""issues,"" not about events or activities. For instance, you should write explaining about your opposition to the dress code. You should not write about Joe's getting in trouble... because of the dress code.

, Don't break the dress code. Wear something that expresses your discontent. This can include a shirt that says, ""Students against the dress code!"" or whatever message you are trying to convey.


Don't use profanity or poor taste. Don't make any references to drugs or anything clearly illegal. Don't make threats, just simple promises.
Don't do anything that disrupts class or the campus.
Carry information with you which verifies your right to protest. See the link in the sources section.

, Have as many of your classmates sign it as possible.

, Make sure you bring other student leaders who support your position. You can see one member at a time. More than one or two members of the board in a private meeting may infringe a law against unscheduled or non-public meetings of the board.

Figure out what type of book you like.,
Before picking out your book, look back onto the list of books you may have made earlier.,
Go pick out your book.,
Once you pick your book, make sure it is exactly what your teacher asked for.,
Start the book in a comfortable, well lit area.,
If you truly despise the book, find another!,
When writing your report, have fun with it.,
Turn your report in to the teacher and give him/ her a big smile!

",How to Read a Book for School and Enjoy It," Think back to the books you have enjoyed. Make a list of the books you've loved. What genre, and author was that book from? Was it written in the first, second or third person? Focus on what made you enjoy these book.;
, What were the books about? Were they about trains, orphans, adventuring unicorns, futuristic automobiles, etc? How long were they? Do you prefer long, medium, or short books?

, First find the specific genre, and then look for your favorite author. If he/ she wrote a book of that genre, read the back, and the first chapter. Does it catch your attention? If your favorite author didn't publish in this genre, or that book doesn't seem interesting, browse through the books. Read the first chapter, look for catchy titles, etc. Have fun with it.

, If the book had 50 pages, and your teacher asked for more than 100 pages, you need a different book. You could still read the book, but you won't be able to use it for your report.

, Chances are you won't enjoy the book if you are uncomfortable or squinting to read it. Also, make sure you give the book a chance. Make sure you at least read the first 5-10 chapters before deciding you hate the book.

, Just make sure you'll have time to finish it and write your report.

, Picture others reading your report, and try to get the imaginary reader wanting to read your book. Try to put in words how much you enjoyed the book.

Turn your cell phone completely off.,
Keep your cell phone in a cell phone case.,
Consider putting your cell phone in your locker.,
Tell your friends ahead of time not to call or text you during school.,
Change your settings on your phone, so that if someone does call or text you, it will not make noise.,
You could ask your parent to have a word with the principal.,
If you keep your phone in your back pocket lock the keypad.,
If all else fails, check your messages after school.

",How to Prevent Having Your Cell Phone Go off During School," You may not want to do this, if you plan to use your cell phone during school. If this is the case, then keep your phone on vibrate.


Turn the vibration off as well.;
, This is because your cell phone turns on when certain buttons are pressed, and you want to avoid having those buttons pressed. Keeping your cell phone in your bag is a bad idea if it doesn't have a cover because your bag will move around, and so will your cell phone. Then, those buttons may be pressed, and your phone could turn on. So make sure your cell phone has a cell phone case.

, Again, you may not want to do this if you want to use your cell phone during class, but it's worth consideration because if it does go off, it will be in your locker, and the chances of somebody being right next to your locker when your phone goes off are very slim.

, Skip this step if you plan to text your friends during school. This will decrease your chances of your phone going off.

, You can do this in your phones settings. Consider reading the manual if you are confused.

, Surely he would allow your phone after a conversation with your parent.

, That way you will prevent butt dialing, which is accidentally pressing numbers with your butt and could cause you to call or text someone.

, If you're playing the guitar alone, try teaming up with a drummer or bassist, as this will make your part sound better. Any instrument sounds rubbish on its own. And if you get on well, you could even start a band.

Answer questions posed by your teacher.,
Answer questions posed by other students.,
Ask questions.,
Give your opinion.,
Find a balance.",How to Participate in Class," Make a point to introduce yourself to your teacher before class starts. This is a great way to make a good impression. Introducing yourself is especially important if you are in a large class, such as a lecture with hundreds of other students, as your teacher may never even learn your name otherwise. It shows your teacher that you care about the class and are willing to put in effort.If you are in a high school class, see your teacher outside of class hours. Meet to discuss any issues or challenges you are having, or simply to discuss something in particular that piqued your interest. If you are in a college course, visit your teacher during their office hours. Ask questions, raise concerns, or bring work that is in progress to get your teacher’s feedback.;
, This is one of the most important steps. You will not be prepared to speak in class if you have not done the assignments beforehand. Many teachers will use the assigned reading as the basis for the next day’s discussion, so be sure to stay on top of all reading and assignments., While doing your homework, make note of anything that confuses or intrigues you. Write down questions or comments in your notebook for the next class session. Consider what you are learning in the context of the entire unit and year.If you are learning about military strategies in WWII, relate it to WWI strategies that you learned about earlier in the year. You could say “it’s interesting that the machine gun was developed during WWI but it really helped turn the tide during WWII.”
Relate what you have read to real-world issues or decisions. You could ask “did you know that after Melville’s White Jacket was published Congress banned flogging in the Navy?”

, Some teachers, especially in more objective subjects and classes, will simply ask for answers. Others will ask for opinions or interpretations, and some will do both.


If you know that your teacher generally asks questions from the lecture notes from the day before, take good notes. If your teacher asks for opinions, think about where you stand in relation to the issues you have read or learned about. Do you agree or disagree, and why?

, Make sure your basic needs have been met before class starts. If you haven’t eaten anything in hours, your hunger will likely be a distraction. Make sure you are dressed appropriately and have eaten and used the restroom before class. Bring a water bottle or other beverage and wear layers in case you become uncomfortable.

, Try not to daydream or stare out the windows. Don’t let your neighbors be a distraction, either. Refrain from looking at your phone or texting while in class. If you use a computer, be sure to stay on task; don’t use the time to surf the web or check your social media. , Give the class and teacher your honest, undivided attention. Look at the teacher, or student, who is speaking. Make eye contact and nod when you agree or understand what is being said.

, If you’re a bundle of nerves, you may find it hard to speak up. Take a few deep breaths before you raise your hand to speak. Remind yourself that you are prepared and that you have something important to say or ask. Sure, all eyes may be on you, but only for a minute or two. More likely than not, other students will think you are brave and smart for participating.

, When you have something to say, speak as clearly and concisely as possible. Don’t mumble or look at the floor while you are talking. Address the teacher (or student) directly. Don’t be cocky or condescending, just be confident.

, Don’t be afraid to give an incorrect answer or an unpopular opinion. Your teacher will likely approve of the effort you are putting in, even if what you say is not exactly what they were looking for., You may be able to explain the concept in a different way than your teacher, which could be helpful to other students. This will also show the teacher that you're paying attention, which they will appreciate., If something is confusing to you, ask about it. This pertains to questions you may have written down while doing your homework as well as to material that is new to that day’s class. It is likely that other students are wondering the same thing you are, and the teacher will be glad to take a few minutes to clarify an issue., Don’t be afraid to respectfully disagree with a student, the author of what you’ve read, or even your teacher. Don’t insult anyone, even in a debate, but don’t feel like to have to agree with everyone either.


If you disagree, say something along the lines of “I can see why you feel that way, but in my opinion…” or “from my point of view…”

, Don’t try to answer every question or give an opinion on every topic. At the same time, don’t think that answering one question the entire semester or year is going to cut it. Aim to speak up once or twice per class session. However, don’t just speak to speak. Make sure you have something relevant to say.

Determine whether the speech is protected.,
Quantify potential disruptions.,
Identify who is involved in the speech or activity.,
Understand constitutionally valid restrictions.,
Write down the details.,
Identify the context of the speech or activity.,
Talk to witnesses.,
Meet with school officials.,
Read your school's rules.,
Identify your goals.,
Talk to a trusted adult.",How to Prove Your School Violated Your First Amendment Rights," While the First Amendment does prohibit government actors from making any law abridging freedom of speech, the Supreme Court has determined that some forms of speech can be prohibited or restricted in certain contexts.For example, obscene speech is not protected by the First Amendment at all. What is categorized as obscene may depend on the intended audience, because the Supreme Court has recognized that some material may be available to adults that should be forbidden to minors.
Other types of speech also remain unprotected by the First Amendment, either in or out of school, including true threats as well as untrue statements (which can be suppressed under libel and slander laws).
School-sponsored events such as athletic contests or school ceremonies, as well as school-sponsored publications such as the student newspaper, are not considered open public forums.
However, permissible restrictions tend to relate to how the statement is made rather than what is said. For example, in one case the Supreme Court ruled a high school did not violate a student's First Amendment rights when they suspended him for delivering a student government campaign speech laced with sexual innuendo at a school assembly.
Generally, schools can prohibit speech which is vulgar, sexually explicit, or condones illegal activity.
The subject matter of your speech or expression may determine the degree of protection it has under the First Amendment. Political speech typically enjoys the strongest protection, while other types of speech may be limited or restricted.;
, School officials have a valid interest in restricting freedom of speech or assembly if necessary to maintain a peaceful environment conducive to learning, meaning your speech may be restricted if it would cause a substantial disruption.The case that established this rule involved students who wore black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War. This type of speech is known as symbolic speech, and is protected by the First Amendment. 
While other students in the class may have noticed or commented on the black armbands initially, this symbolic protest generally wouldn't have caused a significant disruption in the classroom.
This classification generally relates to the way in which the expression is delivered or shared, rather than what is said. Outside of school, the government can restrict the time and place of expression protected by the First Amendment – for example, by use of noise ordinances in certain areas, or by requiring a permit to stage a protest on public property.
School officials have similar rights to restrict speech by students that otherwise enjoys constitutional protection, if that speech would cause a substantial disruption to the school's educational activities.
For example, if you have leaflets that you want to hand out to your fellow students, your school may permit you to hand them out in the hallways, but not during class.

, Since the First Amendment prohibits government actors from ""establishing"" a government religion, or promoting or advocating the practice of a particular faith, teachers and school officials generally cannot be involved in student religious groups.Prayer is not outlawed in schools. However, the school cannot promote religion or encourage students to pray or to encourage students to believe in a certain way.
This means that schools can't begin the day with a prayer led by teachers or school administrators.
Prayers also cannot be led by a student if that student's prayer takes place in the classroom or at a school-sponsored event or function such as a graduation ceremony or an athletic contest.
However, if a group of students wants to start a religious club or group at the school, the school must permit that group if the school allows other extra-curricular student groups.
The same applies to LGBTQ student groups or student groups devoted to social or political issues. If the school allows student groups such as Future Farmers of America or Young Republicans, it also must allow a student ACLU chapter, gay rights group, or Christian group if there is demonstrated student interest for such a group.
These groups may have faculty advisors to keep group meetings on task and coordinate group activities, but the faculty advisor cannot be involved in the group's recruiting efforts, and participation in the group can't affect any student's academic standing.
For example, a faculty advisor could not give extra credit in her English class to students who attended a rally or protest.

, Even if your speech or activity is protected by the First Amendment, some restrictions remain permissible in the school setting because of the purpose of school and the age of students.Your First Amendment rights relate not just to your speech, but to the speech available to you – such as on the internet or in books available in the library.
Schools have the right to ban books or content that serves no educational purpose. However, your school cannot ban a book just because administrative officials disagree with the ideas or beliefs expressed in the book.
Schools also have the right to put filters on school computers and have computer use policies that forbid objectionable content. However, sometimes the filters block content that the First Amendment protects your right to access, such as websites about sexual health or gender identity.
If you bring this matter up with librarians or school officials, they should have the ability to ""white list"" these types of websites so students can access them. If they refuse to do so, you may have an argument that the school is violating your First Amendment rights.

, If you believe your school has violated your First Amendment rights, write down an account of the incident that occurred, including as many specific facts as you can. You want to make a record as soon as possible after the incident occurs while the details are still fresh in your mind.Include information about when and where the incident took place, and what you were told by the school officials who suppressed your speech or activity.
For example, if you work for the school newspaper and your school refused to allow you to publish a student editorial on abortion, write down the exact circumstances in which you were told the editorial would not be published and why.
Make note of the name and job title of any school official who communicated the school's decision to you.
Keep a written copy of the speech that was suppressed. If you end up filing a lawsuit, the court will need to know exactly what was said so it can evaluate the school's decision.
If the First Amendment violation relates to your freedom of religion or right to assembly, include as many details as possible about the people involved in the activity and the permission you sought from the school.
You also might want to make note of other groups who were granted similar permissions, to show that the school's actions were related to the subject matter of your speech or activity and not the act itself.
For example, suppose you've started an LGBTQ student group and asked the school for permission to hold meetings in the cafeteria after school once a week. The school refused to allow you to hold your meetings there, despite the fact that it allows other groups to hold meetings in the cafeteria after school.
The fact that the school permits some groups to meet on school property, but not yours, may be evidence that the school is violating your First Amendment right to assemble.

, Schools have greater power to restrict school-sponsored or school-supported activities or events than they do speech or activities conducted by students independently.If your speech or activity is suppressed by your school, consider offering an alternative. For example, if the school says it would be too disruptive for you to hand out pro-choice flyers in class, ask if you can distribute them in the hallways between classes.
Suppose your school also refuses to allow you to distribute your flyers in the hallways between classes, saying it would disrupt the flow of traffic and cause students to be late to class. You might then propose handing out the flyers at lunch.
Ultimately, your goal is to find the appropriate context in which the school no longer has a constitutionally valid reason to restrict your speech or activity. If the school continues to refuse to allow it, this shows the school is attempting to suppress constitutionally-protected speech or action in violation of your First Amendment rights.

, Get statements from anyone who was present when the particular incident occurred, or from any other students involved in the speech or activity your school is trying to suppress.Other students who support your speech or activity can be great witnesses for your cause. One of the purposes of the First Amendment is to encourage an engaged and informed electorate, so the more students you can show who are interested in your cause, the better.
Statements from students also can put pressure on school officials to change course and allow the speech or activity. You also might think about getting parents involved.
Friendly teachers and administrators can give you good inside information on things said by the officials who are restricting your speech or activity. These statements can give you a better understanding of the school's motivations.

, Once you have all the information you need regarding the facts, talk to school officials about your goals and motivations. An open dialogue can help you understand their reasons for suppressing the speech or activity.If school officials present a valid educational reason for restricting your speech or activity, try to find a way around it. Typically there will be an alternative that doesn't invoke the same concern.
For example, schools are allowed to prohibit vulgar speech or curse words in school – and this applies to both spoken and written words. The school can punish you for that vulgarity regardless of the legitimate social or political point of your message.
However, if the school still refuses to allow your speech even after you've ""cleaned it up,"" removing any vulgar words, phrases, or innuendo, the school is violating your First Amendment rights.
Be wary of school officials who dig in their heels and tell you there's no possible way that the things you want to say or do will take place on your school's campus. If this happens, taking legal action may be the only thing you can do to protect your rights.

, A copy of your most recent school handbook provides information about your school's rules, policies, and procedures regarding student speech and expression. If you don't have your own copy, you typically can get one from a school administrative official.Many schools also have the school handbook available on their websites to read or download.
The school handbook includes guidelines in a number of areas that potentially implicate your First Amendment rights, including your school's dress code, the distribution of flyers or leaflets on campus, and how to establish student groups.
If there is a rule or procedure that violates students' First Amendment rights, make note of it. You may want to speak with a school official to find out how the rule or procedure is applied in practice, and whether students' First Amendment rights are taken into consideration.

, Before you take legal or other action, you must determine what it is you want to accomplish through your actions and what types of changes you want to see happen at your school.You must decide whether you want to make a change that would only affect your particular case, or motivate a broader change to school policies to protect the First Amendment rights of present and future students at your school.
Your goals may determine the steps you take. For example, if you have been disciplined for your speech or expression in a way that violates your First Amendment rights, you may only be concerned with defending yourself against a suspension.
In cases related to school discipline, there are specific deadlines that you must meet or you will lose your right to challenge the school's decision.
In contrast, if you're trying to change a school policy, you may have a little more time to act. Although you probably want the matter resolved as quickly as possible, you can take the time necessary to build support for your case and collect documents and evidence.

, As a minor, you are limited in many of the things you can do without having an adult on your side. You also typically cannot file a lawsuit, if it comes to that, without the support or assistance of your parent or legal guardian.A teacher or guidance counselor who is supportive and sympathetic to your cause may be able to help you better understand and navigate the school administrative system.
You also can contact a nonprofit organization near you, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, that fights for free speech or religious freedom.
Depending on the subject matter of the speech or activity your school is suppressing, you also may be able to get help from an organization focused in that area.
For example, if your school is refusing to allow a student LGBTQ group on campus, a local gay rights organization may be able to assist you.
Civil rights attorneys can help you decide whether it is appropriate to file a lawsuit against your school. Some may be willing to meet with you directly, while others will want to speak with your parent or legal guardian first.

, This will ensure that the color will stay on for as long as possible, and it also stops your nails from fading due to stains being left behind by dark shades of nail polish. Wait a few minutes for the base coat to dry.

, Make sure you don't get any nail polish on the skin around your nail. If that does happen, immediately wipe it with a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover. Once you've painted your nails, wait for them to dry.


It's suggested that you paint the nails of one hand and wait for them to dry before continuing onto the other hand.






If you are inexperienced and don't feel comfortable painting your own nails, ask for the assistance of a friend or relative who is familiar with painting nails. If you're kind to them, they'll be delighted to help you.

,, Although it's uncommon, it only means that you care for your nails and you aren't afraid to show it. People may look up to you for this.

, While you may feel a little uncertain and insecure, know that if you're happy with your choice it will show. You may receive some stares for a while, but people will eventually get used to it and perhaps even admire your nails.


Just because it's common for girls to paint their nails doesn't mean boys can't paint their nails either. Painting your nails shows your personality, not how girly or manly you are.







, Refrain from using violence or crude insults to put them down because they'll only bully you even more. If you have confidence in yourself even though you may feel like you have none, you'll gradually gain it and rise above those bullies.


If the situation grows worse, tell a teacher or a trusted adult and ask them for advice. They'll help you stop the bullies. Until the problem is solved, do not stop painting your nails just because of what someone says.






While they might not admit it, there are boys that may envy you because of your courage and confidence to paint your nails. Remember that there might be boys in your class that secretly want to paint their nails!

Look at the location.,
Look at after-school activities.,
Consider sports.,
Find out about rules.,
Look at enrollment fees.,
Talk to your child about it.",How to Pick an Elementary School," Location matters dramatically when it comes to picking schools. These are questions you should ask:


Is it safe to walk there?
Would my child have to ride a bus?
Would I be able to get there quickly if there is an emergency?;
, If there several opportunities, like choir and band, then it is a good option. If there is nothing after school, then you may want to reconsider.

, Questions like the ones below are good to ask when thinking about schools:


Does this school have good sports that my kid likes or would like to be in?
Does it have a good high school or older programs he/she can look forward to?

, Is there is something like vaccinations or dress code that you can't afford, don't agree with, or don't have? If so then you cannot go to this school.

, If the price that you must pay for book fees and lunches may be too much for your price range, some schools offer reduced or free lunches.

, If they aren't comfortable with joining that particular school, then don't force them, but do try to persuade them.

Ask questions before you begin.,
Take your time.,
Write in the margins.,
Summarize what you have read.,
Tell someone about the reading.",How to Pass English1," Asking yourself some pre-reading questions can make it easier for you to retain what you read. Before you start reading a text, determine what you need to discover from the text.


Some instructors will provide students with a list of questions to help them stay focused as they read. You might ask your instructor about good questions to keep in mind as you read.
You can also develop your own questions. For example, you might simply ask, what is the focus of this chapter?;
, Give yourself plenty of time to read and take breaks as needed. It is better to go slowly when you read a text than to rush through it and have to re-read it later on.Make sure that you provide yourself with plenty of time to read and understand what you read.


For example, if you have to read 40 pages of a book by Friday, start reading on Monday and just read 10 pages per night. Don't put off reading until Thursday night.

, Making notes in the margins whenever you encounter something important is more effective than highlighting or underlining the passage. Try reading with a pen in your hands instead of holding a highlighter.You can write key words in the margins, ask questions, or comment on something that just happened.

, Writing summaries of what you just read can help you to commit the information to memory as well. After you finish reading a chapter of a book or a short story, take a minute to write a brief summary of what you just read.In your summary, don’t worry about including every little detail. Instead, try to provide a nice overview of the action.
You also might want to include a paragraph where you discuss your ideas about the reading. For example, if something surprising happened in the chapter, you might talk about how you reacted to it and why.
Summaries are also a good place to record information about symbols, themes, and characters. For example, you might note that the author uses nature symbolism to describe certain characters.

, Teaching someone else about the text that you have been reading is a great way to commit the information to memory as well. Try telling a classmate or friend about the chapter you just read.When you tell someone about the reading, try to summarize the main ideas and explain anything that might be difficult to understand if you have not read the book.
Make sure that you explain the reading in your own words. Don't just repeat parts of what you read word-for-word.

Take time to prewrite.,
Research your topic.,
Create an outline.,
Draft your essay.,
Revise your work.",How to Pass English2," Prewriting (also known as invention) is what you do to generate ideas before you actually write a paper. While it may be tempting to skip prewriting and just start drafting your essay for English class, it is worth taking the time to prewrite. By spending time developing your ideas before you write, you can improve the quality of your work.


Freewriting. This is when you write as much as you can without stopping. Even if your mind is blank, you should write “My mind is blank,” until you get an idea to write about. After you finish writing, read over your freewrite and identify any important ideas that might be useful for your paper.
Listing. This is when you create a list of all of everything you can think of that is relevant to the essay topic. When you have listed as much as you can, read over your list and identify any useful information.
Clustering. This is when you use lines and circles to connect your ideas on a piece of paper. For example, you can begin by writing your topic at the center of the page and then draw lines coming from this idea. Keep drawing more lines and making connections until you are out of ideas., Some English papers will require you to conduct research before you write. If you have to write a research paper, then make sure that you spend some time finding quality sources and reading them carefully.


Search your library’s databases rather than just doing a basic internet search. You will be more likely to find quality sources by using your library’s database. Check with a librarian if you are not sure how to use your library’s databases.

, An outline provides the basic structure for an essay. Outlines can be as detailed as you want and this can be a great way to keep yourself focused when you start drafting your paper.Outlining your essay before you get started can help you write a better paper as well.

, Drafting is when you take your notes, outline, and all of the ideas in your head and put them onto paper in essay form. If you have done adequate freewriting, research, and outlining, then this step should not be too difficult.


Keep in mind that if you struggle with the drafting phase of the writing process, then you can always return to one of the previous phases and come back to the drafting phase when you feel ready.
Remember to use your outline to guide you as you write.

, Revising is when you go over a piece of writing before you submit it to determine if you need to add, delete, reorganize, or clarify something. Revising your work can help you to develop your ideas and catch minor mistakes as well. Make sure that you allow yourself plenty of time to read over your work and revise it as needed.


Having a few days to revise is ideal, but if you can only spare a few hours then that is fine as well.
All essays benefit from revision, so do not consider this as an optional step.
You can always swap papers with a friend a provide feedback for each other. Just make sure that the friend is someone who you trust to provide good feedback. You might also consider asking your instructor or a writing center tutor to look over your paper for you.
Try to give yourself a break before you revise. Even taking a few hours away from the paper will allow you to return to it with fresh eyes.

Make flashcards.,
Read for fun.,
Use new words in conversation and in writing.,
Consider getting a tutor.",How to Pass English3," If you need to master certain vocabulary words for a test, then making flashcards is a great way to commit these words to memory. To make flashcard, write the word on one side of an index card and then write the definition of the word on the other side.


You might also find it helpful to provide yourself with an example of how to use the word in a sentence.
Keep the flashcards with you and study them whenever you have a few spare minutes. For example, you can study your flashcards while waiting in line or riding the bus., Reading is an excellent way to improve your vocabulary and grammar skills.Try to discover a book or series of books that you enjoy and read during your spare time.


Read as much as possible and choose books that are slightly challenging for you.
Look up words that you do not understand when you are reading. Make sure to make a note of the word’s definition as well.

, Using new words will help you to remember them and figure out how to use them. Try to use the new words that you learn as often as you can.


For example, you might try out a new word in a conversation with a friend or include a few of the new words that you have learned in an English essay. Keeping a journal where you try out new words is another great option., If you struggle with English sometimes, then getting a tutor from the writing center at your school may help you to develop your skills.A tutor can work with you on any areas that give you trouble, such as grammar, vocabulary, or reading.


Most schools provide tutor services to students as a free benefit. Your fees and tuition help to cover the costs of providing these services.

Learn what is expected of you.,
Plan ahead.,
Find a study partner or group.",How to Pass English4," When the semester begins, read over the course materials and make sure that you understand everything that is expected of you. If you do not understand something, then ask the instructor to explain it to you.


Highlight important details in your assignment sheets and other course materials. For example, you might want to highlight key words for assignments such as “describe,” “argue” “compare,” etc.Copy down all of the important due dates for your English class in your planner or on a wall calendar to make it easier for you to remember them.

, Figure out how much time you will need to complete your assignments, read books and essays, and study for tests. Make sure that you set aside plenty of time to complete these objectives every week. Procrastinating is a sure way to fail your English class.


If possible, start your assignments at least a week before they are due. Having plenty of time is especially important for writing essays. Starting early will provide you with more time to develop and revise your work.Keep in mind that in college level English courses the majority of your grade will come from assignments that are later in the semester. For this reason, make sure that you do not burn yourself out early in the semester. Take good care of yourself and reserve plenty of energy to finish the semester., Studying with a classmate or a couple of classmates can improve your grades and make it easier for you to pass your English class. Plan to meet at least once per week to study and quiz each other.


Try to team up with classmates who are good students. Studying with someone who is a good student will make it easier for you to excel in English class than studying with someone who is struggling.If you plan to study with a friend or group of friends, it can be easy to get distracted talking about other things. To prevent this from happening, try studying at the library. The quiet environment should make it easier for you and your study group to stay focused."

Come to class.,
Take notes in class.,
Speak up.,
Meet with your instructor outside of class.,
Go above and beyond.",How to Pass English5," Attendance is essential for passing any class, but it may be even more important in an English class where participation may make up a large part of your grade. Make sure that you are present in body and mind whenever you attend your English class.


Never sleep in class.
Silence your cell phone and always keep it stowed away during class.
Avoid chatting with your classmates, especially when your instructor is talking.

, Much of what your English instructor talks about during lectures will end up on your tests and exams for the course. This information can also be helpful when you are writing papers. Make sure that you take good notes during class to earn as many points as possible on your English class assignments.Write as much as you can during class to help you retain the information. Things that your instructor writes on the board or includes on a PowerPoint may be even more important to remember, so be sure to write these things down.
If you have trouble keeping up, then you may consider recording lectures (with your instructor’s permission) or asking a friend to compare notes with you after class.

, If your instructor ever says something that does not make sense or that you’d like to know more about, make sure that you speak up. Raise your hand and ask your instructor to repeat, explain, or expand on what he or she just said.


Keep in mind that most instructors are happy to elaborate on a point if it will help you to understand it. Just make sure that you are listening closely because an instructor may find it annoying if you are always asking him or her to repeat things that have already been explained.

, Your instructor probably has regular office hours where you can drop in or make an appointment to meet with him or her one-on-one. Make sure that you take advantage of this valuable resource.Meeting with your instructor outside of class is a great way to get some extra help with assignments, ask questions that you didn’t want to ask in class, or just get more information about something.
Try to meet with your English instructor at least once per semester.

, If you really want to excel in your English class, then look for ways to go above and beyond your instructor’s expectations. If your instructor ever says that something is a good idea, but that it is optional, do it anyways. These extra assignments can help you to increase your knowledge and that may improve your grade. Some instructors even offer extra credit for completing optional assignments.For example, if you are assigned a short story and your instructor says it might be a good idea to get a little background on the story’s reception after you read it, then do it! If your instructor recommends flashcards as a good option for improving your vocabulary, then make some flashcards!

Study in short sessions.,
Attend any review sessions that are offered.,
Take a practice test.,
Get a good night’s sleep before the test.",How to Pass English6," Rather than staying up all night for one big cram session the night before a test, try studying in small sessions over the course of a week. Studying in smaller sessions will make it easier for you to retain the information that you take in and it will be less stressful for you as well.For example, if you have a test on Friday and you expect that you will need to study for about six hours to get a passing grade on the test, then break your study sessions into three two hours sessions over the course of the week.
Make sure that you take a short break every 45 minutes as well. Most people can’t concentrate for more than 45 minutes at a time, so taking a short break (about 5 to 10 mins) will help you to reset and stay focused., Some instructors offer review sessions before an exam to go over the material that will be on the test. Make sure that you attend these sessions whenever they are offered.


It can be tempting to skip review classes, since it is a review of old material, but you will increase your chances of passing English if you attend.

, Before you take the actual test, taking a practice test may be beneficial. Try asking your instructor for some practice test questions to help you prepare or come up with some practice questions of your own. You can create a practice test based on your knowledge of what will be on the test.When you take the practice test, make sure that you simulate an actual test environment. Put away your notes, books, etc. and time yourself. Check your answers when you are done and use your results to help you figure out what you need to spend more time studying.

, Being well-rested is one of the best ways to ensure that you will be able to focus on a test. Make sure that you go to bed a bit earlier than usual the night before your English test.


For example, if your usual bedtime is 11pm, try going to bed at 10pm instead.

Start the plan.,
Join Bridge Courses.,
Buy Study Materials.,
Join a good college.,
Keep it up.,
Do well in exams.",How to Pass the 11th and 12th Grade in Nepal," In Nepal, after completing the 10th grade (SLC level) you’re allowed to join the 11th and 12th grade. So all you have to do is pass the SLC examination by the end of grade 10. It’ll be much helpful to you if you pass the examination with a distinction (80% or above). The SLC exam is pretty easy if you know the basics of grade 10.;
, After the SLC exam you’ll probably be given 3 months off. In this time, most of the students just pass their time doing nothing. You can join a bridge course where you’ll learn all the basic concepts which you’ll later have to learn in the 11th grade. It is also a good place to make new friends too. There are tons of Bridge Course Institutions in Nepal because of which you’ll have a hard time to find the perfect institution for you. For this you can ask the elder brothers and sisters who have done this course.

, If you’re too lazy to go to the Bridge Course or don’t want to offer much time out there you can buy some study materials. You can either go to a Bridge Course Institution and buy their books or straight away buy some book for the 11th grade. Now all you have to do is start study those books.

, In Nepal there are tons of colleges everywhere. Since the government is unstable, some business people have opened up private colleges just to earn money without giving quality education. So you’ll have to find some well reputed and good colleges like St. Xaviers Maitighar, Rato Bangla College, etc. But joining these colleges will be hard as many students will be competing for a limited number of seats. So you’ll have to take an entrance examination to get accepted there. To overcome this all you have to do is revise all the stuffs that you studied in 8th, 9th and the 10th grade as most of the (multiple-choice) questions will be asked from there. You can also join a Bridge Course (Entrance Preparation Course) to get accepted there.

, Now that you've joined a good college it’s time to keep up your performance level. Always study and do your homework as teachers will also evaluate you on these points. Don’t forget to join other extra-curriculum activities too. Do well in exams.


Don’t Stress out. In the 11th grade of Nepal, the students have a hard time understanding the concepts because of the acceleration of education level without filling up the gaps. This may give you a lot of pressure. But don’t get into this and just deal with it. It’;s true that you’ll not understand a couple of topics for which you can do a quick search on Google to learn the concepts.

, This is the most important part. It’s true that a person needs to be very talented. But in this age of competition, people don’t look at your talents but they rather look at your scores and marks to give you jobs. So it’s very vital for you to earn some good marks in every exams. To lean about how to do well in exams you can just search an article related to it in wikiHow here itself.

Practice!,
Get dressed.,
Warm up.",How to Participate in a School Play1,"


Get to know the director (if you don't know them, just smile and wave when you see them in the halls).
Find out which musical your school will be putting on.
Watch a movie version, read about it online, or ask someone who has seen it recently to find out more.  This step is crucial for you to know what you are doing.
Find out what is expected at the audition.  Are you supposed to sing 16 measures of a song?  Dance for 8 counts?  Do cold readings?  Most likely just yes to the song.  But find out anyway.  Are you supposed to sing a song from another musical?  Or a music movie?  Find out the rules.
Fill out any forms you are required to.  Use your best handwriting and plan out what your are going to write ahead of time.  Spell everything correctly.  Use professional speech.;
,


You should probably pick a song from another musical, even if you are allowed to sing from a music movie.  This is more professional.  Also, try not to sing from the musical itself unless you are specifically instructed to.  This is boring for the directors.
Pick something unique!  You don't want to be the 30th kid singing ""Tomorrow"" from Annie.  You want to be the kid who stands out!
Pick something that has a similar music style or comes from a similar plot in the musical you are auditioning for, but don't be too obvious.
You should choose a song that you are very familiar with.  You need to have heard it several times, and preferably sung it in front of an audience before.  You will not be as nervous and now what to expect.
Don't pick a song you wrote yourself.  The directors need to know that you are singing it right, and it sounds more professional.
This should be a song that is easy for you.  If you can't always hit that high note, pick something else.  You need to be able to sing it beautifully and clearly without faltering.

,


Sing the song as much as you can, but not in front of the directors before the audition!
Watch yourself in a full length mirror.  What are you doing with your hands/  Your feet?  Your eyes?  Does it look professional or silly?
Sing the song in front of your parents or a sibling or friend.  Ask for tips and for them to be perfectly honest.
Practice your slate (this is introducing yourself and your song).  Know it well.

,


About 45 minutes before the audition, put on nicer looking clothes.  Make sure that they fit you well and match!  If you will be doing dancing as well, or suspect you will be doing dancing, don't wear a skirt or something too uncomfortable.
Do your hair.  It should look nice and neat, but not perfect to the dot.
If you are a girl, put on a light layer of makeup that looks good on you.
Brush your teeth!  You don't want bad breath.

,


Do several singing warm-ups and sing your song several times.
Smile and look confident.
Practice different facial expressions.
Calm yourself.
If you will be dancing (or suspect that you will), warm up your body.

New kids don't know how to navigate the school, they're not familiar with school rules, and they are surrounded by strangers. If you've ever been a new kid, you know how hard it is. So be friendly with the new kids. Greet them. Ask if they need any help or advice. Show them around. Introduce them to nice people who could become their friends. You yourself might make a good friend in this process.;
, Most schools love to talk the talk: ""No-bullying zone!"" ""Be a buddy, not a bully!"" Why, then, can most people say they have been bullied in school? Simple. Either the teachers have no idea or they don't want to stir up a fuss. Take it upon yourself to combat bullying. When you see bullying-in-progress, say something. Have a few like-minded people with you to make you seem more authoritative. Report any bullying you see. If teachers don't want to do anything, take it to the principal, then the superintendent. If nobody on your school's staff wants to do anything, go to the media. The media is great for bringing attention to injustice.


If your friend is being a bully, don't condone it. At first, give them a friendly warning. If the bullying is serious or they refuse to stop, confront them about it.

, You could hold food drives and fundraisers. If one of your classmates is undergoing chemo, give her a care package. If one of your classmates' house gets flooded and his family can't afford to fix the damage, start a fundraiser to pay for it.

, Carry extra pencils and snacks, in case a fellow student forgets his pencils or lunch money. Have tissues on hand in case someone has an emotional breakdown.

The more a student enjoys class, the more they will retain information. , Utilize the plethora of technology that is available to make lessons exciting and interactive for the students. Once you grab students’ attention they are more willing to listen and learn. For science lessons, bring in artifacts like insects, animals, fossils, plants, etc.
Conduct experiments for history and science lessons.
Organize scavenger hunts around the classroom or school.
Go on virtual field trips.
Use an interactive whiteboard for students use to complete math equations, answer questions, complete sorting activities, etc.
Play video clips and movies relevant to lessons such as National Geographic videos, and historical videos.
Put on plays for literature and history lessons.
Let students teach the class certain concepts.
Play music during lessons.

, This works best for history and literature lessons. Teachers can use props and even dress up during the start of units. During Shakespearean units, speak with an accent and get into character. You can even ask to students to try it as well.
When teaching a unit on medieval times, dress in old-fashioned clothing of the times.
Bring in old newspapers featuring news from historical events.
Show students old political cartoons during historical lessons.

, Incorporate the interests of your students in your lesson plans. You can gather this information at the start of the year by having students fill out “favorites” cards. , Sometimes students become lazy when they feel they are not being properly awarded for their efforts in the classroom or when opportunities to boost their grades are unavailable. Let students earn extra points for additional assignments.
Don’t offer extra points for bringing items in for the class like as tissue or pencils.
Allow students to redo the test with the lowest score.
Let students revise a project worth a lot of points.

, Sometimes students find classes to be dull, causing them to be unmotivated. Teachers ought to exude a certain sense of passion while teaching. When students are able to see their teacher lecture with some gusto, they are more likely to listen and participate. Smile when you are lecturing so students see you enjoy what you are teaching.
Speak loudly and passionately, changing tone and avoiding sounding monotonous.

Know when your stress has become unhealthy.,
Reframe your perspective.,
Talk to your parents.",How to Not Get Stressed by School1," Some stress can be a good thing; it encourages us to work harder and perform under high pressure situations. But too much stress can begin to hurt our health and make it harder for us to perform.


A good sign that you have become overly stressed is that you can no longer bounce back. It makes sense to be stressed the night before a test. But, if you are still stressed when you come back home to spend time with your friends, then you have a problem.The most commonly reported signs of excessive stress are headaches and stomach pains.Other symptoms include fatigue, constipation, nervousness, diarrhea, inconsistent sleep patterns, neck cramps, sweating, absence of appetite, indigestion, heartburn, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of inadequacy, guilt, helplessness, and failure.;
, You should take some time off to try to rethink the way that you look at your situation. Try to find a more positive way to look at your situation.If you are struggling with AP classes, for example, remember that you are still a high schooler dealing with college level work. You aren’t struggling at college, you’re excelling at high school.
If bad grades get you down remember that it is only one assignment and that you will get a chance to make it up. Focusing on the negative will only keep you down and prevent you from excelling in the future.
Talk to the school counselor if you believe that your grades might be too low for you to meet you life goals. The counselor can tell you whether you are on track. If you are not on track, the counselor might be able to give you some suggestions as to how to catch up. Alternatively, the counselor can also point you toward other career paths commensurate with your interests and abilities., Talking to your parents might be the last thing most of us want to do in high school, especially if they are contributing to our anxiety. Sometimes, without meaning it, they put pressure on us to excel and push us further than we can manage. Hopefully, if you mention how you feel to them, they will adjust the way they talk to you.Without this outside pressure, it can be much easier for us to develop a healthy outlook on school work.
If our parents are aware of how we feel, they can become important partners in coping with stress. Parents can help us fix our schedules. Furthermore, getting them to commit to a quite household during homework time can make it easier to concentrate on finishing our assignments.

Set clear expectations.,
Sustain expectations.,
Maintain consistency.,
Reward students for good behavior and grades.",How to Motivate Lazy Students2," Make certain that all of your students as well as their parents or guardians are aware of the expectations you set for the year. If you alert them about the types of behavior you require, students and parents can be held accountable. During open house or welcome back events, explain your class expectations and have handouts readily available.
Send home student/parent contracts in which both parties sign a document acknowledging the class expectations and the promise to work hard.

, Don’t change established expectations and be sure to uphold them all year round. If students begin to see leniency they will try to take advantage. , Hold every student accountable for adhering to the expectations you set and be as consistent as possible. Make sure to be fair with the consequences. Fair doesn’t mean equal. Set individual expectations for those students that need them.
Don’t let certain students get away unacceptable behaviors.

, Students should always be recognized for exhibiting model behavior and receiving excellent grades. Give free time on Fridays to well-behaved students.
Provide points for participation.
Let students choose small trinkets like erasers, pencils, notepads, games, stickers, books, etc.

Speak to your children.,
Reward good grades and effort.,
Review assignments.,
Revisit difficult concepts.",How to Motivate Lazy Students3," Sit down and discuss your children’s’ classes and teachers to gather information. This will help you to gauge their level of motivation. Have a conversation at the kitchen table while eating a snack to make the discussion more informal.
Ask about recent school projects or partner work.
Find out what the teacher is like and how much he or she interacts with your child.
Determine if your child is having any behavior issues.

, Be sure to recognize their success to show them you are proud of them. This will also encourage the positive behavior to continue. Create a chart to document acquisition of good grades.
Make a separate chart for hard work, effort, and behavior.

, Make sure to check if your child has homework each and every day. Take a look at their assignment notebook to see if they wrote down coursework or test dates.

, If you notice your child didn’t score so well on an assessment, review the incorrect questions and explain the right answers. Ask your child what they can recall about the concepts to determine their retention.
Discern whether your child is unmotivated or just discouraged. These are very different and you must determine what you are dealing with to tackle the problem.
Consider tutors. If you notice that your child is not unmotivated but struggling with particular concepts, set them up with a tutor.
Provide assistance. Perhaps your child needs a little assistance and encouragement to increase their motivation. Try working with your child to complete assignments or prepare for an assessment.

Draw out a schedule.,
Start big projects early.,
Create a work space.,
Talk to your teacher.,
Get a tutor.,
Prioritize.",How to Not Get Stressed by School2," Get a planner and write down all of your obligations. Start by blocking out fixed obligations like school and club meetings. Figure out when you will work on each of your assignments and try to leave some time to relax.Try to schedule school work earlier in the day. You will find it progressively harder to concentrate as the day goes on.Schedule some free time every day. Clubs and sports can be a source of stress as much as they are a source of entertainment. You should have some unstructured time to do nothing, should you choose to.

, If you know there is a test coming up, study a little every day. Putting large assignments off to the last second is a recipe for stress. Schedule to have these projects complete several days in advance., It is important to have a place where you can work without distractions. There should be no TV, phones, and the internet should only be used for research. You might need to tell your parents to turn their TVs off too; hearing what you are missing out on in the distance is only going to make it harder to focus on work.


Your work space should also be clean and organized. You can easily lose your work in the clutter. That scenario can cost you a little bit of your time and a lot of your sanity., If you talk to your teacher, he might be able to illuminate what is going wrong in class. It is possible that he could offer you extra credit or even point you in the direction of a tutoring service.

, A good tutor will help you organize your work, schedule your time, better grasp a subject, and progress more efficiently through your assignments. Look online for tutoring services in your area or search for private tutors. If you talk to your counselor or teacher, you might find that your school has some tutors who can work with you.

, When you begin plotting out your schedule, you might find that there isn’t enough time in the day. At that point, you will need to determine what is important and start dropping things. Consider whether your sport or club obligations are distracting you from your school work. If your school work itself is too much, consider dropping some AP or Honor’s classes.Sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too by harnessing the power of summer. Over the summer, you won’t have course requirements. You can use that time for SAT and ACT prep so you don’t need to worry about it during the school year. You can also get involved in sports and other extracurriculars over the summer. You can even take a summer course at a college, so that you can pare down your AP requirements during the school year."

Get advice.,
Understand puberty.,
Find a way to express your emotions.,
Recite a positive mantra.,
Celebrate your accomplishments.",How to Not Get Stressed by School3," It is natural and exceedingly common to be worried about making friends and feeling accepted in high school. Talk to someone else, whether they be a therapist, a friend, or a parent. These people can give you suggestions about how to navigate your social environment., Puberty causes extreme emotional swings and will affect your appearance. Many teenagers are extremely distressed by the way that puberty affects their appearance.But acne, body odor, and rapid weight changes are a temporary side effect of puberty. Recognize that these are a short-term discomforts that pave the way to you becoming an adult.


To deal with these side effects in the short-term, live a healthier lifestyle including a good diet and exercise., Take up poetry, guitar, or art. Don't expect your high school work to be a masterpiece. Sometimes it just helps to have a medium to express your feelings. If you are lucky, you might learn a new skill too., Repeat in your head, ""I am not afraid"" or ""I can do this."" Repeat over and over again when you want to push your social boundaries, like if you try sitting with a new group at lunch. This will crowd out your pessimistic thoughts and help you move forward., Every time that you talk to someone new, succeed at speaking in front of a group, make it through a new club meeting, lose five pounds, or clear up your acne, celebrate. Mark your milestones so that you remember afterward that you can overcome your obstacles."

Exercise.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Sleep.,
Laugh.",How to Not Get Stressed by School4," Exercise has been shown to increase confidence and energy, while reducing stress.You should try to exercise three to five times a week, whether you are going for a jog, doing yoga, lifting weights, or playing sports., Food that is high in fat and calories can make you feel sluggish.For energy you should have a good variety of nutrients, including proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, and fats. Vary up the types of food you eat as much as possible.


It is particularly important that you eat a good breakfast, to give you energy throughout the day.
Avoid foods that are high in sugar. This will cause you to crash. Regular caffeine use will also eventually tax your supply of energy.Avoid extreme crash diets. These often involve starving yourself of key nutrients that are important for maintaining your energy level and your mental health.Foods that are said to increase your ability to think clearly include whole grains, oily fish, blueberries, oranges, pumpkin seeds, broccoli, sage, and nuts., As a teenager, you should aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night. Students who get less than this have been shown to get lower grades and be at higher risk of car accidents. Sleep is important to maintaining your concentration and overall mental health.To help get to sleep, stay off your computer for at least an hour prior to bed. Computer screens have been shown to emit a wavelength of light that suppresses melatonin, a hormone that is essential to getting a good night’s rest., Laughing naturally reduces stress. Make time to hang out with your friends and have a good time. Watch funny movies and TV shows. Don’t forget to have a good time."

Add detail!,
Revise your map.,

Organize it.,
Add information.,
Add a title.",How to Make a School Map (for a Class Project)," Walking around your school and leaving notes of where things are, or even drawing a rough draft can really help.

If you attend a large school and can't do it all in one day, take multiple days to go around your whole school.;
, While going around your school, make sure you don't miss anything. You can do this by going over the whole building again, or just by checking a blueprint of your school and seeing if you missed anything. If you missed some parts, add it to your map!, If you decide to do a rough draft before the final, then don't spend a ton of time on the rough draft. Just sketch it and spend the time to get the fine details in on the final draft., You really should use your rough draft as a tool to check your work and see if everything's correct.

Don't make your map an edited version of your rough draft. Start over on a new page, so that it's clean and clear.

, Before everything else, you should draw the big parts first. For example, drawing the different grade wings of the school might be a good first step., After the big parts, you should draw the less important sections, such as the offices, lobby, or special use rooms., When you have those two parts done, you should then draw the least important; such as stairwells, bathrooms, and other sections. Depending on the layout of the school, you can do these three steps in any order., Make sure everything is in it's correct spot, an go over everything a few times on your map. If you checked it, your rough draft should be correct, and this can be a good way to see if you got your map correct., Adding detail is an important part of making a map. Now draw the doors if you haven't already, draw the small parts of the school, label the areas, and check over your map again just to be safe., As you can probably tell, this is a very important step and thing to do. Look over your map, and see if everything is in it's right spot, see if the labels are correct (if you did any), see if the room sizes are right, etc. So, basically, revise your map., If you want to, feel free to color the background, color certain rooms in, just let your creativity run wild!, Add a key if you want to, make it color coded, or just keep it plain., You can add a little description for about three or four rooms on your map, and it can be for ones that wouldn't have an obvious purpose to the average person., You should add a title of the school it's suppose to represent so people can know. You can write who it's by under it."

Think about preparing for high school, as you're only a year away from it!",How to Have a Great Year in Eighth Grade," Stick with friends and find something that you like to do. Find new games, and ask your gym teacher if he/she will try to learn it so you can play it in gym!;
, Pack it cutely. Put it in a decorated bag with your sandwich cut with cookie cutters. If you don't pack a lunch, don't forget money to load up your lunch account.

, If you don't find anybody, it's not the end of the world! Obviously if there's no one nice enough to sit next to, no one will care you're sitting alone!

, Since you are an eighth grader, you finally get dibs on the back seat. (If you don't ride with the high schoolers!)

, Most schools give out agendas. Use them! If they don't, get a notebook and write the date at the top with all of your homework. You'll be more organized if you do!

, Get involved in a sport or activity! If you aren't very athletic, but want to be part of a sport, try volleyball! School volleyball isn't that hard. If you like hitting people, try baseball or football. If you like getting attention, try cheerleading or spirit/pep squad.

, For guys, the best thing is to just be nice to the special lady and never ever joke on her or let your friends do the talking. For girls, just be yourself, talk to the guy, and try hard to not let your friends do the talking either. It will give the impression that you are not confident.

, This is eighth grade. If your school has graduation or a dance, go all out. Your school may even have a middle school prom. Buy a nice dress-who cares if you'll only wear it once! Go on all the field trips and have a blast.

, It is common for someone who is at the top to pick on someone at the bottom, but don't be one of those people. Be nice to the sixth and seventh graders and offer to help them out instead of making fun of them for being ""lower"" than you.

, This is your last year of middle school, so it's important to make lasting friendships.

, Prepare as much as possible; it may appear harder than you thought.

Make your children realize that how they study is important.,
Start young.,
Teach consequences.,
Try not to force studying on your child.,
Set a good example.,
Take breaks.,
Look at your child's friend group.",How to Make Your Children Study1," Show them some examples. Bring your children to a person who is study-conscious, and have your children ask why he or she studies so much. Tell them about the days of your childhood at school and explain how challenging and fun it was to study.;
, As soon as your child starts any type of schooling, start showing them how to balance their time. Teach them that school is a priority over things like games and TV, and get them into the habit of finishing their school work before anything else.

, Depending on where you live, your child's school may not require students that fail a class to do any sort of make-up course. You can usually find some sort of summer school option, however, whether it is through the school or an external program. Your child probably won't love the idea of summer classes—but this can be a great way to teach them that if they studied harder during the year, they would have more free time during the summer. Remedial courses may help your kids catch up the rest of their peers in the following year, ensuring that they don't fall further behind.

, Over time, this may condition them to avoid studying at all costs. If you sit your child down at the kitchen table for three hours with a textbook and lock the door, chances are that they will refuse to do what you want them to do. If you pressure them constantly about the importance of studying and shout at them when they don't, the child may begin to resent both studying itself and you as a figure of authority within the house. If you ask your child to study in a relaxed way, and make them aware of the importance of studying, the outcome could be different


""You should probably go study"" sounds a lot better to your child than ""Go study right now"", and he/she may be more likely to think, ""Maybe I should go study right now.""
Encourage your child positively, and let them find out for themselves why they need to study. Constant pressuring can result in extreme rebellion and/or resentment.

, Let your child see you working on something work-related. When your kid studies or completes a homework assignment, sit with her and work on something that you need to do. Set an hour aside each night for study—this includes you!

, Balance out rigorous studying with unstructured play time. Make sure that your children take short breaks to decompress in the midst of a study session, or else they may get too stressed—which can negatively impact their health, their social life, and their academic performance. Studying for over 20 minutes at a time can lead young children to lose focus, so 20 minutes of rest for every 20 minutes of study may help your child memorize what they're reading.


Don't make your kids sit at the computer all day. Make sure their eyes are properly rested, and make sure that they get plenty of time outside.
If you force your children to work for longer than they are able to focus, they may not get as much out of their study—and they may develop negative associations with the whole act of studying.

, If your son's friends aren't very into school and studying, there's a good chance that their habits and behavior are influencing your son's attitude. Consider whether it is your place or your responsibility to interfere with your child's social life. If the problem continues, you might consider speaking with your child, speaking with the parents of his/her friends, or limiting your child's time with certain friends. Ultimately, short of changing schools, there may be few invasive ways to change your child's social life.

Take notes on note cards instead of in a book.,
Try to sit in the middle of the classroom.,
Dress nicely when coming to class.,
Take notes on all the questions you have for that week.,
At the end of the week, organize a meeting with your teacher during their office hours.,
Try to build a personal relationship with the teachers.,
Get all of your homework done before the weekend.",How to Make Classes Easier," Doing this allows you to write down just the important information so that when you study for a test, you don't have to read through the entire section of the book again.;
, Teachers tend to ignore students in the back of the classroom because they belong to the ""I don't want to be here"" group, and pay less attention to those in the front of the classroom because they belong to the ""prodigy"" group (you barely understand quantum physics? Hah!). Sitting in the middle ensures that you are getting as much attention as possible from the teacher during class.

, Nothing says ""I'm serious about learning"" like business-casual. Teachers will take you more seriously, and as an added bonus, people give more credit to a person that's well dressed.

, It helps to compile a list of questions so that you can check them off if you understand the concepts later.

, Meet with them to discuss any questions you have. Bring your list of questions from that week.

, Teachers love nothing more than a student who has the initiative to talk to them. It gives them a better idea of where you're having problems, and allows them to say things that they couldn't in the class (Giving shortcuts for problems, deeper conversation about a subject, etc...). The better the relationship with your teacher is, the more help you get from that teacher during the semester.

, It seems like a natural thing to save all of your homework for the weekend, but it's not a good idea, because teachers expect you to do it, and usually save their biggest and longest assignments for the weekend (You have to do SOMETHING during those boring weekends, don't you?).

"
Set up a reward system.,
Inspire your children with goals.,
Engage your child by relating less ""fun"" topics to the subjects that she loves.,
Consider enrolling your child in advanced programs for subjects that he/she finds interesting.,
Teach your children to learn, not just to study.,
Find ""fun"" ways to study.",How to Make Your Children Study2," We are wired to believe that our work should be rewarded, so make studying rewarding. One less chore, an extra dollar in their allowance, more TV time—whatever motivates your kids and works in your household. Make sure that you clearly explain how the system works, then stick to that system. There are two ways to ""bribe"" your kids:


Tell your child that if they study, they can get something. For instance: If they study for an hour today, they can get a chocolate bar, or an extra 30 minutes of free time. Some children may not take the offer
Tell your child if they don't study, then they don't get something. For instance: If they don't study for an hour today, they don't get to catch up with their friends.

, Studying can feel pointless and abstract for children when they don't see where it is all leading. Make sure that they understand where studying can take them. Talk to them about how studying can improve their grades, which will, in turn, increase the amount of colleges they can go to—which can empower them to do anything they might want to do in the future!

, Most kids will naturally click better with certain subjects. Over time, they may learn to love the subjects that come easy and dislike the topics that take more work. This dislike can lead kids to shut down when things get harder and find excuses as to why they don't need to do it. Catch this early, before your child teaches themselves that they don't need math because, ""who really uses algebra anyways?"" Help them understand that school is more fun when they follow their interests, but that it can also be important to be well-rounded.


One way to stop this is to relate the subject they don't understand to a subject they excel at. Use examples and comparisons. For instance, if your son loves history but hates math, you might try to engage him with the history of numbers; tell him stories about famous mathematicians to add a bit of romance to the subject; or help him understand how mathematical methods like carbon dating help us better understand historical timelines.
Ask your child's teacher, knowledgeable friends, or a private (in-person or online) tutor to help with this. Consider using online resources like games and educational YouTube videos to engage your kids.

, If your daughter hates doing her English homework, but spends hours working on science experiments, consider enrolling her in a science camp or a STEM youth program. If your son doesn't like to study for his tests, but jumps at the chance to practice playing music, encourage his musical development by enrolling him in a youth orchestra or hiring a music tutor. If you make it clear that your child must maintain some level of engagement in the ""boring"" classes to keep learning about what he/she loves, you may be able to teach a sort of working discipline by getting your kid excited to learn.

, Encourage them to learn new things every day, even if they're small things. All the studying in the world will be empty rigor if your child doesn't understand what it means to learn—and to love learning. Show your child the joy of learning, and you may not need to make her study.


Take your child to public spaces that will stimulate her mind. Take her to an air-and-space museum, a natural history museum, an art museum, or an aquarium. Take her to the library, to the zoo, or to a play. Take her somewhere that she will still be talking about in a week.
Find interactive ways for your child to learn at home. Show him documentaries, give him educational games, or give him books. Ask him questions, and teach him to question the world around him.

, Use flash cards, a personalized study guide, or sticky notes around your child's room; you can even encourage your kid to study with friends over email. Think outside the box. Perhaps the material isn't the reason that your child doesn't like to study—perhaps it's the way that the material is laid out. Try different methods and tweak your child's study system until it works.


If your child wants to study in a particular way, to make it fun, then do just that. If they don't mind, or they simply don't want to study, it is still good to suggest ideas that might catch their attention.

Be involved.,
Minimize distractions.,
Know how your child learns best.,
Consider hiring a tutor.,
If you have young children, try to be present when they study.,
Review your children's homework when they get home and when they have finished it.",How to Make Your Children Study3," Take an interest in what your child is learning, what they think is easy or what they think is hard. Become familiar with the material your children are studying. It's quite difficult to help your child with algebra if you are not familiar with the basic concepts yourself. Once you’ve become familiar with what your children need to learn, you will be in a better position to help. Take the initiative.


If there is something your child finds hard that you don't know, consult their teacher. Do not tell them to ask their teacher: chances are they will forget, or be too embarrassed to go alone. Instead, set up a meeting with their teacher, yourself and your child, and figure out an option that is best for your life style.
Find the time to do homework with them—not by telling them what to do, but by guiding them along the way. Sometimes children do not like the tension of having someone else watching them study. Try either studying with them or giving them some space.

, Keep the TV off, and put away any gaming consoles. If your children are using a computer, keep an eye on them to make sure that they don't play games. Consider blocking certain websites from a computer, or disabling the Internet altogether during certain designated study times.

, Understand what makes her engaged and productive, and try to build an ideal learning environment. Treat your child as an individual with unique needs and strengths. If your child remembers things easier by seeing things, try having him read something aloud and repeat in his own words what he read. Some children remember more if they write things down (touch/hands on), so reworking a math problem or writing certain history dates will help for them. You may need to read out loud to your child to help her retain the information, if she learns best by hearing.


Try to understand the environment in which your child learns best. Do they learn best with food by their side, or no food? Do they like peace and quiet, or music? Do they like sitting at a desk, on the couch, or on a yoga ball?
Some parents make the mistake of thinking that their child didn't study enough because they didn't sit down for a long time. Reading/writing and comprehension speeds vary wildly between children, which may begin to explain why your son only sat down to study for an hour before the big exam.

, Teachers may recommend a private tutor. If it's in the budget, take the opportunity. It can be a great way for your child to learn, and you might even learn something. If you can't afford a tutor, some one-on-one time with the teacher may do the trick. Many schools are developing peer-mentoring programs where students teach other students. Finally, you can always take to the Internet—there are a number of reputable chat and video tutoring services.

, Make sure they know that you are there to help, but do not let them rely on you completely for the answers. Be patient, positive, and tolerant. As your children grow older, more disciplined, and more independent, you may need to back off and let them build their own study habits.

, Read over essays and writing assignments; look over their work for math assignments. Consider checking their answers and working with them to correct anything that's wrong. Make sure that you do not demean your child or make him/her feel dull. Your guidance should be a positive light, not a stressful weight.

Keep parents and guardians informed.,
Offer prizes.,
Encourage sick students to stay home.Whether or not you institute a rewards program, make it clear that students shouldn’t come to school when ill. Avoid pushing an individual student so hard that a 24-hour bug grows into a week long illness, or worse.,
Offer extra help to chronically absent students.",How to Improve School Attendance1," Alert them whenever their child is absent in case the child has skipped school without them knowing. Continue to alert them about each repeated instance. Also keep them abreast of any developing patterns in their child’s absenteeism and/or any problems resulting it from it, whether or not the parents/guardians have excused their child's absence.Patterns to look out for include: missing school just before or after vacations and/or weekends; leaving for family vacations while school is in normal session; missing full or half-days for non-emergency appointments with doctors, dentists, or other offices.Ask parents/guardians to meet with teachers and staff to address chronic absences. This is especially important if they are allowing or even responsible for those absences. Explain the disadvantages that this places on their child.;
, Give students incentive to show up with a rewards program. Create tiers of acceptable numbers of absences per year, semester, marking period, and/or month. Reward students who meet these tiers with appropriate prizes reflecting each tier.For example, say Tier 1 is up to two excused absences for the whole year, with a new laptop as a prize to each student who meets it. Tier 2 is three or four excused absences per year, with a $50 gift certificate to a local store as prize.
Creating monthly prizes may be more productive than yearly prizes, since students won’t be discouraged to give up if they have an early setback.

, Additionally, prevent the spread of communicable diseases, which may cause other students to miss school.


If you do institute a rewards program, and if your school’s funding is dependent on attendance records, don’t make exceptions for health-related absences. Make it clear to students that all absences will be treated as the same. This way they won’t be tempted to take a “mental-health day” on top of everything else.

, Keep in mind that the more school a student misses, the more trouble they will have in keeping up with their classmates. Counter this with an in-school and/or after-school program designed to address each student’s needs with hands-on help from staff. Ensure that your students won’t give up on lessons and then compound the problem by skipping more school or classes.Give at-risk students positive attention. Prove to them that the school is invested in their success.
Review existing policies regarding punishment. Nix any disciplinary measures that involve the student missing more school or class-time, such as suspension, which just make a bad situation worse.

Create a daily schedule for your child.,
Show your child that school matters by example.,
Treat all absences as equal.,
Reach out to the school.",How to Improve School Attendance2," Ensure that they will make it to school each day by sticking to a strong routine. Enforce a regular curfew at night so they will be home with enough time left to finish homework and studies and then wind down for bed. Establish a nightly bedtime so they get plenty of sleep.Also establish a daily wake-up time to reduce their chance of oversleeping. Additionally, create a morning plan to make sure they get to school.Have them leave the house at the same time each day with plenty of time to make it to the bus stop.
Map and time your drive or walk before the school year starts if you have to escort them yourself.
Check traffic and weather reports in the morning to plan around unforeseen events.
Coordinate with other family members, trusted neighbors, or other students’ parents if you are unable to escort them.

, Plan your family activities around the school calendar. Schedule vacations and other trips to match school breaks so they don’t interfere with your child’s learning. Also avoid disrupting any special events involving your child’s extracurricular activities, which may still take place during school breaks.These could include:


Sports events
Other contests for clubs like chess, debate, or economics.
Plays, recitals, and concerts
School trips.

, Be aware that your child’s absence will not be struck from their record just because you have allowed it. Count all absences as the same, whether or not they were excused or unavoidable. Keep the number of excused absences to an absolute minimum to allow for unavoidable absences, like illnesses and emergencies.Refrain from making appointments with doctors, dentists, or other offices during the school day.
If you must keep your child out of school for such appointments or other reasons, like religious observances, alert their teachers ahead of time.

, Keep an open dialogue with teachers and attendance offices to find out if your child misses school without you knowing. If you know you will be keeping your child out of school on a particular day, let teachers know so they can provide your child with material from lessons they would otherwise miss. Alert them right away if your child will be absent for a long time due to their health or other emergencies.If your child is already chronically absent, contact the school to try possible remedies:Establishing a “contract” between your student, teachers, and guidance counselors. Define clear goals for your child, with appropriate prizes for success and repercussions for failure.
Assigning a model student or a teacher as a mentor to provide one-on-one help.
Exploring sports teams, clubs, and other activities that may motivate your child to stay in school, since many require a certain level of attendance for eligibility.
Switching classes or programs, if possible, in case your child’s absenteeism is due to a lack of interest or personal problems with specific classmates or teachers.

Take care of things the night before.,
Establish a steady routine.,
Stay focused on getting out the door.,
Go to school for your own sake.,
Give yourself another reason to go.",How to Improve School Attendance3," Reduce the amount of things you need to do between waking up and getting out the door. Prevent yourself from running late, stressing out, and making that fateful decision to “just skip school ‘cause I’m already late.” Make your mornings easier by:Showering or bathing at night.
Planning your outfit for the next day before going to bed.
Making sure everything you need for breakfast is ready to go.
Packing everything you need for school before falling asleep.

, At night, follow a curfew, even if your parents or guardians don’t enforce one. Allow enough time between that and bedtime to finish homework, do chores, and take care of anything else without skipping anything. Go to bed at the same time every night so you’re not exhausted the next day.Set an alarm for the same time every day so you’re used to waking up at that hour and less likely to oversleep.If you still feel rushed in the morning, start setting your alarm earlier by ten or fifteen minutes.
Keep a calendar to plan around special events (like your sister’s recital, your friend’s birthday party, or your own away game) that might throw your schedule off.

, Build a morning routine whose only purpose is getting you awake and off to school. Wake up. Eat breakfast. Brush your teeth, comb your hair, and whatever else you need to do in the bathroom. Get dressed, get your things, and get moving. That’s all.Avoid distractions like watching TV, going online, playing games, reading for pleasure, or listening to music.
Exceptions can be made for checking weather or traffic reports.

, Even if you hate, hate, hate school, remember that each day you miss makes the next day even tougher. Be aware that high absentee rates often lead to lower grades and poor test scores. Even if you have high grades right now, expect your chances of dropping out of high school to keep going up the more you miss school.Remember: even though an excused absence might not result in disciplinary trouble at school or at home, you still lost a day’s worth of lessons.
Asking your parents or guardians for a “mental health day” can be beneficial sometimes.Still, do so as little possible, if at all. Keep in mind that you could catch a virus tomorrow and be forced to stay home again!
If you do ask for a mental health day, plan wisely. Consider what’s happening in school that week so you don’t miss crucial tests or lessons.

, If you can’t stand schoolwork, find other motivations to keep you going. Pursue your interests through extracurricular activities. Join a team or club.Since they usually require you to maintain good attendance in order to participate, use this as an incentive to keep your absentee rate next to nil.


If nothing else, focus on the other things that make school enjoyable. Go to see your friends or to have another excuse to bump into that boy or girl you like in the halls.

Participate in class.,

Stay focused on the future.",How to Go to School," One of your big responsibilities is to make sure that you have everything you'll need to be successful at school. Many times, teachers will make supply lists available a few weeks before school starts, to make sure you have enough time to get everything you'll need. Whether you're starting a new school or just returning after a summer break, some common supplies include:


Pencils
Pens
Notebook paper
Crayons
Binders or folders
Glue
An eraser;
, Before you go to school, you need to make sure you know where you're going when you get there. Depending on what level of school you're in, you might just have one classroom, or you may have to go between classrooms.


If you're in middle school or junior high school, it's common to go and walk your class schedule once you find out where your classrooms will be. Find out how long the passing period is and make sure you'll have enough time to get to each class. A little practice helps.

, Many students take the bus to school, which is usually the easiest way of getting there, but there are all kinds of different ways to get to school. If you live close enough, you can walk, ride a bike, or get a ride from someone. Usually, the school makes bus routes available before the year starts, so you can find out where and when you need to catch the bus to get to school.

, To make the morning before school as easy and stress free as possible, decide what you're going to wear the night before you have to go to school. Lay out your clothes, take a bath or shower, and get as much sleep as possible so you'll be ready for the first day.


It's always a good idea to eat breakfast in the morning before school to keep your energy levels high until lunch time. You don't want to be sluggish on your first day.
If you're bringing a lunch, pack it the night before and keep it in the fridge so all you've got to do is grab it and go.

, However you're getting to school, it's important to show up on time, especially on the first day. Once you get to school, try not to waste too much time talking to your friends and messing around at your locker, and just head to class as quickly as possible.

, When you get to class, try to stay focused on doing what your teacher says. In the first few days of each semester, you'll probably have a lot of introduction activities to do, mostly getting to know the other students and the teacher. It shouldn't be too difficult, but it's still important to listen closely, do what you're told, and pay attention to any homework tasks you're supposed to accomplish.


Be quiet in class and avoid talking to your friends. It's important to establish early in the semester that you're a good student and not get started off on the wrong foot.

, You'll probably have a lot of new stuff to keep track of in the early days of your new school, and it's important to keep them written down in your notebook. try to keep track of each homework assignment, as well as what you're learning about your various subjects. It can be hard to remember everything, so you definitely need to write it down.


Keep organized by having a different notebook for each subject, or having a few sheets of paper in each folder you have for different classes to keep your notes separated.

, Answer questions occasionally when the teacher opens up, and contribute to class discussions. Do the assignments that your teacher provides in a timely manner. When you're in class, try to participate as much as possible and stay on task to establish that you're a good student and a contribution to the class.

, If you don't understand something, don't wait for someone else to ask to clarify. If you're confused, it's likely that someone else is confused too, and that you're doing them a favor. Teachers usually appreciate when students are brave enough to ask questions and make sure that everyone is getting the concept or the idea that's being taught.

, Keep your binders, folders, and backpack well organized and as clean as possible. Make sure you can find everything you need for class quickly and effectively, and keep your homework assignments tidy and in the front of your folders.


If you're a messy student, try to get in the habit of going through your backpack and binder every couple of weeks to get things cleaned out. If you've got old papers that aren't important any more, it can be a big stress reducer to throw stuff out and get rid of it.

, Try to find other students who you have something in common with. If you're a sports find, find your friends on the basketball court at recess. If you're a sci-fi obsessive, chat up the kid you see reading a Star Wars novel at lunch. If you can't get music out of your head, keep a look out for other people sneaking iPods onto the bus.


Alternatively, try to be friendly with everyone. If you don't know someone well, look for a reason to get to know them a little better. Befriend people in your neighborhood that you go to school with, so you'll have nearby buddies. Befriend smart students in your class so you'll have homework helpers.

, A great way to make friends is to join up with clubs, sports teams, the school band, or other after-school opportunities that your school offers. Each school will have different opportunities available, from chess clubs to Japanese Societies, so you'll have to find out what's available at yours.


Alternatively, if you want to start a club that doesn't exist, find a faculty sponsor and try to organize one. Want to get a Super Smash Bros. after school club started? Talk to a teacher and see what it takes to get one started.

, School can get stressful, with all the social responsibilities and the homework responsibilities. To make sure that school stays fun, try to stay as organized and as balanced as possible, keeping enough time for your homework.


If you're a procrastinator, try to schedule enough time to get everything done. If you schedule a particular block of homework time, you can avoid your procrastination tendencies and free up your extra time to have fun.

, School isn't easy for everyone. If you're not having much fun at school, try to remember that you're not alone, and that eventually things will get better. Lots of kids who hate middle school have a great time in high school, while students who have miserable high school experiences grow up to be successful and fascinating adults. The small world of your school will soon get a lot bigger when you're done. Work hard now, try to have as much fun as you can, stay out of trouble, and get it over with it. It gets better.


try to keep a good attitude about school, if at all possible. If you're really struggling, talk to your parents about your experience, or talk to a guidance counselor at school if your parents are unwilling to listen. They can help. Don't keep it to yourself."

Study in the summer.,
Prepare for next year's classes if you're up for it.,
Get all of the school supplies you need.",How to Get on Honor Roll in Middle School1," Remember what was challenging last year for you and study it! You could go online and find a good website, get a book from your library or find one on Amazon. If you don't feel like studying over summer,you could do something like go to a museum if you have the time, or invite a friend over for a study session (that also happens to involve video game breaks). There are many ways to review what you know when school's out, even in fun ways! Just remember not to overdo it, because if it's not feeling fun and you don't want to do it, then you won't focus as much, you won't learn as much, and it will be frustrating.;
, If you excelled last year, then you might want to think about skipping ahead and covering next year's material. Say you're going into 6th grade and last year you aced every math test you had. If it's too easy for you, you could print out some 6th grade level tests and see how you do. You could also think about skipping a grade if all of the 6th grade material is SUPER easy. But it's good to prepare over the summer because you know what's coming and you have a head start on some things.

, Go to Office Depot, Office Max, Staples, or another school supplies store and get them all ahead of time. Don't wait until school has started, because then everything will be gone. Go a week or two early, bring your school supply list, and shop away. I would recommend getting a Case-it, because they hold a lot and keep you very organized, and that's a big help for getting good grades. Here is a general list, though it may vary from school to school:


Case-it or binder
LOTS OF PENCILS  (People will ""borrow them"" like crazy, which means lose them)
Lined Paper
Red pen
Highlighters
Folders and notebooks (you may want to wait on these because some classes require them and some don't)
Depending on teacher, you could need colored pencils, tape, scissors, and more

"
"
Make a good impression with your teachers on the first day.,
Pay attention in class.,
If you have a question, raise your hand!,
Do all of your homework immediately.,
Don't put off studying or doing a project until the last minute.,
Be very organized!,
Know your teachers' different styles.,
If you are struggling in a subject, don't just give up.",How to Get on Honor Roll in Middle School2," This doesn't mean be an absolute teacher's pet. It means don't stick gum under the desks, or call out without raising your hand. Be respectful to them, even if you don't like them. Remember this rule: You always have to be respectful to teachers (or be nice to them), but they have to gain your respect (or admiration). This might not help you get better grades, but being friends with your teachers will make the year more enjoyable.

, If you want to be an honor roll student, you can't expect to doodle on your desk the whole year and get all A's. You're at school to learn, so listen to the teacher. It's okay if you accidentally start daydreaming once in a while, but make sure to catch back up on the topic, and try to avoid daydreaming. Make sure to take notes, especially if it's required. Then you have something to reference back to. Record your homework in your planner, or on a piece of paper. It is also good to record test dates so you know when tests are coming.

, Sometimes it can be embarrassing to go out of your comfort zone, but if you leave your question unanswered, then you might get confused later in class. If you are really embarrassed, try to ask the teacher about it after class, or ask a friend.

, Do it in a quiet place where you will be undisturbed. If you need help with something, ask your parents or siblings. If they're busy, then go online to find an answer, or email your teacher about your question. Remember, it's best to get one-on-one help, so try to get your family to help first.

, Do a little bit each day until the deadline. This can be hard to plan out, but look at the whole thing and how many days you have left to do it. Let's say you have a poster board on the Aztecs due in one week. You have to get 3 resources from online and 3 from books, and make up a fiction story including 10 real facts from those resources. Then you have to draw a detailed drawing for part of your story. (This is a pretty good description of something you might have to do for a project.) The first and second nights you could get your sources. (Make sure they're trustworthy!) The third, fourth, and fifth nights you should get your facts, write a draft, and write the final thing. The last few nights can be spent making sure it's all perfect and drawing that picture. You'll want to plan the whole thing out like that, and maybe even a little more!

, Some of your teachers will mark off points for turning something in late, so make sure to turn stuff in on time. The worst thing ever (and one of the biggest reasons things are late) is to have done a whole paper and not being able to find it in your messy binder, or leaving it at home. Then that A might turn into a B or worse...a big 0 if your teacher isn't forgiving. You could have forgotten to do it, which is also due to organization issues. This means that you forgot to write it down....perhaps because your planner/pencil was buried somewhere deep in the abysmal pit of papers and cute Japanese erasers in your binder. Some tips for being more organized: Keep track of what you have to do. Homework, tests, projects, and even if you are meeting in a different room one day for class. Have an ""Organization Day."" Clean out your locker and binder and anything else that gets messy. Put all of your graded papers in a folder far away from your binder, unless you know you'll need them again. Have folders for every school subject. Actually use your folders. Sometimes it's hard when you're in a hurry but it pays off in the long run. If you can't do it between classes, try doing it at home.

, Some teachers will be the best teachers ever and describe everything very well, and some will be the worst teachers that you've had. Some will be strict and some will be easygoing. But that's not all. Different teachers have different grading systems, and they have different rules. Teachers can sometimes be picky about things, and mark points off for that, so you have to learn about their requirements early in the year so you don't lose hard earned points. Some teachers might only accept work if you have your first name, last name, hour, and the date in the upper right hand corner. Make sure to always do that specific thing, or else they might take points off of your paper. (I had one teacher like this.)

, Get a tutor if you really need one, or just study with a few friends. Stay after school with the teacher if you really don't understand, and try your absolute best on everything. As long as you do the best that you can and put in a lot of work, it's okay if you don't get on the honor roll. Just be proud of what you did do, and try again next time.

Go beyond the surface information.,
Use the knowledge of others.,
Be proactive in your education.,
Get organized.,
Choose courses you are interested in.,
Be aware of your body clock.,
Give your best effort.","How to Get Straight ""A""s1"," Don’t just stop learning at the bare facts. These will not make you any smarter, nor will they give you the analytical tools you need to get straight A’s. If you really want to excel in school the most important thing is to always ask why. Learn why things work the way they do, why things matter and then you can apply that knowledge across a vast amount of information and may be correctly guessing even things you might not have learned about.;
, We don’t mean cheat…. when we say use the knowledge of others, what we mean is that you should talk with friends, family members and teachers about the subjects you are studying. Get their opinions on topics, see how they would have approached a problem or learn their method of doing something. In opening your mind to new ways of thinking and doing you should be better prepared to handle almost any academic challenge.

, Participate in study groups. Get help when you need it. Study over time rather than cramming before a test. Basically, getting straight A’s is hard (if it were easy, everyone would do it) so you need to work at it if you want to do this.

, Consistently keep all assignments or handed back work/handouts separate and in chronological order. Not only does this make life in general easier but it also helps when exam time comes especially if there will be a cumulative end-of-the-year exam. You should also organize your time by allowing yourself plenty of time to study and sleep. Organize your notes and your study space. A cluttered space is distracting.


Study and do homework in chunks. If you have 2 days to do a homework assignment, do most of it the first and do the other part the second. Or, if you have 1 week to learn 10 vocabulary words learn a few each day and review the words already learned. This way you'll be less overwhelmed and ultimately have more time free from cramming.
Get a planner. Write down your homework as soon as the teacher assigns it. If a teacher tells you when a project is due or a test will be given write it down. This will help you know what you have to do.

, If you can, make sure you are studying things you enjoy and can get invested in. You will do better if you care about the material you are studying. This is why you will find that you get the best grades in your favorite classes.


Remember to balance things you enjoy with things you need to know.

, The human body learns best at specific times and for some people it can be in the morning. Be sure you save this time for studying important class material, and leave the rest of the time for less important activities such as socializing. Avoid studying when you are tired. In general you should try to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night.

, You need to have knowledge of the study subject but it is also important to persevere and go back and revise the subject until you are confident that you will be able to get the right answers during an exam or test. If you don't understand a question on a test then think it through and write it out so that you can see what you are doing.

Pay attention in class.,
Ask questions.,

Never skip class as you will fall behind and it may affect your grades.,
Talk to your teachers about your grades.","How to Get Straight ""A""s2"," You can learn so much from just listening so always pay attention in class. Study smart! You should be able to understand the subject better and know what the teacher is talking about prior to a test.


Eat breakfast and if you are prescribed medication or take vitamins make sure you take them before leaving for school. A good breakfast will help keep you awake and focused throughout the day.

, Ask the teacher relevant questions about the subject. If you do not understand the subject then write down what it is you are having trouble with and ask the teacher if you can have some time to discuss your concerns.


Never be embarrassed to ask questions. Curious students make teachers happy.

,


For example, if you’re in a history class and you’re learning about the formation of the United States of America but you see that the next section will be about the American Civil War, think about how those two events could connect to each other.

, Learn to write down an outline and fill it in with bits and pieces of key information. Write a summary of what you have learned in class to use it for future reference.


Make notes on what you don’t understand so that you are well prepared when your teacher explains those things or you can discuss then with your teacher

, If you are sick and cannot go into school, ask the teacher for any notes on the classes you may have missed. If the teacher is not available for some reason, ask a friend for some information you have missed on the day you were absent . 

, Ask about your quality of work and reasons for any weak grades. Work on any areas of weakness and ask your teacher if your extra work will help improve your grades.

Do your homework.,
Don’t procrastinate.,
Teach the material to someone else.,
Get a dedicated study space.,
Read extra material if you have time.,
Consider getting a tutor if you can afford to.","How to Get Straight ""A""s3"," Some college teachers may not always check your homework so it is important to remain motivated motivate yourself to do your homework. Homework helps to reinforce what you have learned in class and identify what you don’t understand. study. If you don't have any homework on a subject, read your notes or read any textbooks on the subjects.


On average about 10% of your grade is homework but how it is incorporated into your grade really depends on the teacher.

, Never stay up late doing an assignment unless you have not finished it and it is due very soon. Instead, if you have two weeks to do your assignment, spend the first week outlining and doing the basics. Over the weekend, neatly put it together, and the next week, just put the finishing touches on it, do some editing, and print it out. Don't forget to hand it in to your teacher one day before you actually should. This will show your dedication and give your teacher time to suggest revisions.


Starting an assignment ahead of time will also give you time to meet with your teacher and discuss any problems you have, directions you can take, and get other assignment help that is crucial to getting A’s. Just going to the extra trouble of asking for help and taking your teacher’s advice may earn you a slightly higher grade.

, Find a quiet place, maybe in your room, lock the door and imagine you are the teacher explaining the subject to a student. This is also a good way to measure your understanding of the material and explaining it to someone who doesn’t understand it at all can often help you develop a better understanding of the material yourself. If you can participate in tutoring programs in school, this serves the same purpose.

, Find a space that is only for studying. This may help to minimize distractions and keep you on track. Studying is just another habit and if you teach your brain that a certain desk or room is just for studying then you should have a much easier time focusing and getting work done.

, You can always go onto the internet or go to the library and find more books or information about the subjects you are studying. Learning some additional information and adding it into papers or test questions may impress your teachers.

, There's nothing wrong with getting in some extra learning and it may make a difference in your grades.

Pay very close attention to the teachers.,
If you don't understand and need to ask a question that concerns the whole class, raise your hand.,
If it is not a question or comment that concerns the class, or you are too embarrassed to speak in front of others, and the teacher is okay with it, ask them in person.,
Complete all of your in-class assignments.,
When walking in the halls, tread lightly.,
Know the school rules.,
Inform the school about absences.,
Expect the learning to be different.,
Be very friendly.,
Try to feel out other people's relationships.,
Talk to people who seem lonely.,
Seek help it you feel intimidated.,
Get into the things you're passionate about.",How to Go to Junior High for the First Time After Being Homeschooled,"


When they are talking, stop talking to your friends, reading, writing, or playing on your phone (which is often not allowed anyway), and look right at the teacher.
Listen to what they are saying.
Think about how it applies to you.
When they are done talking, complete the instructions they have given you quickly and efficiently.;
,


Raise it either high above your head or bent at the elbow.
Don't look too eager to ask your question, but don't look bored, either.
Make eye contact with the teacher and wait patiently.
If the teacher says not to ask questions yet, put your hand down and wait until they are ready again.
When the teacher calls your name, makes eye contact with you and nods, or points at you, ask your question.
Be loud enough for the teacher to hear, but don't shout.
Enunciate your words.

,


Wait until they sit back at their desk.
Stand in line (if there is one), and wait patiently.
Ask your question loud enough for the teacher to hear, but quiet enough not to disturb others.
Thank the teacher for their help.

, Work quickly so that you can have time to do other things you need or want to do- but don't rush. Do your best work (and use your best handwriting).


If you have a question, ask the teacher in person (see above).
If you don't finish your assignments in class, you may need to take them home to work on there.  Ask your teacher what he/she would like you to do.
Keep track of when your assignments are due.
Complete your homework the same way.

, There will be a lot of people, so prepare yourself for that.


Look for gaps and openings between people to squeeze through (sticking close to the walls often works well).
Keep track of where your next class is. If it's your first day, carry around a list of your classes, teachers, and locations in your pocket.
Know the school so that you can get around.
If you need to use the restroom or get a drink, and there is one nearby, do so quickly, if there is time. You may want to get a map of the school and plan out when is a good time to go to the bathroom and get stuff from your locker.
You have roughly five minutes (depending on the school) to get from one class to the other, and get to your locker, get a drink, and go to the bathroom if you need to, so hurry. It may be helpful to have a watch and time it.
If it's too hard to get to your locker between every period, try going after every other period- before school get the stuff for first and second period, after second period get the stuff for third and fourth, etc.
Memorize your locker combination and get a lot of practice using it.
If you can't get to where you need to be in five minutes (this is called being tardy), you may get detention, have the school call your parents, and get suspended or expelled if you continue to be late.

, If you can carry around a backpack or bag, it may be helpful, but if you can't, you certainly don't want to get in trouble!


Oftentimes it's against the rules to wear hats.
Some schools do not appreciate students eating snacks in the halls or classrooms.
If you have health issues or concerns, talk to the administration office. You may want to bring a parent with you when you do this, as some secretaries can be very cross or strict.

, If you are going on vacation, are sick, or have a doctor's appointment, do not just miss school. Have your parents call the front office and tell them that they know you are absent and are okay with it. If you don't, you could get detention for an unexcused absence. You may even be suspended or expelled if it happens too often.


Talk to your teachers in person to see if you need to do make up work, or if they have a website you can check to find missing assignments.

, The curriculum the junior high uses may be very different from the curriculum you used at home.


If you don't understand some of the material, because you were studying something else, have your parents explain this to your teacher.
If you've already covered the material, you don't need to shout it to the world. Talk to your parents, and, if you decide you should, talk to the teacher about getting something new to do. There is no need to say this in front of everyone else.
You may have already covered the material (or you may be at the same place as your peers are), but with different terms or slightly different methods. This can really throw you off track, so consider talking to your parents about studying the textbook together if you have a problem.

, When you see someone, smile at them (give your best smile). Wave or beckon them over if you know them. If you don't, introduce yourself.


If you already know them, call them by name to show that you remember them.
Ask them about their day or compliment them on something (I really like the way you did your hair. Will you show me how to do it?).
Make eye contact. Don't stare at the rest of their face, hair, clothes, or even what they're holding (unless you are complimenting that thing, then look at it for a few seconds before going back to eye contact).
Be genuinely interested in what they have to say.

,


Which people have been friends since kindergarten?
Which people don't have many friends or look left out?
Which people like a few close relationships?
Which people like lots of loose relationships?
Which people have a crush on each other or are dating?
Try to figure out which people would like to have you as a friend.

, If someone doesn't have a lot of friends, they would probably welcome it if you talked to them.


Decide which kinds of people you like to hang out with.
Get to know more people - variety is good.

, If you are being bullied, get help immediately.


Look the bully in the eye and tell them to stop. Explain that you do not appreciate the behavior they are demonstrating.
Don't resist physically unless they are already hurting you - but even then, only shove them away so that you can go get help.
Talk to your parents, a teacher, or another adult you can trust.
If you see someone else being bullied, go up to the bully and tell them to stop. Then invite the person being bullied to go sit with you.
Talk to an adult if someone else continues to be bullied.

, With electives, pursue your interests! Consider what your friends will be doing. Consider what you want to do. Then decide how much you want to pick your choice and how much you want to be with your friends. Choose which electives you think will work best for you.

You should be applying to at least two schools; three is even better.,
Start early!,
Grades, grades, grades!,
Testing!,
Resume!,
Teacher Recommendations!,
The Interview!,
Go to school events!,
Make sure all your applications and recommendations get in on time.,
You applications and recommendations are usually done in December.,
If you don't get accepted into your first choice of school, don't be too upset.,
If you do get accepted to the school of your choice, congratulations!,
Don't stop working hard even after you have been accepted.",How to Get Into the High School of Your Choice," The more backup you have, the more likely it is for you to get accepted. However, you don't really want to apply to more than four, because it costs money to apply, and you have to interview at all the schools you apply to.;
, The place to start is in fifth grade, not eight! You want to get your grades up and participate in as many extra-curriculum activities as possible. Starting something in eighth grade looks like you're trying to do it to impress the high school!

, The high schools look at your report card of seventh grade and the first trimester of eighth grade. Having high grades is a very good idea! Try to aim for 20% and above. If you have other skills, show them to the school.

, Your ITBS (Iowa Test of Basic Skills) scores are sent to the high schools you're applying to, so make sure you try to do well. Also, Most high schools make you take an entrance exam. Catholic high schools usually use the HSPT. Other private high schools use the ISEE. Boarding schools use the SSAT. Jewish high schools on the East Coast go by the BJES. You are required to take the SHSAT for Specialized high schools in New York City. You should sign up to take the test at your favorite school to show them that they are first on your list. However, if that isn't possible, you can take it at another location and have the score sent. You want to do extremely well on these tests, and you don't want your real one to be the first time you've taken it. If possible, contact a tutoring agency about three months in advance. This gives you time to learn all the vocabulary you might encounter and learn tricks for math sections and reading comprehension. You could have a private tutor in which study sessions are tailored to your needs, or go to an agency such as Renaissance Kids. If you do not want to be tutored, buy a preparation book, which will teach you the tricks and will usually include a practice test in the back. Take at least one practice test administered like the real thing before you actually take the real thing.

, Try to participate in activities you like out of school. Sports, choir, alter-serving, martial arts, piano/other instrument, academic decathlon, chess, dancing, and Student council all look amazing to high schools. However, make sure you like the activity and aren't doing it just for high schools. Don't do too much, either, or your grades will suffer.

, Your teachers hold your fate in their hands. If you are a talkative student who never does their homework, the teacher isn't going to lie! Again, it's better to start early on this one. Do all your homework from your sixth grade year, don't talk in class, and if you have trouble go to the teacher afterwards for help. Try to make friends with your teachers-if the teacher likes you, it will show in the amazing recommendation you will be given!

, The interview is an extremely important part of the admissions process. If you have a full resume, amazing grades, great score on standardized test, and recommendations extolling you, this is the high school's chance to see who you are as a person and see if you're really right for that school. If you shake hands, make eye contact. Try to include the extra activities you do when they ask questions. The hard part is not to sound like a braggart. Remember, always be true to yourself. If you are pretending, they'll notice! If it is asked if the school is your first choice, LIE! The schools rarely accept you if you say that they are only a backup! YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THEY ARE YOUR FIRST CHOICE IF YOU WISH TO GET ACCEPTED! Try to show how unique you are, and what you would add to the school community. Be extremely polite, don't wear casual clothes, and don't get too nervous. Remember, even though the interview is important it is only 1/5 of what you are judged on!

, Come to the open house, ask for a shadow day, if they are putting on a musical, go to it. This not only gives you a good taste of the school but it also shows the school how committed you are and how much you want to be there.

, In some schools the teachers will take care of this, but in others you must approach them. Most high schools want a recommendation from the English teacher and the Math teacher. However, you can ask for personal recommendations from other teachers, too.

, The standardized test should be taken by January, or, at the latest, early February. However, you won't know if you have been accepted or not until early March. Don't waste time and energy worrying! Keep your grades up and apply yourself to the extra activities you do. Don't let your grades fall in the second trimester; some schools have waiting lists and some acceptances are only if you keep your grades up.

, Maybe it's just not the right place for you. Most schools allow you to send your acceptance as late as the end of March, so don't hurry to send in a ""yes"" to your backup. If you didn't get in, you're probably high on the waiting list, so wait until the end of March before making your final decision.

, Send in your reply immediately, so that the schools knows that you are coming. Send ""No thanks!"" to all your backup schools as soon as possible too, so that someone on their waiting list can get in and doesn't have to wait.

, If the process has given you better study habits, you want to keep them! The schools you applied to are probably hard, so make the most of the rest of your junior high education because you may need it!

Notice whether your classmate is having signs of a panic attack.,
Quietly get your teacher's attention.,
Ask your classmate if they are having a panic attack.,
Ask your teacher if you can accompany them to the nurse's office.,
Offer reassurance in the hallway.,
Offer water.,
Engage them in idle chatter as you walk.,
Explain what happened to the school nurse when you arrive there.,
Stay for as long as needed.,
Act casual but reassuring if you are walking back to class with your classmate.",How to Help a Classmate with Panic Attacks," Here are some of the symptoms that you may observe in them. Your classmate may have some but not all of the following...


Rapid, shallow breathing or other labored breathing
Appears frightened
Uncontrollable, nervous shaking
Clutching chest or stomach
Dizziness or clumsiness; may clutch their desk or surroundings for balance;
, Your worried expression will signal to the teacher that something is wrong. If possible, beckon the teacher over and speak in a quiet voice. This will attract less attention from your classmates, and embarrass the panic attack victim less.

, They may be unable to speak, so watch for shaking their head or nodding. They may be unsure if they haven't had panic attacks before, or if the disorder is undiagnosed.



Asthma attacks and autistic shutdowns can also resemble panic attacks. In case of asthma, your classmate needs an inhaler and possibly medical help, and if it's an autistic shutdown, they need a quiet place to recover.

, Removing your classmate from the room right away will help, because they won't feel pressure to remain composed in front of their peers. As this is a medical issue, your teacher will understand.


You may want to pack up your and your classmate's stuff to bring, especially if the bell will ring soon. It's best not to ask your classmate to carry anything, because they may not have full control over their hands and arms.

, Assure them that you're here to help, and use a patient and helpful tone of voice to make it clear that you aren't judging them. Offer to help them take deep breaths. Encourage them to place their hand on their stomach as they slowly inhale, and direct them to make their stomach expand as they breathe in. These ""belly breaths"" can curb hyperventilation and begin calming them.

, Drinking from a drinking fountain, or splashing cold water on their face, may help them feel safer and more grounded. If you see a bathroom or drinking fountain, point it out and ask if they'd like to stop there. If they think it'll help them, they will.

, They may do more listening than talking, which is okay. Ask a question or two about them, preferably one that can be answered with a short answer (as talking may be difficult for them). Find out something they like, and then talk about it;if they like dogs, mention your friend's lovable dog, if they like Disney movies, talk about your favorite Disney songs, and if their favorite class is science, talk about your wacky science teacher. Sometimes acting like everything is going to be fine will convince them that it really will be okay.

, Describe your friend's symptoms, and what you've done so far to help. The nurse may have questions for you and your classmate.


For example: ""I noticed in class that Mark was breathing really heavily and he looked very pale. He said he was having a panic attack, so I took him here. We did some deep breathing together, and he got a drink from the drinking fountain on the way.""

, The nurse may send you back to class immediately, or you may stay with your classmate while they figure out what to do. Your classmate may go home, rest in the nurse's office for a while, or head back to class if they think they can handle it.

, They may not want to talk about the attack, so don't mention it unless they bring it up. Instead, continue with the idle chatter—it can be reassuring, and lets them know you don't think any less of them as a person.


If they want to talk about it, listen well and assure them that it wasn't their fault.
Be supportive if they mention seeing a counselor, doctor, or therapist about it. They may be afraid that this will mean something is wrong with them, so if you treat it like a normal thing, they might feel less worried.

Ask for an IEP.,
Help plan the IEP.,
Define the aide's qualifications.,
Get a private evaluation.,
Consider alternatives.",How to Get a Personal Aide at School1," If your child has special needs, they should have an IEP (Individual Education Program). Make an appointment with your child's teacher to discuss creating your child's IEP. If your child does not yet have an IEP, make an appointment to create one.


Prepare for the IEP. If you have any documents that support your case, bring them. This could include medical records, notes from previous teachers, etc.
Schedule a conference with your child's teacher and the principal.
Ask the school to have your child assessed by specialists in the school system. This will not cost you any money.
Based on the findings of the evaluation, an IEP will be created.;
, To arrange the IEP, the principal might want to hold a meeting that includes you and any professionals with information to contribute. This might include special education teachers, previous teachers of your child, and home-aides or social workers who work with your child). If your child is over 16, they may also be included.


Invite anyone you think can help contribute, such as after-school educators or coaches.
If you don't feel your school is treating the situation fairly, you may hire an attorney to accompany you to the meeting.
If you can't afford an attorney, the school system may provide you with one for a discount or for free., While you participate in the planning of the IEP, make sure you state very specific requirements for the individual who will be helping your child. Advocate that the IEP specify hiring someone with a specific degree, certificate, or a certain number of years of experience in the needs of children like yours.


It is frequently a challenge for schools to afford properly qualified individuals, but they must make every attempt to hire someone who fits the requirements of the IEP.

, If your child's evaluation does not say they need an assistant, but you believe they do, you can have your child independently evaluated. Visit a specialist in your child's condition and ask them for an evaluation.


Under FAPE, the school board must consider all independent evaluations.In some cases, the school will conduct their own IEE. This happens when the school system does not have anyone qualified to evaluate your child.

, One-to-one aide's can make all the difference for your child. In many cases, however, a one-to-one aide restricts a child's developing independence.Look around for schools with integrated classrooms, or other schools that emphasize peer support.


If it is developmentally feasible, the goal should be to reduce the presence of the aide until they are no longer needed.

"
"
Inquire as to whether your school has a peer-helper program.,
Explain exactly what you need.,
Establish a good relationship with your peer-helpers.,
Communicate about your needs and preferences.",How to Get a Personal Aide at School2," Students like this might come with many names, such as ""buddies,"" ""tutors,"" ""peer-buddies"" ""peer-to-peer supporters"" or other titles. Go to the office to ask for assistance, or have a parent or guardian make an appointment., Do you need someone to help you get from class to class? Your school might have students who volunteer for this activity and can take you on. Someone to share notes with you? Your school may assign a different student in each of your classes who is willing to take on this responsibility, or just one student who is in your grade.Some schools offer an elective for students who volunteer to be a personal aide for a period every day.
Your school may prefer to have professional adults take care of tasks like this.

, Make friends with your peer helper if that feels natural. If it doesn't, you don't have to force it. You can have a friendly but impersonal relationship as long as it gets the job done.


Hopefully, your helper will be timely, friendly, and easy to work with.
If your peer helper is consistently late, unfriendly, or doesn't communicate well with you, you can ask for a different one from the office.
Your relationship should be mutually supportive. General education peers benefit from explaining things they've just learned, or from feeling helpful during breaks, and you benefit from their time., If your helper talks in a condescending way, or tries to help you with things you don't need help with, gently explain what you need and what you don't need. You might say, ""It's nice of you to offer me reminders, but I don't have any trouble with my memory. I need copies of your notes because I can't write quickly, not because I think differently.""You can also explain how it makes you feel: ""I feel like you don't understand what I need. Please don't speak to me like I can't process normal information. It makes me feel unseen.""
If your helper blows off your comments or doesn't change their habits, you can ask for a teacher to help reinforce the message, or you can ask for a different aide.

Check the weather.,
Check your school’s hotline.,
Know your school's weather policies.,
Go to bed as you normally would.",How to Find Out if School Is Cancelled for Bad Weather1," The weather forecast for tomorrow won’t always give you an accurate prediction, but it will give you an idea. Check online or dial into your local news station to see tomorrow’s forecast. Look at the percentage prediction of snow. If the forecast calls for over an 80% chance, then the chances are high.


You should also take a look at the hourly forecast for tomorrow. See if the precipitation is suppose to increase or decrease as the day progresses.;
, Parents and students may be able to call a number provided by the school to find out information on school delays or cancellations. Since it comes from your school directly, this is the most reliable way to obtain information. Most schools are equipped with such a system, but check to be sure before the next big weather problem hits.


You may also check the school's website, if it has one, for a delay/cancellation notice.
Many websites will list this information clearly on the front page.

, The best way to plan ahead is to review your school's policies on inclement weather. Review your school's handbook or website for any information on your school's rules for weather. If a school is prepared, they will have this documented for parents and students.


For example: a school might cancel school without question, if snow reaches above three feet. School could be canceled if the power is out in the school or neighboring communities.
Another common policy is to cancel or delay school if public transportation if down.

, This means having all your homework done and packed away as it normally would be. You should also mentally expect there will be school the next day. Several snow day predictions have been wrong. You don't want to wake up to disappointment or panic because you haven't studied for your math test!


If school is cancelled, then you are in for a surprise! It makes the fun even better. Even if it's not cancelled, you can do your research and be the first to know about the next big snowstorm to hit your town!

Check your local news.,
Check with your school.,
Ask your peers.,
Listen to a local radio station.,
Go to school.",How to Find Out if School Is Cancelled for Bad Weather2," Right when you wake up you should check the new affiliate's website for school delays and cancellations. They should have an accurate list that will normally be refreshed every few minutes for updated information.


You could alternatively turn on the local news. Near the bottom of the screen they’ll show school cancellations and delays based off county districts.If you attend a private school, your school information may not be listed on the news.
Check this site for information: http://www.cancellations.com/

, Many schools will send out an automated phone call or email to all student’s homes. If your school does not do this, you can call the school directly or go to its website. Your school should have a inclement weather hotline you can refer to., If you’re not able to get a clear answer, call a friend and ask them if they know any information. Do not call them too early in the morning.


Make sure you can trust your friend. It’d be unfortunate for you to find out school’s cancelled when it isn’t.

, Some local radio stations include delay and cancellation information for schools. Survey through your stations until you get the local news station. You probably won’t hear about school delays from your classic rock station., If all else fails, get ready and go to school like you would on a normal day. If the parking lot is empty, doors are locked etc, then school is most likely closed. Even if your school is open, there is always a chance that you will be sent home early due to inclement weather.


If you weren’t able to get a clear answer, you probably have to go to school.

Prepare by learning about the schools.,
Attend as many of the Open Evenings as you can.,
Try to attend the Headteacher speeches.,
Try to have a clear idea of what a 'good' secondary school means to you.,
Study for the exams.,
Make sure you have applied for the exam.,
Be ready for the exam date and do the best you can.

,
Apply to a secondary school by the 31st of October in the UK.,
Make sure you apply as soon as you can.,
Wait until March to find out which school you got into.",How to Get Into a Good Secondary School in England," Around September to October of the year before you hope to join the new school, you'll want to go to Open Evenings or Open Days. These are evenings where the school is opened especially for prospective students to visit the school and take a look around.;
, Make sure you organise the dates and get to the evenings with plenty of time to look around - you don't want to be rushed. Take time to look around different subjects and look at course content and previous student's work.

, Make sure you bring your parents along and pay close attention to what the Head tells you about the school.

, This could be good grades at GCSE; the extra-curricular activities they offer or which school is closest to you. Make sure to compare the different schools.

, If you've decided you want to get into a Grammar School (this is a school in which you have to pass exams to attend) make sure you have prepared for the exams. This could be doing practice tests with your parents or revising things such as verbal reasoning or maths.

, You'll need to ask your parents or legal guardians to do this for you.

,, You'll need to apply to at least three different schools. Ensure that you meet any relevant residential requirements.

, Check with your local council to find out when applications open. Ask your parent/guardian to do this.


The earlier you apply, the more likely you'll get your first choice of secondary school.

, Remember that it isn't just about which school you go to. If you want to achieve, you'll need to put in effort yourself. You can go to what is considered a 'worse' school and do better than somebody who goes to what is considered a 'good' school but slacks off. If you try your hardest, you will succeed.

Write down your primary reason for wanting to change schools.Before you can make a good argument to your parents, you need to understand why you really want to change schools.,
Outline a timeliness for changing schools.,
Look at schools you’d like to attend.Before you talk to your parents about switching schools, you want to look at alternative schools you might like to attend.,
Write down your positive reasons for changing schools.,
Write it out and practice.,
Come up with an introduction.,
Keep your words calm and mature.,
Write out your positives.,
Make your conclusion open-ended.,
Bring up the subject gradually.,
Do nice things for your parents before you try to talk to them.This is a classic part of persuasion in any situation.,
Pick a good time to talk.,
Write them a letter.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Switch Schools," You need to be able to state this reason clearly. Some reasons you might want to change schools, include:


You’ve been dealing with bullying, and you don’t think it’s going to get better or you don’t feel comfortable staying around those people.
You feel lost in the crowd of a large school with large classes, and you’d like a smaller environment.
You don’t think your school is helping you academically. You might need a more challenging school or a school where you could help more individualized help.
There’s another school that has programs you’re really interested in, like a superior drama, music, art or band program.
As you are writing down this reason, make sure it is important enough to switch. For example, if you just don’t like math, and your school gives you a lot of homework, that’s not a good reason to switch. Or, if your boyfriend or best friend goes to a different school, this is not necessarily a good enough reason to switch.;
, This will affect how you approach your parents about your situations. If you give your parents exact dates that you want to change schools, it will make it easier for them to say yes and not put off letting you switch.


If you’re being bullied, you might want to make a mid-year switch.
However, if you want to change to a school that will push you more academically, then you could consider switching for the next academic year, as this will be easier to arrange.
Make a calendar on a piece of paper, or print out a calendar, and write the date you want to switch schools. Then, write down a date to have a conversation with your parents about changing. You want to give them as much advance notice as possible, at least a few months.

,


That way, you can tell your parents why you’d like to go to a different school.
Look at schools based on your reason for switching. For example, if you want to change schools because you don’t feel challenged academically, look at schools that have a lot of honors programs.

, It can be tempting to only talk about all the bad things about your experience at your current school. While it’s important to tell your parents what’s going on to make you want to switch, you also want to show them the benefits of changing.


Write a list of all the good things you find out about other schools.
If you have an friends, or even friends on Facebook, that go to schools you’d like to consider, ask them to tell you what they like about the school, so you can pass it along to your parents.

, You should approach this conversation almost like you are preparing to give an important speech.You want to write out how you want the conversation to go. Visualize it going well.


Practice saying all your reasons out loud to yourself in the mirror or to a friend.

, You want to get your parents full attention as you convince them to help you in switching schools.


Say something like, “Hey, Mom and Dad! Can we all sit down at the table together? I have something I’d like to talk about with you, and I’d really love to hear what you think.”
You want to let your parents know that this is important to you and that you appreciate them listening to your thoughts.

, Even if your parents don’t respond at first, you don’t want to come across as whiney because this will make it less likely that your parents will support you in switching schools. At the same time, be honest.You want them to know how much staying in your current situation will hurt you. Make your statements sincere and to-the-point.


If you’re being bullied, don’t be too embarrassed to show them how much it’s affecting your performance at school and how much it hurts you.
Say something like, “There is a group of kids in my class that write mean notes to me every day, and steal things out of my desk. They call me names, and it makes me sad. I’ve asked them to stop, and I’ve talked to the teacher, but they still do it behind her back. I have a hard time enjoying school or focusing because I can’t stop thinking about it.”
If you think you need a school with more academic attention say something like, “I’ve been having a hard time finishing my work in school because I don’t understand it. There are so many kids in my class that the teacher usually doesn’t have time to help me.”
Or, if you want more of a challenge, say, “I get all A’s at school because the work is too easy. I finish all my work first, and I end up just sitting there in class. My teacher doesn’t have time to make special assignments for me.”

, These are the reasons that changing would improve your overall life. Some examples of positive reasons to practice might be:


“I’m really interested in learning to play music. Jackson Middle School has the best band program in the state, and it’s only ten minutes away. I’d really get to work on my skills there.”
“St. John’s School only has 10 students in each class. If I went there, I’d be able to get more help with my work, and my grades would get better.”
“Central Middle School has a lot of science and math classes I could take. They even have a Physics class. I want to be an engineer one day, and it’s never too early to start learning.”

, You don’t want your parents to have to decide right then whether you can change. That pressure will make them more likely to say “no” out of convenience.


End the conversation with a statement like: “Thanks for listening to me. Take some time to think about what I said, and let me know what you think. I really hope you’ll think about letting me change schools”

, When you sit down to talk to your parents about schools, you don’t want them to be completely surprised by the fact that you want to change. If you have an emergency, like severe bullying, you should talk to your parents immediately. Otherwise, let them get a sense of your situation before you ask them to talk with you.


Make it clear to them that you’re unhappy in your school.
Every day, tell them one little thing that bothered you at school when they ask about your day. For example, let them know, “We got our math tests back today, and I didn’t do so well. I went to ask my teacher a few questions about what I got wrong, but she didn’t have time to talk to me.”

, Be especially kind to your parents in the few weeks before you want to actually ask them to switch schools.


Don’t argue with them or talk back to them.
Do the little things they ask the first time like cleaning your room and picking up after yourself.

, You don’t want to sit down and talk to your parents about switching schools while they are stressed or in a hurry. Find them when they are relaxing and ask them if they have a minute to talk to you.


For example, a good time to talk might be after dinner once everyone is full and the house is clean.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to talk to your parents about certain situations. This especially helps if you’re not sure how to let your parents know you’re being bulled.


After you give them the letter, they’ll come approach the conversation with you. This can take some of the pressure off of starting a serious conversation.
Especially if you’re being bullied, you can use a letter to let your parents know exactly what your bullies are doing to you, so you don’t have to say it out loud, but your parents will still know how serious your situation is.

Once you learn to budget your time well, you will find that homework and other demands are more manageable and you will even have more free time to pursue your own interests.


Get a planner and write down assignment due dates and important events.
Try to have a set schedule, such as planning ahead to do homework in the evenings and other activities at the same time throughout the week. Sticking to a schedule will help you feel like you have your life under control.;
, Homework and grades are undeniably two of the biggest school-caused stressors so doing your best to succeed in these two areas will make your life that much easier.


Stick to a consistent schedule of doing homework in the same place every day. Prepare a space that is free of distractions so that you can concentrate and complete your work quickly.
If you are struggling in a subject, get a tutor or ask a teacher for help outside of class.

, You should aim for at least 7-8 hours each night and even more if you are a teenager. Try to keep a regular sleep schedule since, when deprived of sleep, it makes it that much more difficult to focus and perform at your best in school.


If you have trouble falling asleep, limit your use of electronics such as computers and phones for an hour before your bedtime. You can also try a nightly relaxation ritual, such as a night time cup of non-caffeinated tea.
Don’t cram the night before. Studies have shown that cramming instead of sleeping is actually counterproductive. Sleep is so necessary for our bodies to function that if a student sacrifices sleep over studying, they are more likely to perform more poorly the next day.

, While scheduling your days, make sure you also have downtime and aren’t stretching yourself too thin, otherwise you may experience burnout.


If using a planner to record assignments and other activities, be sure to block out times, such as on weekends, where you have no plans.
If you feel like you are constantly on the run, take some time to reflect on which activities you can cut out. For example, if you are struggling to juggle debate team, honors classes, and sports, you may want to consider dropping sports or whichever extracurricular activity is eating up too much of your time.

, Stress is an inevitable part of life, but school often comes with a unique set of stresses. Take some time to reflect on what challenges you face in school and then work to overcome them.


Make a list of what is stressing you out, such as bullying or not having enough time alone. Then brainstorm possible solutions. Even if you can’t solve all of your problems, sometimes just identifying and working to solve these issues can help decrease your overall level of stress.

, As tempting as processed snacks and sugar may be, they can cause many health problems and even contribute to depression. Eating lots of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will help you feel better and keep a clear head.

, Poor psychological health has long been known to affect school performance and the ability to learn. Meditation and other relaxation techniques, along with aiming for a positive outlook in life, will help you deal with the stresses and challenges of school.

, Exercise has countless mental, physical and psychological benefits and has been proven to make people happier and more able to deal with stress. Experiment with different forms such as running, dance, soccer, or yoga until you find something you enjoy and look forward to doing on a regular basis.

, Extracurricular activities, such as school clubs, sports, or other personal interests, can help keep stress levels down and develop character.

, Making fun plans for weekends, evenings, and school vacations will mean that you always have something to look forward to, no matter how stressful things at school get.

, Family members, teachers, guidance counselors and even students can all be there for you when you’re feeling overwhelmed.

, Peer pressure happens when other people pressure you to do or say certain things in order to fit in. While it’s natural to want to be accepted by others, peer pressure can become a big source of stress when other students pressure you to engage in activities that go against your own beliefs, such as breaking the law or cheating.


If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, learn to say no and walk away. It may be hard but you will find that sticking up for yourself gets easier over time.
Seek out a peer group that is open and nonjudgmental.

, Bullying (repeated aggressive behavior, including physical, verbal, or relational) is unfortunately all too common in schools but learning to effectively cope with and protect yourself is essential .


If you are being bullied, don’t blame yourself and try to maintain your inner self-confidence as much as possible. Stay resilient by remembering that bullies often hurt others because they themselves are hurting.
Get help. Though nobody wants to be a snitch, if you are worried for your safety, seek a trusted adult and let them know what is happening.
Don’t be a bully yourself. Always treat others with respect and kindness and you will find that, more often than not, those same behaviors will be reciprocated.

, Always be polite and try your best in your classes and you’ll find that most teachers will want to help you succeed.


If you have any teachers that you feel especially comfortable with or look up to, don’t be afraid to let them know. Having just one teacher as an ally can help you when you are struggling socially or academically.
Don’t be a teacher’s pet. Don’t go out of your way to try to impress teachers or you may just end up alienating yourself.

, Having even just one or two good friends who share your values and interests can make all the difference in getting through a school day. Put yourself out there and join clubs or take up a new hobby to meet new people.

"
Take a moment to look at your future goals.,
Choose subjects you enjoy.,
Choose subjects that offer a (reasonable) challenge.,
Choose classes that you are required to take.,
Make a list of all the subjects you want to do, and narrow it down.,
Consult your parents.",How to Choose the Right Subjects at School," If you don't have any, decide what they will be. Don't just do a course because your friends are, or your brother is. You are your own individual.


What career do you want to pursue? It's a good idea to take classes that are relevant to the job you hope to have in the future. For example, if you want to be a doctor, biology, science, and math are courses you might want to take. Especially if you are in high school or college, your career choice is a huge deciding factor.
Think about what you want to have on your resume. Are there any ""extra"" classes that maybe aren't relevant to your career choice, but are subjects you are particularly interested in or teach you a valuable life skill? Things like band, art, or a language fall into this category. These things are good to put on your resume in the future because it makes you stand out more when applying for jobs.;
, These classes make your life less stressful, bu they may be recommended subjects that you need to fulfill for your education goals.


When you enjoy subjects, you will often listen more, work harder, and overall do better. All subjects are worthwhile, and even if a few subjects you choose aren't all that relevant to the future you want to have, that doesn't really matter. What matters most is that you enjoy what you are learning and are following a career path you are excited about. Motivation plays a key role in your success as a student.

,


If subjects are too easy for you, you will easily get bored and will lack motivation. If they are too hard, you will get frustrated and likely not understand the material well enough to succeed. Take classes that offer you a challenge you are willing to take.
Look at how well you've done in past classes to help determine what level you are at. If you were struggling at math last year, for example, you probably shouldn't be taking the advanced math course. If you were excelling in math, however, the advanced math course may be a good choice. Biting off more than you can chew or taking the easy road does not make you look cool; be honest with yourself when judging your abilities and picking classes.

,


Don't get too excited picking subjects that you forget the ones that are required for you to take! Pick out your required subjects first so that you know how many other choices you can still make.

,


If you need to choose, say, five subjects, make sure you include a couple backups on your list. You probably won't be able to take every class you really want to take; accept that before you start.
If you end up with way more subjects on your list than you are allowed to take, cut the ones you would least enjoy, or any subjects that have overlapping topics. Keep narrowing it down until you have enough classes, plus 1-3 backups.

,


You get the final say, but you should make sure your parents approve of your selected classes and career path. If they question any of the classes you'd like to take, calmly discuss the matter. Screaming and yelling at each other won't help you keep your classes.
Your parents can help point out any classes they think you'd like or that they think you should take. Remember that you get the final say, but you should seriously consider different possibilities. Who knows? Maybe a class you thought looked lame could turn out to be fun!

"
"
Think about your interests.,
Identify your strengths.,
Think about skills you want to develop.",How to Choose Extracurricular Activities1," Before you start considering specific activities, take a step back. Think about what excites you. Find your passion or passions. Use those to decide on activities that will keep you interested for a long time.Ask yourself:How do I spend my free time? Reading? Writing? Playing sports or musical instruments? Dreaming about visiting France?
What section of the bookstore or library do I always end up in? Sports? Science? Travel?
What makes me feel satisfied and accomplished? Helping others? Organizing events? Being an important part of a team?;
, Now that you have a better idea of what you like to do in general, pinpoint those that you excel at. Ask yourself what skills they showcase. Then find activities that require the same ones. Guarantee that you will enjoy yourself by choosing an activity that lets you shine. These may include:Mental skills (such as continued learning and applied knowledge), which are used in things like math, science, and chess.
Physical fitness and motor skills (like balance, coordination, and stamina). These are needed for activities like sports and dance.
Social skills (such as communication, leadership, and teamwork). These can be found in team sports as well as other group projects, like the school paper or yearbook.

, In addition to your strengths, identify what you would like to improve about yourself. Use activities as a way to round yourself out. Seek out new challenges, without the added stress of having to earn good grades at them.You can use activities to develop general skills that you may lack. For example, if you feel like your social skills could use improvement, look for activities that involve team projects and strong communication, like theater or team sports.
You can also apply your current skillset toward building new talents. For instance, if you have a history of playing aggressive sports that have taught you to be assertive, consider other activities that demand the same self-confidence, like the debate club.

"
"
Plan for the year ahead.,
Find out what activities are available.,
Look into each one.",How to Choose Extracurricular Activities2," If possible, begin your search well before the new school year. Give yourself plenty of time to meet any requirements. These may include:


Fees you have to pay in order to join or use equipment. Private music lessons will charge you for each session, for instance, while the school band may charge you a rental fee if you don't have your own instrument.
Whether any travel is involved. Say you join the swim team, but they practice off-campus at a private pool. Is transportation provided by the school, or do you have to get there on your own?
What grade point average (GPA) is required for you to be eligible. To participate in school activities, you will most likely need to maintain passing grades.
Whether new members are welcome at any time, or if they have to apply by a certain deadline. Many team sports will have try-outs, for instance. Volunteer groups, on the other hand, will probably welcome you at any time of year.

, Search your school’s website for a complete list of all the sports, clubs, and organizations that it provides. Also look for calendar details, such as start- and end-dates, plus event schedules, to make sure it won't get in the way of anything else going on in your life. If the website seems incomplete, talk with your guidance counselor or adviser. Also look for other organizations in your community, such as:Local churches and volunteer centers, like food banks or the Red Cross.Private clubs, lessons, and organizations, like the YMCA or the Boy & Girl Scouts.
Recreational centers run by your town.
Job opportunities., Once you have a list of activities that match your interests, do a little research so you have a better idea of what to expect. Make certain that you are comfortable with the level of commitment they expect from you. Also make sure that their culture is a good match for your own personality. For instance, with team sports, do they practice good sportsmanship or a win-at-all-costs attitude? Whatever the activity is, make sure the people involved will be a good fit for you personally.Visit their website or social media pages if they have any.
Speak with current and former members for their personal take.
Ask to sit in on meetings or practices to observe them in action.

"
"
Think ahead.,
Look for leadership opportunities.,
Sample early, then narrow down.",How to Choose Extracurricular Activities3," Whether you’re in college, high school, or lower, think about the future. Consider your goals beyond graduation. Then think about how your current activities will reflect on you in light of those goals.


If you’re planning on applying to college or grad school, expect admission boards to look for long-term commitment. Only join a couple of activities. Stick with them year after year. Don't jump from one to the next every month or two.If you’re entering the workforce after graduation, think about how the experiences offered by each activity could strengthen your resume.Planning a food drive in school, for example, can demonstrate initiative, leadership, and organizational skills, which most employers will be looking for.

, Find out which activities promote advancement. Stand out from the crowd. Choose activities that will highlight your commitment by seeking more prominent positions and responsibilities.Leadership roles aren't restricted to titles like “captain” or “treasurer.” Volunteering to take on extra responsibilities is a great way to set yourself apart from other people who do the bare minimum. Evaluate each activity by how much room there is for personal initiative.
For example, Sally might have been elected vice-president of your National Honor Society based on popularity. But your NHS adviser will undoubtedly write you a glowing recommendation if you're always the first one to volunteer for extra work that needs to be done.

, Remember: just because something looks great on paper doesn’t guarantee that it will really be all that great for you personally. Don’t be afraid of trial-and-error at first. Use your freshman and sophomore years to explore your options. Once you have a firmer idea of what this or that activity actually involves, decide which one(s) you want to stick with.First and foremost, base your decision on whether you or not you truly enjoy this activity. If you love French in general, but start dreading each meeting of your school's French club, choose something else.
If you're in college, figure out ways to complement your major.For example, if you're a zoology major, think about volunteering at an animal shelter.
For high schoolers considering college, don’t worry about the subject matter. Admission boards are less concerned with the subject and more interested in your commitment to it. So If you really look forward to, say, the A/V club, stick with it even if you have no interest in becoming a cameraman or anything like that.

Go to bed at a reasonable time the night before.,
Get up early in the morning, but not before 6 am.,
Be prepared.,
Expect people to say ""Happy birthday"" when you get into the classroom!,
Don't let rude people ruin your day.,
Focus on your lessons.,
Do fun things at lunch.,
When you go home, do things you enjoy (like using the computer, watching TV, reading, listening to music etc.",How to Enjoy Your Birthday at School," Even though it seems a little bit early, a time of about 9:30 pm (or earlier) is good for teenagers, or who will be the next day! Being tired may ruin your day and you might suffer from tiredness, lack of concentration and headaches. Avoid it by getting the sleep you need. Use a comfy pillow and duvet, take a shower,and do some reading before you switch out the light, as this could help you to sleep better.;
, Get ready for school and look forward to everyone saying happy birthday! Have everything ready. After all, it would be a shame to get to school late and miss your friends, plus be late for lessons.

, Once you get to the school gate, people will almost certainly say ""Happy Birthday!"" and give you hugs. If this happens, say something friendly, like ""Thanks!"" or ""Can't wait till tonight!"" If you receive presents, say thank you. Of course, it is entirely your choice whether you open them there in front of your friends. You could just pop them in your bag to save for later. However, do look at the parcel, be careful with presents, say thank you and be appreciative.

, Chat, be friendly and smile to show your wonderful teeth!

, Of course, there may be some silly people who are nasty to people, whether it's their birthday or not. This can be upsetting, even if it's just a stupid comment that people say. A good way to deal with this is to spend time with your friends, ones who are really nice, caring and talkative, not your so called ""mates"" who make you feel miserable. If someone is mean enough to be spiteful you could say ""It's my birthday today so I'm going to do things that I enjoy, and not waste my time talking to you"" or, if they call you a name, something like ""That's not true. Now if you wouldn't mind, I have a birthday to enjoy, so bye!"" and you could walk away. Names can really hurt, so try not to let people ruin your day. Just think of the presents and cards you'll get later and you will probably cheer up. However, do confide in a close friend if someone is upsetting you a lot. They can support you and be a friend.

, Some lessons are really great fun, and your teachers are all bound to be extra nice and pleasant to you. Listen, contribute and work hard. Getting positive comments can make your day even better!

, Eat with your mates, go to the library and read or write, even make a start on any homework you may have (after all, it means not having to do it at home and gives you extra time to do stuff like going on the computer and watching TV). You could also just hang out with your friends and chat.

,), but first finish any homework you might have (as you wouldn't want to be reminded about it when opening your presents!) Have a birthday tea with yummy food,make a special wish and eat your cake, open your presents, say thank you. Enjoy your day!

Relax and be yourself.",How to Change From Private to Public High School," While you can choose between various private schools in your area, public schools are assigned by the geographic district you live in. This means you’ll probably only have one choice.


If you don’t know which public school district your home is assigned to, go to http://schooldistrictfinder.com and type in your address.;
, You can find comprehensive public school assessments through various free, independent resources.



http://k12.niche.com, http://publicschoolreview.com and http://usnews.com/education/best-high-schools are a few good options.
Your high school’s academic ratings can have a significant impact on college acceptance., If you want to learn more about Advanced Placement, SAT/ACT preparation assistance or what kinds of classes are available, contact one of the school’s academic advisors.


You can most likely schedule a meeting to discuss these issues in depth or simply send your questions in an email.

, Most public schools ask upper-level students to give tours to new or prospective students.


Not only will you get to see the facilities but can ask your student guide questions about their experience there and even make a friend.

, The average public school class in the United States has approximately 25 students while the average private school class has 15. Consider what works best for you.


The increased attention from instructors is one of the main reasons that private schools are considered superior by many.
However, some argue that the larger class size can better prepare students for college., While public school curriculums are usually fairly similar throughout each state or school district, private school curriculums can vary drastically.For example, your new school may teach geometry in the 10th grade while you already took this subject in the 8th grade. Discuss difficulty level and subject matter with your new academic advisor and see if you can build a customized schedule to avoid going backwards or too far ahead.

, Private schools have limited budgets and may not have the variety of extracurricular activities that a public school can offer.


On the other hand, if your new school is considerably small, your old private school may actually have more clubs and organizations.

, Private schools tend to have more rules, particularly with regard to dress code.


However, public schools are managed by the government which can impose unique restrictions, particularly on freedom of speech., Private and public schools will attract different kinds of teachers that may vary in quality, experience or their approach to education.


Like the rules that students are expected to follow, the rules that teachers follow can be drastically different between public and private schools. The rate of pay also typically differs. Understanding these differences can tell you more about what kinds of teachers are hired., Students often find that the attitude, culture and socioeconomic background of students are drastically different at private and public schools.


The best way to learn more about the students at your new school is to talk to them.
You can also do some research on your school district and the people that live there.

, The biggest social difference between public and private schools is the number of other students you’ll interact with. Public schools will usually have more students in each class and enrolled at the school overall which can impact the social environment.You may notice that students at public schools come from less affluent homes. If you do come from a wealthier family, be sensitive to diverse backgrounds and don’t make assumptions about what other students can or cannot afford.
A larger school population might mean that you’re less likely to stand out. But it also means you’ll have more options in terms of friends and social circles.
If you’re comfortable with it, try to be outgoing and start conversations so you can learn more about the student culture at your new school.

, A great way to break the ice is to ask the people in your class if they’d like to form a study group.


Not only will you get a chance to talk to new people but this could help you adapt to differences in the schoolwork., It’s always a good idea to plan out your classes and academic goals ahead of time but it’s particularly important when you’re switching schools. The changes in curriculum, class availability and expectations will be most challenging if you’re caught off-guard and unprepared to deal with them.


Make a list of all the classes you plan to take for the remainder of your high school enrollment. The differences in class availability and curriculum are more likely to be significant as you get to elective and advanced-level courses.Think about your college preference ahead of time and research what high school classes will look best on your application.
Work closely with your academic advisor to ensure that there is continuity in the subjects you are studying. You don’t want to skip or repeat anything.

, There will likely be some social differences between your new and old school but they shouldn’t be overstated. If you were able to thrive socially at your previous school, you should be ok at your new one.


One of the most common mistakes people make when they adapt to a new social environment is trying too hard to fit in. If you present a personality or attitude that you are not comfortable with, you will either need to maintain that façade or appear inauthentic as you revert back to your natural self.t is better to be true to yourself from the outset and patiently seek the friends and social circles that are best for you.

Start catching up right away.,
Make a list.,
Prioritize your list.,
Prepare a schedule.",How to Catch up With School when You Have Took a Day Off1," Do not procrastinate on catching up with school. As soon as you return to school, collect any assignments you missed and ask your teachers about any tests and quizzes you need to make up. New work will start piling on fast, and if you put off catching up on old work you can fall even further behind., A list can be a handy tool to show you what you need to do to catch up. This way, you can make sure you don't miss anything. Talk to all of your teachers and make a catch-up list that incorporates work from every class.Do not just write down the subject. Write down the specific material you need to catch up on.
For example, instead of writing down ""Finish English assignment,"" write down ""Complete the 10 questions about The Outsiders.""

, After writing your list, figure what work should get done first. Some assignments may be more pressing than others.Teachers often differ in how long they give you to catch up. If your English teacher said you have until the end of the week to turn in the work you missed, you can do English homework later. If your science teacher wants the work the next day, do that first.
You should also think about which assignments will be more time consuming. If your English assignment requires a lot of writing, you may want to do that first to make sure you have enough time.

, Once you've prioritized your list, make a schedule to catch up. Carve out blocks of time where you can focus on different subjects. You can, for example, spend the first hour after school doing your science homework before working on your English homework.If you have a study hall at school, incorporate that into your schedule. You can plan on doing some of your missed work during study hall.

Decorate your classroom for the occasion.,
Assign a special homework assignment or project that's due on that day.,
Theme your lesson plans towards the number 100.,
Have some fun activities for your students to do.,
Show your students things from the last 100 days of school.,
Throw a party.",How to Celebrate the 100th Day of School," You can use things such as balloons and banners themed towards the milestone. This will show to your students that the 100th day of school is an important milestone and is something that should be celebrated.;
, Having a special homework assignment would be not only fun, but also a great way of celebrating the milestone. For example, you could have your students collect 100 of something of their choice, or build something with 100 things of their choice. You may also want to give homework assignments on the 100th day that are related to the number 100.

, For example:


Teach your students about events that happened 100 years ago.
For younger students, teach them about the number 100.
Have your students count to 100. Mix it up at times by having them count by 2's, by 5's, by 10's, etc.
Read books about the 100th day of school, or something related to the number 100. You can find a lot of books online or in your local library.
Do math problems and activities related to the number 100. For example, you can have your students write about what they would do with $100, or find different ways to make $100.
Do the 100th Day Challenge, where students find different ways to represent the number 100 through the means of arithmetic.
Have your students write about what they think the world will be like in 100 years.
Have your students write 100 words that they know.

, You could do arts and crafts, painting, games, or anything else you could think of that your students would have fun with. You can theme these towards the number 100, too.

, This could be through pictures, a scrapbook, or anything else you have in your classroom. This is a great way for you and your students to reminisce about the last 100 days of school.

, You can ask the students to bring in food and/or snacks, or bring some in yourself. You'll want to have a cake, too. You could also bring in lunch for the students to have, if you have the money to do so and if your school allows it. Bringing in pizza would be a good idea in this case.

Be happy!",How to Get a Good Reputation on the First Day of School (for Girls)," Nobody will think you're any less weird if you stink! Take a shower either the morning of the first day of school, or the night before. You can try using shower gels if you want to smell nice.;
, If you want to look good for the first day of school, you'll want to wash your hair. Use a good shampoo, making sure to rinse it out thoroughly, and let your hair air-dry.

, People won't want to talk to you if your breath smells. Make sure you brush your teeth thoroughly the night before and the morning of the first day of school. It's best to brush your teeth after you eat, so that you don't undo all your hard work! After you brush your teeth, floss and use mouthwash.

, Many people don't take care for their hair nearly as much over the summer, and chances are, you've got some pretty overgrown hair. Either get a parent to cut your hair, or go to a salon or barber. Explain what style you want, and let them have at it!


Try something new, like layers.

, Anyone who doesn't have extremely short hair needs to comb their hair to keep it from getting tangled. Using a fine-tooth comb or a brush with rubber-tipped bristles, go through your hair, being careful not to yank at any knots you might find.

, Some girls have pretty short hair and don't need to do much more than just run a comb through it. Those with longer hair, though, may want to make it look good for the first day. Consider these options for a cute, not-nerdy look.



Straighten your hair. If you already have straight hair, consider curling it.
Wear a ponytail or pigtails. If you want something more unusual, try scene pigtails.

Braid your hair.
Put your hair into a bun.
Try accessories - barrettes, headbands, and ribbons can add a neat flair to a girl's hair. And if the ribbons are in your school's colors, hey - you're showing school spirit!
If your school doesn't have policies on how to wear your hair, consider dyeing it a cool color or adding in a clip or extension of an artificial color. Common choices are pink, green, and blue.

, After a certain age, just showering won't keep you from smelling. Apply a deodorant in your underarms, and possibly an antiperspirant to keep you from sweating during the day. If aluminum (the main ingredient in most deodorants and antiperspirants) irritates your skin, try searching for other brands that don't use aluminum.

, If you're at ""that age"", your skin is probably breaking out and doesn't look so good. Use an acne wash on problem areas, and exfoliate your skin. This won't solve your acne problem entirely, but it'll definitely help.


Don't exfoliate your skin every day. This will lead to itchy and dry patches and won't look good.

, Some schools don't allow makeup, but this doesn't stop students from wearing it anyway. You may want to avoid makeup if you have acne problems to prevent it from getting worse. If you do decide to wear makeup, keep these tips in mind.


Stick to things like concealer and maybe mascara.
Don't use foundation. You're going to school - you don't need to hide your barely-there wrinkles. Nobody will care.
Try using a tinted moisturizer.
Keep it light. You don't need eyeliner or loud eyeshadow.
Consider switching certain aspects of makeup out. For example, if you want to use lip gloss, but your school doesn't allow makeup and is very strict about it, consider wearing chapstick instead. It gives your lips a shine to them, is better for your lips, and if a school authority questions you, you can just pull the chapstick tube out and prove that it doesn't violate the rules!

Avoid artificial or loud colors. Wearing a dark brown or black mascara is easy to get away with, but if somebody catches you with bright blue eyeshadow or a dark red lip stain, you're done for.

, This part often goes overlooked, but trim your nails! Overgrown nails are more likely to break and get dirt stuck underneath them. Clip your nails back and then file them so they aren't sharp.


Use a nail buffer and whitener to remove stains and patches from your nails and to give them a cleaner look.
Consider decorating your nails. You can use simple polish, or you can try nail art. And if nail polish isn't allowed, try clear polishes or French manicures. These are less likely to be seen from a distance, and give your nails a shiny and tidy look.

, Some girls have to wear glasses because of bad eyesight. If you're one of them, decide what to do about them. Typically, past middle school, most people don't really care if you're wearing glasses, but if you've been known as a nerd, glasses may not help your case. You have two options: sticking with your glasses or wearing contacts.


If you choose to keep wearing glasses, decide whether you want a ""quiet"" pair or a ""loud"" pair. ""Quiet"" pairs of glasses would be things like frameless glasses, or having thin frames with simple colors. ""Loud"" frames would be thick and big, and possibly have crazy patterns on them. Choose what you want to wear - just remember that the louder the glasses, the more of a statement you'll make. Whether that's good or bad is up to you.
If you decide to switch to contacts, make sure you take good care of them and wear them properly. Keep in mind, though: if the contacts make your vision blurry or make your eyes itch, it's best to switch back to your glasses. Having good vision is better than not wearing glasses.

, Some girls come to school practically drowning in their uniforms. Don't be one of them! Make sure your uniform fits you properly and isn't too big or too small.


If you had to get a uniform larger than your usual size, use belts, tie your shirt back, and do whatever's in your power to make the uniform look better on you.

, A favorite tactic of girls everywhere is to alter a uniform in some manner, sometimes by sewing. Don't do it. If you stitch up your skirt just a tad too high or cut the belt loops off your pants, you'll be regretting it at the surprise uniform check.


If you must mess with your uniform, try tricks that can be undone in a matter of a few seconds. For example, if you want to shorten your skirt, roll it up at the waist a time or two (but not so much that you have a thick waistband). This way, if rumors go around that there's a uniform check, you can quickly pull your skirt back into place.

, Unless you have an extremely strict uniform, try some basic tricks to change up your uniform. Some of these can get past a uniform check without a school official batting an eye, while others might get a bit of a closer look; decide what you feel looks best on you, and if it's worth possibly getting in trouble! Try out some of these tips below.


Roll up your skirt at the waist. (Don't roll it up too high, though - a thick waistband and a skirt that's up to your thighs is a dead giveaway.)
Cuff your shirt sleeves at the elbow.
Tie your tie in different ways.
Get a slightly oversized shirt and tie it at the back.
Swap out school-sold uniform pieces for pieces found at other stores.
Wear ""custom"" socks.
Pin something to your shirt or jacket.
Unbutton your shirt a bit to show a colorful shirt underneath it.
If you're stuck with a kilt, hang some charms from the kilt pin, or replace the pin with a button or brooch.
Hook a cute keychain into the belt loops of your skirt or pants.

, In the colder months, some schools will allow you to wear some sort of sweater or cardigan over your uniform. If your school is one of these, see what kind of things the school requires, and try shopping for a better version of what they sell. This can make your uniform look much nicer.

, If you're lucky and don't go to a school that requires a uniform, chances are that you have a dress code. Don't push the dress code. Many school dress codes are already quite lenient as it is, and it's kind of pointless to violate it anyway.

, You may think your uniform would look cute with a pair of heels, but most schools don't allow heels, and even if they do, running up and down the stairs with a pair of heels can prove itself to be dangerous. Wear a pair of flats or sneakers, or the school-issued shoes.


If your school has strict policies on the shoes (for example, you're restricted to one kind of shoelace), make sure your shoes meet those policies, or it's something you can easily fix.

, Some schools are strict and don't allow jewelry. If yours does, you're in luck. Pick out some cute earrings, maybe a cool necklace and bracelet or two.


If you're allowed to get some cute shoes with little trinkets on them, don't be afraid to do so. If you can't get a custom pair, consider attaching a small trinket to your uniform shoes.
If your school is religious, try wearing a religious necklace (for example, a cross or a Star of David). You may be able to get away with this.
Consider taking an earring with a stud on it and pinning it to your uniform's ribbon or tie.
Try getting an attractive wristwatch. They're handy and look fantastic. Plus, they're practical for school and shouldn't get you into trouble.

, Be careful, though - you may get in trouble with some teachers or authorities if you are indoors.


Most schools with uniforms will allow scarves in the winter. Check with your school on the policy regarding scarves. Some schools are stricter than you'd think.

, It helps if you look your best, but if your supplies look their best, even better!


Try covering your books. Scrawl your favorite lyrics across them or draw cool little pictures on the front covers. Alternatively, buy some wrapping paper in a design you like and cover the book in that. You can cover your book with dove plastic wrapping, it's easy to flip and quite unique.
Label your stuff in pretty typing labels or cute stickers with cartoon pictures that you can make by yourself using sticker paper.
Don't forget your school bag or backpack. Decorate your school bag. Put stickers on the zippers, label your name in your best markers, and put a couple of cool key rings there. Maybe you can even get your friends to write personal messages on it. Stick badges, safety pins, band patches and stickers on your bag to make it original, or tie a ribbon around the handle.

, Regardless of whether your school has a uniform or just a dress code, you'll almost definitely have a gym uniform. You might feel self-conscious in it, but remember: so does everyone else. Gym uniforms are universally considered to look bad, so don't worry too much about looking good in those ones - just focus on the class. After all, it's only for so long!


Wash the uniform as often as you can, especially if you only have one set. You don't want your uniform to smell.

, Almost every preteen or teenager doesn't go to bed at their assigned bedtime. You'll want to get between eight and nine hours of sleep nightly. This will help you significantly in terms of growth, appearance, and focus.


It's okay if you have one night where you can't sleep - everyone has to deal with insomnia once in awhile. But avoid pulling constant all-nighters to finish homework or read wikiHow articles!

, Studies have proven that those who don't eat breakfast in the morning don't work as well in school or in their jobs. Make sure you eat a healthy breakfast every morning. Even if it's just a smoothie or a bowl of non-sugary cereal, it'll do a lot to help your focus.

, Let's face it, nobody's ever not been late to class. What's important, though, is trying to keep it from happening again - too many tardies, in some schools, can count as a truancy and land you in serious trouble! Make sure to leave on time every morning, and if you're in middle school or high school, don't waste your passing periods - get to class as soon as possible.


Plan your passing periods efficiently to avoid being late. For example, don't go to your locker at every passing period - only go to it when you're close to your locker in the first place. If you have no classes close to your locker (unlikely, but this does happen), try going to your locker at lunch, where you should have plenty of time.
Sometimes, you can't help being late. These things do happen, and you may find yourself stuck in a traffic jam some mornings, especially if you live a considerable distance from the school. If this does occur, make sure you get a slip from the front office after explaining what happened, and don't make a big deal out of it to your teacher.

, Whether you're in class or with a potential friend or two, try to keep your focus on what's happening directly in front of you, and not what's off on the field to the left. Being ""random"" is not considered cute or quirky; it's just considered weird, and in some cases, annoying. Try to keep quiet if you want to say something completely unrelated to the topic.


Obviously, this doesn't always apply. If you're having a conversation with your friend, and you spot that they're about to step in a ditch or get hit by a soccer ball, a ""Look out!"" or ""Duck!"" is much appreciated. If what you're going to shout out is something to let others know of an imminent danger, then by all means, say it.

, Past elementary school, you need to develop your study habits and your work ethic. Work on studying every day at a certain time, getting all your work done, and possibly develop a system for how your study skills work. This will definitely help you later on in life.


Get your work done on time. A fault of almost every student is procrastinating, zoning out, and generally not doing good work in school. Pay attention in class and get your work completed and turned in on time - or even early.

Try to avoid turning in your work late. Unless you have a legitimate excuse for not turning in your work the day it was due (e.g. being at the doctor's), get the work in when it's due, not a day or two later. Many teachers will take points off of late work just because it's late, and some won't even take late work at all.


Unless you've been given explicit permission for this, don't write in your textbooks. (Be careful about workbooks - some schools don't even allow you to write in these, either!) While it may help you learn, the next person to receive the textbook may not appreciate the textbook graffiti - plus, if you get caught, you may get in trouble for it and have to pay a hefty fine.

Put a brake on distractions. Only allow yourself short breaks if you've accomplished something productive with your schoolwork - and no, you can't ""lose track of time"" when taking a break on the computer or phone!

, Middle school and high school is when drug and alcohol use becomes more prominent than ever. Avoid these at all costs. Alcohol and drug use damages your brain, and being drunk or high makes you prone to doing some pretty stupid things. You don't want to wait at the police station for your parents to come get you because your drunk self thought it would be a good idea to smash the window of a car, or end up in the hospital because of a drug overdose (which can be fatal).

, Yes, it's cliché and everybody tells you that, but it's one of the most important things. While some behaviors, such as talking at inappropriate times, are socially unacceptable and should probably be avoided if you want to avoid people forming bad opinions of you, you should never feel pressured to like or dislike something, act one way or another, or anything that stems from what your peers think, rather than what you think. Remember how adults always tell you not to give in to peer pressure? Remember that!



Be confident in yourself. People will respect you more if you're confident.
Show people what's cool about you. Are you a master writer? Ask to read something in your English class.
Don't allow your desire for social acceptance to get in the way of knowing who you really are. It's fine to do away with habits that offend others, or to improve upon your personal hygiene, but don't try to be anyone other than yourself. It may take some time for you to find your crowd, or to find people with interests that are similar to yours; but you will find them.

, It's important to think about what causes your reputation so that you can try and do something about it. You can't fix rumors, but you can rebel against them. For example, have you been accused of being fake? Make sure to stay in your comfort zone when it comes to dressing and acting, and be honest.


Not all labels are bad. If you've got a reputation as smart, shy, or some other ""general"" label that doesn't put people off from talking to you, don't worry yourself with trying to shake it. Think of it this way: those labels are like having a certain hair color. Hair colors don't push others away, right?

, One of the most important things for changing your reputation is to be friendly! Think about it - you know that one girl who's really mean, but somehow the entire school worships her? How many real, genuine friends do you think she actually has? If you're friendly, you'll draw more real and true friends to you than if you try to be popular and mean.



Smile! If somebody looks over at you and gazes for a bit, wave and smile. If you're not in class, maybe start a conversation with them.
Be nice to everyone. Whether they're popular or one of the school outcasts, be kind and accepting. It doesn't matter if they're LGBT, of a different race, are considered ""nerds"" or ""freaks"", or anything that may be different from you - be nice.

Don't swear around people you don't know very well. Swearing is considered rude by most, and cursing too much can drive people away from you. If you must swear, keep it minimal and do it around your friends only.
Aim for ""quiet and shy"" rather than ""distant"". If you don't want to talk much, but somebody starts a conversation with you, be friendly and happy, and willing to carry on a conversation. If you cut the conversation off after you answer somebody's question, you'll seem hostile.
Avoid shouting and keep your voice at a reasonable level. Similar to swearing, being too loud can drive others away. If you have trouble regulating the volume of your voice, try using an app to track your voice volume and practice speaking at even tones.
Always try to stay calm. Unless something is going on that really warrants you to panic (e.g. you accidentally set something important on fire in the chemistry lab), don't panic and try to keep a cool head at all times.

, Be kind, friendly, caring, and a good friend and person. Honesty is a must, as well as being genuine. Find people to talk to that you share common interests with.


Take care not to appear overeager when it comes to making friends or being accepted by a group of people. This will be an immediate turn-off. No one will accept you if it's obvious that you are desperate to be accepted.
Focus on befriending individual people, rather than cliques. There are many friendly folks out there who have plenty of self-esteem, and who don't feel that they need to associate themselves with any particular clique. These people tend to make better friends, exercise more integrity, and treat others with greater respect. In them, you will find truer friends and longer-lasting relationships.
Don't get too caught up in talking about your own interests to a potential friend. Find out what other people are interested in, and talk to them about their interests. Be aware of what's going on in the world, in terms of news and popular culture. You might discover new interests. You might even learn something!
If you are ever confronted or questioned about past deeds, disregard it with a laugh and explain. Say ""It was just a stage I was going through"" or ""It was just a stupid part of my life I'd rather forget.""

, Unfortunately, just about everyone will get bullied in school at some point. Avoid these people as often as you can! When you can't avoid them, stare straight ahead and pretend they're not there, and don't respond to any mean comments they might make.


If you're labeled badly and everybody makes fun of you for it, don't let them bring you down to their level. Don't say anything bad back to them, because that makes you just as bad as them; they're calling you names to get a reaction out of you, so don't give them one. However, if this bullying starts escalating to threats, physical violence, or people telling you to hurt yourself, reach out to an adult and tell them what's going on. That sort of behavior is never acceptable.

, Depending on what grade you're in, most cases of dating may be short and sweet, or last for several months - or even years. If you ever feel too uncomfortable with a relationship you're in, don't be afraid to break up with your partner. And remember - most people who date in high school don't get married, anyway!

, Trust people once they have earned your trust, but not before then. Sometimes people are unkind to others in an attempt to feel better about themselves. Be sure to hold your head high, cut your losses when you must, and keep a thick skin. Don't retaliate by treating others poorly in return. Know that life's too short to waste any time on those who won't treat you right. Respect yourself. This will earn you the respect of others.

, Rebel once in a while! Make it clear to the world that you are the primary governor of your own self, even if this just means talking back to that old crabby teacher once in a while. A tiny bit of disregard for the opinion of others from time to time can make you seem more cool and more confident. Just don't overdo it on this one.

, Most high schools and some middle schools have clubs or sports teams. Consider joining one of them. It'll help you broaden your horizons, become a well-rounded person, and who knows - you could discover your passion!


Consider joining a club of something that you're already good at. For example, if you have a knack for programming, see if your school has a club for programmers. If not, try finding something like a robotics team - they need programmers, after all!

, This is where your study habits really come into play. You don't have to try to get all A's, but aim to get grades as high as you can. Remember, everyone is different: if you're trying your hardest and all you can get is a high C, that's okay.

, Chances are, you might be a bit shy or socially out of practice. Break out of your shell! Start talking to people, and aim to make friends by doing so.


Learn people's names and address them by their names. They'll appreciate it.
Talk to people. Say something like, ""Are you nervous too?"" They'll probably appreciate that because it's a good way to break the ice. You never know, this could end up being your best friend.
Don't be too quiet. Try to crack a couple of jokes in class - it will attract more attention and already on your first day everyone will think of you as ""the funny kid"". Just make sure they aren't mean or inappropriate!
If you walk or ride the bus home, strike up conversation with the people on your route home.

, Most preteens and teenagers spend their free time playing games on their electronics. Consider using your time in a more productive way. There are other things you can do besides just using your phone. Help others, and don't expect anything in return. It's very rewarding.


Make a study group. Alternatively, make study guides for classes that you have with friends or acquaintances that struggle with it.
Tutor those in younger grade levels. If you're in ninth grade and you have an A in Algebra 2, try tutoring seventh or eighth graders in pre-algebra. If you're in sixth grade and have a knack for history classes, tutor elementary schoolers through the school. Some schools have programs that allow you to leave the school and tutor at another school during the day. Talk to your school counselor and see if you have one of these.
Volunteer. Try volunteering at non-profit organizations to help out. Just keep in mind that typically, if you're under a certain age, you'll need to have an adult with you in order to volunteer. Some volunteer places may not even take you if you're under the age of sixteen.
Take on something like babysitting. If kids aren't your thing, try petsitting.

, Who said you only had to stick to doing things in school to be more well-rounded? If you do more new things outside of school, you'll become just as well-rounded, if not more so! Try out the following suggestions for something new to do.


Check out a sport. If you play one sport already, try another one. It's even better if you can integrate those two together. Good at gymnastics? Try cheerleading!
Go to different events. If you don't go to the school events, try out going to a dance or to a sporting event. Alternatively, you could try going to things like the school choir concerts or dance performances.
Take up a new hobby.
If you're old enough, look for jobs.

, Many people find their time in mandatory schooling to be absolutely miserable. Since this is such a stereotype, some people dread school without even having the experience of their school. Don't assume that you'll hate school! Instead, smile, be optimistic, and see the good in everything at school. It'll make everything better and much more enjoyable - and your school year will be a blast!

Ask for a classmate's notes.,
Talk to your teacher if you're confused about a lesson.,
Seek help from a tutor.",How to Catch up With School when You Have Took a Day Off2," If at all possible, do this before coming back to school. You can send an email or have a parent stop by your school to pick up any work you've missed. If you can't contact your teachers ahead of time, ask your teachers the next day about missed work., If you have a class where your teacher lectures a lot, it can be difficult to make up missed work. If you've missed an important lecture, see if you can get a classmate's notes. Lectures often highlight things that will be important on future tests and quizzes.Choose a student who you know takes thorough notes. This way, you'll be more likely to get a full picture of what you missed.
You can also ask a classmate for help if you're confused about anything. If you missed a lecture about a new equation in math, for example, you can have a classmate you trust help you figure it out.

, If you don't understand a lesson you missed, stop your teacher after class. Ask them if you can meet with them sometime to go over what you missed. This is especially important if you're struggling to complete an assignment due to missing a day of class., If you've missed more than a few days, you may be genuinely struggling to catch up. In rare cases, you may need a tutor if you missed significant material.If your school has tutoring services, take advantage of them.

Do not neglect new assignments.,
Take breaks.,
Maintain your sleep schedule.,
Prepare beforehand whenever possible.",How to Catch up With School when You Have Took a Day Off3," It can be easy to forget new assignments when trying to catch up on old ones. In addition to doing everything you missed while you were gone, make sure you complete anything new that's assigned the day you get back. This may mean you will have to make extra time for homework the day after returning to school.You may have to cut out certain activities if you get a lot of new work the day you get back. For example, you can sit out your softball practice one day to catch up on work.
Write down any new assignments in your planner to make sure you keep track of everything.

, It's important to take study breaks. If you're trying to do extra work, you'll burn out without giving yourself an occasional break. Every hour or so, commit to taking a five minute break. You can have a snack, text a friend, watch a video online, or do anything else that helps you unwind., Sleep is important to your well-being and ability to concentrate. If you missed school due to sickness, it's especially important not to neglect sleep upon returning. Strive for a solid night's sleep, even if you're struggling to catch up, so you have the energy to get work done in a timely fashion., Things like illness cannot be predicted. However, in some cases you may know you're going to miss class ahead of time. If you're missing class due to something like a vacation, ask for the work in advance. This way, you can complete the work before returning to school."

List the work you haven't done yet.,
Meet with your teachers.,
Prioritize the list.",How to Catch Up in School1," In order to catch up in school, you'll need to start by figuring out exactly what you need to catch up on. Start by writing up a list that includes all the work you need to get done.This should include assignments that are past due as well as work that is coming due in the near future.


For each each task, note the due date and what, exactly, you still need to do. It should include readings you haven't done, papers you haven't turned in, and other homework that is past due or due soon.;
, Ask your teachers to meet with you for a few minutes to discuss the situation. Let them know that you know you are behind and are trying to catch up. Ask what help or advice they can give.Your teachers should be able to tell you which assignments they will still accept. This way, you don't waste time doing work that is so late you will no longer receive credit.
They may have advice on how you can get work done faster or more efficiently. They should also be able to tell you which tasks are most important to your grade.
In some cases, teachers may be willing to grant you extensions on deadlines, especially for work that hasn't come due yet. If you show you are genuine in your desire to learn the material and get caught up, some teachers will be lenient.

, After meeting with your teacher, rank the items on your list in order of importance. Remove any tasks that it is no longer possible for you to get credit for.


In prioritizing work consider the point value of each task. Consider how you are doing in the classes the various assignments are for. You should prioritize those tasks that will make the biggest difference in your grades. If there is a class you are at risk of failing, assignments from this class will be most important.You should also consider due dates in prioritizing your list. Focus on those things that are either the oldest, or that you can get done before the deadlines pass for maximum credit.

Schedule a time to meet with your teachers in person the day you return to class, or the day after, to discuss your missed homework. Don’t let too much time pass. Apologize to them about missing class, and ask them for the best way to make up the missed work.


Voice any questions and concerns you have over the amount of homework that was assigned and how long it’ll take you to complete. Discuss any time conflicts you may have with completing the missed homework, such as a job, sports or family business. Set a time that works for both you and your teacher in turning in your missed homework to them. Ask your teachers about their policy for turning in homework late. It is not uncommon for teachers to take points off for missed homework. Some teachers don’t accept late homework at all, unless it’s discussed ahead of time. , If you have a syllabus for the course, you will already know what the lessons and homework will be each day for the rest of the semester. Aim to work three to six weeks ahead of schedule. Knowing what is due in six weeks will help you to maximize your time. Set deadlines for completing each missed homework assignments.


Create a homework schedule, goal or check sheet and mark off each completed homework assignment as you go. Create one from scratch using a notebook, or use an online template to help you get started. Make it a goal to finish as much as you can by your deadline.

, Call or email a fellow classmate and ask about the homework you missed. Find out about readings, study guides, worksheets and projects that were given in class. Request to copy, rewrite or scan any notes they took during the classes you missed. Set up a time to meet and study with them via phone, email or in-person.

Make a plan.,
Schedule work time.,
Dig in and get the work done.",How to Catch Up in School2," Once you've figured out where to focus your energies, sit down with a calendar or planner and set some goals. Figure out when you can reasonably get things done by.Setting deadlines for yourself will help you track your progress and keep you accountable to yourself.

, Next, establish a set period of time each day that you will dedicate to catching up on your work. Stick to this plan, every day.The amount of extra school work time you will need to set aside will depend on how much you need to get done. In some cases, an extra hour a day might be enough, but in others you may need to set aside much more time.
To succeed, be aware that you will probably have to step back from some of your other activities, at least temporarily. You may need, for example to spend less time with your friends, stop going to club meetings for a while, skip a few piano lessons or soccer games, or even withdraw from certain time-intensive activities entirely.

, Once you have a plan, stick to it. Work every day to make progress on your school work.


If you are having trouble staying focused on your work during long work sessions, try building some short breaks into the schedule. This can help boost your productivity and creative thinking.Getting a little extra exercise can also help you stay focused.
During work times, turn off your phone if you can, log out of social media, and make sure there aren't other distractions around such as a TV on.
Having a well organized work space that is free of clutter and distractions can also help."

Use a planner.,
Set aside adequate time for school work.,
Consider joining a study group.,
Reward yourself for success.",How to Catch Up in School3," Once you get caught up, you can probably ease up a little on your work schedule, but you should maintain the same organization and discipline. Keep using a planner or calendar to keep track of work deadlines.Sometimes people get behind because they just forget when things are due. Keeping a planner or setting reminders in your phone can prevent this.

, Being caught up doesn't mean you can go back to the way things were before. The fact that you got behind in the first place probably means you weren't setting aside enough time for school work.


As before, establish a certain time each day to work on school work, and stick to it.Evaluate the activities you are part of outside of school and figure out which ones are most important to you. That way, if you have to let something else slide in favor of school work, you know what you're willing to skip or drop out of., Many students find that studying with other people not only allows them to pool their knowledge, but also helps them be more organized and accountable.If you've agreed to meet with people to work at a certain time, that creates social pressure that doesn't exist when you are just working alone. If you decide not to work on your own, you are failing to live up to your own goals, but if you decide not to meet with your study group, you'll be letting other people down, too.

, Devise a system of small rewards to motivate you to get work done. Whenever you get a project in on time, give yourself one of these rewards.This rewards can be anything that you enjoy. It could be your favorite candy, a new article of clothing, a song purchased online, or an activity like a trip the mall with your best friend of a little time spent playing your favorite instrument.
These rewards are motivating because they create a positive association in your mind with getting things done on time. Your brain will start to understand that completing a task leads to something positive, and this can help you feel more motivated to work.

Take advantage of after-school help from teachers.,
Use educational resources from your school or local library.,
Attend a study hall or group.,
Seek tutoring for help with difficult subjects.",How to Catch up on Missed Schoolwork2," Find out what days your teachers offer after-school help with homework online. If that information isn’t available, send them an email or call them directly to request a meeting. Make a list of questions you want to ask them about your homework after working through missed assignments on your own. Make sure you’re clear on expectations your teacher has for you in making up missed work. Ask them for any tips, such as note-taking or time management , that they have that’ll help you complete the missed homework and learn the material faster.

, Check out encyclopedias, journals and other educational materials to help you understand your homework. Make use of their online database to search for bibliographical guides or indexes, or to simply fact-check answers to your homework. Talk to librarians about checking out or borrowing school supplies, such as a calculator or laptop, if they are required to help you complete your homework.

, Ask your teachers about upcoming study hall sessions, or organize your own after-school homework club with classmates. Make note of any problems you’ve had while completing your missed homework, and share them with the group. This will help you not only work through what you missed, but also be prepared for future homework assignments. Work through as much of the missed homework as you can on your own before comparing answers with your fellow classmates. This will be extremely beneficial for other students who have also missed class and need to catch up on missed homework. , Get a referral from your teacher, family or friends for tutors that offer help in your homework subject. Dedicate a reasonable amount of time to meet with the tutor to cover your homework. Ask your tutor to double check your homework, and advise you on mistakes you may be making. Be sure to speak up about any struggles you’re having, such as finding time to study and focus. Join in a group tutoring session, if possible. Small group tutoring offers personalized prep and homework review. Meeting in a group can also help cut the costs associated with private tutors.

Create a schedule for completing your missed work.,
Find a productive space to work.,
Focus on finishing.,
Give it your best effort.",How to Catch up on Missed Schoolwork3," Carve out time to work on your missed assignments each day. This can be after class, during the evening after dinner or in your downtime like a long car ride or wait for an appointment. Research suggests adding at least 10 minutes of homework time for every grade. For example, if you’re in the 6th grade, you should spend roughly 60 minutes. If you’re a 12th grader, you should spend 120 minutes tops. Plan to work for at least one hour a day on missed homework in more difficult subjects, such as math and science. , Pick a location you feel comfortable working in, and that you can also be productive in. This can include a quiet space in your home, such as the bedroom or kitchen, your school or local library, or your local coffee shop. It is important that the area is well lit, and does not cause you any physical discomfort. Make sure that white noise, or any background noise is down to a minimum. The place you choose to complete your missed homework in should be reliable, free from distractions, and support your learning style and success. , Gather all notes, supplies and materials you’ll need to begin your homework. Eliminate distractions by powering down your electronic devices, and logging out of your social media. Take small breaks if you need to. It is important not to rush doing your homework, as it can cause you to make mistakes that can count against you. Work on completing one assignment before moving to the next one. Refrain from multi-tasking, as that can limit your productivity. Create a reward for yourself as an incentive to stay focused and finish, if you feel unmotivated. Some suggestions include taking yourself out to breakfast, treating yourself to dinner, or seeing a movie. , Stay focused on learning the material you missed and do every bit of work to the best of your abilities. It is okay not to know it all, or not to completely understand it your first go-round. Keep in mind that everyone learns at a different pace. Focus on allowing yourself the time you need to study to really learn what your homework is covering.

",How to Build a Pyramid for School1," Thanks to a coating of sand covered with glue, this cardboard pyramid looks like a realistic flat-sided pyramid, but it's lightweight and doesn't take very long to put together. You probably have most of the supplies on hand already. Gather the following materials to make your cardboard pyramid:


A large flattened cardboard box or piece of cardboard
A ruler
A pencil
Scissors
Hot glue gun and sticks
White school glue
Paint brush
Sand;
, Use your ruler and pencil to draw an 8-inch (20.3 cm) square on your cardboard. Now draw four equilateral triangles with 8-inch (20.3 cm) bases. Use the scissors to cut out the shapes, so you have a square base and four triangular sides.


If you want to make a a larger pyramid, you can make a 9 or 10-inch (22.9 or 25.4 cm) square and triangles with matching bases. Just make sure the bases of the triangles is the same as a side of the square.
You can use a craft knife instead of a scissors if the cardboard is stiff and difficult to cut.

, Heat up your glue gun and put a line of glue along the bottom of a triangle. Line it up with one edge of the square and press it lightly. Do the same with the other three triangles, gluing their bases to the square.

, Lean the triangles in so that their points meet and create a pyramid shape. Seal the edges together with a line of hot glue.

,, Pour some into a dish and use the paintbrush to paint the entire cardboard pyramid with an even coating of glue. Don't forget to cover the edges, too, so you'll be able to hide the cracks with sand.

, Before the glue dries, cover the pyramid with sand.Try to sprinkle on an even amount so that the entire pyramid is evenly coated in a layer of sand.

",How to Build a Pyramid for School2," Making a clay pyramid allows you to get creative by making realistic indents and grooves in the pyramid walls to resemble an ancient Egyptian pyramid. You'll need the following supplies for this method:


A large ball of modeling clay (air dry)
Rolling pin
Knife
A piece of cardboard
A ruler
A pencil
Scissors
Paint and paintbrush

, Use the ruler and pencil to draw a square on your piece of cardboard. A 6-inch by 6-inch (15.2 by 15.2 cm) base is fine for a smaller pyramid, or you could make a larger base if you have plenty of clay. Cut out the square when you're finished.

, Place the clay on a dry, clean surface and use the rolling pin to roll it out to 1/2 - 3/4 inch (1.3 - 1.9 cm).

, Use your ruler and pencil to mark out four equilateral triangles with bases the same size as one side of the square. If you have a 6-inch (15.2) square, each triangle should have a 6-inch (15.2 cm) base., Use a knife to cut out the triangle shapes you marked.

, Press your ruler against the sides of the triangles to slant them slightly downward. This will make it easier to press them together so the pyramid won't fall apart.

, Position two triangles so that their edges line up with the edges of the cardboard square. Press the sides of the triangle together. Place a third triangle along another side of the square and press it against the adjacent triangle. Add the last triangle and press it together with the triangles on either side.

, Use the knife to make markings that look like stone shapes in the sides of the pyramid.

, Leave it alone for several hours or overnight to give the pyramid time to dry and harden.

, Pour the paint into a dish and use the paintbrush to spread an even coating on the pyramid. Use brown or sand-colored paint for best effect. You could also use a coating of glue sprinkled with sand if you'd prefer.

",How to Build a Pyramid for School3," This simple pyramid looks like a step-sided pyramid, with individual ""stones"" visible instead of flat sides. It requires just a few household supplies:


A box of sugar cubes
A piece of cardboard
A ruler
A pencil
Scissors
White school glue
Paintbrush
Sand

, Use your ruler and pencil to draw a square on your cardboard. This will be the base of the pyramid, so make it as small or large as you'd like. An 8-inch by 8-inch (20.3 cm by 20.3 cm) base is a good size for this project. Cut out the square when you're finished.

, Paint a layer of glue around the edge of the cardboard square. Position sugar cubes over the glue so that you have a sugar cube square around the edge of the cardboard.


You can use white icing in place of glue if you don't have glue on hand. Make icing by adding 2 tablespoons (30 g) water to 3 cups (384 g) of confectioners' sugar; stir until smooth.
Hot glue may also be used in place of regular school glue.

, Paint a layer of glue on the inner half of the first square of sugar cubes. Position a second row of sugar cubes on top of the first row of cubes, set slightly back toward the inside of the cardboard square. The second row of cubes will require fewer cubes than the first row.

, With each new step, paint a layer of glue on the inner half of the sugar cube square and create a new, smaller square by layering more sugar cubes on top. Keep adding steps in this manner until the sides of the pyramid have come to a point.

,, Use a paintbrush to paint the entire pyramid with a thin layer of glue. Be careful not to damage the pyramid as you go.

, Try to create an even coating of sand over the entire pyramid.

Start young.,
Learn how your school chooses its valedictorian.,
Choose your classes wisely.,
Remember that being the valedictorian will NOT guarantee you a spot to any elite college.,
Study smart.,
Stand out in the classroom.,
Get organized.,
Read ahead.,
Get extra help.,
Participate in extra-curricular activities.,
Maintain your social life.,
Be aware of your competition, but don't obsess about rivals.,
Treat your body with care.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.",How to Become Valedictorian," Unfortunately, in most cases, you can't just waltz into your high school on the first day of freshman year and decide to be valedictorian. You'll need to have proved yourself in middle school by taking the most rigorous math and English courses that your middle school had to offer. Some middle schools don't have tracking for their classes, but some do offer Honors courses as early as seventh or eighth grade. Being in these courses will set you on a path to honors courses in high school, so make sure you've laid the groundwork for this.


You can move up in English more easily, but once you're ""locked"" into a math track, it'll be harder to move ahead. For example, if you're in regular Algebra in 8th grade, you'll have to go to regular Geometry in 9th unless you've really proven yourself.;
, Some schools rank students with an unweighted GPA, while others award extra points for harder classes. Most schools do offer extra points for taking harder courses so you should aim to take these; and even if your school doesn't offer extra points for harder courses, you should still aim for success; after all, if you want to be valedictorian, then you probably want to go to a top-notch school, which means you'll have to take the most challenging classes anyway.


For example, if your school does use a weighted GPA to determine valedictorian, then you may receive a 4.0 for an ""A"" in regular classes, a 5.0 for an ""A"" in honors classes and a 6.0 for an ""A"" in AP classes.
A valedictorian also typically gives a graduation speech in front of their classmates. But if this is the part that appeals to you the most, then make sure that the speech-giver is the valedictorian. Some schools have the student body president give a speech, some have students vote for which student should give the speech, while others have the valedictorian and the student body president and another student give a speech.
Some schools have more than one valedictorian -- or as many as 29!, If your school does factor the weighted GPA into their decision to choose the valedictorian, then you should take the most rigorous courses whenever possible. If you think that the harder classes may be too tough for you, then you may need to rethink being valedictorian. To be the valedictorian, you have to get As in the hardest classes at your school pretty much every time. Are you up for the challenge?


Take AP classes over honors classes when you can, if they are worth more points.
Your electives can really hurt your weighted GPA because they tend to be considered regular classes. However, all students in your school will most likely be expected to take some electives, such as gym or art class. Whenever you can, though, try to take an elective that is worth more points, if you have the option. For example, don't take Creative Writing if it is considered a regular class; take AP Language and Composition if it is offered to everyone instead.
Sure, you may end up missing out on some fun classes over the course of your high school career. But those classes will NOT get you to be the valedictorian.
If your school has the option of not having to take gym if you do a sport, then consider picking up a sport if not taking gym will boost your GPA. If you want to be valedictorian, then you should also be well-rounded so you stand out in college applications for more than just your grades. You should obviously not take a sport, though, just to make your GPA higher, because the extra time you devote to sports may keep you away from your studies.

, If you want to be valedictorian, then you must be very ambitious, having your sights on elite schools such as Harvard, Yale, Duke, or Amherst. But remember that when you apply to colleges such as these, valedictorians will be a dime a dozen. Being valedictorian will keep you in the running and will impress admissions officers, but you want to avoid looking like a cold grade-obsessed automaton and show that you have depth, several other interests, and that you're a good citizen of your community.


Even William R. Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions at Harvard, recently said, “I think, it’s a bit of an anachronism. This has been a long tradition, but in the world of college admissions, it makes no real difference.”Being valedictorian in addition to showing strengths in sports, community service, or the arts will help you be an amazing candidate. But being ranked #10 in your class and doing these same things won't make you look much worse.
Your SAT score will also have a major impact on your college acceptances. Many colleges place equal weight on your GPA and your SAT score -- that means your effort for four years of high school courses will amount to about as much as your efforts on a 3.5 hour exam! Sound fair? It isn't, but you've got to get used to it.

, If you want to be a valedictorian, then you have to study smart to get good grades. This doesn't mean that you should spend all of your waking hours perched over your book, but it does mean that you should study as efficiently and thoroughly as possible. Here are some tips to get you studying hard:


Make an efficient study schedule. Maybe you will spend 2-3 hours of studying a night, or maybe you will study for 3-4 hours every other night. Whatever you do, make a plan in advance so you don't end up getting overwhelmed or procrastinate.
Pace yourself. Set a goal -- 10-15 pages per day, and don't go overboard too much or you'll burn out.
Take advantage of practice quizzes. Your history books, math textbooks, or other course material may come with practice questions that you can use to see how well you know the course materials. Even if your teacher doesn't use these resources, they can be valuable to you.
Make flashcards. If flashcards help you memorize historical concepts, foreign languages, or even mathematical operations, use them.

, You don't have to be the teacher's pet to be stellar in the classroom. You should, however, arrive to class on time, participate in class discussion, and ask questions when you're confused about something. Being focused in the classroom will help you absorb the course information more, which will lead you to do better on tests, and it will also make your teacher like you more and will help you earn any in-class points allotted for the course, such as participation points.


Keep your chatter with other students to a minimum. You may be missing some important information.
Take stellar notes to study from. Don't just write down what the teacher is saying word for word -- try to put the notes in your own words so you really absorb the material.
Talk to your teacher after class occasionally. You don't have to annoy your teacher by always being there, but getting to know your teachers a bit more will help you stand out in their eyes.

, If you want to succeed in the classroom and throughout your studies, then you have to be organized. You need to have a notebook for every class, clearly labeled binders, a clean locker, and an organized desk at home. If your life is filled with clutter, then you won't be able to retain information as easily and you won't have as much to focus on your coursework as you'd want.


Keep a planner where you write down all of the homework due each day.
Keep a calendar over your desk where you can mark important test dates.

, Reading ahead to the material that your teacher will cover the next day or next week will give you a leg up on the course content and will keep you from getting confused or not absorbing as much information as you could. As long as you're not covering anything too difficult that would be easier to comprehend if it were first explained by your teacher, you'll be giving yourself a leg up by doing this.


Reading ahead is a great way to give yourself an edge. Just don't bring it up when you participate in class or the teacher may get annoyed that you're stealing her thunder or confusing other students with additional information.

, You may be thinking, if I'm trying to be the valedictorian, then why would I need extra help? This is where you're precisely wrong. If you want to be the valedictorian, then you have to get an edge over the competition. Get more information or more repetition of the subject matter, whether you ask your teacher for extra help after class, ask your parents for more help if they understand your homework better than you do, or even ask an older successful student for some assistance.


You can also invest in a private tutor, but those can get pretty pricey.

, Always leave time for clubs, sports, volunteering, or other activities outside of class. Believe it or not, extracurricular commitments can boost your grades because they can help you organize your time better. Studies even show that student-atheletes tend to do better in school than non-athletes.


This will also help you stay grounded and will keep you from obsessing over your studies too much.

, You don't want to be holed up in your room, studying for ten hours under the glare of a too-bright light bulb. You want to have time to study, sure, but you also want to make time to pursue your friendships, go to parties, hang out at the movies, or even go to the school carnival. If you spend 100% of your time with your nose buried in a book, you may start to feel a little bit unhinged and lonely. You don't have to be the life of the party, but having at least a few meaningful friendships will make you feel more motivated to study. Be sure that you stay away from most of the drama at your school, for it can be very time consuming.Find some friends that you can study with. Having a group of like-minded students can help you make studying more fun and productive. Try starting a study group for one of your classes and see how it works out; if you're able to stay focused, then you've just improved your chances of acing your classes.

, You don't want to waste time on narcissism and nervous back-stabbing. Don't go around asking your rivals what they got on their tests, how much time they spent studying for the latest exam, or what grade they think they're going to get in a class. This will make you focus your efforts in the wrong places and will keep you focused on what you have to do.


Remember that everyone is different. Maybe you need to study for 4 hours to ace an exam and the student next to you only needs to study for 3 hours to do well. You don't have to be the most naturally gifted to be the valedictorian -- you just have to work the hardest.

, Becoming valedictorian isn't a test of raw intellect, it's a test of endurance. Be healthy. Eat breakfast, and stay away from drugs and alcohol. Only when your body is strong can you perform at the highest level. Though you can splurge on pizza and candy once in a while, eating power foods like nuts, vegetables, and proteins will keep you focused on your work and will keep you from crashing or losing steam.


You can still have a social life while avoiding drugs or alcohol. If you want to be valedictorian, then you have to stick with the right crowd.

, Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night and going to bed around the same time and waking up around the same time will keep your body feeling energetic and strong, and will give you the fuel you need to pay attention in class, succeed in your exams, and to be a stellar student. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to study so you don't end up going to bed at three in the morning and sleeping through your classes.


Try to go to bed no later than 10 or 11 pm and give yourself at least 45 minutes to an hour before you leave the house in the morning so you feel alert when you head to class.

, If you want to be the valedictorian, then you have to relax a little bit. Don't tell yourself that every little grade matters and will influence your fate and your chances of going to a good college. Sure, grades are important, but so is being mentally sound and having great friendships. Remind yourself that it's not the end of the world if you don't get a perfect test grade -- you'll get 'em next time.


To be the valedictorian, you'll have to be in a calm state of mind or you may find that the pressure is suddenly too much to deal with.
Stay positive and always look forward -- doesn't waste your time stressing about your test grade from a month or a year ago. It just isn't worth it.

Don't act happily oblivious to other people's emotions. What's worse, is the other way around, people who always act ""happy"", they tend to get very annoying. Being happy with who you are is never annoying, as long as you don't brag.;
,, Things like developing a personal style of clothing, music, etc.

, Fads can be great opportunities for clothing originality. If there's a fad at your school, it's fine to follow it, but change it slightly, enough to make it your own style. You may even start a new fad! Consider designing (if you're artistic) your own clothes. If you're low on budget, try going to a second-hand shop or even the thrift store. Often they get surplus straight from department stores, at a much cheaper price. Remember, even the ugliest of clothing can become dazzling if you have a particularly artistic eye. It is also important to remember that looking great and being great are not the same thing. You can dress in a way that some people think is a bit boring if you want, and still be great. The important thing is to dress how you are happiest. If you are not obsessed with your appearance, great, if you love to look your idea of awesome, that's great too.

, Being great at school means being willing to try new things. Try going to a few concerts if you can afford it, if you are on a budget, go to amateur performances.

, Probably nobody likes school at all, but if you make it work for you, it will be boring but fun.

, Buy a planner to list your assignments, projects, tests, and even chores. Do your homework in class and when you get home, and when you're sick, at least know what assignments you missed. Even if you aren't the brightest in the class, if you turn in everything well done and on time, you will be respected.

, Have at least three people in each class who you can call if you missed an assignment, need help, etc. Being friends with your teacher will help, because if you missed an assignment, sometimes you can persuade them to 'see things your way' etc.

, Remember, doing well in school is actually important, but it's not the end of the world if you miss an assignment or two.

Don't be a bully! If you are, people won't want to be friends with you. Being a bully also includes spreading rumors and starting gossip.;
, Be good to be around. Instead of glaring or saying mean things, be bubbly and full of energy and be nice to everyone around you. Be friendly and smile. Don't ignore anyone and talk to them.

, This can help your friendship career. Don't be one of those kids who's always ditching school and being rude in class or anything. Prosper in school and help kids who need it (without being rude about it). Get good grades in exams. Others will like to be friends with intelligent people. Don't be a nerd though.

, Compliment their outfit or hair. Be able to walk by someone and have a light conversation with them. Don't stick to one person either; go to many people and hang around them (one at a time). Talk about general things , and make small talk.


Don't take sides if your friends have fights. That makes your friends think you like someone else more than you like them. Stay neutral and don't strive for drama.

, People will not always come to you. Be friendly to everyone and then ask them out (not on a date; to the mall or something). If they say no, don't worry about it. There are always more people out there. Set an example and be the kind of person everyone wants to be friends with (but don't be snotty about it).

Learn history and facts.",How to Be Entertained on a Long School Bus Ride," You should fill it with basic necessities, such as bottled water and snacks in case you feel hungry. You could also bring along entertainment, such as your favorite magazines (provided that they're appropriate), a notebook and pencil if you like to draw, portable video games (if they're permitted), small games you can play with others, and anything else that might help you pass the time. However, be sure that you aren't bringing banned items on the bus; otherwise, they may be confiscated and you might receive a detention.;
, Getting in trouble will make the bus ride much less fun, and the consequences can extend into your school day. Make sure you know all the rules, including what items aren't allowed on the bus, what activities are banned, and whether seats are assigned. If you aren't sure, check with your bus driver or a school authority.

, If seats aren't assigned, take advantage of that and remain with your friends, as they can help make the bus ride less boring. Before boarding the bus, stick close to them so that you won't get separated during the rush to claim seats. If you're in a large group, it may be best to decide who will sit together so that you decrease the chances of being isolated.

, If you have assigned seats or aren't familiar with anyone on the bus, try befriending the people around you. By being friendly and initiating a conversation, you'll encourage them to talk to you and you might have a new bus buddy to pass the time with. However, understand that not everyone may be interested in speaking with you. If that appears to be the case, politely detach yourself and move onto someone else.

, You can take the time to watch the landscape sweep by, as well as amuse yourself with unusual sights. Search for animals, strange cars or license plates, or anything else that might alleviate your boredom. You could even play ""I Spy"" with people sitting near you. If you stare at the scenery long enough, you may end up zoning out, which can help the time pass by quicker.

, If you have assignments, completing some of them on the bus can help ease the burden off your shoulders. You'll also be able to pass the time productively. However, if you become easily carsick, it may not be wise to do your homework, as reading words on a moving vehicle may make you feel nauseous.

, Interesting books and magazines always help pass the time. You can even share them with people sitting next to you, as that will help you make friends and perhaps alleviate their boredom. Be careful not to lose library books on the bus; otherwise, you may have to pay a fine.

, If your school permits it, take advantage of the opportunity and bring portable devices, such as a music player, handheld video game, or a phone. Make sure that you charge them the night before so that you don't start out with a low battery. Be sure that they're small enough so that you don't have trouble carrying them around. You should also keep them in a safe place during your trip so that you don't accidentally lose them.

, A long bus ride is the perfect time to catch up on much needed sleep, especially if you had to wake up early in the morning. Bundle up a jacket or a sweater to use it as a pillow. If your bus mates are loud, you may need to consider bringing earplugs or drowning them out with music.

, If you're separated from your friends or everyone is too noisy for you to properly speak, writing notes to one another can be fun. You could include little doodles on the side or start playing a small game together. If you're sitting far away from one another, avoid asking people to deliver your messages too frequently; otherwise, they may become annoyed with you. Make sure that no one else can read them, especially if they're personal.

, Sketching is a fun way to pass the time, although it may be difficult in a moving vehicle. Bring a sketchbook or a folder full of paper so that you have something sturdy to draw on. Draw pictures and comic strips, allowing your creativity to overflow and keep you from being bored. If you like, you can let other people contribute to your art so that you can all participate in a great activity together.

, Popular examples are Hangman, Tic Tack Toe, and Mash. You can either play with one person or have other people join in as well. Paper RPGs work too, as you can draw characters and make them go on adventures.

, Allow your imagination to take control and create an entirely new world. You can draw maps of different places and include important landmarks. Draw the creatures and people who inhabit your world. You can assign them homes and different jobs, as well as write about their lives and the adventures or challenges they face.

, If you're bored, writing can be a fun activity to participate in. Whether you're interested in creating stories, poetry, or jokes, work your brain and release your creative side. You can share your work with others or allow people to contribute to it.

, Planning out the rest of your day or week is a productive way to pass the time. By creating a to-do list, you can organize your life for a short while and see what tasks that you need to complete.

, This can help you become more familiar with yourself, and you might even discover new preferences.

,, This will help expand your knowledge and perhaps boost your grades, especially if you're learning about the place that your field trip is taking place. Being excited about learning is a great attitude to have, so don't hesitate to take advantage of the bus ride to help your mind grow.

Keep breakfast simple.",How to Be Ready for School on Time," The first step in curbing tardiness is deciding when to go to bed at night and when to get up in the morning (at least 15 minutes early is a good rule of thumb) – and then sticking with it everyday. It's usually best to go to sleep at a reasonable time so you can be well-rested and ready to respond to your alarm clock in the morning.If you've become used to oversleeping during summer or winter break, try easing back into the swing of things with a gradual approach. Instead of attempting to get up at the crack of dawn on your first day back at school, at least a few days beforehand, try setting your alarm slightly earlier each day until you're better able to get up at the proper time.Every time you get up on time or early, give yourself a reward, whether it's watching TV before leaving the house or taking a walk around the block.;
, Rummaging in drawers and closets is a time waster if you do it right before you're supposed to be out the door. That's why it's better to choose your shirt, pants, socks and shoes at night, putting them where you can find them easily in the morning., Just in case you get up late in the morning, make sure you've taken a shower the night before. That way, all you have to do is brush your hair and teeth and wash your face and hands before getting dressed., The night before school, fix whatever you intend to eat for lunch the next day and pack it in the fridge.If your family eats breakfast together, set the table at night and make sure all foods or ingredients are easily accessible. This will save time.

, Make sure to go through your things in the evening and remind yourself if a permission slip needs to be signed or if you're scheduled to do something special the next day, such as going on a field trip or attending a school function. These types of things could require special clothing or bringing extra money with you.

, Make sure all your homework is finished at night so you don't have to rush to complete it in the morning – or, worse, get in trouble for not handing it in at all. This means you should get everything done before you go outside to find your friends in the afternoon or sit down to watch TV or play video games. If you need to, have a snack first, but the longer you delay doing your work, the more likely you'll be not to complete it.The same is true for group projects, sports or extracurricular activities such as band or drama club. Except for projects assigned by your teachers, participation in these other activities is voluntary, so homework still has to get done.

, It's one thing to finish all your homework and gather any permission slips or parents' signatures you might need the night before, but none of that matters if you forget to bring it with you to school. Part of your nightly routine should be making sure everything you'll need is packed in your bag and ready to be used once you get there., Before you eat breakfast in the morning, make sure you're completely dressed and washed. This will save time as you prepare to head out the door because you won't have to backtrack to your room or the bathroom. You'll be ready to leave the moment you've finished eating., Ask your parents to help you put together a system of sharing tasks to save time in the morning. If you have brothers and sisters, your mom or dad can make sure each of you has specific tasks to complete before leaving, so a single person isn't responsible for everything you have to do before the day begins. That would take too long.


For example, you wash the dishes, your sister can gather everyone's backpacks and another sibling can take the dog out for a walk – all at the same time. All of you will be finished with these chores in minutes if you work together.

, Have a central spot – or launch pad – where all school-related items (bags, papers, pencil boxes) are kept. That way everyone can grab what they need quickly and no one will be searching for missing items while the bus is waiting outside., Unless you've prepared it the night before, an elaborate meal could take too much time to cook and clean up in the morning. Make sure you eat things such as cereal and toast that can be finished in minutes."

Keep conversations brief.,
Head directly to the bus after school.,
Use technology as a distraction.,
Stay away from crowded areas.,
Find a private space of your own.,
Avoid major social events.,
Locate one or two trusted confidantes.",How to Be a Loner in High School1," If someone begins to talk to you, try to keep your answers short and to the point. Providing very little information or encouragement will let them know that you are not interested in a long chat. However, do listen carefully in case they say something of importance to you.Avoiding eye contact will make your classmates less likely to approach you for conversation. Instead of looking directly at one person, try to skim the room with your eyes.
Being a loner doesn’t mean that you can’t provide a reaction to what someone says to you. If a person is talking and you feel like offering your sympathy, do so. In fact, introverts are often known for their emotional awareness.
Noncommittal responses such as, “Uh-huh,” and, “Mm-hm,” often signal to other people that you are not engaged in the conversation. This will usually lead to a talk being cut short.;
, Instead of hanging around in the hallways or outside of the school to socialize, make your way to your ride home. The sooner that you get home, the sooner you can recharge in peace and privacy. If you take this same action every day it will become a routine and your classmates will know what to expect.You may want to time your arrival at the bus carefully, otherwise you could end up sitting and waiting for it to fill up.

, Cell phones are generally not allowed in the classroom. However, you may be able to bring your headphones and wear them in the cafeteria and other public spaces. You can also use your phone in permitted areas. Getting on a library computer also sends a message that you want your space.Just make sure that you are still aware of your surroundings as you immerse yourself in technology. For example, watch where you are walking as you make your way around campus.

, Find a place to sit away from others in the cafeteria. Try to walk on the edges of the hallway away from where people are congregating. Don’t hang around in the classroom immediately after class. The fewer people you encounter, the fewer random conversations and forced social interactions you will have.It is a common misconception that all loners are shy. Many loners are perfectly fine in social situations, they just prefer to avoid them if possible. Loners can often be classified as introverts at heart.

, Get to know your school environment and look for a few places that you can escape to during the day for some privacy and solitude. This is especially important to do if you find your classroom time to be mentally draining. Escaping in this way shows that you are a loner by choice, not by circumstance.If one of your fellow students questions you about your habit of disappearing, simply tell them that sometimes you prefer to be alone.Look for places currently not in use, such as the school theater or empty classrooms.

, Instead of attending the seasonal dance with a large group, go by yourself or not at all. You could always spend that time pursuing a hobby that you enjoy, such as painting. If you attend a function requiring tickets, purchase the seats around you to ensure your solitude.If someone makes a big deal about you not going to a particular event, just remind yourself that your peers are busy with their own lives, so everything will blow over rather quickly., This is not a necessity, as it may make you feel like less of a ‘true’ loner. However, everyone needs help on occasion and having a few classmates you can turn to for assistance is never a bad idea. Just remember to return any favors as soon as possible so that you don’t feel indebted to anyone.Just because you are a loner in high school doesn’t mean that you can’t have friends or a social life outside of that space either. If you have a best friend from childhood, who goes to a different school, look to that person for support.

Stick with your own fashion style.,
Stay polite.,
Develop some individual hobbies.,
Be confident.,
Choose a few loner idols or mentors.",How to Be a Loner in High School2," Don’t feel the need to follow all of the latest trends. Embrace your own unique appearance and work to refine it over time. Wear clothes that suit your personality and mood. Being comfortable in your own skin will give you more confidence in all of your choices, including being a loner.Most people are aware of the stereotype of the trench coat wearing, troubled loner teen. If you choose to dress this way do so because you enjoy it, not to conform to some image.

, No matter how frustrated you become with other people attempting to reach out to you, avoid the desire to head into rude territory. Stay true to your morals and give them minimal time, but not an abrupt brush-off. Most people are extroverts and have no clue how to interpret your loner signals.Some polite ways to exit a conversation include saying, “Okay, well, I have to make my next class,” or, “I’ve got to go now or I’ll be late.”

, Being a loner doesn’t mean you can’t be interesting. In fact, many loners become recognized artists due to their abilities to channel their inner energies outward. Investigate learning a musical instrument on your own. Or, try your hand at another artistic pursuit, such as writing or painting.One of the reasons that Bruce Springsteen started playing music was to find an outlet for his feelings as a high school loner. Just because you are a loner doesn’t mean you are alone in your experiences.It is also possible that you gravitate toward being a loner because you hold potential friends to higher creative standards as a result of your own artistic impulses. Being aware of this can help you to reassess your expectations of others, if you desire., Try your best to not care about the opinions of others, including those of your peers. Focus on your own inner strength and take actions that make you feel comfortable, not the ones that will make you ‘fit in.’ Part of being a confident person is not accepting bullying. Don’t allow anyone to victimize you for your loner status., Search online for the stories of other loners. You will find that many celebrities self-identify as former, or current, loners. Your research will show you that, for most loners, there is nothing unhealthy or unnatural about this affinity. You simply crave privacy."

Be a survivor.,
Change your behaviors if you are lonely.,
Watch out for the stereotypes.,
Don’t give in to peer pressure.,
Talk to the school counselor.,
Talk to your parents.,
Talk to a medical professional.",How to Be a Loner in High School3," Be aware that your loner status may make you a target for ridicule in your present, or future, life. So, it is important to be flexible and to adapt to your situation the best that you can. Perhaps you need to wait until the end of the day to get alone time. If that is the case, then so be it. Perhaps you have to discuss your work in a group project setting. If that is the case, then so be it., Practice introspection on a daily basis and ask yourself if being a loner is making you happy. If the answer is yes, then continue as is. If the answer is no, then start to open yourself up a bit more to social experiences while in high school. Pay attention to any feelings of loneliness, in particular. Your decision to be a loner can be reversed, if you choose to do so.Loneliness actually leads to the build-up of stress within your body. Over time it can cause a host of health problems if it is not addressed., Humans usually reach out for social interaction, so, as a loner, you may be the focus of other’s curiosity or fear. In particular, as a result of some of the violent acts committed by self-described loners in school environments, some of your classmates may attach negative stereotypes to your choice. Try to alleviate their concerns by being polite and engaged, just busy with other concerns., Some of your peers may try to ply you with alcohol or drugs in order to get you back into the social group. Be prepared for this and feel confident in your refusal. Others may assume that you are interested in these illicit activities simply because you are a loner. Brush these advances off as well.If you are offered drugs or alcohol, you might simply say, “Sorry, I’m not into that.”

, If you feel as if your emotions are bottled up as a result of your loner status, reach out to professionals at your school. They will keep these conversations confidential and you can unload what is on your mind. Be aware that you can also visit with your counselor to discuss how happy you are as a loner.If you are satisfied with your life as a loner, your counselor may be able to offer suggestions regarding future career options that will suit your personality. Many loners find satisfying work as writers or completing other solitary pursuits., Your parents may be concerned about your life as a loner, especially if they are both extroverts. Spend time talking with them and let them know that you are okay and happy. If you are unhappy, you can also reach out to your parents for assistance and ask for their advice., If you feel like hurting yourself or others, you should talk to your parents or school professionals and get them to make you a counseling appointment outside of the school environment. It is important that you don’t keep these feelings bottled up. There are ways to improve your situation, but you have to go against your natural instincts and reach out to others.

"
Tell the truth.,
Explain that you tried but didn’t understand the assignment.,
Be creative.",How to Avoid Getting in Trouble for Not Doing Your Homework1," In most cases, being honest and direct is the best course of action. It shows that you’re willing to own up and take responsibility and that you respect the teacher enough not to try to mislead them with a cooked-up story.


Explain why you didn’t do the homework--maybe you forgot about the assignment, got home late, fell asleep, etc. Don’t sugarcoat your reason, but do use some discretion; if you didn’t do your homework because you were at an all-night kegger, keep your reason general (ie, “I didn’t get home until late”) rather than overly specific (ie, “I was too busy doing keg stands”).
Apologize. After giving your reason, sincerely apologize. Don’t gloss over this part--the sincerity of your apology will impact how likely your teacher is to want to help you.
Explain that it won’t happen again--and make sure it doesn’t. Let your teacher know that this was a rare instance of you lapsing on a responsibility and that you’ll be careful that it doesn’t happen again. And--this part is important--keep your word. If you make forgetting your homework habitual, your teacher will not only stop believing your excuses, they’ll rapidly become less sympathetic to your apologies.
Ask for another day to finish the assignment. The best case scenario here is that your teacher will grant you extra time to complete the assignment and won’t penalize you for turning it in past the original deadline. More likely, though, your teacher will offer to let you turn in the assignment late, for partial credit. Don’t gripe about or be ungrateful for partial-credit--it will make it less likely that your teacher will extend you a similar opportunity in the future.;
, This excuse has the virtue of making it seem like you at least tried to do the homework and that there’s a reasonable cause why you couldn’t finish.


Ask the teacher to help you understand the assignment and to let you have another chance at completing it. This both buys you more time and has the added benefit of getting you one-on-one homework help as well.

, If all else fails and you have to concoct a story, at least make it a good one.


If the story’s creative or amusing enough, your teacher might cut you some slack simply because you didn’t give them one of the same boring excuses they always hear.
For example, maybe it just so happened that your parents went out last night and left you with a family friend who turned out to be a clairvoyant and burned all of your homework because he looked into the future and saw that if he didn’t destroy it all your cat would rip your homework to shreds while you slept and you would breathe in a fatal amount of air-borne paper bits and choke to death.

Recognize your stress.,
Recognize that stress is natural and happens to everyone.,
Identify the source of your stress.,
Take action.,
Have a planner or calendar.,
Prioritize.,
Don't procrastinate.,
Be willing to say no.,
Have stress-relieving methods.,
Focus on your achievements.",How to Balance Stress Due to School," You've probably done this already and come to this article for help. If you're not sure, know that school-related stress is extremely common and teen stress rates have been found to be higher than those of adults. Look for the following stress symptoms in yourself:


Increased/decreased appetite
Unintended weight gain or loss
Sleep troubles
Frequent colds and other illnesses
Headaches
Stomach aches and/or nausea
Increased anger, irritability, and/or aggression
Forgetfulness, confusion, and/or disorganization
Frequent mood swings
Social withdrawal;
, In a natural environment, stress is healthy and useful. If a prehistoric human ran into a predator, for instance, their body would operate differently to help the human fight or run. After the encounter was over, the body would return to normal. But in modern times, threats, take the form of duties and work, which hover over people for a long time. When prolonged in situations like that, stress is unhealthy. The stress you're trying to avoid is this kind, the long-term kind.

, Be as specific as possible. Is it a certain class? Are you being harassed or bullied? Is it a mean or intimidating teacher? It will be best to focus your efforts on the most stressful area(s).

, Stress is a serious problem when you have too much of it for too long, so if you feel the need to switch or drop classes or talk to administration, do it. Look at the issues listed above if you're uncertain-- these are awful things to have to live with. If your school is dismissive of the problem, it might even be worth transferring. If the problem is less major-- struggling with a certain class, for example --see if you can get assistance from a teacher, counselor, or parent/guardian.

, When you don't write down your assignments, they clutter up your already-busy mind. Writing down due dates and test days will help you keep track of it all.

, Schools assign a lot of work, and if you often get confused about where to start, you're not alone. Take into consideration due date, grade value, and what teacher assigned it. If you have a math test worth 20% of your grade tomorrow, you should probably save the project due next month for another time. However, if it's a quiz worth 5 points, you might want to focus on the project. Keep in mind, also, the strictness of the teacher you're dealing with. Will the teacher fail you if you don't hand a paper in the minute she asks for it? If so, focus on her assignments. If your teacher is more relaxed about due dates, you can probably hand in a paper a day late or so without a problem.

, If you have a large project to do, dedicate a bit of time to it each day so you don't have to worry about the due date. The very concept of big project can cause stress; the bit-by-bit method will make it seem much less intimidating.

, Many people feel guilty about saying no and end up agreeing to do everything that is asked of them. If you have too much on your plate, say so! You'll thank yourself for it in the long run.

, Sometimes you just need to put the work away for a minute to calm down. Taking breaks is among the methods you can use to relieve stress. Others include taking a walk, getting some fresh air, reading, listening to some music, or having tea or hot chocolate. Try different things to see what soothes you. When you find what works, use it when you're stressed, but also on a daily basis to keep your brain relaxed so that when a challenge comes, you'll be ready to deal with it without stress.


Controlled breathing might help if you don't have any options. Taking deep, slow breaths gives you something else to focus on and supplies your body with more oxygen for thinking things over.

, If you finished seven assignments last night and didn't have time for an eighth, be proud of what you accomplished. Worrying over what you could have done doesn't help. Sometimes you can't do everything, and that's okay! Take pride in your efforts.

Don’t be obvious.,
Don’t blame technology.,
Don’t plead ignorance.",How to Avoid Getting in Trouble for Not Doing Your Homework2," One of the most important parts of getting a little leeway from your teacher is to not insult their intelligence. You’re not the first student to forget homework and try to get out of it. Your teacher has probably heard a list of excuses longer than the number of years you’ve been alive, so don’t go with the first obvious or lame excuse that comes to your head. It probably won’t get you anywhere.It should be obvious, but don’t use “the dog ate my homework.” You might as well not even bother coming up with an excuse at all.
Don’t just say “I lost it” unless you can come up with a believable set of extenuating circumstances to explain how it got lost. Saying it just got lost randomly is pretty transparent.

, Saying your printer didn’t work or your computer froze is definitely a last-generation excuse. With the ubiquity of printers and cloud storage, saying technology mysteriously hijacked your homework is a pretty thin excuse.


Instead of blaming the printer or your laptop, etc., explain that you had trouble when you were trying to print (or whatever) the homework right before class but that you’ll email it to your teacher by the end of the day. You can buy more time with that, and quickly type it up.
Just be sure you actually do send it to them by the end of the day--preferably by 5 pm., Saying you didn’t know it was due or weren’t in class when it was assigned won’t work, for three big reasons.


First, since it’s your responsibility, not theirs, to make sure you’re up-to-date on assignments, this excuse is pretty much like telling the teacher that it was your own fault.
Second, because, from your teacher’s point of view, an entire classroom of other students managed to find out about and do the homework, so it clearly isn’t as hard as you’re making it out to be.And finally, the ignorance excuse won’t work because when you’re absent, your teacher expects that you’ll find out everything you missed. If didn’t, your teacher will again see it as your own fault.

Make a homework game-plan.,
Have a homework schedule.,
Make homework a routine.,
Use free or in-between times to do homework.,
Ask for help.,
Cut out distractions.",How to Avoid Getting in Trouble for Not Doing Your Homework3," Relying on excuses to get you out of homework isn’t a good plan for the long-term. If you find yourself frequently forgetting or otherwise not doing your homework, you need a better game-plame.


Start by writing down every assignment and its due date as soon as it’s assigned.
Be sure to write all of your assignments down in the same place so you don’t miss any or have to go on a desperate search every time you want to know what’s due. A day planner, dedicated homework notebook, or scheduling app are all good options.

, Know when your assignments are due and have a schedule in place that will help you complete each assignment by its due date.


Whenever you get an assignment, estimate how long it will take to complete and set aside the necessary time accordingly.
If it’s an assignment that will take several days or even several weeks, set aside as many blocks of time as you’ll need to complete it over that span of time.

, Set aside a period of time to do homework each night. Preferably make it at the same time every night so it becomes part of your routine.


Don’t procrastinate on homework--don’t let yourself play video games or chat on Facebook until you’ve finished your night’s assignments.
Do the harder assignments first. Getting the harder work out of the way first is a more efficient and rewarding use of your time.

, If you find yourself struggling to finish all of your homework because of time constraints, use small bits of down time to help you make more of a dent in your work.


If you have a study-hall period, a free period, a few minutes between classes, a 10-15 minute bus ride home, etc., use that time to work on homework. Sure, you’d rather be talking to friends or playing on your phone, but if you want to have your homework done, you’ll need to actually take the time to do it., If you find yourself getting bogged down by homework or can’t get the assignments done because you’re struggling to understand the subject matter, ask for help.


Start by approaching the teacher. Explain your difficulties and ask for their help. That’s what your teachers are there for, after all--to help you learn. (And if they show any reluctance to help, remind them of this fact.) They’re the best source of help since they’re the ones making and grading the homework, and having the help of an insider is often invaluable.
Get help from a classmate. If your teacher isn’t able to give as much help as you need, supplement their help with help from a classmate who understands the material and is doing well in the class. If you aren’t sure who that might be, ask your teacher for suggestions.
Get a tutor. Many schools offer free peer-tutoring services that can be a significant help. Ask your teacher or an administrator whether such services are available. If not, consider looking into hiring a tutor. There are a number of professional tutoring services to choose from, or you might try hiring a local college student for tutoring help.

, Like it or not, studying requires focus and concentration. Consequently, a large part of not getting homework done has to do with distractions.Even if you think you’re a great multi-tasker, trying to do homework while also texting, catching up on Facebook, and tweeting about how much you hate homework is actually hurting you more than helping you get through the process.
Moreover, though multitasking can be an asset for some activities, it isn’t an asset when studying. When you’re multitasking, your mind leaves your current train of thought (like, say, trigonometry) and takes up a new train (maybe texting a friend about tomorrow’s plans), and the result is that you end up doing worse on both.
Find a quiet, distraction-free space to do your studying. The better you’re able to concentrate, the better you’ll do on your work and the more quickly you’ll get through it. Put away or turn off anything you know will distract you (your phone, Facebook alerts, whatever).If you find yourself being distracted by thoughts of other things you should or want to be doing, keep a piece of paper next to you where you can write down those thoughts as they come up. Don’t dwell on them, just write them down and know you can get back to them later.Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. For example, set a goal to study for 15-20 minutes straight and then reward yourself with a small treat when you do so."

Get vaccinated.",How to Avoid Getting Sick at School," Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before you eat, and after you use the restroom or come into contact with anything that other students have used before you. Washing your hands often may cause dry skin, so carry moisturizing lotion during winter months.First wet your hands with warm or cool running water, and add soap. The water doesn't need to be hot to clean germs and microbes from your hands.Rub your hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, from the wrists to the tips of your fingers.
If possible, use a nailbrush to clean under your fingernails, where germs collect.
Dry your hands thoroughly with a towel or air dryer.
Use a paper towel to shut off the faucet and open the door.;
, Any germs you pick up on your hands will be transferred to your face, where they enter the body through the mouth and nose., When in doubt, it is a good idea to clean shared equipment, desks, or food trays with hand sanitizer to kill any germs that might be lurking there. Apply it liberally to your skin, and then rub your hands together thoroughly until they are completely dry.Look for a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.Lavender essential oil can be used as a natural hand sanitizer.Hand sanitizers are not as effective when your hands are visibly greasy or dirty.

, Most germs enter your body through your nose and mouth, so it is a good idea to hold your breath for a few moments if you are standing near someone when they cough or sneeze.Sneezing helps keep you healthy by clearing your nose of viruses and bacteria.A sneeze can travel as fast as 200 miles per hour, and can add as many as 40,000 droplets full of germs into the air.To prevent spreading germs yourself, turn your head and cough or sneeze into your sleeve., Although it might feel impolite to refuse your friend a sip of your soda, this is a great way to spread germs. Offer to buy them their own drink, instead., The best way to avoid passing your cold or flu onto someone else is to simply stay home when you are ill. Your body will also recover more quickly if you stay home and rest., Although germs can live on most any surface, they are more likely to collect in certain places than others. In most schools the restrooms are cleaned at least once per day, but there are some areas that are frequently overlooked. It is estimated that 80% of all infections are caused by coming into contact with a contaminated surface.Toilets aren't actually as bad as we think they are, because they are usually cleaned on a regular basis.Door handles collect a lot of germs. Many students skip washing their hands, and then transfer their germs to the door as they leave. You can use a paper towel to open a door so that your hands don't get dirty.

, Cafeteria trays aren't always cleaned between meals. Dishes are always washed after use, but the trays are sometimes overlooked.


If you carry hand sanitizer, use it to wipe your tray before you get in line.
Don't allow your tray to come into contact with any shared surfaces after it's been cleaned.

, The average desk is used by five or six students in a single day. If any of those kids were sick, they probably left some germs behind.


Keyboards and mice are also likely to collect germs.Hand sanitizing wipes are the quickest way to clean shared surfaces.

, Some students put their mouths directly on the faucet, passing along their colds and flu to the next person in line. Try to avoid contact with the spout, and run the water for a few seconds before drinking.


There may be as many as 2.7 million bacteria per square inch living on a public drinking fountain spigot.If you want to be even safer, carry your own water bottle instead.

, Art supplies are often shared, and seldom cleaned. Multiple students may be using the same art supplies in different class periods. Apart from rinsing paint out of brushes, cleaning art supplies is not usually a big priority for students or teachers., Although proper etiquette dictates wiping off exercise equipment after using it, not everyone does this. Shared equipment like balls, bats, and helmets can also be a hotbed for germs.

, Outdoor facilities like park benches and playground equipment are usually not cleaned on a regular basis. Since these items are shared by a great number of students over the course of a day, they tend to collect a lot of germs.


Playground equipment has been shown to harbor trace amounts of fecal matter along with viruses and bacteria.Run the water for a few seconds before drinking from the water fountain. Even better, carry your own water bottle instead.

, One of the best ways to avoid getting sick is to keep your immune system healthy. Try to eat plenty of fish, vegetables, and fruit, and avoid crash diets and rapid weight loss as this can make you more prone to illness.Some of your favorite dishes have significant health benefits during cold and flu season.Onions and garlic have been shown to have antiviral effects.Tuna is packed with glutamine, which improves the efficiency of your immune system.Yogurt contains probiotics, which help lessen the severity of cold symptoms, and shorten the time you will suffer through the sniffles., The best way to get the proper daily allowances of vitamins is to eat a wide variety of different, healthy foods. Because this isn't always possible, it is a good idea to take vitamin supplements, especially during the colder months.Vitamin C won't prevent you from getting a cold, but studies have shown it may slightly help shorten the duration and severity of a cold.It is believed that zinc supports the immune system, possibly stopping the growth of microorganisms in the body, including certain bacteria and cold-causing viruses; however, studies have been mixed in its effectiveness in preventing a cold. Plus there are potential adverse effects from taking zinc. Check with your doctor before taking.Some studies show that while echinacea won't prevent a cold, it can reduce the length and severity of cold symptoms., Moderate exercise boosts the immune system by increasing your overall level of fitness. Walking, in particular, has been linked to an increase in white blood cells, which fight infection. But try to limit exercise if you're already feeling sick, especially if you have a fever – it might actually slow down your recovery.Adolescents should get at least 60 minutes of moderate physical activity per day; adults should get 75 minutes per week of intense activity, or 150 minutes per week of moderate activity.In one study, participants who walked for half an hour each day for one year got half the number of colds as the control group who didn't exercise., Try to avoid processed foods, which often contain high amounts of unhealthy sweeteners. Doctors recommend ingesting no more than 6 teaspoons per day for girls, or 9 teaspoons for guys. A typical can of soda contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar – well above the recommended daily limit.Excessive sugar intake interferes with your white blood cells' ability to combat bacteria and viruses.Studies have shown that simple carbohydrates like sugar can interfere with the body's immune system for many hours after ingesting it.

, Your body needs sufficient rest in order to keep up its defenses. Doctors recommend seven to eight hours of sleep for adults, but teens require more sleep. You may need as many as nine and a half hours per day to remain healthy.One study showed that people who skimped on sleep were almost three times as likely to get a cold as those who slept eight hours per night.Sleep deprivation can also cause chronic stress, which will increase the severity of symptoms if you do get sick., A flu shot greatly reduces the chances that you will get seasonal flu and pass it on to others. Experts now say that everyone older than 6 months of age should be vaccinated on an annual basis.Seasonal flu shots are formulated to combat the specific influenza viruses that research indicates will be the most common that year.
Despite the rumors, you can't get sick from getting a flu shot – flu vaccines are made either with inactivated, non-infectious viruses, or no viruses at all.

Studies have shown that young people working toward clear goals have higher achievements and life satisfaction.Write a list of the things you’d like to be able to provide for yourself as an adult. Some examples of things you want as an adult might include:


Traveling the world
Supporting a family
Driving a good car
Buying season tickets for your favorite sports team
Having extra money to see concerts, eat out in fancy restaurants, see plays, etc.;
, You want to love the job you have when you grow up, so take your time in school to prepare the skills you’ll need to get that job.


Make a list of all the jobs you can see yourself being happy in.
For each job, list the skills you’ll need to do that job well.
Match up those skills with the classes and clubs at school that will prepare you for your dream job.
Work extra hard in those classes. Join those clubs. Know that working hard in school will ensure a fulfilling career later in life.

, This doesn’t mean that you should be talking through class or passing notes, but it does mean to make school more enjoyable by embracing your classmates. Don’t have a bad, grumpy attitude just because you’re in school. Enjoy your classmates’ company, and you might even find yourself looking forward to school.


Make good use of your downtime at school. Lunchtime and the time between classes is a great time to recharge your energy before your next class by having a good laugh with a friend.
Join after-school clubs and teams to find people who share your interests.

, If you don’t set yourself up to do well in school, you’ll absolutely hate facing it every day. So you must try hard., Successful people often stick to regular routines to help them stay on task and achieve their goals..
There might be some variation throughout the week — for example, you might have a club or practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but not the other days. But every week, you should know what to expect from each day.
Give yourself a break from time to time. Studies have shown that taking a break to recharge when you feel like you’re going to burn out help improve your productivity., School won’t seem so overwhelming if you stay on top of all of your obligations. Buy a daily planner to help keep track of the schedule you created in the previous step. Write down all your homework in this calendar, as well as due-dates for long-term assignments and projects.


Remember to write reminders about long-term projects in the days leading up to the due-date, so you don’t forget about it until the last second.
You can also use a calendar app on your cell phone to keep track of your obligations. Most apps can be programmed to remind you of deadlines., If you’re working in a hectic space, you’ll hate the time you spend working. Make sure your study space is set up to help you enjoy your study time as well as you can.


Keep your desk neat and clean so you don’t get frustrated by how sloppy it is.
Keep your tools (pencils, highlighters, staplers) neatly organized so you can find them easily.
Make sure the space is well-lit. Dim lighting can give you a headache, which definitely won’t help you stay motivated.
Figure out if you work best with silence or with a little background noise. Some people are distracted by noise, while others can’t work without a little music playing in the background.

, When you study with friends, it doesn't feel so painful! But you have to make sure you stay on task instead of joking around and having a good time.


Study groups should have no more than 3-4 members so they don't get unruly
Meet at least once a week on a regular schedule. You can meet at school during a free period, or after school at somebody's house.
Volunteer to be the group leader/coordinator. You will determine what classes and projects the group will focus on in a given week, so that everyone's working together and helping each other instead of randomly working on their individual projects.
Prepare for each session. Don't just show up and expect to do work in your study group. Come prepared with insight on the task you've been working on all week.
Remember to give the group short breaks from time to time to relax and recharge.

, Remember that you don't have to finish a project in one sitting.


List all the different steps you must complete to finish the project.
Make a schedule that forces you to finish one small piece of the project per day.
For a paper, you might read and summarize one source on day one; another source on day two, a third source on day three; synthesize their arguments on day four; outline your own argument on day five; integrate quotations from your sources into your outline on day six; write your paper on days seven and eight; rest on day nine; and revise on day ten.

, If you want to stay motivated in school, you need something to look forward to. Bargain with yourself: if you study for two hours, you can watch your favorite tv show at 8:00. If you get an A on your paper, you'll take the whole weekend off and just relax.


Remember that nobody can work all the time. Give yourself a little time off when you deserve it.
If you don't meet your goals, keep yourself to your promise. If you goof off on Facebook for half of the two hours you were supposed to be studying, don't let yourself watch your favorite tv show!

, You'll work harder during the week if slacking off means you can't go to the movies with your friends over the weekend.

, Spread the news: you're setting a high bar for yourself. Tell your friends, your parents, tell everyone you know that you plan on bringing your English grade up to a B by the end of the semester, or that you're going to ace the chemistry test. By telling others about your goals, you will work harder to avoid the embarrassment of failing to meet those goals.


If you work your best and still fail to meet those goals, don't be discouraged. Redouble your efforts. With hard work and time, you'll meet your goals.

, Meditation will clear your mind of the distractions that might keep you from focusing on your studies. Before you sit down to study, set aside fifteen minutes to meditate; this will help you get in the right state of mind for working toward your goals without distractions.


Find a quiet environment.
Sit cross-legged on the ground in a comfortable position, supporting your back against a wall if you need to.
Close your eyes and focus on the darkness.
Think about nothing but the darkness that you see. Don't let yourself think about anything else.
When fifteen minutes have passed, get to work!

, You read interesting articles online and watch interesting videos online and on TV. Summary is one of the most useful skills you can have, and it's the foundational building block of everything you do in school. By practicing this skill on stories and information you find personally interesting, you are honing an important academic skill while thinking about something you actually enjoy.

, A good way to bring your mind back into focus is to practice mindfulness tricks.


Create a simple but distinct action that sends a clear message to yourself
It should be something you don't do on a regular basis — wiggling your toes, for example.
Every time you feel your mind drifting away, wiggle your toes to snap yourself back into focus.

, Counting backwards from 100 will help calm you down and focus your mind.

, Studies have shown that exercising for as little as ten minutes before tackling a task can improve performance by increasing the flow of blood to the brain.The effects can last up to a few hours, so there's a big payoff for a little bit of exercise.


Try jumping rope, doing jumping jacks, running in place, or any other simple activity you can do easily in your room.

, Studies have shown that teenagers’ bodies don’t function well early in the morning, so many middle and high schoolers have trouble focusing in school because they’re sleepy.A large part of why many students don’t like school is that they’re tired. Teenagers’ bodies naturally want to stay up late and sleep in late, but you need to train your body to your school schedule.


Make yourself get in bed at a reasonable hour, even if you’re not tired yet.
Don’t watch tv or use your computer for at least an hour before you go to bed.Don’t take naps during the day, so you’ll be more tired at night.

, It might not be immediately obvious how your diet relates to your performance in school, but it’s very important! A poorly balanced diet might fill you up, but it won’t necessarily give you the energy you need to stay focused and productive, and you won’t be motivated if you’re tired.Remember to always eat breakfast to help power up your body first thing in the morning.


Fish with omega-3 and whole grains improve memory function.
Dark fruits and vegetables provide anti-oxidants that improve memory and cognition.Foods rich in Vitamin B, including spinach, broccoli, and beans, are good for memory and alertness.

, Many studies have demonstrated a link between exercise and improved productivity, so stay active.Regular exercise will not only help you focus when you’re studying, but it also improves your mood.Being focused and in a good mood are very important to staying motivated for school.

Don’t go out of your way.",How to Be a Good Student Without Being Teacher's Pet1," Instead of asking questions every time your teacher finishes their sentence, limit them to one or two insightful and relevant questions. If you want, you can prepare these questions before class. They could be insights from last night’s homework, or general clarifying questions. By limiting your questions, you are allowing other students the opportunity to ask the teacher questions, as well.When the teacher announces something, wait a few seconds to see if others have the same question before you ask your question.
If you have more questions, speak with your teacher after class or schedule a time to talk with your teacher instead of asking too many questions during class.;
, Volunteering to help your teacher clean the chalkboard, pass out worksheets, or send a message to another class once in a while is fine. However, limit these opportunities to once or twice a week. Let other students volunteer their time to help the teacher with smaller tasks.Instead, volunteer for the tasks that you enjoy doing, and leave the other ones to other students. For example, if you like passing out worksheets, then just volunteer to pass out worksheets. Let other students clean the chalkboard, send messages, or take attendance.

, Unless you have poor eyesight or poor hearing, it would not hurt to sit in the middle or the back of the classroom from time to time. Sure, sitting in the front of the class every day makes you look engaged and ready to learn, but you do not want to monopolize the front seats.By sitting in the middle or the back of the class, you are giving others the chance to sit in the front of the class.
Remember that the teacher can see you no matter where you sit, and you can still be engaged even from the back of the classroom.

, A lot of students get labeled “teacher’s pet” because they go out of their way to impress the teacher. They try their very hardest to please the teacher by bringing them gifts, complimenting them, or by taking their side versus the class’ side. These are not bad things to do, but try to limit your compliments and gifts to rare occasions.For example, only give your teacher gifts during holidays, or when it is their birthday.
Compliment your teacher when they truly deserve it, for example, when you find their lesson particularly interesting.

Be friendly and approachable.,
Impress your teachers.",How to Be a Bright Child in School," If you have to do it on a computer, take out a few hours from all your other websites and do your work. Make sure that you have a comfortable environment to work in.


If you need help keeping your grades high, ask your parents and teachers for support and tutoring. Go the extra mile to build your academic skills.;
, Being bright at school requires hard work at home, too. Make sure you have somewhere comfortable to complete your assignments, review your subjects, and study for exams.


Be sure you have somewhere to work that's free of distractions. Focusing on your assignments without getting distracted by friends, siblings, technology, or other factors will help you get higher grades and learn more.
It can help to ensure you have a comfortable environment that's the right temperature, too. In the summer, have a quiet, cool climate with air coolers and a cold drink. In the winter, have a quiet, warm space with heaters and hot chocolate (or the hot beverage you prefer).

, Keep your materials neat and clean. Being organized and neat will help you complete your assignments more efficiently, avoid losing important materials, and streamline your learning. Making sure that your assignments, supplies, and self are neat and clean also creates a better impression for your teachers and classmates.

, Once you build your skills in a given area, participate in contests against other talented people in your field. Whether it's a dance competition or a spelling bee, participating in competitions that challenge you is a great way to shine.


Be a good sport as you compete. Although you will get some envious people, learn to get them on your side. Console them and encourage them. Behave like you wanted them to win. If you end up losing your contest, don't be a sore loser; appreciate the chance you had to compete, and congratulate the winners.

, While looking good isn't directly related to being bright or intelligent, being hygienic and healthy is a good step in helping you succeed, in life in general and at school. If you take care of yourself and stay healthy, you'll miss fewer days of school, have more energy for your classes and other activities, and look better, too.

, Being kind to all the people around your school will help you be a star on campus. Always keep a smile ready for the people you know - and even those you don't.


Building friendly connections with people around school can end up helping your academics and performance in extracurricular activities, too. The more people you have ""in your corner"" and on your side, the more people you can ask for help when you need it. If you find you need tutoring, assistance, or other support, you'll have more people willing to help you out if you're generally likable and approachable.

, Being personable, curious, and dedicated to your learning will help you shine in your teachers' eyes. Without being annoying to the teachers or irritating to your classmates, try to become your teacher's pet.

Don't brag about your grades.,
Avoid being a tattletale.,
Don't worry about what others think of you.",How to Be a Good Student Without Being Teacher's Pet2," You should feel proud about your grades, and the time you spent studying to get them. However, bragging to your peers about how well you did in class can be bothersome. When you brag, you are emphasizing differences between you and your classmates and friends. This creates distance between you and them, and your peers might start to resent you.When talking about your achievements, highlight commonalities between you and your peers. For example, instead of saying, ""I got the highest grade in the class,"" say, ""Like you guys, I worked really hard on this project, and I worked even harder to get the grade that I got.""

, Don't go out of your way to inform the teacher about every little thing students do. Instead, use your judgment to decide whether it is important enough to tell your teacher. If it is, then tell your teacher discreetly, instead of outing the person in front of the whole class.Try to remember that it is your teacher’s job to keep every one in line, not yours.

, Don't feel like you need to make major personal changes, or risk your academic success, to get others to like you or stop calling you ""teacher's pet."" Remember that true acceptance comes from within. Therefore, as long as you accept who you are, what others think of you is a small matter.Plus, what others think about you is out of your control. Instead, focus your energy on bettering yourself and moving forward instead of changing what others think of you.

Break the rules.,
Make friends.,
Be motivated.",How to Be a Good Student Without Being Teacher's Pet3," It is ok to break the rules once in a while. One little mark is not going to tarnish the reputation your teacher has of you. If anything, it makes you seem more human and relatable to your peers.Don’t be afraid to whisper to your friend, pass a note, or make a joke during class. As long as you don’t make a habit out of it, and keep it moderation, you should be fine.

, A tell-tale sign that you are a teacher’s pet is if your only friend is the teacher. This isn’t necessarily bad, but it can be lonely at times. Try to branch out and befriend other students. Make friends with students whom you have things in common with. Perhaps you love to eat chocolate, read books, or love the Christmas season. These are pretty common things that you can use to connect with other people.Revealing tiny secrets that are slightly embarrassing is a good way to deepen a friendship. By sharing intimate details about yourself, you are showing the other person that you are human, and thus, relatable.

, A great student is a student that is motivated, and you can be motivated without being teacher’s pet. Instead of channeling your energy into pleasing the teacher (we know it takes a lot of energy and time), channel your energy into your interests.For example, try starting a photography, book, fashion club, or any kind of club at school.
If you like planning events, you can help plan school events, like pep rallies, Christmas parties, and field days, for example.

Be civil and respectful around school generally.",How to Avoid Getting Expelled from School," You won't be expelled just for not handing in a couple of assignments on time but consistently not doing the work you are given will lead to trouble. If you find your schoolwork too hard or too easy, talk to someone, your year tutor, the head of department or your favorite teacher. Teachers always want to help pupils who want to learn. If you are close to being expelled or have already been suspended or had a lot of detentions, all because you are too challenged by the work or not challenged enough, you must be brave and say something;
, If someone tries to talk to you when the teacher has asked for quiet, try ignoring them. If this doesn't work, then consider telling them to not talk to you. Don't do other work than the current class assignment. Don't gaze out of the window, daydream or doodle. Listening to your teacher will help you understand the subject and complete the work.

, All schools have their own rules. Some of them can be strict. Figure out what you are doing, making sure you are not violating the rules. Playing truant, not sticking to the school dress code, bullying, bringing banned items to school, behaving aggressively, skipping lessons and time keeping are all behaviors that could get you expelled. Stick to the school rules about these things in particular.

, If you see a fight happening, do not engage in it. Just continue to where you are going. If it looks like bullying, two kids on one or an older kid on a younger one, tell a member of staff.

, Don't get aggressive in any way whatsoever, as aggression can sometimes lead to violence. Violent outbursts of aggression such as breaking windows or throwing chairs may get you expelled.

, Some people believe that if you stand by doing nothing when someone else is doing wrong, you are just as guilty as they are. If you are reporting a bully (or bullies) to the staff, do not be a tattletale and exaggerate anything or make up stories. Tell the truth when reporting incidents, you may not be believed if you have lied in the past, so always be honest.

, Someone nice is usually more appreciated than someone who is not. Try to be a pleasure to teach, without being a teacher's pet if possible and your chances of getting expelled will be next to zero.

, This may result in you being expelled quickly. This includes fighting, play fighting and risky behavior such as climbing or playing chicken. Think about what could happen before you agree to any sort of dare. Things involving heights, fire, deep water, pressurized containers etc can get out of hand very quickly.

, Vandalizing the school may result in you being expelled, if the school finds out it is you behind the vandalism. Be respectful of the things that are in place to give you a chance of a good education. Don't tear pages out of books, carve your name into your desk, smash windows or 'tag'.

, School can be frustrating, upsetting, aggravating, annoying and generally not a great experience for some, especially those whose home life is challenging too. Ask for help in school if things are hard at home. Talk to the school nurse if you feel uncomfortable talking to your teachers. If you are angry, try to calm down. Anger may result in aggression.

, Infantile behavior is only appropriate for infants. Use the bathroom as the bathroom. Using the hallway as the bathroom may make the staff very angry unless you have a genuine medical problem that means you have issues with using a bathroom. Make sure staff in school are aware of any special situations you have. If you are diabetic for example, you may need to eat in class. Eating in class is probably against school rules, but your teachers will make allowances for you if they know. Don't get into trouble for anything that isn't your fault and expelling you will be the last thing on your head teacher's mind.

, If aiding for a teacher (aiding means assisting (some schools allow students to help teachers)), stop any breaking of the rules. For example, if there are students fighting, your intervention skills will be needed. Don't put yourself at risk breaking up fights.

, When school ends, don't bash out the door like you are happy and cheering. Just be calm like the other students and walk calmly out the door.

, Nothing like Pop-tarts or sugary cereals. Try to eat oatmeal or some fruit.

, People say looks don't matter, but they do to some extent. Make sure your clothes are clean, and if you're feeling ambitious maybe you can even match your clothes. If you have to wear a uniform, try to make it unique to yourself. Accessorize with jewelry and different types of shoes.

, Nobody wants to be around somebody who smells like they haven't showered in three days. Shower once a day, and maybe twice a day if you play a sport. Wash up every morning, you don't want to look like you fell straight into school from your bed. Brush your teeth too for two minutes. This should apply to weekdays and weekends. Don't forget deodorant! Make sure your hair is clean and your nails aren't all covered in some mystery dirt.

, Listen. Foundation, blush, eyeliner, and mascara is heavy make-up in high school. Special events are different, but for everyday use, mascara and foundation will do just fine. Even a little eyeliner if that's your style.

, Don't be afraid to smile. However, if you're walking through the hall, smiling at nothing, people will think you're crazy. Smiling at people is okay, but wear a neutral expression when you're walking through the halls. For everyone's peace of mind.

, It doesn't work that way.

, Don't slack off all the time and then get pissed when you have C's and D's. If you get an F you need to focus way more on schoolwork than whatever else it is you're spending your time on.

, Don't hang out with people that you want to be like, unless those people are straight-A honor students who have lots of fun non-drug using friends and a great relationship with their family. Stay away from druggies, and don't worry about not recognizing them, because it's normally quite obvious.

, Find some after school activities that you like, and go for it. Whether it be sports, drama, or German, find a club!

, You could have a lot of fun, and maybe even meet new people. And most schools have a very small group of kids who are involved in plays, and they're usually delighted when new people get involved. As long as you're respectful of course.

Wear sea-inspired clothes.,
Add ocean accessories.,
Add a mermaid tail, if wished.",How to Look Like a Mermaid1," Weave oceanic colors like blue and green into your wardrobe. Maxi dresses and skirts flow in waves like the sea, as do some scarves. Gold jewelry is sometimes associated with mermaids––go for hammered gold or replicas of ancient coins, as if it were something you found on the sea floor.

When you go swimming, add a swim skirt or even a silicone mermaid tail to your swim suit.;
, You do not necessarily need starfish, or other used-to-be-alive animals, because some mermaids are against hurting aquatic animals. If you want to wear ocean animal-related accessories, replicas of dolphins, sea turtles, and tiny fish can be a cute touch.


Wear subtle sea related jewelry, including bracelets, bangles, necklaces, pendants, head bands, hair bands, wrist bands, rings, earrings, and anything else you think resembles the ocean.
Consider hats and scarves, with pops of sea colors.

, You can make your own mermaid tail or purchase one from a costume store."
"
Get the hair.,
Wear light, sparkly makeup and a light shade of lip gloss.,
Keep your skin soft and hydrated.,
Paint your fingernails.",How to Look Like a Mermaid2," Most mermaids are portrayed as having long, wavy hair. Grow out your hair and always keep it clean to give it that lovely shine. If you have short hair, consider getting extensions.


Spraying your hair with a bit of salt water will give it a hint of an ocean scent.
In the way of accessories, go for flower crowns and shell clips to give yourself a natural look.
Dyeing the ends of your hair in green or blue could enhance your look.
If your hair is tangled, take special care. Start by smoothing lots of conditioner over your hair. Take a wide-toothed comb and work it gently through the hair, finally comb through the hair with a fined-toothed comb until the tangles are removed. Brush your hair every day to keep it tangle-free.







, Remember, mermaids are very natural, so don't go overboard! Wear a small bit of mascara or liquid eyeliner to give you the beautiful look of a mermaid.


For a natural ""just got out of the water"" look, wear clear lip gloss, pearly white eyeshadow, and clear nail-polish.
Spray a light mist of water from the spray bottle into your face form about arm's length for a beautiful glowing look. You might want to wear waterproof makeup if you do this.

, Don't let cracks appear on your lips or your feet, or your skin loses its moisture.Use high quality creams, moisturizers, and apply lemon juice and yogurt over your body once a week.It naturally increases the water holding capacity and endurance of your skin.Mermaids don't have cracked skin!, Stick to colors like silver, blue, purple, green, gold, or coral-pink.


Consider using mood changing nail polish.

Speak minimally, but when you do, engage into a very interesting conversation.,
Swim a lot.,
Have a deep level of sea knowledge.",How to Look Like a Mermaid3," A couple of times you are allowed to relate it to the ocean or the beach. While speaking to someone in person, look into their eyes with a soft gaze and a dreamy look.

, Swim in the day. Swim in the night. Whenever you get the chance, jump into the water, and don't take a quick shower unless pool rules require it.


When underwater, stay longer than others and take the dolphin dives. Don't stay longer than you can cope with though; you are, after all, an air-breathing human pretending to be a mermaid.
If you swim where there are plants growing on the sea or lake bed, always pull out a weed or two and stick them in your hair. Play with the fish there, and swim for a lot of time.
After coming out of the water, act as if you are not properly able to walk. Hey, you have been using your mermaid tail!

, Know everything about marine creatures, ranging from all plants to animals. Keeping information about local lakes, ponds, rivers and beaches adds up as well. If you have some biology class in which the discussion is about aquatic life, be ready to answer any question the students or teacher throws at you, and always correct the mistakes of others.

If you have a crush, subtly show them that you`re into them.,
Take interest in sophisticated hobbies like writing, reading, drawing, painting, poetry, and listening to classical music.",How to Look and Act Like a Teenage Vampire," Since you`re trying to be a teenage vampire, you`ll have to start paying attention to your schoolwork! Vampires are almost always smart and intellectual, so read up on books that you`ll enjoy and learn from! Start with simple books, or maybe How To books on extraordinary topics. Then try to get deeper by reading poetry, vampire novels, mysteries, and maybe even subscribe to a magazine! Just as long as you expand your intellectual side and learn new things, anything is possible!;
, If your teeth are a mess or are yellow, try getting braces or seeing a dentist for more on target details! Vampires have great teeth, so follow the dentist`s instructions for a healthy smile! If you feel brave enough to wear these in school, go out and buy clip on fangs that aren't tacky or glow in the dark. Yet, if you`re going to do this, only do this if your teeth are white and straight! Otherwise, it might look a bit silly!

, You have to look the part! Yet in this day and age, you might feel silly wearing long black coats, dresses, or gloves to school. Instead, find some nice dark clothing (black, dark blue, deep red, deep green, dark purple, etc..) made of lace, satin, silk, or anything that looks like it has a Victorian touch to it.


Then, once you've got a nice sultry piece of clothing, add something with a splash of color to it, like a bright necklace, rings, earrings, or even a belt. Yet don`t go overboard, and remember to buy skirts as well as jeans if you`re a girl. It`s really great to buy dresses for the spring and summer as well, and they don`t have to be in dark colors, but any colors you choose!
Keep it flowery, beautiful and elegant looking, maybe adding sandals, gloves, or a sunhat to it as well! Remember one thing as well- you want to look sweet, light and dark,vampire-like, and classy! Don`t go too light, and don`t go too dark! (Great colors to use: Black, dark purple, dark blue, white, off-white, tan/brown, deep red, gray, gold/silver, and maybe even some pink.)

, Since teenagers have trouble with understanding some aspects of life, it`s best if you start this step out slowly. Make sure you observe a lot, keeping your eyes open and observing everything.


To really play up the part, stare at someone for a really long time until they look at you, and then just smirk sweetly and mysteriously, making sure to look away. When you come into school, always make eye contact with friends, teachers, and even enemies.
You want to look intellectual, but remember to keep the gaze amused- not too creepy, and not too rude. Whenever you talk to someone, always think before you speak. Really listen to what someone is asking or telling you before responding. Add in a special touch of drama by saying nothing for a second or two, then answer them with a smooth voice.
Try not to overreact to anything as well, like per se you see a spider. If spiders and bugs in general freak you out, try to just ignore them and deal with them instead of screaming loudly:""OMG- SPIDER!!!AH!!!"" This is not vampire material.

, While you're putting on a façade of being a sweet vampire, it`s still nice to have some friends!


Do extraordinary things with them on time off, like taking a walk in the park, or going out for lunch. Maybe just inviting them over for a cup of tea and a movie. It`s your call- just remember to smile mysteriously and make eye contact a lot, along with keeping them guessing about what you`re thinking as well! You`ll have them wondering who you truly are all right!

, Vampires don`t have pimples or flaws, but being teenagers, we DO. So try getting a facial wash and some good acne products while eating plenty of fruit and veggies! This`ll support a healthy immune system and healthy skin- don`t forget your vitamins!

, Playing a sport and joining a team are easy for teens at school. Vampires aren't usually big and bulky, but even if you are, stay in character, stay healthy, and you`ll be just fine!

, Some things can be goth, while other things girly- you are a sweet vampire, after all.

, Whisper in their ear in a crowded room, smirk and smile pleasantly at them, hug them whenever the moment`s right (but not too much) and always act like something smells good when you`re around them. (which is like their blood!) Remember to not overreact around them, and always stay pleasant and well mannered- they will be hooked!

, If your school ever hosts operas or plays, go to them and observe everything while boosting your culture as well! People,specially adults, will notice how amazingly different you are from everyone else!

Lestat's attitude is usually moody.",How to Behave Like the Vampire Lestat," First and foremost, Lestat is charming and well-loved, and has many friends from all walks of life. Don't be afraid to strike up conversations with, well, just about anyone! Be sure the conversation is about something interesting and slightly unique. Art, music and the theatre are good, but always seem mysterious and or unique.;
, Lestat takes good care of his loved ones, for the most part. Do your best to be around when people need you, and to show your loved ones that they are appreciated. Pay attention to your family and friends, and shower them with gifts. It doesn't have to be expensive.

, Do your best to learn all about proper etiquette (especially antiquated manners and affectations) and take an interest in the fine arts.Such as piano, poetry, painting, etc. (Remember Lestat loves his music so try to take time in that.)

, Not annoyingly melodramatic, but have a very noticeable sense of style. Lestat wears everything from black velvet and antique lace to leather and chains, to tailored fashions and violet-tinted sunglasses. Growing your hair out ""long and full"" and giving it a slight wave is a good idea. Applying some light powder (either bronzed or translucent, depending on the look you're going for) and eyeliner isn't a bad idea at all.

, Get well-made, classy and dark things with it. Lestat has all kinds of money, but you might not. Live within your means but get nice things when you can. This goes with having taste. If you live on a budget, you can usually go to a Goodwill, E-bay, or Craigslist for very neat things to go with your look.

, Lestat's taste in music is as eclectic as his taste in clothing and friendships. Favorites seem to be any kind of violin, symphonic metal, death metal and Classic or Romantic-era orchestra pieces.

, Such as Edgar Allen Poe or any other very strange poet.

, If you're experiencing a strong emotion, don't dance around it! Get your true feelings out in the open and experience them fully. But just don't go too far. Vampires usually hide their emotions to fool humans.

, Make friends with some but always have a rather small group of people that you mainly adore and care for like Lestat had. Find someone who is your total opposite but at the same time complements your personality. Don't worry if you disagree; Lestat and Louis fight a LOT but really they adore each other. You'll always reunite!

, His emotions change rather fast.He has some-what of a short temper so be kind of short with people. Although he can be loving and caring, just don't get him upset.

Use shimmery white and blue eye shadow.",How to Pretend to Have Ice Powers (for Girls)1," To convince people of your ice powers, your look should bring winter to mind. Wear clothes in shades of blue, white, and silver for an icy appearance. Snowy patterns like prints of snowmen and icicles are also good., Give yourself an ice-kissed look by putting real or faux winter colors in your hair.

, To give yourself a snowy appearance, opt for necklaces, bracelets, rings or earrings with snowflake or icicle patterns. You can also choose scarves woven with metallic thread for a shimmery, icy exterior.


If you can’t find accessories in a snowy pattern, opt for silver-tone jewelry. It has a cooler, more wintery look than gold.
Wear jewelry with crystals, which look like icicles.

, Nail polish is a great way to get an icy look. You can find tutorials online for nail art designs of snowflakes or snowmen, or you can simply opt for icy blue or silver polish. Some nail polish even has glitter, which makes your hands look unusual and magical., Seek out eye shadow in wintery colors like white and blues. You can also find eye shadow with a metallic sheen to enhance the magical nature of your look."

Search around the internet for inspiration.,
Begin embodying an Elven personality.,
Start acting more elf-like.,
Utilize Elven language and speaking mannerisms.,
Understand Elven lifestyle.,
Select the appropriate colours.,
Select Elven jewelry.,
Choose appropriate hair.,
Adopt the Elven clothing style.",How to Be an Elven Otherkin," It can be difficult sometimes to find inspiration for lifestyle choices or for clothing, so here's a list of Instagram users to borrow some ideas from.


@tathariel@saeth_snowbane@nilenia@meldawen@elverynel@thevikingqueen;
, Elves are known for their grace and elegance, often being seen as cold where they're actually just calm. Remember: fighting is never a solution, it is always a problem.


Sincere: Elves are honest when required to be and always mean what they say. They aren't known to spread gossip or rumors about anyone/thing. When hearing rumors about someone or foul gossip, try to ignore it; or at least try not to tell anyone about it.
Calm: Usually found playing gentle music or reading under a tree, an Elf isn't one to run wildly around screaming at the top of their lungs for amusement. A suggested activity is finding a comfortable spot somewhere quiet and do some sketching or read your favourite book.
Brave: Don't be afraid to have an opinion and stand behind it when questioned, don't allow others to intimidate you. Be careful, however, not to come off as aggressive or hostile without provocation. Stand up for others when they're in need and always try to be a guardian for wildlife where possible.
Strong-willed: If you make a decision or a commitment, stand by it. Don't waver if the path ahead seems difficult in certain situations. Take it as a challenge and face it head on.
Independent: Elves aren't the type to yearn for constant attention. They often prefer their own company, or the company of those they trust. Try to find ways to entertain yourself when you're alone as to not dislike your own company.
Polite: Always treat those around you with respect where respect is due. Those older than you, teachers and other authority figures should always be treated properly. However, try not to be a pushover. If you're not being treated with respect then you should let those being disrespectful know what they're doing wrong.

, Elves act in a certain way. This is important because it defines their very culture.


Quiet: Elves are known for their low noise-level. This includes quiet gatherings, walking almost silently where possible, keeping the voice at a comfortable but not overly loud tone and carrying out activities with peace.
Posture: If it's possible, try to sit straight with your shoulders back and breathe with your stomach and not your shoulders Traveling: When walking, Elves walk with a purpose. This means knowing where you're going, or at least why you're walking. Walk with your chin up and your shoulders back; this gives you an air of confidence and authority.
Meddling: Elves don't interfere with the affairs of others. This means not being involved with school-related drama, friend drama and situations of the like. When giving advice, don't take sides and give advice lightly. ""Elves seldom give un-guarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill."" - Gildor Inglorion, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien , The tongue of the Elves can be a gentle and soft one when spoken in a form, or harsh and cutting in another. You have the option of speaking your regular language or Elvish.There are many types of elvish but the two main types you can learn are Sindarin and Quenya . There are many guides on the internet to learning those languages.If you choose to speak your native language, there are a few points to remember.


Speak slowly and with purpose; anything worth saying is said slowly and clearly
Do not swear! Swearing is both unintelligent and rude. If you're angry, there are much better ways of expressing it vocally over swearing. Although Elves do try not to become angry with others, if it's impossible to remain calm and you feel the need to express your emotion, try to learn Elvish insults to hurl at your antagonist. Not only will it confuse them, but you'll be insulting them in hilarious ways without even swearing.
Some Elves speak with a melody whereas others speak with confidence. Choose the way you want to speak based around how you feel as an Elf.

, Elves revere nature and wildlife above all and do their best to work with nature as often as they can. It is not required for you to become a vegetarian to be an Elf, as long as you are sure that the meat you're eating was killed and prepared in the most humane and animal-friendly way possible.


Be respectful and aware of nature; this can be done through going on regular walks through nature trails, learning about different animals and making your environment available to them or through having plants and animals in your house. Above all, always treat them with respect!
Recycle where you can. This helps the Earth and the environment and will benefit our future generations.
Try to live an eco-friendly life; you can find out how by researching different topics right here on wikiHow!
Find an interest in music and culture, whether it be through learning to play an instrument, visiting art galleries and museums or listening to music. There's no wrong way to do it!
Athletics. Elves are well known for their athletic abilities. Not everyone has a strong passion for sports and athletics. Those who do can embrace that and learn gymnastics, archery, running, sword-fighting, martial arts, etc.For those who aren't so keen, you can go on regular walks to nice places, do yoga to increase your flexibility and reflexes as well as smaller things like hula-hooping, skipping, etc.
Intelligence. Try to learn facts on many subjects. Elves are very knowledgable and wise, often learning different languages or fun facts. Take some time to read interesting non-fiction books or learn something new.
Be peaceful. Don't start fights, don't be rude, don't litter and don't make a fool of yourself through drinking and drugs.

, There are many colours you can wear for different reasons.


Wood Elves should focus their attention of golds, browns, oranges and dark greens. This helps to blend into your surroundings as well as reflect your origins.
For more elegant elves, the focus should be on cold colours such as silver, white, light grey and light blue.
Those feeling a little sneakier and darker should focus on dark browns, dark greens and dark blues. Try to stay altogether away from black colours as they're rather harsh.

, This can be a nice touch to any Elf's outfit, if done correctly.


Those focusing on elegance and grace should focus on silver trinkets. A prime example is the Evenstar necklace from The Lord of the Rings. Other pieces can include silver rings with crystals in/on them, silver headpieces (hair chains, circlets, headbands), silver bangles, arm cuffs and silver earrings.
The more adventurous Elves should wear more earthy pieces. A suggested material is wood with a black fabric 'chain'. The pieces the adventurers should focus on are wooden pendants featuring leaves, animals, symbols or anything else that just feels right. Wooden bracelets are a good addition as are dark green earrings and cuffs. Try to wear less jewelry with these styles as they wouldn't be very convenient in an adventure!
Gold colours go well with darker tones. Brunette's and darker-skinned Elves very much suit golden colours. Gold is a very noble colour but can also be put in with lesser adventurers and explorers.

, Elven hair need not be long and straight! Here are some different styles to try:


Braided/Plaited: You can never go wrong with braided hair. Whether it be one large braid or many smaller braids in a larger hairstyle, it always works.
Down: If you have shoulder-length hair or longer, having your hair down can look wonderful. Try to keep your hair healthy by staying away from heat . If you do use heat, protect your hair accordingly beforehand.If you choose to keep your hair down, you could pull your fringe and the side of your hair behind into a plait and have two parts of your hair coming forward over your shoulder with the rest down your back.
Short: Short hair can look just as good. Try to style it in a pixie/faerie like manner. Add some hair accessories such as flowers, leaves or intricate patterns.

, This is a little more personal and requires more of your own ideas rather than a guide. Here are a few outfit suggestions to start you off:


A forest-green or olive-green shirt over coffee-coloured jeans/leggings with a large coffee-coloured corset-style belt over the shirt. Add some ankle/calf high boots with small or flat heels for an adventurous look. For warmth in the colder months, add a dark green/brown hoodie or even a cloak.
A long, white chiffon dress with angel-sleeves and a tighter waist coupled with flat silver shoes or small heels and a white throw-over for the elegant look. For extra warmth in the winter, add warm leggings underneath the dress and replace the shawl with a knitted cardigan.
A green/brown tabard, dress or tunic with leggings and sensible boots. Add a belt with a large viking/celtic styled buckle and some bracers for a warrior look.

Talk about how the cold doesn’t bother you.,
Dip your hands in cold water then touch a friend.,
Glance at your hands wistfully when people mention ice or snow.,
Tell people about upcoming winter weather patterns.",How to Pretend to Have Ice Powers (for Girls)2," People with ice powers are impervious to feeling the pain normal people feel when touching ice and snow. Talk a lot about how snow and ice have no effect on you.


If people are bundling up for a cold day, you could say, “I feel most at home in the snow,” or “The cold has never bothered me.”

, To make people think you have ice powers, run your hands under very cold water or dip your hands in a bowl of ice for no more than 20 seconds. Then, dry your hands and touch a friend’s bare skin.If they recoil or comment on how cold you are, act as if you don’t notice. You could say, “Really? I guess my ice powers are strong today.”

, When people talk about ice or snow, glance at your hands as if they are the source. You can even sigh for effect to draw attention to what you’re doing.


If they comment on a snowy day, for example, you could say, “Sometimes I just don’t know my own power.”

, Keep an eye on upcoming cold weather days. When people talk about the weather, imply that you may have a hand in upcoming wintery storms.


You could say, “I’m making it sn-…I mean, it’s supposed to snow on Tuesday,” or “I’m bringing ic-…I mean, there are going to be ice storms this weekend.”

, Use your free time to play in the snow on snowy days. Make a snow angel, start a snowball fight or build a snowman with a friend.


If someone comments on your snowman, you could say, “You should have seen him before I turned him into snow!”

, Watching movies where people have ice powers will give you ideas about how people with real ice powers act. Make a list of things they do to illustrate their powers so you can copy them.Frozen, Jack Frost, Batman, and Adventure Time are all good movies to seek out featuring characters with ice powers.

, Reading wintery books will keep you in an icy mindset. They often have characters with ice powers you can draw inspiration from. Good choices to seek out are The Snow Queen, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Frosty the Snowman.

Have a good sense of humor.,
Make a tribe.,
Use elf colors for your room.",How to Act Like an Elf," A woodland elf, dark elf, normal elf, high elf, a traditional elf of the type associated with sexual threats, seducing people and causing them harm. There are lots to choose from as elves have been featured in mythology since pagan times.;
, Not all elves are tall. Only those in the Lord of the Rings are taller than humans. Most elves in legend and mythology range in height from about 5 feet (1.5 m) tall to the tallest being only 6 feet (1.8 m). Elves possess a slender, lean build with muscles, but not beefcake like.

, Hair should be worn long. However, if it's short, that's fine. Try to wear it down most of the time, (except for when you're in battle!) or in gypsy-ish styles. You could also try braids, curls, or you could straighten it. Hair must always be clean and have a shiny glow to it., Nails should be strikingly clean as well, and you can always top them off with a natural color polish or just a clear coat to give them some natural looking shine., If it feels right to you, it's probably right. Elves are self-confident so you should feel confident in what you wear. Any colors will do, but try to keep away from weird tie-dyes or neons. You're going for an elven look... not hippie. The Bohemian style works like a charm! Long tiered skirts, or short neutral colored ones, suede ankle or knee high boots, embroidered moccasins or boyfriend shoes (it's a style, not your boyfriend's actual shoes, so look them up), leather belts with old fashioned clasps, embroidered pouches and gypsy satchels, gladiator sandals, and foot thongs or flip flops are also an option, as well as going totally barefoot. You should go barefoot around home but wear the recommended shoes at school.

,


Woodland elves. Wear tan and green. Maybe add a cute flower in your hair for a small touch. Wear semi long skirts or even a dress if you can in the same colors. Put your hair to one side, then pull a lock of hair from the other side and let it stay in front. If you can, try adding some glitter to your hair––it's very pretty and produces a magical effect. Paint your nails green and wear tan makeup too, it looks nice and goes perfectly with your outfit. For boys, do the same thing without makeup.






Dark elves. Wear dark colors like red, purple, and obviously black. When you think of dark elf you think of Skyrim right? Have a nice, wool scarf for winter, black boots, a tan jacket and purple long sleeve shirt. Wear simple makeup, just some eyeliner, maybe a little bit of face paint to give your skin a darker tone to it and your nails painted purple. For your hair, if you want to, you can put it into a ponytail, or wear it down.






Normal elves. Don't wear too bright colors like hot pink, bright yellow, things like that. Try wearing some coral colors, maybe a light orange. Coral for your nails might look good, depends. For hair it's simple! Kind of go for a Tauriel look. Wear your hair down and put it all behind your back, take a few locks of hair and pull it to the front of one side, add a small braid to the hair in the back and put a hair clip in. For boys do the same things without the makeup






High elves. Wear tan jeans/shorts and a white shirt, with a tan jacket again. Take some face paint and rub it into your face, it's very pale and gives off a glowing effect. Use some very light pink lipstick and eyeshadow, paint your nails the same pink. Make a braid crown by separating your hair into two parts and bringing the, to the front, then braid one on both sides, take the braids to the back and hair tie them together. Top off the look with a light pink feather. For boys, just do the same things without doing hair or makeup.







, Wear feathers in your hair, wear a ring with a tree on it. Wear something that will make people wonder.

, Every move an elf executes has a purpose. Your movements should be lithe, graceful and very quiet. It's recommended you learn how to walk silently before attempting to be Elf-like.

, Your real name is your human world cover name. For example, choose such names as Ellette and Elden for woodland, Moriel and Morian for Dark elf, Faelein.

, Contemplate philosophy quite a bit. Elves never say something unless they truly mean it, it makes sense, and they believe it with all their heart. They adore nature and everything it encompasses. They are also very in tune with the natural essence of things. They generally remain neutral in disputes, but will not hesitate to stand up and fight for what they believe in!

, Don't give much information because you want to hide your identity.

, If there's a robotic toy, act interested––if you're an elf, you might not see these things much.

, Write down your life as an elf! Pretend to have tribe meetings and write it down too. Write traits of the 'humans' and phrases too.

, When somebody tries to look at what you've written pull away then write something like, ""Humans are very nosy."" But nothing about a certain person, nobody wants trouble or drama!

, If someone says, ""Look at the rain! It's pouring!"" Then look at the rain too, and say, ""But the old man was never snoring. What kind of riddle is that anyway?"" If people laugh, smile. But don't laugh along., Get some of our closest friends and show them this wikiHow article, and you can be a tribe.

, Paint your room those colors, get things those colors! Maybe add some wall art like vines or trees, add a bow on your wall, or sword (remember to make it fake!), or even display a crown somewhere your room is up to you but make it so that you have a little bit of elven things.

Use a vampire name generator.,
Look up lists of fantasy names online.,
Use names from novels and movies.,
Think funny.,
Contemplate creating a name of your own.,
Ask friends.",How to Choose Your Vampire Name," Special programs have been built for the computer and even as phone apps, that are able to instantly create vampire names and a basic search of the internet will bring back a few for you to try. Generators tend to pull together lists of names drawn from ancient vampire lore and legend, old and recent novels, movies and TV shows, role playing games, and anything else they consider appropriate. Some generators are based only on certain shows or books. Have a search around to find which work best for your needs. Here are some examples drawn from using various name generators:


Female: Aubrey Le Mort, Marishka Fargloom, Bruxa Coldbane, Josette du Coudray, Lynessa Iceshard
Male: Michael Papillon, Azazel Mordant, Barnabas Dirge, Damien Winters, Vladimir Morbid
Female: Empress of Flesh, Seductress of the Thirsty, Comtesse Silver Medea, Comtesse Dangerous Dementia
Male: Lord of the Cold Wastes, Emperor of the Great Oceans, Anubis of Delhi, Prince Ivan Bitter;
, There are a number of sites that have made long lists of names drawn from all realms of the fantasy world, including novels, legends, movies, etc. While these are not strictly vampire oriented, you'll often find vampire names listed in them and there are bound to be many fascinating names in them to mix in with your choice of name, enabling you to make your vampiric name a lot more original than simply using a vampire name generator.

, While the generators often draw on these names, if can be more interesting and personally satisfying to find your own favorite character's names in books, TV shows, or movies and to adapt these to your needs. You could adopt the entire name, or mix it up with your own name, or other vampiric names that you like.


Look online for lists of names drawn from specific authors, novels, or shows. These can cull down the searching time considerably.
As part of taking on the name of an existing character, it's important to read the books or watch the shows, in order to have a thorough understanding of the traits and motivations behind the character chosen.

, Does your vampire name have to be all doom, gloom and seriousness? There are some truly funny vampire name possibilities out there too, as a result of parodies on the vampire theme. And what sweeter revenge for a vampire fan than to take back a parody and own it seriously? Here are some suggestions:Count Blood Count (Bugs Bunny)
Count Duckula
Count Chocula (has his own cereal)
Count von Count (Sesame Street)
Count Floyd (SCTV's Monster Chiller Horror Theater)

, Reflect over it for a while and look deep within yourself. What names are bubbling to the surface that seem to ""fit"" better than anything else? This exercise might take a while, or it could happen very quickly; either way, trust that you will come up with a name that will suit your needs most.


Keep your first name and add a vampire or horror name at the end. In this case, you keep your everyday name (handy if you still need to respond to people) and simply add a suitable last name. Either adapt something from known vampire names, or use another type of horror word, such as ghoul, slash, bloody, monster, psycho, brute, evil, etc. For example, Gianna Ghoul, Bob Brutal, Melissa Zombie, Harry Sharptooth, etc. If you like the sound of certain names together, consider trusting your intuition and going with that choice.
A common first name (not your own) with a vampire last name can also work well. Bill, Edward, James, Victoria, are informal, commonplace names currently in high circulation on TV shows such as True Blood and the Twilight series.
The stranger or weirder the name, the less realistic your vampire might seem to some people who view exotic names as pushing the envelope too far for beings who are still human but ""with a difference"" in our more modern times!

, There are several possible approaches here. You might already have several names in mind but can't choose – ask your friends which they think suit you best. Or, you might not have any ideas at all but have friends who are steeped in vampire lore and can help you out by suggesting suitable names.

Have mermaid-worthy hair.,
Have the face of a mermaid.,
Dress like a mermaid.,
Have mermaid accessories.",How to Act Like a Mermaid1," The first thing that will make you stand out as a mermaid is your hair, so you should work hard to cultivate that mermaid look. Growing out your hair takes time and patience, but it'll be worth it. Here's how to have perfect mermaid hair:


Grow your hair out long. Just below your shoulders or longer is best.
If your hair isn't naturally wavy, curl it lightly to give it a natural wave. If you want a more natural wave to your hair without using rollers or a curling iron, try braiding your hair while it's still wet after washing it. Sleep with the braid in and take it out in the morning.
Cultivate a healthy shine to your hair. A few ways you can do this is by adding a little bit of vinegar to your hair and rinse it out with cool water instead of warm.
Leave-in shampoo, or do a hair mask with eggs, mayonnaise, Aloe Vera, and more.
Read the article titled How to Have Soft Shiny Hair Inexpensively for more ways to get soft, shiny, mermaid worthy hair.
If it feels right, your hair can be partly wet, especially the tips. This will give you that ""I just stepped out of the ocean"" look.
You can also put water and salt in a squirt bottle and spray your hair a few times to get that ocean, beach look.
Get the right hair accessories. Since you're spending so much time under water, put fake starfish, coral combs, or even a sprinkle of sand in your hair to show that you're a true mermaid.;
, Your face is what everyone will notice after your hair, so it should show everyone that you are the genuine article. Mermaids have a natural look so you don't have to go over the top to achieve it, but there are a few things you can do.


Use light blues, greens, and purples to shade the outer corners of your eyes to bring out natural ocean tones. Wear a good, non-clumping black mascara, this gives your face mermaid emphasis.
Avoid glitter, it would wash off in the water and give an unnatural look.
Wear a blue, purple,or clear lip gloss.
Remember to wear water-proof makeup.

, To dress like a mermaid, you won't need too many items of clothing, but you'll have to wear them the right way. To be a true sea creature, you'll have to pay attention to your top, your bottom, and even your feet. Here's what you should wear:


A bikini top that is shapely but not too seductive for the beach is great. Pick a sea-friendly color like blue or purple, and try to find bikini cups that look like shells if you can.
For everyday clothes stick to long clothes that flow. This style will remind people of the soft ocean waves.
Pair a flowy shirt with a pair of jeans or a crop top with a flowy blue skirt.
Remember to stick to ocean colors such as blues, greens, and purples. Pink is also a good color in some cases.
Wear flip-flops or sandals with shells on them and keep your shoes casual. Since real mermaids don't wear shoes there's no need to draw attention to your feet. You could even wear water shoes, if you like.
Paint your nails and toes a subtle shade of pink, blues, or other ocean colors. If you want to draw more attention to your nails and make them seem more like a mermaid, paint designs on them such as starfish, anchors, or even scales.

, To be a true mermaid, you have to accessorize like one. Mermaids are too busy swimming to have many accessories, but a few key items can help distinguish you as a mermaid.

Wear coral and shell jewelry. Having coral or shell necklaces, earrings, or bracelets can help you stand out as a mermaid.
Wear a mood ring to show your complicated mermaid emotions, but remember that some mood rings are cheaply made. Don't wear them for too long, or you will risk having a green finger unless you wash it all the time with soap.
Have a small coral purse.

Spend as much time near water as possible.,
Have a mermaid-friendly home.",How to Act Like a Mermaid2," To be a true mermaid, not only do you have to look the part, but you should also surround yourself with the typical mermaid environment. Though you don't need to go to the bottom of the ocean to mimic a mermaid's real home, here are some ways to come close:


If you live near the ocean, spend your days in the water or on the shore. Always leave a healthy trail of sand wherever you go.
If you don't live near the ocean, be near water as much as you can. Spend your time near a lake, a swimming pool, or a river.
Spend extra time in the shower. Mermaids love water!
If you have time for a vacation, go to an island so you can spend all the time you want near the ocean.

, Though you should spend as much time near the water as possible, you'll still need to work on cultivating a mermaid-friendly environment inside your home as well. Here are a few easy ways to transform your home into a mermaid's paradise.

Ask your parents if you can redecorate your room in an ocean theme.
Have a large fish tank filled with all of your favorite sea creatures.
Go to the beach and find shells with holes in them.
Buy Hawaiian flowers, and beach-like flowers to decorate your room.
Have lots of shells hanging up and placed around your home. Use shell plates, coasters, and even cups, if you can.
Surround yourself with pictures of the ocean. Paint your walls blue.
Surround your bed with fake coral, plants, fake seaweed, and anything else that can make you feel like you're under the sea.
Get blue curtains that will look like waves.
Use a treasure chest for storing your clothes.

Make up a spell.,
Find out the meaning of your name.,
Act mysterious.,
Be optimistic.,
Make a mermaid diary.,
Act crazy on a full moon or new moon night - go out and stare at it if you can see a full moon.,
Watch mermaids.,
Sing, and sing a lot!,
Mermaids are known for their wonderful swimming.,
Act slightly bewildered by the world.,
Find other sea creatures to hang out with.",How to Act Like a Mermaid3," Practice writing it in something no one would find. In sense it is made with your own imagination and you are aware that it is not 100% likely to work, it actually has more chances of working. Just make sure the spell has something to do with being near water or being in/touching water..it works better that way.

, Imagine that the meaning of your name has something to do with your destiny. The meaning of your name could also be your mermaid-name, but remember if the meaning of your name is something from the earth it can't be your mermaid name so look up mysterious ocean-like names, such as Kailani and Serena.

, If you're a mermaid on land then you're probably living a double life. To be a true mermaid, you shouldn't reveal too much about your life underwater and should keep your other identity to yourself as much as you can. However, there are some things you can do to be mysterious in just the right way:

, Mermaids, are always at awe of the Earth, be optimistic and always look on the bright side of things.

, Have a mermaid notebook where you write down your deepest mermaid thoughts. Always write the Month, Number, Year, and Day, and start with the words, ""Dear Mermaid Diary,"" to make sure the person who is reading it can see you're being a mermaid. You can get some ideas for a mermaid journal at Write a Mermaid Journal.


Write longingly in the notebook. When anyone approaches, pull it to your chest like it's a secret!
Reference your under-the-sea friends and then act embarrassed for bringing them up.
Say things like, ""No one understands the ocean like I do,"" or ""I could never eat a fish. Fish are our friends!""

,


Excuse yourself to go outside saying you left your purse outside. Secretly bring a purse, or leave a purse underneath a car if it's outside.
The next day pretend the spell is broken, and that you had no idea what happened after you stared at the moon the night before.
Become a mermaid for a long time - become a Siren.
Try to show people your mermaid secret - anything that is not like you.
Run off unexpectedly without explanation. Just say something like, ""I'm wanted"" and then run toward the ocean.

, Watch some mermaid movies and shows, like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aquamarine"". And watch mermaid television shows. Like ""H2O"" and ""Mako Mermaids (An H2O Adventure). Mermaids love to watch other mermaids swimming in the water, and transform.

, A true mermaid sings beautifully and skillfully, whether to herself or for an audience. This is the most distinct feature of a mermaid and you should play it up whenever you can. You can even try and sing to attract a guy's attention (mermaids are known for that).

Even if you're not naturally a good singer, practice singing as much as possible.
Sing to yourself all the time. Pretend to be caught off guard when one of your friends walks in while you're singing.
If it's not the right time for singing, hum to yourself.
Have a look of longing and melancholy when you sing as if you're thinking about your life in another world.

, Learn how and practice swimming. You can even buy a monofin (a special fin made to swim like a dolphin. You can even look for companies online that make special underwater, swimmable costumes.


Swim like a fish. A true mermaid should have impeccable swimming skills. She should be more comfortable in the water than on land. Make swimming your second nature.

Make a point of swimming as much as possible. Use swimming as a form of exercise. If you're a great runner, learn to be a great swimmer instead.
Mermaids can breathe underwater. Practice going underwater for a reasonably long time without coming up for air. When you do come up for air, don't be obvious about it.
When you swim, put your legs and feet together. Remember that you don't have separate legs! You can also purchase a mermaid tail, such as Fin Fun or Mertailor.

, Mermaids are at home in the ocean and are slightly confused by and afraid of life on land. To act like a mermaid, you need to act confounded by perfectly ordinary things, or find strange uses for normal items. Here's what to do:

Act confused by technology, especially computers, cell phones, and televisions. You don't have those underwater.
Always be a little confused by how your legs work, and walk with uncertainty. Trip if you can do so safely.

, Being a mermaid on your own can be lonely, and if you find some fellow sea creatures, not only will you make some friends, but your act will be more convincing.

Ideally, find a few other mermaids to hang out with. You'll look more convincing in groups.
Find a merman to call your own then spend most of your time together in the water.
Find other sea creatures, such as starfish, crabs, or tropical fish to add to your coterie.
Get a Mermaid tail and wear it. How can you be a mermaid without the tail of a mermaid?
Get a pet fish or starfish or any other sea creature and call it your best friend.

Research a seductive vampire lady you want to be like.,
Have a sophisticated palate.,
Dress yourself up as feel appropriate.,
Do your hair.,
Care for your skin.,
Get the make-up.,
Get the personality.,
Act the vampirish part.",How to Be Like a Seductive Vampire Lady," Get the facts, myths, legends about vampires and empathize with the characters you learn about. You have to know what you want to embody, obviously. Some classics to consider: Drusilla, The Countess, Akasha, Lily Munster and Carmilla.;
, You can't stop drinking and eating, drink and eat richly, a lot, and enjoy that. Get to know about table manners, elocution, deportment and etiquette - you have to get the noble-lady-look.

, Wear romantic gowns, long dresses skirts for example, in rich colors, like burgundy, purple, blue, silver-grey, and black. High heels are considered really feminine by many, choose high heeled shoes or boots or any footwear you feel is appropriate. Show your curves and wear old, elegant jewelry. Ladies never dress bad or shabby, so always be well-dressed. A signet ring, jewel necklaces, sparkling bracelets and romantic hanging earrings will create a gentle and noble feeling.

, For a sweet vampire lady, soft curls or an elegant chignon is perfect, bound with a silk ribbon or held by a sparkling clip. An elegant french braid is good. Deep burgundy, deep brown or entirely black hair works very well for this look, but don't dye your hair if it hasn't the desired color either. As for a lady, your hair should be at medium length or longer, as you want to look feminine. Care for your hair, keep it well trimmed and don't straighten or curl it if you don't have straight hair/curls. Avoid damaging your hair.

, A pale skin tone is desirable by some, it supports the elegant, noble look a seductive vampire lady usually has. In early times, pale skin indicated that the person didn't work hard on the fields and was very rich to have this luxury. A vampire lady has never a tanned tone. Get your skin clean and soft.

, As a lady, you need to have defined facial structures. Apply a slight brown colour around the sides of your nose bridge to contour your skin. Also, do this with your cheekbones, the line connecting your nose with your lips, and the inner bottom side of your brows, creating the illusion of defined edges; also, do this with the edges of your face and chin. Then, highlight your nose bridge, your upper cheekbones, the outer bottom side of your brows, your chin, the inner part of your forehead (if you don´t have bangs), your cupids bow, and the part slightly above your eyebrows with a matte white eye shadow to define your face even more. Fill in your eyebrows: first, use a grey color as a base and then use a brown eyebrow pencil to fill them in. Those strong eyebrows will add a mystified look to you. Tight line and line your eyes with a dark eyeliner (brown, grey or black, but black will be very heavy), and maybe apply mascara. If desired, color your lids with a deep, rich eye shadow mostly in a burgundy, grey, purple or deep blue color It´s best to create a slight cat eye - this will give your eyes a very sensual look. Your eyes have to look hollow and mysterious, not extremely up-made. Skip the blush, as you want to look cold, and define your lips with a lip pencil or a concealer. This is the most important part: select a deep, burgundy or black cherry colored lipstick in a cold tone, and apply it after defining the edges. As long as the color of your lipstick is deep and cold, you can use any color as you wish. This is where the look comes together.

, If you are very bubbly, cheerful and outspoken, you will have to cool down a bit. Add a mysterious, haunting smile to yourself, and try to be warmhearted, but not overly hyper. You also have to be able to get serious sometimes, so don't be childish 24-hours a day. If you are a very shy, secluded and pessimistic person, try to be more outspoken and straight forward. You have to voice your own opinion. Also, be sure to be able to make friends and talk to others, but sometimes be distant, too. Find the balance in this - this balance adds the mysterious part.

, Avoid sunlight, maybe silver and iron, sacred icons, love the night-time, put an interest in history, etc. If someone cuts himself, discretely sniff or lick your lips. Be sensitive to temperature changes and get a soul-piercing gaze, as if you could right look through another person. Also, you can speak in a low, husky voice - this will make you alluring.

But do leave it somewhere and when someone finds it steal it back and say, ""None of your business.""

, A goddess doesn't go around saying, ""PICK UP THE TRASH! I WILL LAY A CURSE ON YOU!"" Only punish people if they're being mean, or not doing the right thing.

Wear dark clothes.,
Grow your hair long, or wear a wig.,
Grow out your fingernails.,
Pale your face with make-up.,
Get other witchy props.",How to Act Like a Witch1," Witches are usually dressed in black or dark purple and blue colors. Long robes, cloaks, and flowing clothes are the best witch garments.


Mix colors to use layers. If you're a female witch, wear an old victorian-style black dress with a dark shawl or cloak over it. If you're a male, wear a dark tunic or suit.
Witch costumes are often kind of silly and tame looking. If you really want people to think you're a witch, it's better to avoid the Halloween stores in favor of antique shops and second-hand stores.;
, Witches immediately bring to mind long, scraggly hair. If yours is short, grow it out or get a wig to make your hair appear longer. Style it by avoiding washing for a few days, then letting it hang down over your face.


Consider adding color to your hair. A long streak of gray, purple, or white can help to give you a witchy look, depending on your hair style and color.
If your hair is blonde, that can look perfectly witchy. It's not necessary to have dark hair to look witch-like.

, Having long fingernails just looks creepy and witchy, male or female. It's an easy way that you can make yourself look different, for a costume or for a cosplay trip.


If you don't want long fingernails on every finger, just grow out a few. Having a really long ring-finger nail? That'll look awesomely creepy.

, Use some very pale foundation on your face, and darken your eyes and lips to start looking witchy. Use the make-up subtly. Green make-up and fake warts usually looks more silly than witchy. It's probably better to avoid it.

, There are lots of different kinds of little props that you can use to create a witchy look, aside from the stereotypical broom and black cat. If you're creating a witch costume, keep an eye out for the following witchy props:


Big rings
Long necklaces and pendants
Corsets
Stockings
Scarves and shawls
Jewelry with bones or teeth
Animal pelts
Crystals or gems

Learn spells to cast.,

Build an altar.,
Hang out in witchy places.,
Talk like a witch.,
Learn about real witches.",How to Act Like a Witch2," Witches are known mostly for casting spells. You don't have to use real spells if you're just pretending to be a witch, since spells mostly have to do with the intention. Rhyming some words and moving your hands isn't dangerous in any way.


Draw a circle on the floor with chalk, or build a circle out of little rocks and sticks outside. Light candles at the corners and sit in the middle. Close your eyes and move your hands in circles, as if you're channeling the spirits. Hum softly to yourself while you're pretending.
Use spells from Harry Potter, or other books or movies that you like, if you want to. ""Double-double, toil and trouble...""

, Portion-making is the other most important part of a good witch-impression. Build up a big collection for mixing different sorts of potions. Some good things to collect for your potions, or for spell-casting, include:


Dried herbs like lavender, rosemary, or witch hazel
Mosses
Little bones or beaks
Crystals or stones
Essential oils
Candles

, Keep your wand, little bones, and other potion-making ingredients in little wooden boxes, or in vials and keep them on a shelf that you display in your room. Put pictures of your witch-icons, as well as candles and other little trinkets. Put out some tarot cards and other occult-style things. This all screams ""witch.""

, Head into the woods at night with the rest of your coven, and sit and pretend to cast spells in a little glade. Check out a graveyard with your friends after dark. Hang out in spooky places whenever you can, to do your witchy work.


If you're young, make sure you get your parents' permission to go places after dark. It's ok to go in the daylight too, even though the ""witching hour"" is usually around 3 am.

, Witches are mysterious, heady, and always act like they know something you don't. When you're acting like a witch, it's good to say spooky, mysterious things, like you know what's going to happen in the future.


Work on your cackle. Witches don't laugh. Witches cackle. Think of it as the evil version of your regular laugh

Fairies live in and make use of the natural world. They wear flowers in their hair and around the necks and wrists.
Fairies embrace a wild beauty; they aren't overly-tidy and their style is exuberant, rather than tailored.
Fairy clothing is old-fashioned and romantic. Think long skirts, lace and ribbons, a Shakespearean aesthetic.
Fairy hair is very natural, so no need to over-process it with perms, dyes or straighteners. Take care of your hair with regular deep conditioning treatments.
Fairies glow, so take care of your skin. Wash, exfoliate and moisturize for a healthy glow.;

Use make-up to create a natural, fairy look.,
Dress like fairy.",How to Look Like a Fairy2," Keep your hair natural and whimsical. Messy bohemian styles best capture the fairy look.


If you have long hair, wear it down or in braids.

Adorn your hair with ribbons and flowers. Antique pins and barrettes also make for a nice fairy look.

,


Even out your complexion with a light-weight tinted moisturizer.
If you are especially fair, apply a rosy blush to your cheeks.
Apply a shimmering powder to your cheekbones.
Use a highlighter pencil under your brow bone.

Wear lip-gloss or a sheer lipstick. Look for products with shimmer. Avoid matte lipsticks, as these are too heavy. Good color choices include pink, red and wine.

, Fairy fashion is feminine and ethereal, old-fashioned and romantic.


Wear long skirts and flowy dresses. Look for gossamer fabrics and filigree detailing.
Err on the side of demure. In summer, you can show your arms, shoulders and perhaps some décolleté, but avoid hems that are too high (think thigh-high) and plunging necklines.
For your winter wardrobe, check out the winter fashions of 19th-century Russia. The long coats, muffs and round hats capture the romantic fairy look.
Accessorize with headbands and jewelry. Again, antique designs, beads, ribbons and flowers create a romantic and whimsical fairy look.
Fairies are often barefoot, but this is not practical. Flat shoes, sandals and Mary Janes are excellent choices. Low-heeled shoes are acceptable, but exceedingly high, stiletto heels are not compatible with the free and easy fairy look.

Cultivate the art of understatement.,
Wear a tailored suit.,
Go for classy casual clothes, as well.,
Keep your appearance classy.,
Use accessories in an unusual way.,
Look to the past.,
Try out different hats.",How to Look Like a Princess1," Many real-life princesses don't wear a whole lot of short ballgowns and headbands (except for around the village). People these days are learning to associate princesses with elegance. Think of princesses like Grace Kelly, Princess Diana, and Kate Middleton.Keep your assets covered. Princesses tend to leave a little to the imagination, so don't go for the the mini-skirt and super low-cut neckline because they are just not that casual
Some great choices are lace, wrap dresses, sailor necklines. All of these cultivate an air of elegance.
Create balance in your outfits. For example, you might do lose on top, tighter on the bottom like a free flowing skirt with a fitted bodice. This is a particular favorite of Kate Middleton.
Knee-length skirts rather than miniskirts are the way to go for an aspiring princess. Skirts that hit a little above your knee are okay, especially when it comes to skirts that are less for formal occasions.;
, Patterns and insignia go in and out of fashion. You want to make sure that you look put together and in style at all times. The occasional pattern is fine, but make sure that it isn’t something that is trendy and will go out of fashion within months.If you do choose some patterns, go for ones that are slightly unusual. For example, think of Kate Middleton's patterned blue dress. It looked like it was patterned with white dots, but up close it turned out that they were little birds.
While you want to stick to neutral and pastel colors (they create the appearance of elegance) the occasional jewel-toned outfit can be a great asset. Think royal blue, or bright crimson.

, This is common fashion advice, but it's something that a person wanting to dress like a princess should take to heart. A princess doesn't try to be the center of attention. Instead, she lets her outfits subtly enhance her and that in itself draws attention.Try enhancing an unusual feature, like your back. Princess Diana had a famous formal dress that was conservative in front, but open in back.

, A princess doesn't look to have the attention focused on her at all times. Often, attention is focused on a princess whether she wants it or not. Pick clothes that are understated and elegant.Tailored clothing is the way to go. You want your clothing to fit you just right, which is why you should take it to a tailor to have it altered to fit you perfectly. This shouldn't cost you too much especially if you only do it with a few select pieces of clothing.
Kate Middleton has worn some gorgeous grey, tailored dresses and it's a good look for any aspiring princesses. While you might not be able to afford the designer versions she often wears, you can find good quality dresses in department stores and secondhand shops.
One of Princess Diana's famous dresses was a subtly gorgeous off-the-shoulder sleek blue gown. Consider dresses like that when you're on the hunt for princess-like clothing.

, Again, tailoring is incredibly important! You want your clothes to fit you as perfectly as possible. Dress suits are an important part of any modern princess's wardrobe. They make you look powerful, professional, and elegant. They were a big part of Princess Diana's wardrobe, as well as Kate Middleton's.Suits in brown or grey are a good choice. Again, you're looking for understated and well-cut.

, Because a princess is always in the spotlight, they have to look put together and classy at all times, even when they're only dressed casually. If you want to to look like a princess you're going to have to emulate their classy casual clothes, as well.A good look is jeans, boots (always a good fashion choice) and a nice sweater (in a neutral or jewel-toned color). Always make sure that your jeans fit you correctly (there's nothing less elegant than jeans that are too loose or too tight).
Another good look, based on Kate Middleton's wardrobe, is a long-sleeved turtle-neck dress with a wide belt to emphasize your waist.

, Use the natural make-up. Princesses tend to stick towards make-up that doesn't overwhelm their face, that enhances the features they've got rather than going overboard. If you want to look like a princess, the natural look is the way to go.


Keep your nails well-manicured. Don't fall into the latest nail trends. Avoid jagged nails, or dirty nails.
Wash your hair and keep it well styled. You might not have Kate Middleton's luscious, Disney-princess hair, but you can get it cut and styled in a way that's best for your face and hair type.

, Accessories are a great way to get in a bit of individuality without going overboard and stealing the spotlight. Princess Diana was particularly famous for it.Wear a necklace as a crown. You might not have the crown jewels to use, as Princess Diana did, but you can still use a pretty necklace as a crown (further showing that you are a princess at heart).
You could also do something like wear a pearl necklace backwards so it accentuates your back rather than your front, especially if you're wearing a backless dress.

, Lots of princess like to hearken back to older times for inspiration for their modern wardrobes. You can do this, too.


Edwardian fashions have a lot to offer in terms of fashion.
Try a high-collar look inspired by Elizabethan fashion
Kate Middleton wears a lot of dresses that seem to be inspired by ‘40s clothing, so look to the ‘40s for your elegant princess attire.

, Princesses and royalty seem particularly keen on wearing hats. Try out hats that flatter your face. You can find ones that are good for tea parties, for formal occasions, and for strolling around town.


The traditional English wedding hat is particularly appropriate for formal occasions.

Wear things in colors that suit your environment or the type of elf you want to be.,
Accessorize with accessories that go with the style you are aiming for.,
Add matching makeup.,
Style your hair.,
Try to match your body height and size with the type of elf you want to be, but don't go too far.,
Change your personality slightly to match one of an elf, but still be yourself.",How to Look Like a Modern Style Elf," For example, if you want to be a forest elf, wear green, brown, blue, and silver. Other colors may be added, Don't limit yourself (or your 'elf). You may continue to wear clothes that suit your style of fashion without compromising your elven style. You can wear denim mini shorts successfully if you wear them with a floaty top and/or accessories. Skirts are quite good. Long, short, denim, cotton, silk, it doesn't matter. There is absolutely no need for a cap (this would detract from your ""normality"").;
, Silver, green, blue, brown are good base colors for forest elves. Brown, orange, yellow, red and blue are good for desert elves. Don't be afraid to add splashes of other colors and don't limit yourself only to these colors. Be adventurous sometimes. Be careful though, and always remember that Elves are subtly beautiful. They see no need to go flashing their wealth and beauty to everyone.

, Elves are always beautiful but don't let this dishearten you if you feel you are not. You will almost certainly look beautiful if you are confident in yourself. You will require lovely skin though. Find a good skin care regime with antibacterial products for acne. You don't need to wear make-up: an elf has a natural beauty, and having clean skin should be all you need. I f you really like make-up, you may want to wear it, but stick to natural colors or greens and browns. Make sure that the colors you choose look natural on you and complement your natural skin tone. Eyeliner applied skillfully will make eyes look bigger and angled upwards. Do this by putting eyeliner on the top of your eyes but only from the middle to the outer side. Flick it out gently if you wish. Then apply it on the bottom but only on the outer quarter. Blend it with the top and smudge for a more natural look. Bronzer and blush may look good but don't overdo it, elves are naturally beautiful, you want to make it look like you aren't wearing makeup at all. Keep lips moist and healthy with balm. Nail polish is fun too.

, It doesn't really matter about hair, but long usually looks right. Short hair will still look really cool, but you may look more pixie than elf (nothing wrong with that though!). Colour and texture do not matter. Keep it clean though and wear it out usually. As long as it's clean, any style will do; however, it's usually most elven-looking to not have it hanging in your face. Braids look really good; you can try french braids, one long braid, pulled-back braids, braiding small sections, putting braids in buns, etc. Half-ponies and buns are also good.

, Elves are usually tall and thin so you may want to exercise to lose weight BUT DON'T STARVE YOURSELF! If you are short this doesn't matter, wear high heels if you want but it won't matter really. Hold your self tall and confidently but don't act like a snob. Pull your shoulders back and push your chest forward but not overly so. You don't want to look like you are showing of your breasts. Hold your head high and proud. Walk and talk musically and elegantly.

, Don't change your personality entirely. Keep your own self in there somewhere but don't become angry quickly, be calm, have dignity, be kind to all animals, the environment and other people and stand up for what you believe in and what is right. Elves are loyal to their allies (i.e. your friends).

Cut your hair in short spiky layers.,
Use clips with flowers or butterflies in them for your hair, to make your hair more interesting.

,
Select makeup.,
Wear flowery or animal jewelry.,
Add wings.",How to Look Like a Pixie," Team with a white tank or a tank in a complementary color. If you are uncomfortable with wearing tanks and short skirts, opt for cap sleeves and bright tights under the skirt. Glam up your outfit with a wide belt cinched at the waist. You can even wear a short dress that billows out slightly from the waist and has an asymmetric hemline.;
, Striped leggings look amazing.

, Choose shoes such as ballet flats, in fresh colors such as yellow, green or blue. Moccasins, Mary Jane pumps, or barefoot will have the same effect.

, If needed, you can pin it onto your hair.

, Flip the layers, and have bangs to one side. You could even think about dyeing your hair, or parts of it, white blond if it goes with your skin tone or adding other colors such as electric blue streaks to your hair. Other dramatic colors also work well,, including things like pitch black and rusty red. Remember: always think of your skin tone before dyeing.

,, You have two options so far as makeup goes. You could keep your makeup fairly simple- fresh, dewy skin, a hint of blush, some pale lip gloss and bright eyes is more than enough. Or you could go crazy with the eyeliner and give off a frou-frou pixie look. You could also add a little glitter on your cheeks and chest to add more of an effect of a pixie. This would work best with both options.

, For example, you could wear daisy earrings or a butterfly pendant.

, If it's for a dress up event, consider attaching a pair of wings to the back of your dress. Choose good quality wings to avoid looking costume-like.

Dress like a modern-day Disney princess.,
Create a Disney princess costume.,
Do your make-up like a Disney princess.,
Get Disney princess hair.",How to Look Like a Princess2," Disney princesses are big right now, but it can be difficult to dress like one in regular daily life. Fortunately you can incorporate modern-day Disney princess styles into your look.


You want to get the color scheme correct when you're picking what looks to use. For example: if you wanted to emulate Belle in her yellow ballgown, you might get a '50s inspired yellow dress, with golden earrings, and matching yellow headband, and shoes to match.
You can create the princess look with a more modern outfit. For example: you might pick a pair of green jeans to match with a purple top, with fish scale like shoes and shell earrings for Ariel.
You can get really creative with this and try out different outfits that are inspired by Disney princesses.

, You can easily buy a Disney princess costume, or you can make one. This latter is obviously more difficult, but can be very rewarding. Again, it depends on which princess you want to look like. These are good for Halloween and costume parties.


Making a gown like Belle's yellow ballgown requires that you have a sewing machine and the right colored material, but the end result can be very cool.
Pocahontas's outfit or Ariel's mermaid outfit are easier costumes to make, because there is less material.

, Most of the Disney princesses have subtle, natural style make-up, with eye shadow and lipstick depending on their outfits and so on.


Golden champagne and peach colored eye shadows are good choices to use for your natural look.
You'll want to line your eyelids with a darker eyeliner (black or dark brown) and smudge depending on which princess you're emulating.

, While your hair is never going to look exactly like your favorite Disney princess you can get a hairstyle that is close to it. You can use this for your Disney princess costume or you can couple it with your modern-day Disney princess look.

Build your confidence.,
Work for good.,
Cultivate elegance.,
Always be prepared.,
Don’t follow the latest trends.,
Mix up what clothing stores you use.",How to Look Like a Princess3," People are drawn to confidence and they are drawn to princesses because of their confidence. Kate Middleton is attractive for multiple reasons, one of which is her confidence. Emulate her confidence as well as her fashion.


Walk upright with your shoulders back and your head upright. Imagine that a string is in the middle of your chest pulling gently upwards without over arching your back.
Meet people's gazes when you're out and about and smile. A princess cultivates a lovely smile.
Fake your confidence if you don't feel confident. You can trick your brain into being confident if you act like you are. Start small, for example like smiling at people you don't know, and work your way up.

, Many princesses, both past and present, have been on the forefront of social change and the betterment of society. If you want to be like a princess, this is an important component.Be like Princess Ameera Al-Taweel of Saudi Arabia who has pushed for equal rights for women, women's empowerment in the Arab world.
Be like Princess Mary Elizabeth of Denmark who has been on the forefront of working towards poverty alleviation.

, A princess is elegant in her manners, as well as in her attire. Cultivating elegance is key to presenting as a princess. Grace Kelly was known for her elegance, poise, and serenity of personality.


Cultivate poise. Observe the way you walk: avoid strutting like a supermodel, or striding like a man. You want to have perfect posture and carriage in how you walk and sit.
Never be in a hurry. You can move quickly without running, or appearing upset or rushed. Avoid slamming doors, running, clomping your feet on the ground, and so on.
Serenity is important. You can't allow things to upset you or knock you off balance. When confronted with a situation that you don't expect, take several deep breaths and think before you act.

, Part of cultivating a serene and elegant personality, is to be prepared for anything that is sprung on you. Even if you weren't expecting something, meeting it with equanimity is important.Dress for the occasion. While you want to always cultivate elegance, a princess isn't going to wear a full-length ballgown to a tea party, or when you go for a walk. Make sure you're dressing appropriately.
Also be well-groomed. You never know who you're going to run into. Princesses never just run to the store in their sweatpants.
Be well-mannered to everyone and every situation. No matter how people treat you, be polite in return. You don't have to take abuse. Instead, meet that abuse with a calm explanation of why that behavior is inappropriate.

, Not only do princesses tend to set their own trends (like Princess Diana), they don't fall into the trap of trying to follow every new fashion trend. Simply keep your look timeless, understated, and elegant.


If you do incorporate the latest trends into your wardrobe do so in a subtle manner.

, No princess uses the same designer. They want to mix up who they wear so that they can showcase different designers, especially ones who are up and coming.


Try to get your clothing tailored to you, even if you buy it from a second-hand shop or a regular (non-designer) clothing shop.

Avoid tanning.,
Keep your hair healthy and neat.,
Makeup can enhance your look.,
Show off your natural beauty.,
Stay in shape.,
Be creative with colors.,
Accessorize wisely.,
Have a ""princess"" dress.",How to Look and Act Like a Disney Princess1," Most of the princesses have very pale skin with the exception of Jasmine, Pocahontas, Tiana, and Moana. If you have the option, remain as pale as possible! This means you should wear a strong sunscreen, avoid tanning sprays, and try not to stay out in the sun for too long. If you're naturally pale or you have darker skin, that's fine too.;
, The length doesn't matter so much, since some princesses have long and some have short hair, but make sure that you take care of it. Enhancing your color is okay, as many of the princesses, such as Ariel, have eye-popping color that is very hard to have naturally. You can have it in any length or style you like, as the princesses all have different hair.

, Pick one or two features you love and play them up with some light makeup if you wish. Don't wear a ton of makeup: just enough to show off your best features. This means that if you have long eyelashes, wear a little mascara to make them darker, or if you really like the way your lips look, wear a little lipstick to draw people's attention to them.

, Everyone has natural beauty, but you can do things to make yours even better. Take care of yourself. Make sure to get enough sleep and keep up good hygiene for a natural glow.

, All of the princesses are slender and proportioned. However, since they are cartoon characters, don't feel like it is necessary to starve yourself to meet impossible images. In fact, the body shapes of the Disney princesses are often impossible to have in real life. So, instead of trying to imitate their unhealthy body shapes, just try to be the healthiest version of your unique body shape. This will make you feel and therefore look confident! If you're looking for a new type of exercise, try something graceful like dance, as grace is a crucial part of embodying the Disney Princess look.

, As for your clothing, don't feel the need to change much from what you already have. After all, Cinderella was able to transform an old dress into something new, and Ariel was able to make a dress out of an old sail. Feel free to be crafty and creative with your clothing style. Also, try to add color to your outfits! Each princess has their own ""color"" that they wear that looks simply magnificent on them. For Cinderella, it's light blue; for Belle, it's bright yellow; for Tiana, it's light green, etc. Find your color- one that complements your hair color, skin-tone, and/or eyes- and incorporate it into your wardrobe any way possible. Your color should be cheery, pretty and bright. Wearing the color you chose should make you feel perky.

, When choosing accessories, think cute and feminine. Rhinestones, pearls, and lace add a nice touch. Add accessories to your hair often, such as a flower or a pretty hair ribbon.

, Have a dress for fancy occasions that you put on and feel like a million bucks. But, that doesn't mean the dress has to cost a million bucks! The price of the dress doesn't matter: what does matter is how much you like it. Every Disney Princess has that dress that catches the eye of her prince and everyone else in the room. However, this dress must be classy. It should preferably be longer and cover up all areas that should be covered. There are several different styles, so find the one that flatters you and makes you feel wonderful.

Maintain good manners.,
Smile, smile, smile.,
Have good posture.,
Be engaging!,
Have respect for yourself and others.,
Don't be a huge flirt.,
Be a good role model.,
Enjoy being a princess!",How to Look and Act Like a Disney Princess2," Practice the most proper etiquette you can imagine. Always say please and thank you, even when you are ordering food at a fast food restaurant. Be sure to have good dinner table etiquette as well. When meeting someone new, shake their hand and tell them what a pleasure it is to meet them. Also, for an added touch, find something you like about them, such as their hair or smile, and pay them a compliment!

, Do your best to keep a smile on your face wherever you go. Obviously, if something very sad, angering, e.t.c. has happened, you are not expected to be fake. But for the most part, just smile. It doesn't have to be big or cheesy, but pleasant. After all, Disney Princesses are well-known for their optimism, so show off your own!

, Walk as if a string is pulling your head and shoulders up. Posture says so much about a person, so make sure it is saying the right thing! Keep excellent posture and step lightly wherever you go. Nothing says princess more!

, When talking to others, look them in the eye. Listen to what they have to say. Most of the princesses have many royal subjects, and they listen to each and every one.

, Be sure that your politeness is not taken advantage of, and always stand up for what you believe in. Also, respect others, even if it is not ""cool"". If someone is being bullied, stand up for them!

, Although your inner and outer beauty may attract gentleman callers, remember to be smart, as Belle was when dealing with Gaston. Disney princesses will eventually find their prince, but it doesn't happen overnight! Don't settle for someone who isn't your dream guy.

, This is both for kids and those your age. All of the princesses have admirable qualities that teach young girls how to be young ladies. Although everyone makes mistakes, do your best to keep a clean image for children to look up to! Don't do anything you wouldn't want a three year old child knowing about.

, Being a Disney Princess doesn't just come from a crown. It comes from the beautiful spirit within. Now go out there and show everyone the wonderful princess you are!

Be sweet and curious - like Ariel when she went into town with Prince Eric for the first time or Snow White when the disguised queen offers her the poisoned apple.,
Be graceful and accepting to comments of your loveliness; don't be vain and shallow.,
Your eyes, skin and lips should also be perfect -- even if you've just gotten out of bed or are mourning over the assumed death of your prince.,
Clothing.,
Romance.,
Do not be evil!,
Speak up.,
Be proud.",How to Do It Disney Princess Style," Perhaps you are romantic and dreamy like Aurora, strong-willed and spirited like Ariel, clever and considerate like Belle, sweet and polite like Snow White, strong and brave like Mulan, or a charming, loyal hard worker like Cinderella. Go for one (or more) princesses that match your natural qualities. The Disney Princesses would never change their identities to be like someone else. There are many more Disney princesses to choose from though. Watch the Disney Princess movies and note their behavior.;
, When tidying your bedroom or cooking in the kitchen pretend that woodland animals appear out of nowhere like they did in Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. It may be helpful to get an unusual pet for yourself. You might even want a tiger like Jasmine, a raccoon like Pocahontas, some mice like Cinderella. But any pet will work. Remember, pets aren't for show! Feed, groom and take care of them like a real princess would! And if you can't get a pet of your own, consider pet-sitting, working at an animal shelter or even getting a stuffed animal and treat it like a real pet. And don't stomp on bugs in the house, let them go outside and show them respect. After all, animals have feelings, too!

, Your locks should be in their natural color! Your color is unique to your hair, so don't dye it, but enhance what you were given. Loose curls will look great, especially if you have a nice accessory, like even a tiara, for the finishing touches. A (jeweled) headband like Jasmine and Briar Rose (Aurora) will work, too. Find your ideal length and keep it in good condition!

, You should be able sing with a beautiful voice and think of great lyrics off the top of your head. Consider joining a choir at church or school and know whether you're a soprano,mezzo-soprano or alto. Practice by singing what you're doing in a basic rhyme pattern and then move onto a love song. If you cannot sing, hum! And dancing is always recommended. While cleaning up or doing other chores, sing something to make it more enjoyable. Sing Disney Princess songs like Part of Your World, Let it go, Once Upon A Dream, or Someday My Prince Will Come.

, Most girls don't have a Disney princess figure. Don't bother changing what you are (no eating disorders!) to look like a Disney princess; just wear something that suits your shape. Disney Princesses will agree beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. Just take good care of yourself. For a flatter midsection and a slimmer waist, try crunches. If you're naturally Disney Princess-looking,that's great! But if you don't have the same figure as most Disney Princesses,that's just as great.

, Also, try to have somewhat of an innocent air. Being sweet and innocent without being laughably fake is what you're most likely going for.

, All the Disney princesses are gorgeous, but they are very humble and modest. Don't be stingy with compliments either; if you love someone's hair, let them know!

, Lip scrubs, neat eyebrows and facials therefore are the foundation of your flawlessness! Make it seem natural too. Your concealer should not be able to be seen and your lashes should not be clumpy. But if they are, don't worry. You are a princess, therefor you can wear your makeup however you'd like to. What's more important is how you carry yourself.

, You can wear dresses or something that suits your goal. Don't go for colors and styles that you don't like just because your favourite princess wears them. Go for colors that suit you. If you're concerned about your waist go for vertical stripes and if you don't like your arms, go for the Aurora or Belle-style sleeve dress. Also, wear push-up bras. The princesses always like to show just a bit of cleavage - when done correctly, it looks classy. Or, you can forgo a bra. It's your choice, because you are a princess. Remember, princesses like Aurora lived way back in the 1500s, so she had to wear corsets. Those are painful, and you likely won't want one. Her (and likely several others) didn't have any bras to wear either, due to lack of invention at the time.

, It's good to know characteristics of your perfect princess or prince, but it won't do to have your head constantly in the clouds dreaming of your ideal partner. ""If you open your heart, it will open your eyes, it's not a mystery!"" It pays to keep your head in a book every once in a while like Belle would! Don't go chasing after your ideal partner; chase your own dreams. You will find your true love when the time comes! Belle went to the beast's castle to free her dad, not find love and she turned out to have one of the most true romances of all.

, You are not evil whatsoever unless a spell has been cast on you. You are kind and affectionate. As for villains themselves, if you are in contact with a male villain - he will most likely fancy you. Take heed. But this doesn't mean wait around for people to help you! If you need to fend for yourself, do so.

, Stand up for what you believe in, don't be afraid to say what you are feeling inside. Even the very polite Snow White will voice her opinion, and it belongs to the traits of strong-willed princesses like Ariel and Jasmine to be straightforward. However, there's a fine line between outspoken and rude, so try to recognize it. If you accidentally come across as rude, apologize and don't worry about it, it happens to all of us.

, Be proud of who you are, don't try to be somebody else. Don't ever be afraid to be yourself, Stand up straight, walk with pride, and look into the mirror on the wall and remind yourself that you are the loveliest of all.

Be guided by your hair color first.,
Prepare the eyes.,
Add blush.",How to Look Like an Ice Queen1," Look at your hair color and use it to determine the strength of your makeup:


If it's very pale, you can get away with more over the top eye-makeup.
If your hair is dark, go with a paler look.;
,

Start in the inner corner of your eyelids with a white eyeshadow.
Use an eye primer before applying eyeshadow because colors will show up better.
Then, use a shimmery silver eyeshadow in the middle of the eyelid, then a glittery darker shadow.
Apply mascara and white and black liquid eyeliner on the top eyelid, matching where the eyeshadow is.
Finally, apply white eyeliner on the bottom lid. This looks good on everyone and it makes your eyes look bigger.
For eyes, less is often more, but if you want to look more theatrical, you can apply small rhinestones or more tones.

, Use either a pale blush, a rosy blush, or a red blush is good, depending on your skin tone. For lips, a glittery pink tone or a pale beige tone is best.

Dress the part.,
Choose ice queen colors.,
Choose the appropriate ice queen gear for formal occasions.,
Choose appropriate ice queen gear for casual occasions.",How to Look Like an Ice Queen2," Depictions of ice queens tend to show a woman who cares about her appearance down to the last detail. Good grooming is essential for giving off an aura of royalty., Anything white or pale blue is ideal for an ice queen look. This can be given a boost with such colors as red, pale pink and pastels.


Sparkly additions can make colors shine forth more but don't overdo sparkly accessories in case it looks tacky.

, Always wear a dress for a formal event. Something short with lots of tulle is nice, and if it isn't very ice queen like, you can always put a tutu under your dress and let a bit of tulle show out from underneath.


A ballerina or a fairy is a nice inspiration for the look.
If you're thinking more royal, you can try an Elizabethan era gown, in either pastels, with, or red.







, Downplay fancy elements––these aren't needed when you're wearing casual. Keep the clothes well fitted and neat.

Avoid hoodies and anything really baggy. Form-fitting is best because baggy stuff will appear to weigh you down.






You can wear pastel or white colored skinny jeans, tutus, shorts over tights, or anything that isn't too baggy or dark looking.
For shoes, flats or small kitten heels are best. Don't wear stripper heels, ever.

Walk smoothly as if gliding.",How to Create the Fairy or Pixie Look," Use your imagination in achieving this or see the image above.;
, If you choose the tank top, you might consider wearing a floaty silky shirt. This makes a very good effect. If you are more sporty, wear a striped shirt under it. Grey and red is a good combo or grey and blue. The leotard will carry itself without other additions clothing-wise but you might like to decorate it as in the image above.

, Select matching colors with your outfit.

, If you prefer the pixie look, prefer tighter pants and leggings instead of a billowy skirt. Wear ballet flats either way.

, As a base for your eyes: put a dab of liquid concealer on your eyelids, blend all over with a brush, then set with the same powder.

, Do not blend up to your browbone, you want to look very subtle. Then brush shimmery pale pink shadow on the inside corner of your eye.

, Use either black or dark brown.


Add a little mascara to the end of your eyelashes in the corners. Next to the corners in your eyes, add a little cosmetic glitter. Do be careful not to get it in your eyes! Unlike fairy dust, this will irritate. Apply a little foundation slightly darker than your skin and a light blush pink blush.

, Only line the very end of your lid.

, Don't slather on foundation though. Get a good liquid concealer and apply it to any dark circles and blemishes you have, then blend it with a wide, flat brush. Add powder that's a little lighter than your skin tone to set the look.

, Suck in your cheeks and apply the bronze along your cheekbones. Then smile and put the blush on the apples of your cheeks.

, Put on the lip balm, then get some gold shadow on your finger and pat it on the center of your lower lip, then your upper lip.

Know a lot of facts about the ocean.,
Research about mermaids.,
Decide what kind of mermaid you are.,
Look the part.,
Dress like a mermaid.,
Add mermaid elements to your hair accessories.,
Wear subtle ""mermaid"" make up.,
Wear a piece of jewelry all the time as your mermaid symbol.,
Have mermaid-like items.,
Buy a fake mermaid tail or make one.,
Try to keep to yourself a lot.,
Act alert around water.,
Sing or hum a lot.,
Be very interested in the ocean.,
Keep a mermaid journal.,
Be discreet.,
Change the subject if a friend asks you if you are a mermaid.",How to Convince Your Friends You're a Mermaid," If your friends raise the topic of the ocean, show off all you know. But if they bring up mermaids, change the subject right away!;
, Start with ancient mermaid myths and legends, from the first time mermaid or siren stories appeared (ancient Greece) to more recent times.

, This will help to make your story more convincing. Decide which type of mermaid will suit your personality. When choosing your type, consider factors like appearance, habitat, diet, etc. Some mermaid types include deep sea, open ocean, land dweller, arctic, tropical, warm waters, lake, fresh water, coral reef, Mediterranean, etc.

, Mermaids are known to have long, wavy hair, so grow your hair out long and let it get a little messy and wavy. It is also alright if you style it to be curly. Make sure your hair always looks natural. Wear ocean-themed accessories in your hair, such as sea creature clips, coral, shells, ocean-colored ribbons etc. This will make your hair look different and unique.

, Make sure your clothes match your mermaid personality. For example:


If your mermaid personality is arctic, wear whites and shades of blue (mainly dark).
If you are tropical, wear bright colors and patterns. If you are a fresh water mermaid, wear a lot of green.
If you are a land dweller, wear somewhat ""human"" clothes with a noticeable mermaid twist.

, You can buy hair clips and glue-on seashells, sand or little fake animals. If you go to the beach, you could collect sand and seashells for no cost.

, Mermaids live in the ocean and do not wear make up, so stick to a very subtle and natural look. Use waterproof makeup. Wear shades of blue for eye shadow, silver, black or clear mascara, and a light pink lip color.

, You could pick anything to wear but it is best to wear a necklace, preferably with a shell on it. If someone asks you where you got it, say ""home"" and change the subject. Never be caught without your symbol.

, Always have a bottle of water with a straw, some fake mermaid products, mirror and brush in a sea-themed bag. If you don't have a sea-themed bag, a floral or tropical bag would do.

, When you swim, put the tail on. Paint your nails the color of your tail.

, Be vague and mysterious about your life.

, Mermaids transform to their true selves at the touch of water, growing a tail. If someone is drinking water, back up. If you're at a pool area protect yourself.


If someone is holding a glass of water stare at it worryingly.
If your friends ask you to come swimming say ""I can't..."" If they ask why, say that you just can't. Soon they will pick up on your strange behavior and link it to your appearance.







, If you are a good singer, then display your singing skills and stare off in the distance. If you can't sing, then hum a tune. Sing or hum sailor songs.

, Mention random facts about the sea often, things that no one would usually know about; for example, the name of a deserted island. Then act embarrassed and flustered to have brought it up.

, Make this journal convincing. Choose a book that doesn't have a lock and cover it in pictures of the ocean and mermaid quotes, drawings, etc. Be caught writing in it often.

Put all of your secrets about your mermaid life in it and leave it around one day. Wait until someone reads it. Make sure it says things such as ""I'm craving the ocean"", ""Today my scales itched a lot"", ""The water felt so good against my tail"", ""Today I found a pod of dolphins to swim with! They were so cute!"", and so on. This will ""explain"" everything to the person who reads it.






Take good care of your journal.






If you keep a real journal, make sure they don't get mixed up.

, Never reveal the truth directly. Legend has it that if a mermaid tells a human they're a mermaid, they turn into bubbles!

, Say no, stutter and change the subject.


Eventually, though, you'll need to have a good chuckle when your friends keep asking if you're a mermaid. Let them know you wish you could be one and you're doing your best. Have them keep the secret for you.

, Work on your politeness, an aspect of manners.

, Another important aspect of behaving like a princess is executing proper dinner etiquette. This includes properly using all of the different utensils, knowing when to start eating, how to act, etc.

Be neat when you eat. Your princess apparel could get ruined if you spill spaghetti sauce down your front! Eat neatly for a royal meal.

, An ideal princess is clean and always follows proper hygiene processes.

, Snow White worked hard, did her chores, and contributed to her home, both with the dwarves and while living at the castle. Being responsible like this is especially important for princesses! You should do the same and help out where you can, doing your chores, getting a job, and generally being more responsible.

, Cinderella was kind to everyone, from cruel sisters to tiny mice. This kindness was what made her inner beauty and brought about her happy ending. Be kind like Cinderella, even when you don’t have to. People will be mean to you or may not have much to offer you, but like Cinderella shows, that doesn’t mean you have to be horrible right back.

, Princess Aurora, also called Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose, was kind and friendly with all the animals in the forest where she lived. She lived harmoniously with the environment around her and you should do the same. Respect nature, and do your part to protect the environment.

, Life can be hard sometimes and we can often get really caught up in school or other responsibilities, but Ariel shows us that it’s just as important to find joy in life. Ariel collected things and saw the beauty in things that no one else could see. Like Ariel, you should enjoy the world around you and find happiness in the things you do.

, Belle had it rough with the Beast, but she also saw someone who had real opportunity to be a better person. She helped him to heal his own pain and find happiness in life.

Search for understanding and peace, like Pocahontas, smoothing out arguments and problems between the people in your life so that everyone is treated fairly.

, Lots of things that we have to do in life will be pretty scary. Mulan was certainly pretty scared when she had to go off to war to protect her family and her country.

Be brave, like Mulan, and take your problems head on.

, Tiana learned from her father that you can have almost anything your heart can dream up but you have to work hard to get it. Tiana did just that and got everything she needed!

, When Rapunzel and Flynn got into trouble in the bar, instead of being afraid of the scary men there, she treated them all like normal people and became their friend. Like Rapunzel, don’t judge people. You shouldn’t judge a book by its cover and people will always surprise you.

, Merida had to save her mother after making a pretty serious mistake, which was hard and scary but very much the right thing to do. Like Merida, you should do the right thing, especially when it’s hard. This is one of the defining qualities of a princess and almost every princess on this list has had to do this exact same thing. It may not always be easy, but you can follow your heart do the right thing, and find your happiness.

, She is loyal, strong, brave, caring, and beautiful. She never gives up. She follows orders, but stays true to her heart. She met WALL-E and she doesn't want any harm to him and she's being kind to WALL-E. The right thing to do to be like her is to be brave, strong, kind, never give up, and do what's right.

, Anna learned that you shouldn't rush into love. You too must know that it is only after a while of knowing someone can you trust and love them. Elsa learned to be self-confident of her powers and not be afraid to show her talents and use them for a greater good. Both sisters learned that family is very important. You must learn to take love slow, be self-confident, and love your family dearly. If you have powers of any kind (such as seeing the future) accept them like Elsa and don't be scared of them.

, Take control of your destiny. Go out and do things that will enhance your life rather than just waiting for some prince to come. Your happiness will come when you pursue it, not while you're waiting for it to find you.


Be like Princess Zhao of Pingyang. This princess didn’t start life as a princess. She made herself one! She lived in China, a really long time ago and when her father decided he wanted to take control of China, she didn’t wait for him but instead joined in the battle, raising her own army and helping her father. She took control of her own destiny and you should do the same.

, Though you might not have the title of princess, you still have a people to protect. We are all, across the whole world, the same people but many are treated as less and are abused. Fight for their freedom, because that is what a real princess would do!


Be like Rani Lakshmibai. Princess Lakshmibai, who was really a queen as the wife of a king, was an Indian princess who fought for freedom for her people from the British. She saw her people being abused and treated as less than human and her son, who should have been king, stripped of power and a future. Instead of leaving the battle to the men, she fought for her people and their freedom. You should do the same.

, Don’t let anyone define you. Do the things that make you you and that you enjoy. The world will tell you what are girl things and what are boy things, or they'll tell you that something is only for white girls or black girls, but those things don't matter. Don't listen to those people. You just be the person that you are.


Be like Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana. This princess of Thailand studies fashion and is a just a typical girl...who plays sports! She doesn’t let “femininity” keep her from doing things that are usually considered boy things.

, Reach for the stars, no matter what people tell you. Want more for your life and pursue those dreams. Don't just take the same job as your parents because that's what they want you to do. Don't just listen when people say you have to take a girl job. Pursue your dreams to find your happiness.


Be like Princess Sikhanyiso Dlamini. This princess of Swaziland, in Africa, doesn’t let the rules of her culture define her. She fights against many of the outdated restrictions and pursues her dreams and the things she wants for herself. You should do the same.

, You should try to work to make the world a better place. Find causes you believe in and fight however you can. You can volunteer or hold a fund raiser. You can also help by donating toys or clothes that you don't need or use very often. Tell your parents that you want to help people, and they will help you find ways to contribute to the world.


Be like Princess Diana. Princess Diana was the mother of Prince William. Though she died very young, she worked very hard during her lifetime to make the world a better place. She worked for causes like fighting the AIDS epidemic and also worked to help people that a lot of others didn’t think were worth helping, like drug addicts and homeless people.

, Sometimes life gets really hard, for you and for everyone else. Times get tough and it makes people really sad. When this happens, you should try to inspire hope, even when things seem hopeless. Stay optimistic and always work for the best outcome, even in the toughest of times.


Be like Queen Elizabeth. She’s queen of Britain now, but Elizabeth was just a princess during World War II. At that time, the terror of war was at the forefront of children’s minds all across Britain. Elizabeth brought hope to all of them by speaking on the radio and working for the war effort.

, You should fight for equality, because we are all humans and we all deserve equal rights and opportunities. If you see people being treated unfairly, speak up, whether it's in your household or half-way across the world. When enough voices speak up, real change can happen and people's lives can be made better.


Be like Princess Ameera Al-Taweel. A princess of Saudi Arabia, Ameera is an icon of equal rights for women in her country and across the Middle East. She uses her power to try to improve conditions for other women, who have not been given the opportunities that she has.

, Never be afraid to be smart. If you see boys that don't like your brains, then they're bad guys, not Prince Charmings. Learn about things because learning is fun! You'll get to do so many more interesting things and the smarter you are, the easier it will be for YOU to save the world. Study hard in school and never be afraid to use your brains!


Be like Princess Lalla Salma. Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco got a degree in engineering and worked with computers before taking her royal title! Like this brainy princess, you should try to be smart!

Figure out what you're Princess of!,
Know who your Subjects are: It is very important that a Princess is kind and considerate to her loyal subjects.,
Dress accordingly: Depending on the style and etiquette of your kingdom, the way you dress should vary.,
Have good Hygiene: Unless you're Princess of the Stink Kingdom, a Princess should always be clean!,
Work Hard in All That You Do!,
Be Happy!,
Earn Princess Points (PP): a Princess of any kingdom can create her own Princess Points system.,
Be Open-Minded: A true Princess is accepting of all situations of the human condition.,
Buy a Tiara!,
Keep Good Morals: A Princess would never participate in dangerous, immoral, or ""bad"" things or actions.,
Don't Hold Grudges: There may be subjects in your kingdom that don't like the way you run yourself or the kingdom.,
Follow Your Dreams!,
Love Yourself: This is the most important part of being a Princess in today's world.",How to Be Like a Modern Day Princess,": In order to be Royalty, you must first decide what you reign over! You may decide that your room, your house, your town, or even bigger is now claimed under you as a Princess. You can also claim to be Princess of and object, fashion, time, etc. (e.g. Princess of the Night, Preppy Princess, Techno Princess.) Take whatever it is that you're into, and claim yourself as it's Princess! You could also have a title(e.g. Hannah the First, Leah the Brave, etc.).


If you are a more imaginative Princess, you can create your own imaginary land and give it a name, making yourself it's ruler.;
, If you are Princess of your room, then maybe your dolls or teddy bears are your subjects, and you must treat them well. If you are Princess of a larger kingdom with lots of people in it (like your city), then you must act as a Princess towards everyone you meet. A true Princess would be involved in charity events in her kingdom, and give back to her subjects as much as she could!

, As each Princess and kingdom is different, not every Princess should be wearing pink, frilly dresses. If you are Princess of the Skate park, put on your ripped jeans and skate shoes, and head out proudly to your nation! Just remember your manners!

, When you are around your subjects, you want them to remember you for your charm, not your foul smell or dirty fingernails. Take time in the morning after you wake up and at night before you go to bed to do some simple, self-cleansing tasks. Take a shower, wash your hair and face, shave (if necessary), and file your fingernails. Cleanliness is a Princesses personal duty!

,: Whether you're in school or at work, be sure to do your best. You owe it to your subjects to be the best person that you can be! Don't be lazy and skip your homework, or chat when you should be working. A Princess should be well-rounded, and learn responsibility and work ethic.


If you thought being a Princess was all about being spoiled and pampered, think again!

,: Unless your kingdom is of a darker nature, be sure to carry true joy in your heart! Find little things to be grateful and happy for in your life, and appreciate them every day. If you've been working hard studying or working for your money, come home to your castle and pamper yourself with a video game, your favorite book, or and nice, warm bubble bath. Be positive! Don't be afraid to smile a lot, and show everyone how happy you are as a true Princess!

Try all the different flavors of ice cream, and eat any type of ice cream you can get your hands on.,
Whenever you eat a snack, create an ice cream sundae or float to eat whenever possible.,
Make sure you stock up on ice cream.,
Delicious ice cream toppings are mandatory when it comes to being an ice cream princess!",How to Be an Ice Cream Princess1," Avoid sticking to only one flavor and/or one method to eat ice cream or what's the point of trying to be an ice cream princess? To be an excellent ice cream princess, don't be afraid of trying different methods to eat ice cream and become familiar with every single flavor. However, just because you're an ice cream princess doesn't mean you need to love all the flavors - there may be some you may dislike, but don't let that stop you from having fun.


Don't feel inclined to try the peanut butter flavored ice cream if you know you're allergic to peanut butter. Check with your parents and familiarize yourself with any allergies you have before trying different ice cream flavors to avoid any allergic reactions that may come as minor or major.;
, You could also just eat it from a bowl or a cone instead of fancying it up. However, know your limits and have self-control to avoid getting sick or hurting your stomach. Remember that you also mustn't neglect your healthy diet and that ice cream should come as the last thing you eat after consuming all the nutrients necessary to maintain a good health.

, However, this doesn't mean your entire freezer needs to be stuffed with only ice cream! Have at least one or two small tubs of ice cream at hand so that you won't open the freezer to find that you've completely run out. Also, make sure you don't eat all of it at once or you'll be simply wasting your money.


If your parents refuse to buy you ice cream frequently, either buy it yourself or make a fair deal with them (ex: ""I'll wash the dinner dishes for every tub of ice cream you need to buy me).

However, do not make them feel forced to buy you ice cream in order to get you to obey. You may get in trouble, and your parents might refuse to purchase you any ice cream in the future.


To prevent the ice cream from running out quickly, limit the amount of ice cream you eat and consume it less frequently. This will save you time, and it helps you avoid stomachaches.

, Always have plenty of toppings on your ice cream, but make sure you have self-control, remembering the quote, ""Less is more."" However, check with your parents to see if you have any allergies to toppings that might cause allergic reactions to occur, such as nuts (including peanuts). Suggested toppings are:


Sprinkles
Small chunks of chocolate
Fudge
Cookie dough
Caramel
Brownies
M&Ms
Nuts

Avoid using any type of nuts if you're allergic to them, for some ice cream toppings mix a variety of chopped nuts together.


Ice cream syrup

This does not include maple syrup, although you may try it on your ice cream if you wish.

Gather your materials.,
Fill the tube sock.,
Seal the open end of the tube sock.,
Microwave the compress.,
Place a barrier between your skin and the compress.,
Place the compress against your skin.",How to Make a Warm Compress1," All you need for the basic compress is a clean tube sock and some dry, uncooked rice, beans or oats to go inside it. However, if you want to give the compress a pleasant fragrance, you’ll also need a little bit of powdered peppermint, cinnamon, or whichever aroma you’d prefer. You can use some herbs from your kitchen, the contents of an herbal tea bag or essential oils.Try adding relaxing lavender, chamomile, sage, or mint to your compress for an even more soothing experience.;
, Whether you’re using the rice, beans, or oats, pour them into the tube sock until it’s mostly full—about ½-¾ full. Just leave enough sock material on the end to tie a knot, unless you plan on sewing the end of the sock to make a permanent warm compress. Then you can fill it nearly to the top.As you fill the sock, you can add small pinches of your fragrant powder or herbs so there will be a pleasant aroma throughout the compress.

, Depending on how long you want to keep your compress, you can seal the sock temporarily or permanently. Tying a firm knot into the sock will keep the contents in place for a short period of time, but let you reuse the sock later. You can also sew the open end of the sock together for a more permanent compress.Note that sealing the sock very close to its contents will make for a hard compress, while sealing it far away will leave its contents loose. Experiment a little bit with how hard or soft you want the compress to feel before sealing it.
If you leave the contents a little looser, you can drape the sock easily over your neck and shoulders to treat pain there.

, After you have sealed your compress, microwave it for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds you can feel it and see how warm it is. If you are happy with the level of warmth, you can take it out and use it. If you want it to be warmer, continue microwaving the compress in increments of 10 seconds until the compress is as warm as you’d like it to be.Remember that placing scalding hot materials against your skin can cause blisters and burns.A range between about 70 and 80°F (21.1 to 26.7°C) is optimal., You can wrap the compress or place a towel or t-shirt on your skin where you plan to use the heat. This will prevent skin damage or burning. Make sure you check your skin every few minutes to make sure your skin is still in good shape.

, If it feels uncomfortably hot, remove it right away and wait for the compress to cool a bit before replacing it. When the compress has reached a comfortable temperature, hold the compress to the sore area for ten minutes. After ten minutes, remove it to let the skin cool down a bit. After allowing your skin to cool down, you can reapply it for another ten minutes if you wish.


If your skin starts to look dark red, purplish, spotty red and white, blistered, swollen or you develop hives, call your doctor. You may have skin damage from the heat."
