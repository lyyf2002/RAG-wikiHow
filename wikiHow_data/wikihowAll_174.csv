Gradually bring your camera to the temperature of the cold surroundings.,
Bring a few backup batteries.,
Remember to protect yourself.,
Layer your gloves.,
Don't get wet feet.,
Be aware of how you place your feet.",How to Do Cold Weather Photography," One way to do this is to seal it inside of a plastic bag and be outside in the cold. Using the bag will also help redirect the condensation that will occur if your camera gets cold too fast.


Also, watch where you breathe. You can inadvertently cause condensation that way.;
, Cold causes the power to drain more quickly from your battery. You will need extras.

, If the conditions are extreme, any skin showing is prone to frostbite.

, Yes, it is difficult to photograph when gloved, but find some very thin gloves to wear under the warmer gloves. Then wear fingerless gloves over the thin gloves. Over them, wear the thick gloves that you would wear to protect your hands and remove them when you are photographing.

, That can end everything in a hurry. If your feet get damp with perspiration, change socks. Be sure to bring a few extra pairs of socks.

, With cold and ice, slipping is always a danger. You can hurt yourself and your cameras."

Get a flashlight, glow stick, or something that provides colored or non-colored light.,
Go into a totally dark room.,
Set your camera to Manual mode if it's a DSLR, and make the shutter speed 30 seconds(looks like this on the screen for Canon: 30""), or have a friend help and set it to BULB mode.,
Set your ISO to one hundred or two hundred, depending on the brightness of the room you are in.

When the shutter opens, you have thirty seconds (or however long your friend decides, if using BULB mode) to write.",How to Create Light Graffiti Photography," One of the newest creations is a pixel stick. Be sure to check them out!;
, A bedroom with a kind of high bed or table would help as a tripod. Or a real tripod.

, BULB mode allows for the shutter to stay open for as long as the trigger is pushed. A longer shutter speed means more time that light is allowed in through the lens.

,, A lower aperture means more amount of light entering into the lens. The higher the aperture, the less light.

,,, When the shutter goes off, check out your masterpiece! This can also be done with sparklers, lightening, or highway photography with blurred head and tail lights."

Get the film.,
Prepare the end of the film you had left sticking out to make the loading easier.,
Pick up your scissors and cut the rounded edges at the corner of the film.,
Let there be no light!,
Open the film spool/ The film spool has a clever little mechanism involving small ball bearings so that when you twist it one way then back, the film advances onto the spool and can be pulled out the canister.,
Load the film onto the developing spool.,
At this point, you should still be underneath your bed sheets and in darkness and have the film loaded onto the film spool.,
Turn the light back on as the film should now be safely inside the lightproof developing tank.

Get the chemicals.,
Dilute the chemicals.,
Manage the temperature.,
Get the time right.,
When the chemicals have reached the correct temperature, pour the developer into the top of the developing tank.,
Once the time is up pour away the developer out the top of the tank.,

Chopping time!,
With your negatives, you can choose one of the following options:


Make your own prints.",How to Develop Photos at Home," Since this can be a total pain in the neck, a bit of foresight can simplify this step. When winding the film back into your camera, ensure it doesn't fully retract into the canister and a little bit is left poking out. Once the film detaches from the right hand's spool, it can usually be felt so you will want to stop at this point so it doesn't fully wind into the canister. Refer to the photo to get an idea of how much film you'll want to leave sticking out. If the film does end up fully back inside the canister, to 'extract' it back out, there are two options:


Use a film extractor. It can be fiddly however once you get the hang of it, it is fairly simple to use. Instructions for use are usually printed on the extractor.
Use a special film canister opener. It's like a bottle opener so you use it to pop off one end of the film canister. Be warned though: This must be done in total darkness or else the film will get exposed and be ruined!;
, Take a pair of scissors and cut the tab off the end of the film so there is a straight edge on the end of the film.

, This makes the loading smoother and helps the film roll around the spool.

, In pitch darkness, the lights of your room turned off, the windows closed, with you under your bed covers, you can only then proceed with developing your film. Since the film is still highly light-sensitive, the least exposure to the under-developed film can cause all your pretty pictures to turn out white! Optionally, if someone attempts to enter your room or threatens to run on the lights, you can scream: “I'm having some happy alone time!” and generally with one look at you, they’ll make a swift exit.

, You may have to manually pull a length of film from the canister to get it started.

, Once all the film is out the canister, use a pair of scissors to snip the canister off the end of the film. This takes some getting used to, especially as it must be carried out in darkness, so it's recommended sacrificing a film to practice with, in the light first, then in the light with eyes closed and finally give it ago in total darkness. Ensure you only touch the film by the edges during this otherwise you can scratch your negatives (the third picture is an example of how nasty this can look).

, Still in darkness, take the film spool, slide it onto the central spool, put the retaining clip on top and place the whole lot inside the developing tank. Make sure the lightproof seal is still in place. Screw on the top cap.

,, Depending on where you live, this may be slightly tricky so ask around your local camera shop and they should be able to point you in the right direction. In UK, you can order the chemicals from a website called Jessops. However, do your own research and explore camera shop websites with a local store for you. The two chemicals you'll be using are:


The developer. The essential chemistry behind developing films is this: the grapevine on the developer deposits silver crystals on the film on the areas that have been exposed to light, causing them to go dark (hence images turn out negative).
The fixer. The fixer fixes the deposited silver crystals in place, stopping the film from becoming light sensitive.

, Based on the brands you use, the dilution rates differ accordingly. For instance, for a particular brand, the developer may be diluted 1:14 and fixer at 1:4.

, The developer is extremely temperature sensitive (the fixer slightly less so). For most brands the optimum temperature is 20 degrees C (or 68 degrees Fahrenheit). To get the temperatures right, use hot and cold water to dilute the developer and fixer until they're roughly at correct temperature. Use a decent thermometer to aid you. Sit the chemicals in a pair of measuring jugs in a pan filled with either hot or cold water to reach the required temperature.

, While developing and fixing, timing is crucial so read carefully on the sides of the bottles to find out the times for both fixer and developer. It varies from brand to brand however, normally the developer takes about 14 minutes while fixer needs about 2 minutes.

, Sharply knock the tank on a table to dislodge any bubbles clinging to the film. Leave this to develop for the correct amount of time, shaking the developing tank for 20 seconds every 2 minutes. (At this point the more you agitate the developer, the higher the contrast of the image, so adjust this to your wishes)

, Fill it up with water then pour it out. Repeat this several times then leave the tank under a running tap of cold water for about 10 minutes.

, Pour in the fixing solution, tapping the tank on a table sharply to remove any bubbles again. Leave the photos there for a while until the correct amount of time has passed and pull away the fixer. After pulling the fixer, then, rinse out the developing tank with cold water a couple more times. The film is now developed and your spanking new, shiny negatives are only a step away!

, Twist the film spool until it clicks and the two halves separate. Remove the film. Holding carefully the film by edges only, find a dust-free area in your home/room/blimp and using some clothes pegs, peg up the film to dry. Also put a peg on the bottom of the film to keep it straight and stop it from curling up. (note: your film will be longer than the one in the picture, this is a scrap I found for demonstrative purposes.)

, Once the film is dry, cut it up into smaller pieces. Be careful to not accidentally chop any of your pictures in half.

, Follow this guide to do just that: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Print-BW-Photographs-in-a-Darkroom/

Get prints done at a shop. This can be quite expensive, costing up to £1.50 for just one small print.
Get them scanned. Most film developing places give you the option of putting your prints onto a CD, usually costing about £2 for a whole roll. You can then take the photos to the student print shop and get their prints on photo paper. This comes out considerably cheaper.
Scan the photos. If you use a flatbed scanner, this can turn out nasty! However, this step ensures you permanently preserve the result of your photo-developing skills, nasty or not! Now sit back, admire your work and wait for people to come explore your unique artistic ability with the camera.

Taking photographs of public places and public officials, even police, in public is considered a form of public oversight of the government. Generally, unless prohibited by a specific law or ordinance, you are allowed to photograph the following in public spaces:


Buildings, including public buildings and bridges.
People in public, including children.
Celebrities.
Police and other public officials, including when they are performing their official duties.
Airports and other mass transit depots.;
, There is a common misperception, particularly since September 11th, that you cannot take pictures on mass transit or in airport terminals. There is no broad prohibition against photography on mass transit. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has stated that photography is allowed in and around airline security checkpoints so long as you do not interfere with the screening process.In New York City, there was a move to stop photography on subways, Long Island Railroad, and Metro North trains. Ultimately, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) stated affirmatively that there is no ban on photography.Despite this ban, MTA police officers have threatened to arrest press and civilian photographers.If you are threatened with arrest for taking pictures on public transportation, you can contact your local ACLU office to get information on your legal rights in your area.

, There is no federal law that prohibits individuals from photographing the exterior of federal buildings. While journalists and civilians taking pictures have suffered harassment, been detained and arrested for photographing and videotaping federal buildings from public sidewalks, there is no legal justification for this conduct.


The U.S Department of Homeland Security issued a memo stating that photographing the exterior of federal buildings from public property is allowed.
You can access a copy of the memo on the ACLU’s website. The ACLU recommends that you bring a copy of the memo with you if you plan to photograph federal buildings.You should note that you are entitled to take a photograph of the exterior of a building. If you use a telephoto lens to look inside someone’s window you are invading that person’s privacy and you may be subject to a lawsuit., Citizens have the right to take a picture or videotape police officers in public who are performing their jobs. Photography, in this instance, stands as an independent record of police activity, which can be used to show police misconduct.


You have the right to photograph the police. Police officers may tell you that you are not allowed to photograph them. However, as discussed in more detail below, if you are taking pictures or video in a public space or in a private space at which you are entitled to be present, and you are not interfering with the police, you have the legal right to take pictures.

, You can only enter private property with the permission of the property owner and the property owner has the right to limit what you are allowed to photograph on his or her land. A property owner can ask you to leave the property if you fail to follow the rules that were established for your photography. You can be arrested for entering someone’s private property without permission, this is referred to as trespassing.You can, however, take pictures of private land from a public place or from another location where you have permission to enter.There are several exceptions to the trespass law as related to photography. You are allowed to take photos to document or lessen a disaster. You are also permitted to take photos on someone else’s property to document a crime., Police officers can order a person to stop taking pictures if the person is interfering with police operations. Interfering with police operations does not mean filming or photographing the police while they are working. If you are ordered to stop photographing the police, you will have to make a judgment as to whether you are going to comply with the order. If you are not close to the scene but it appears you are being harassed because the police officers do not want their activities caught on camera, you can consider respectfully declining the officer’s request.

, If you are interfering with police operations or breaking a law in order to take a picture (such as trespassing), you may be arrested or detained by the police. You may also be arrested if you photograph certain places related to national security, such as nuclear facilities or military installations. While private individuals may not have a right to stop you from photographing them on a public street, there are limits on how you can use the image.


For example, you cannot publish a picture of a person for advertising purposes without seeking the permission of the person you photographed.
Similarly, you cannot use the photo in an article describing something that may be considered negative without having the person’s permission. For example, you cannot use a photograph that you took in public in an article about obesity without receiving the person’s permission.
You may be sued if you use a person’s image improperly.You cannot photograph people when they have secluded themselves in places where they have an expectation of privacy, such as dressing rooms, bathrooms, or inside of their homes.

, Often, security guards start confrontations over photographers taking pictures of the place where they work. Occasionally, security officers may try to restrict photography citing vaguely worded security concerns. As a professional or civilian photographer you should understand that a member of the public does not have the right to detain you in a public place because you are taking pictures. Even if a person asks you questions, you are under no obligation to provide any answers regarding your photography.


It is illegal for a member of the public to detain you against your will.
Legally, a person cannot use fear or the threat of violence in order to force you to disclose your identity or the reason you are taking pictures.
If you are being harassed or threatened by a member of the public you can call the police. If you feel that you may be injured, you can call 911 and try to remove yourself from harm as quickly as possible.
Some states require that you disclose your identity to a police officer, but you are not required to disclose your identity to a member of the public at large., A photographer may be able to defuse a tense situation with a person who was photographed by speaking politely and calmly to the person. If the person begins to escalate the situation and you feel threatened, you should call the police. If someone is trying to detain you or take your film, consider asking the following questions so that you can follow-up with legal action if necessary:


Ask the person for his or her name.
Ask the person to identify his or her employer. This may be particularly important if a security guard is harassing you.
Ask them whether you are free to leave and whether they intend to detain you. If they state that are going to detain you, ask them if they intend to use physical force.
Ask them on what legal grounds they think that they can detain you or attempt to confiscate your camera.
You should contact the police as soon as you are able., In most cases, the police have no legal grounds to stop you from taking pictures. However, it is important that you remain polite when speaking with the police and never physically resist a police officer.If you are stopped by a police officer, you can do the following:


Ask “am I free to go?”If the officer says no, then you are being detained by the police.Generally, a police officer cannot detain a person without reasonable suspicion that you committed or were about to commit a crime. Until you ask whether you can leave, your stop is considered voluntary and legal.
If the officer detains you, you have the right to politely ask for what reason or crime you are suspected of committing. You can also remind the officer that your right to take photographs is protected by the First Amendment.Photographers have been charged with disorderly conduct, trespass and obstruction of governmental administration just for taking pictures as part of their job. Often, district attorneys dismiss the charges but the officers, by arresting the photographer on questionable charges, were able to stop the photographer from taking pictures., If you are seen photographing an event, a police officer may attempt to confiscate or demand access to your photography equipment or to view your film or video. You can refuse the police access to your equipment by asking whether they have a warrant to view your digital data. This question may be enough to stop a police officer from pursuing the matter further. While the Supreme Court has not ruled specifically on the need for a warrant to view digital images, it has ruled that the police need a warrant to search your cell phone. Private parties cannot force you to delete images unless they get a court order.


Under certain circumstances the police can access your cell phone and most likely your camera without a warrant. The police would have to show exigent circumstances, which means they need to access your electronics in order to save a life, or because the police officer has a reasonable, good faith belief that they can prevent the destruction of evidence., Police officers are not legally allowed to delete your photographs or video under any circumstances. Officers who have engaged in this type of conduct have faced felony charges for evidence tampering and obstruction and theft for taking a photographer’s memory card. If an officer attempts to delete your photograph, you can politely remind him that it is a felony if he deletes the material., If you suffered harassment, intimidation, or threats, or you were physically detained, you should contact the police. If you suffered at the hands of the police, you should contact a civil rights attorney and ask them how you should proceed. Often there are civilian complaint boards to which you can report improper and illegal police conduct.


You may also have a civil case against the person who harassed on your or their employer. You may be entitled to money damages for any injuries that you suffered."

Fashion photography requires a keen eye for fashion trends and set design. Do you enjoy working with models and celebrities? Do you see fashion as an art? If you know how the fashion industry works, you'll be able to create a place for you in it.



 



Advertising/commercial photography is the most visible of the lot. It's a mixed bag of fashion, product, food and portrait photography rolled into one. Your photos should be able to sell or promote a product effectively. For those who fit the bill, this is a very lucrative field







Nature and travel photography require many of the same skills. Be prepared to leave your comfort zone to get the best photographs. Both require a lot of field work, travel and minimal editing.







Food photographers should have a love for the culinary arts. You don't have to be a professional chef but you will have to know about various ingredients that make up a dish. Invest in a good macro lens too.





;
, What got you shooting to begin with? For example, if you’ve always enjoyed photographing couples, wedding photography might be your thing.

, You alone will know what shots you are most comfortable taking. Employers will want to know about your area of expertise just as much as you do.


Organize your best photos into a folder. Look at them with a critical eye.
Have you won awards or prizes for a certain style of photography? Label those and keep those at the top of the pile.
Make medium-sized prints of your best photos once you've shortlisted the best of them. Look at them once again and recall the emotions you felt when you took them.

, Gauge their opinion. You will notice a pattern in their constructive feedback and get the fresh perspective you need on your strongest work.

Ask them plenty of questions as to why they like some photographs more than others.






Request them to write down what they feel are your strongest and weakest skills as a photographer. This will help you develop better critical thinking skills






Remember to thank them for their feedback and criticism. You might need their help in the future.







, If you’re good at more than one areas of photography, choose one you would like to specialize and highlight in your resume.

, Write down separately what you like and dislike if you can't decide what kind of photography you want a career in.

Some kinds of photography would require you to have an assistant and some might not.






Some kinds of photography would require more specialized equipment. For example: If you're a nature photographer, you will need water-proof gear for your equipment.






How good are you at networking? If you don't like meeting new people, commercial or fashion photography won't work for you.






You will meet tantrum-throwing models or clients in the fashion industry. Decide if the money is worth dealing with them.







, Include your personal information, educational/professional experience, technical skills and a portfolio. Apart from the personal information, the rest needs to be articulated using the written word as well as your creativity (your portfolio).


Be honest with the information you volunteer. You don’t want to get off on the wrong foot.
Only mention details that are relevant to the line of work you’re getting into as a photographer.
Consider mentioning volunteer work you may have done as a photographer in the past.

, You name, address, email and phone number should be right at the top of the resume.

, If it’s not, that’s okay. Your employers will want to know about your background regardless.

, This will be the most important part of your resume, apart from your portfolio.


Clearly mention your experience in your previous jobs starting with the company name, your job title and the time you were employed.
Briefly describe your responsibilities while working there. For example, if you were a fashion photographer’s assistant, mention your experience with camera equipment, studio work, lighting, set design, bookings, etc.
Mention your expertise with editing software or photographic technique that you think will set you apart from the rest.
List all your published photographs. This must include the literature in which it was published and the date/month/year. Also include copies of your published work in your portfolio.
Make a list of any awards or prizes you’ve received in the past for your photography.

, Pick valuable people from within the industry to vouch for your skills and professionalism in the field. If they’ve worked with you in the past, their opinion as references will be well-respected.


Call or email your references first. Tell them about the job you're applying for and why you need their support.
Ask them if they prefer you give out their name or number or both.
List their name(s) in the references section of your resume along with their title, job designation, email and/or phone number.
Mention their relationship to you and the company you both worked at.
Only ask for references from people whose opinion will be relevant to the job you're applying for.

, In your cover letter, explain why you should be hired. This plus references will help you especially if you don't have substantial photography experience.


The cover letter should have a formal tone.
Don't write more than two paragraphs for the main body copy. The person hiring you shouldn't get overwhelmed.
If you're sending your cover letter by email, type it in the body copy of the email, unless specified otherwise.
If you're sending it by post, it should be placed before your resume.

,, Once you know what your job options are, make the portfolio you will take to your interviews. Present your portfolio in a way that matches the type of work you will be doing.

Scan through all the photos you’ve taken in your time as a professional photographer. You will need to select your most flattering work.






Gather your resources to put together a great portfolio. If you feel your skills are limited, ask for help from a friend or pay a designer to teach you some tricks. It’s a one-time investment that you can improve on at any time.






Make prints of your photographs to keep with you. Your interview could take place in an informal setting so having prints at hand will limit your need to reach for a computer.






All your photographs should be high-resolution (more than 5 mega pixels) and be finished professionally. Ideal dimensions for a high quality print are 8x10 inches, 9x12 inches or 10x13 inches.







, Use the Internet to share your portfolio with an employer and your peers. You can also use a website to host your resume and just send a prospective employer the link.


You can buy a domain on the Web with the help of hosting sites such as wordpress.com, domain.com or godaddy.com.
Select a website name and check if it’s available for you to use.
Blog hosting sites like wordpress, blogger and typepad.com have ready-made templates for photographers wanting to host their portfolios online. You can either use a free design template or pay a fee to get advanced design options.
Use your website to showcase your creativity as well as your design skills.
Use social networking websites like tumblr, DeviantART and Flickr to post your photos online. Show prospective employers that your photos have been appreciated with the number of comments or “likes”.

, Every photographer should have at least one portfolio book with them to take to interviews. Employers could ask that you bring one to the interview so it's best to be prepared.


Have your personal details mentioned in your portfolio. Also add contact information, just as you would do with your resume.
Web businesses such as blurb.com and myprintfolio.com will print and ship your portfolio to you as a hard-cover book.
Choose a specialized book for your portfolio. Your photos should be big enough to be appreciated. The book must ensure that the ""flow"" of photos is true to your talent and artistic sensibility.
Buy a simple binder for any extra photographs that did not make it into your portfolio.
Add captions for your photos when necessary. Sometimes the photo speaks for itself and you'll do more good if you leave it as is.
Print your portfolio at home on your printer. Make sure the printing is of high quality.
Look online for a local printer in your neighborhood that will print your portfolio for you.

, Even if you're pressed for time, you will need to clear this step before you hit send.


Update your resume the day before you send it. If you've learned any new photography skills or earned new achievements, check to see if you've added it to your resume.
Check if your resume is relevant to the job you're applying for. This will be easy to do if you know what your future employer will expect of you.
Make sure all the sections in your resume are clearly labeled. Highlight the important photographic achievements
Ensure that the content flows logically and is easy to read. You will have already done this with your portfolio so apply the same principles to your resume.
Typographical errors rarely create a good impression. Carefully run through the test to make sure there are no errors in spelling, grammar or syntax.

, Different employers could have a varied preferences so check to be sure. Once you know, you can use any of these following ways to send it to them.

Copy your resume and portfolio on a DVD or a flash drive. Create folders and label them before your mail it to your employer.






If you're sending your resume/portfolio via email, write in the cover letter explaining what attachments the email contains along with the attachment file names.






Employers sometimes prefer a resume and cover letter to be in a PDF format before it's sent or uploaded online. Adobe Acrobat is one such software you can use to change an MS Word document into a PDF file.






Handing your resume over personally is the best way to let your personality shine. Make sure you take your resume and portfolio as well as DVD/flash drive of your work. Most employers might not want to keep a hard copy of your portfolio but they could ask you for some other form of it as well.







, This step applies only if they haven't told you when they will get back to you.


Thank your employer in a short email or handwritten note after you've completed your interview. Do this as soon as possible.






Be available to your future employer by phone or email at any time after the interview. They could call you for a second or third round.






Don't be pushy. If they tell you they will call you back, be patient.

, What kind of response or reaction do you want from your audience? Think about what you want to show them. Are you trying to challenge them, please them, impress them or surprise them? Tailor your content to your audience.


For example, if your portfolio is for a job interview with a cooking magazine, your audience will want to see how well you photograph food and what your personal style is.
Perhaps your audience includes owners of an independent art gallery. The content you would choose for the magazine editors is much different than the content you would choose for the gallery owners.

, Instead, settle on a concept that will unify a strong series of images. This will result in a more cohesive and effective portfolio. The theme can be anything you want – you could focus on images depicting a specific subject matter, a certain style, or photos taken with a particular kind of camera.


For example, for an artistic purpose, you could limit your portfolio to crisp black and white photography only.
If you’re trying to get a job as real estate photographer, your theme could be dynamic images taken of various kinds of buildings.

, Whether you go with a print or a digital portfolio is entirely up to you. Keep your audience in mind when you make your decision. For instance, gallery owners and traditional artists might prefer to see a beautifully bound print portfolio. On the other hand, people affiliated with industries like media and advertisement may want to see your work presented digitally.


You always have the option of creating both, as well.
An electronic format can help you emphasize different aspects of your work than a printed format can, and vice versa.

, At this point you’ve defined your purpose, your goal, the audience and the unifying theme. As you go through possible photos for the portfolio, keep these things firmly in mind. Set aside all of the images that meet the criteria you’ve established.


Don’t worry about making any final decisions now.
Just ask yourself if each photo meets the criteria or not. Sort the images into a “yes” and “no” pile.

, Is the image strong enough to stand on its own without explanation? When viewed with other images, is it just as strong? Does it adequately display your mastery of the medium? Is it consistent with your main body of work?

, As you narrow it down further, keep in mind that the images you choose need to be consistent in format. In most cases, the final set should not be a mix of horizontal and vertical images. Be consistent with one or the other.The style should also be consistent throughout. For example, your portfolio shouldn't jump back and forth between crisp black and white shots and dreamy images printed in color.

, It’s better to have a small number of exceptional shots than a large group of decent ones. Avoid including too many images that look very similar to one another. You need to include a variety of images that explore your theme.


For example, your portfolio shouldn’t consist of images that were all shot during the same session.
Being able to weed out flawed and redundant images shows that you are able to properly evaluate your own work with a critical eye., Be as objective as you can, but consider getting an impartial opinion from someone you trust. Bring this person in when you’re in the final stages of selection.


Don’t reveal your concept or give the person any information upfront. See if they can pinpoint what you’re going for without being told.
Request that they provide as much feedback as possible and take notes if you need to.

, However, most professionals agree that less is more. Twenty images should be the maximum; closer to ten is preferable.


Remember, each of these shots should strongly represent your skill level.
The execution of each shot should be close to perfect and there should be no visible flaws in any of them.

, Examine your set closely. Think about any steps you need to take to perfect your chosen images. Perhaps you need to tweak a negative for a better print or crop something slightly differently. Complete the computer or darkroom work necessary to finalize your series of photos.


As you tweak the images, don't forget that a consistent theme should be apparent and the series of images should fit together in a cohesive way. Don't change the images so much that you lose cohesiveness.

, However, the first image in your portfolio should be one of the strongest. You want the first photo to make a clear statement. It also needs to create enough interest to make the viewer want to continue looking through the series. Arrange the rest so that the colors, tones and moods compliment and play off one another.


It might help to think about arranging them in a way that tells a coherent story or evokes a particular mood.
The final image should appropriately sum up the rest of the series.
Avoid crowding the “best” images at the front and then padding the end out with weaker images. There should be no weak images in the group.

, Your portfolio is more than just a handful of great photos. The way you present them is extremely important. A bound book of selected works is the most traditional option. The book you arrange them in should represent the contents inside. Choose techniques, borders and backing sheet colors that enhance the collection. Make your prints on good paper.


Be consistent and choose either matte or glossy – do not include a combination.
Package everything as attractively and professionally as you can.

, Most artists prefer to do this themselves. They either mount the photos onto backing paper or they slide the images into the plastic sleeves that their purchased portfolio provides. If you'd prefer to have a professional do this part, research your area for shops that do custom printing. The photos should be placed into the portfolio in the sequence you worked out earlier.


You can arrange one image per page, or you could cluster two or three photos together to create a ""chapter.""
Remember, the sequence should make sense. Tell a story with your images.

, Consider adding final elements such as an artist statement, a title list of the photographs in the portfolio, or a cover image that represents the portfolio as a whole. You want the images to stand alone and speak for themselves, but there is nothing wrong with including additional information that may enhance the portfolio.

, Digital portfolios are becoming more common, especially in technology and media fields. There are two options – creating your own website or using a portfolio hosting site like Smugmug or Zenfolio. Unless you are prepared to buy web space and create a website from scratch, the hosting site is a better option. These sites let you upload your photos into galleries and then you can customize the order and the appearance.Digital portfolios can be updated frequently, whereas a print portfolio is usually a finished work. Online you can add and take away images and continually customize your portfolio.
You should still try to keep your chosen images concise, but with digital portfolios it's acceptable to display a few more images than a print one would. 20-30 is a good number.

Do not follow the rules of composition and photography exactly.",How to Compose Photos,"


Read, and periodically review, the owner's manual to make use of your camera's features such as ASA, macro, forced flash, auto, night etc.






Move around or about. Also try pictures from a low or high vantage point.






Take shots with normal, wide angle and telephoto. Use wide angle to include the desired elements into the frame. Use telephoto to simplify a picture. ""Telephoto"" is commonly used to access the subject otherwise not possible - such as in an event where you are not allowed to get closer. Telephoto is also used to make a person look thinner.






Review the basics themes of composition before a photo shoot: c and s curves, contrast, diagonal and horizontal line uses, subject matter, patterns, the way the eyes move throughout the picture when viewing it, aesthetics, texture, framing, taking an interesting photo and texture. Also mentally review the technical aspects of photography. Make a checklist of equipment for your photo shoot.






After a photo shoot transfer the pictures to your computer and delete them from your camera. Delete those few pictures that were technically very bad, otherwise save most of your picture and back them up on on a portable hard drive or online.






Edit your photos and look for ""gems"" within a photo. It is important to take a technically good photo and a camera with good resolution, so you can crop and develop those gems. Spend as much time and energy in editing as in composing pictures with your camera.





;
, In this photo the subject matter is the phone booth and the contrast between the colors emphasizes this. Through the initial composition, from choosing the best picture from the many pictures you took and from editing later (cropping, exposure, color adjustments etc), keep the subject matter the center of interest in the photo.

, To sharply contrast the subject matter, with the rest of the picture, use opposing colors. For example pink or red will stand out with green. Use the reactions, of the different colors, to people to tell your story.

,


Using the previous picture, the subject matter is the phone booth, there is a diagonal line that draws attention to the secondary subject matter - the figure walking in from the distance. If picture was taken later and the figure looming larger in the picture, the phone booth would no longer stand out.
In this DaVinci painting we first notice the eyes and dark halo, next we move down to the mouth and necklace, and after briefly noticing the ""v"" of her blouse we move to the very detailed, little background.

, A diagonal line implies action and makes the photo alive. In the photo with the car, a diagonal line is used and it goes from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. The diagonal line separates the black and white colors, goes through the model's left forearm and right foot. In the dance club photo, there are many diagonal lines.

, Seashores often have a C curve, so feature them in your photos. Look for C curves in the bodies of humans and animals in reclining positions, too. C curves are more relaxing to look at than a straight diagonal.

, S curves guides our eyes through the photo. In the DaVinci painting the little curving background to the subject's left also guides our eyes.

, However, the two photos, with the first symmetrical and the second asymmetrical, are great examples of an interesting photo and a boring photo. Symmetry is a western concept and asymmetry an Asian concept. Asian asymmetry is sometimes extreme. Western symmetry is not extreme and example would be in the DaVinci painting where the subject matter is not placed exactly in the center.

, Your point and shoot cameras may be able to do selective focus. Simplify, with some degree for error, through the viewfinder to minimize loss of clarity. Simplifying a photo is one of the main elements of composition and deserves an article in itself.


When you find a subject for some pictures, move around the subject to simplify your picture. Moving around also might give you new and interesting backgrounds and light interplays. With an SLR camera with selective areas of focus, to emphasize a certain part of the photo, make the other areas blurry by choosing the correct f-stop.
With point-and-shoot cameras, move around to avoid the distracting backgrounds and later do what you can with Windows Paint, Windows Live or some other photo editing program. An SLR camera has a threads at the end of the lens to put on a lens hood, buy a lens hood. With a point and shoot camera, shield the lens from the sun by using whatever items are available: an umbrella, a hat, any small shade, etc.

, Placing the model to the side is more interesting, but there has to be balance. The balance from this picture is the somewhat blank area that she is facing. This picture has too much orange, probably from incandescent lighting, and this could have been corrected with editing.

, For example, in the photo of the model with the red shirt and the car. The black (dark) tones to white tones have a ratio of about 2:1. Black and white provides the strongest contrast. With colors what you are trying to accomplish is interest, so have a variation of colors to make it interesting. An example of lack of contrast is the previous picture of the lady with the headset giving a talk - her skin tone and the wall color are the same. Lack of contrast is boring.

,


The golden mean is a ratio that is abundant in nature and is about .6. Following the golden mean, place your subject .6 or .4 horizontally and .6 or .4 vertically. The relationship between these numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 etc) is the golden mean and about .6. If you add two consecutive numbers, the sum will be the next number. However, if something looks good, do not measure and change it. The golden mean is a dominant concept, so there are other proportions in nature, i.e. no proportion is right or wrong. note: the ratio of the numbers, of the golden mean, are all between .6 - .62: 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, 13/21.
In the picture of the gulch, the golden mean ratio is observed horizontally and vertically.

, With a thin tree directly behind someone, it looks like the tree is growing out of his or her head. Even lines on a wall can be distracting if the lines come out of the subject's head or shoulder. This also applies to other subject matter: notice any distracting objects behind them. In the pebble beach photo, the stacked stones are directly below the horizon. A straight line is more interesting if there is a break in the line and in the example a lower camera angle would have made the stacked stones appear higher. Apply this awareness to other parts of the picture besides the subject matter. You can make a part of a photo interesting or not, based on how that part fits into the scheme of things. Furthermore, the stone is dark and would have made a nice silhouette in front of the light toned sky.

, If you do not have a good photo editing program, stand far away and crop it later to decrease the definition.

, Having them say ""cheese"" is not the best because a true smile has the wrinkles at the mouth and at the eyes. It is not possible to smile at the mouth and eyes together consciously (this interesting topic on smiling and laughing is from Wikipedia). Several things cause people smile or laugh: comfort, amusement, happiness, relief and anxiety. Smiling and laughter is also contagious, so the savvy photographer could select certain animated persons in the group to ""start the smile"". To make people smile or laugh is a great skill.

, Two heads are better than one. The subject will be able to fit in better with a background that the subject feels comfortable with. In the picture with the model crouching next to the Mercedes, the black, white and red makes a simple and powerful picture. Black, white and grey are neutral colors and red is a primary color that is warm and bold. However, your model probably does not know a fraction of what you know about composition and light, so persuade the model to consider your options.

, Later, further enhance the colors with an editing program. For examples of vibrant colors look beyond photographs and at the art of fine artists such as Gauguin and later Picasso. With a point and shoot camera, find a small shade to take your pictures from so the sunlight doesn't create unwanted streaks in your photo. If no shade is available, use your hat or a small umbrella to act as a lens hood. A photo does not have to represent reality exactly, colors can be manipulated to make the photo more appealing.

, When taking pictures outdoors, choose the day and time of the day for when the wind is minimal, so that the trees and other plants that you might use for a frame, will not be moving with the wind. If the frame you use is underexposed, try to correct it with a photo editing program or use a flash even during the day.

,, Use pattern as a theme for you composition. The overwhelming scene of a canopy of big trees at the base of a cliff is great, but what makes the picture more interesting is the light colored clearings. In the top clearing a lone tree is nicely silhouetted.

, For example, a seascape will have a C curve and a horizontal line. In the photo of the orange, pink and yellow flower there are several composition themes that were created: a contrast of colors for the main subject, a diagonal line which is dynamic, asymmetry, tight cropping and interesting background of great depth.

, The rules of composition are the same and are just general rules. Quantifying generally is about 70%, so tap into the other 30% and uncover some fantastic results. Think beyond the normal. Apply this to photo-editing also.


A photo is still interesting if it has a number of composition concepts, yet one of the concepts is not followed. For example, you have a great picture with many of the elements of composition used except that the horizon (the horizontal line) is exactly in the center. From the initial composing of the photo, and editing later, if you cannot move the horizontal line from the center, do not keep trying to alter it. A photographer is not like a fine artist and can manipulate a photo just so much.

Your camera or memory card to your computer the Windows XP Camera Wizard window should come up when you connect. If it doesn’t then you can bring it up separately by clicking on: Start -> Accessories -> Scanner and Camera Wizard.

, This next step allows you to choose which pictures you want to transfer. Also, the wizard allows you to rotate the pictures and also view picture details like the date when the picture was taken. This way you can determine how you will name your destination folder. Most of the times however, you would just move all the pictures into one folder on your computer without doing anything else…but if you want more information, the wizard gives your this ability.

, Now you have two fields you have to fill in.


The first one is entitled: Type a name for this group of pictures. The value that you enter here will be the final file name of each picture on your computer. For example: if you know that the pictures you're transferring were taken on June 21, 2012, and they were taken at Idora Park, set the group name to 070612-Idora-Park, and then each file will feature this name plus an index counter: 01,02, etc. This way you can also identify each picture by its name.






The second one is entitled: Choose a place to save this group of pictures. This is the place to specify your destination folder for these pictures. So you can click the browse button (the yellow folder) and choose the destination folder on your hard disk.







, Check your destination folder—all the pics should be there.

Use your ISO control to avoid camera shake for hand-held stills.",How to Use Your Digital Camera's ISO Setting," (Don't worry, this is going somewhere.) Keep the volume down on your computer or MP3 player and then turn up the volume on the amplifier. You'll notice that while your music gets louder, noise (usually a gentle hissing sound) gets louder as well.
This is not entirely dissimilar to the function of your ISO setting! Your digital camera's sensor only has one inherent sensitivity, which is its actual physical sensitivity to light hitting it. If a picture is too dark (as will happen with a too-slow shutter speed), then your digital camera can amplify the signal from the sensor, just as you can turn the volume up on your amplifier to make your music louder. The downside is, just as with your music, amplifying the signal also increases the amount of noise (grain) in your photographs.
So there is a trade-off: if you want faster shutter speeds, you'll have to increase your ISO (""turn up the volume""), at the cost of bringing out noise. We'll explore these trade-offs some more.;
, This is usually buried in the menus on compact cameras, and most digital SLRs have a dedicated button for the setting. Check your camera's manual if you can't find it for yourself.
Now see the various ISO settings you have available. Digital SLRs will usually start at 100 or 200 and go up to 1600 and beyond, compact cameras will have a much smaller range of values.

, Take a shot at each of your available ISO settings then look at them on a computer. Every camera will look different, but you'll find that the higher settings the image will either become noisier, softer (due to noise-reduction being applied in-camera), or both.
While looking at your shots, compare the amount of noise and see what shots you think are ISOs you will always be able to use, which you will use if the circumstances merit it, and which you'll try your best to avoid using. Only you can decide this; every camera is different and tastes differ wildly too.
, What you want to find out is which shutter speeds will get you perfectly sharp shots every time. Note your focal length, which is in millimeters. Shoot the same scene, but at a variety of shutter speeds, going down to half a second or thereabouts. Some people have very steady hands and technique and can shoot at very slow speeds, others less so.
Now, find the shot from the ones you took with the slowest shutter speed that gave sharp results, and then remember this number as a factor of your focal length. So if your lens was at 30mm and you could shoot sharp photographs hand-held at 1/15 second, then you'll need to increase your ISO if your shutter speed drops below half of your focal length of whatever lens you were using.
Remember: faster shutter speeds don't just freeze motion, they also reduce the likelihood of camera shake. A noisy but sharp image is much better than a noise-less image that has been blurred by camera shake.
, If this is the case, use the lowest setting you have. You only need to crank up your ISO if you need a faster shutter speed than would otherwise be available under the lighting conditions. This isn't important if your subject doesn't move and if there's no issues with camera shake from shooting hand-held.
, Unless you're using massive telephoto lenses, you'll have more than enough light to grab whatever shutter speed you need. Keep your ISO low and you'll be fine.
, We're talking subject motion and not camera shake here. This is mostly of concern to people shooting sports indoors or under dim light. A shutter speed of 1/250 will freeze most things, and 1/500 many more things, but the exact speeds for certain kinds of subjects will be learned by trial and error.
Keep an eye on your shutter speed: if it drops below the desired number, increase your ISO until you get a shutter speed fast enough to freeze that motion. Likewise, if your shutter speed goes much faster than you require, consider decreasing your ISO in order to get the cleanest shot possible.

, You hopefully made some tests earlier to figure out at which speeds you are able to hand-hold a lens of a certain focal length (if not, make some now!). Once again, noisy sharp shots are better than blurry clean shots, so don't hesitate to crank up your ISO to get whatever shutter speed you need.

Add speed.",How to Kickflip on a Tech Deck," Many tricks begin with the index finger placed right behind the front wheels and the middle finger slightly behind the back wheels. Become comfortable with your fingers in this position as it will be the standard finger position for most tricks, such as the Ollie, Kickflip, Heelflip and Impossible.;
, This will be the direction that you will go to do the kickflip. Roll the board back and forth at different speeds. Go slowly at first so that you can get comfortable with the board's movement. Ideally, you want some speed in order to get your board into the air but first you need to make sure your fingers have a good control of the board when it's in motion.

, As you roll the board, press down with your middle finger on the tail to hit it against the table. This brings the nose of the board into the air. Continue to roll the board back and forth but now practice adding the pop. Keep practicing these basic movements at a slower speed and gradually get faster. You want these first steps to be fluid so that you can concentrate next on flipping the board., The board should be a few inches off of the table so that there is room for the board to rotate. These inches of air will give you time and space to complete the flip. With each practice run, bring your hand a little higher each time to pull the board up higher into the air. , As your board moves through the air to the left your index finger will also move to the left. You want to transition smoothly with your index finger because a harsh flick can cause you to lose control of the board. Also, aim your finger toward the pocket of the nose. The ""pockets"" of the nose and tail are the indentations on the board where it begins to bend upwards. Aiming for this spot every time you practice a kickflip will help you become more consistent and accurate.

, This slight pressure with your index finger on the edge of the board will cause it to twist toward you while in the air. This is the key step to completing the kickflip. The slight pressure from your index finger is what controls the rotation of the board. If you flick too hard the board will spin out of control and if you're touch is too light then the board will not flip at all., After the board rotates, place both fingers on the board to stop its rotation mid-air. Focus on the board itself so that you can land your fingers on the top of the deck. You can either let the board rotate once and then catch it or you can master flipping the board several times within the kickflip for a more impressive trick., You don't have to let gravity bring the board back to the table. In fact, you want to use your fingers to direct the board back down rather than letting it drop. This requires more practice but will keep you in control of the board from start to finish.

, You'll want to get into the habit of following through with your tricks. Don't just stop short after completing the trick but keep the board moving afterwards. This will train you to be able to link tricks one after another so that you have an impressive repertoire of fingerboard moves.

, Trying to blow through the steps at the beginning might cause you to lose control of the board. Take the time to pace yourself. Going slowly at first will help you develop good technique with the board.

, The best way to become good at something is to build muscle memory. This will require you to spend time doing the same thing over and over. However, practicing the same thing over and over is athletes and skilled musicians become professionals, and you can apply this technique to your fingerboarding skills. Practicing over and over will also help you develop good habits for this trick rather than sloppy habits., Now that you are comfortable going slowly, you can gradually go faster and faster with the kickflip. It's best to practice going a little faster each time you try the trick rather than going fast right away. Your fingers will become used to going faster this way and you will be more accurate doing a kickflip at any speed.

",How to Make a Paper Fingerboard," Most of these can be found in any arts and crafts or hardware store .;
, You can do this by tracing the outline of a band-aid on index cards or other thick paper.


Using a pencil can help if you have an unsteady hand as you want the tracing to be as close to the original shape of the band-aid as possible.

, Use a pair of scissors to cut along the penciled outline you have made. This first cutout will serve as a template.

, Draw six more band-aid shaped pieces using your template. Making six layers will ensure that your fingerboard is sturdy and durable.

, Try to make the pieces as uniform as possible.

, Use a glue stick or brush and spread the glue evenly on one side of each cutout.


Don’t be afraid to use a lot of glue as you want your fingerboard to be as sturdy as possible.

, Layer them together carefully, making sure they align as much as possible and use your fingers to apply pressure and smooth out any uneven spots or air pockets.

, The easiest and most reliable way to do this is by using two fingerboards as a mold. Otherwise, you can shape it using your hands.


If you already have two fingerboards, you can sandwich your fingerboards between them and apply pressure for ten minutes. Alternatively, you can tie a rubber band tightly around the three stacked fingerboards and leave it to set.
If you do not have any fingerboards, turn up the ends of your paper fingerboard using your hands to create the skateboard-like shape desired. Continue applying pressure with your fingers to make sure the ends stay curved up as the glue sets.

, Allow your fingerboard to dry for at least twenty minutes or until it feels stiff.

, You will use these holes to thread through the screws to attach the trucks onto your fingerboard.


Use a nail, thumbtack, or other pointed object to punch four holes in two rows on either end of the fingerboard, totaling eight holes. Begin by aligning the trucks with each other on the bottom end of your fingerboard and marking where the four screw holes are located on each truck with a pen. Then punch through the markings with your sharp object of choice.

, You can buy griptape or make your own by cutting a small strip of sandpaper.


Griptape is the friction tape on top of the deck that allows you to control and do neat tricks with your fingerboard. It’s not essential but will help upgrade your fingerboard to a functional object.
You can estimate what size sandpaper to cut out by comparing it to your board. You want a rectangular strip that covers most of the board but doesn’t stick over the sides.

, Get creative with colored markers, spray paint, or tape to make your fingerboard truly one of a kind.

, This final step will make your fingerboard fully functional. Because these parts are very small, it is best to invest in some tech deck tools, which are easily found online or in skate shops and toy stores .


Using a tech deck screwdriver or your fingers, push the screws into the holes through the top of the fingerboard. Repeat the process until you have eight screws in your board, then flip your fingerboard over and place the trucks on top of the screws. Keeping the trucks placed over the screws, flip the fingerboard on its side and continue tightening the screws until the trucks are firmly attached.

From there, you can print the image or use a computer program to draw the grid lines over top of it. To make the grid lines, use a pencil and a ruler to divide the paper into 3 rows and 4 columns of equal size.;
, Take your 24x36 drawing paper and use a pencil and a ruler to divide it into a grid of 3 rows and 4 columns, just like you did with the original image. This should result in 8x8 squares. When doing this, don't press down on the pencil too hard - keep the lines very light so that you can easily erase them later.

, Work one grid at a time - look at one of the grids on your original image, and sketch what is inside that grid onto your drawing paper. Again, keep the pencil light so that the pencil marks won't show through the pastels later. Start with the outlines first so that you can make sure that everything connects well throughout the grid - for example, begin with the outline of the woman's body, then move to the windowsill and panes, and then the outline of the girl's body. From there you can move on to details such as clothing, hairlines, faces, etc.

, Once you've transferred the image onto your drawing paper, take a small eraser and erase the grid lines, making sure not to erase your actual sketch. From there you can begin to color in the sketch using oil pastels. Begin with the larger blocks of color - for example, the red wall, the woman's green dress, the girl's red dress, and the green grass in the background.

, When the large blocks of color are finished, use different colored pastels to show the texture in the painting - for example, use darker and lighter shades of red to capture the folds in the girl's dress, and a darker brown pastel to emphasize the shading on the outline of the chair. If your package of pastels doesn't have all the variation of color needed, you can use a paper towel to smear different colors and help blend them together on your drawing paper.

, Once the larger areas have been colored in and shaded, finish off your artwork by coloring the smaller details using your pastels. Start with the trees in the background, and once you've developed some finesse with the pastels, move on to fine details such as the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and lips of the woman and the girl.

,, Make a habit of laying them out in the same order every time. Eventually, you will instinctively know where each color is.This is especially handy if you're painting on location.

, For example: use 1/8 cup of poppy seed oil and 1/4 cup of sunflower oil.

,, Mixing it with turpentine, rather than the oil, will allow it to dry faster. For the first sketch, you will need the thinned paint to dry quickly.


Raw Sienna is a great neutral color to start with and will cover easily.
Don't mix it too thin, but thin enough so that the paint flows smoothly and is transparent.

, Make sure your horizon line is correctly indicated at 1/3 or 2/3 of the way down on the canvas, depending on how much sky is in your photo.

, Use the oil mixture to mix your paints with.


To begin with, your paints are going to be fairly thin and transparent. With each subsequent layer, the paint should be thicker and the oil mixture less. In this way you will be painting fat over lean. This is very important as the first layers of paint will absorb the oil from the layers on top of them. If the top layers dry faster than the lower layers, the painting will crack.,


If there is a lot of color in your sky, just block in the main color.

,, When taking a break, make sure youclean your brushes properly and take care of your paints by covering your palette and capping the oil tightly.

,


When anything recedes into the distance, there is atmosphere between you and that object. Therefore, there will be less detail and less color saturation in your distant objects (such as mountain and trees).
The darkest shadows will be in the foreground. Many people tend to think that the darkest shadows are in the distance. However, if you gaze carefully at any landscape you will see that because of the atmosphere, the shadows are muted compared to the shadows in the foreground.
Remember the rule of thirds. It is a compositional rule that not only helps you place your scene correctly on the canvas, but it also helps you develop a nicely balanced painting.Common among photographers, but also an essential for artists.

The main command dial is on the rear of the camera, on the top right.


 The main command dial.


The secondary command dial is on the front of the camera, right in front of the shutter button. (The very cheapest cameras omit this.)


 The secondary command dial, indicated, is on the front of the camera, near the power switch and shutter button.


The multi selector on the rear switches between auto-focus points (which we'll get to later). You also use this to navigate the camera's menus.


 The multi-selector on a Nikon D200.



, By default, your camera might be set up for single-frame shooting, which meaning that you get one shot (and only one shot) for each press of the shutter button. You don't want this. Continuous shooting will let your camera shoot at its fastest frame rate for as long as you hold the shutter button. Doing this is more-or-less free on digital cameras, and even if you're not shooting things that move quickly (for which continuous shooting is mandatory), there's a good reason to use this: it results in sharper photos. Shooting a sequence of two or three shots rather than a single one means that it's more likely that one of them will be sharp, whereas if you take just one you might get unlucky. You're also less likely to get camera shake directly caused by you jabbing the shutter button repeatedly.
Don't worry about this shortening your shutter life; many Nikon SLRs are still working after hundreds of thousands of shutter actuations.High end cameras: you have a dedicated dial for this on the top-left of the camera, with a C position, which is what you want. Push the button next to the dial to unlock it and turn the dial. Your camera might have a Ch and Cl position; this is continuous/high-speed and continuous/low-speed. This is more or less self-explanatory, so pick the one that works best for you.


 Drive mode dial on a D2H set to Ch (Continuous/High speed).



Mid-range cameras: hold down the drive mode button and spin the main command dial. Look at the top LCD and wait until you see the three rectangles (rather than a single-rectangle, or a timer icon) indicating that continuous shooting is on.


 The drive mode button on a Nikon D70.


Entry-level cameras: you'll have to dig through the menus to find this. You're on your own here, because this differs from camera to camera.

, If you're shooting in low light, or if you don't have very steady hands, this will ensure that you can get sharp shots without camera shake in all but the most unfavourable lighting. You'll need to turn this off only if you're shooting from a tripod (and the whole point of VR is that you don't need to use a tripod in most conditions)., An explanation of this is beyond the scope of this article; it's enough to say that matrix metering is very clever and works well enough most of the time under most conditions. On high-end cameras, you have a dedicated switch for this. On mid-range cameras, hold down the button while turning the main command wheel until the matrix metering symbol is displayed. Again, on the cheaper ones, you're going to have to dig through the menus to find it (though you may be able to skip this; they probably use the matrix meter by default).
, In this mode, the camera will focus continuously for as long as you half-press your shutter button, and can predict subject movement, too. It's fine for still subjects as well.
(You don't need to worry too much about the other focus modes. Single-servo (S) is useless for photographing anything that moves, because it locks focus as soon as it is achieved. And manual focusing is almost never necessary; it's rare for the camera to get so upset that it won't be able to focus at all, and in the very rare cases that it does, that will mean that you won't get focus confirmation in the viewfinder, either.)


On all cameras: if you have an A-M switch (or A/M-M, A/M meaning autofocus with immediate manual override), set this to A, or A/M.


 Set your lens to A, or M/A, if you have one of these switches.



On high end cameras: there's a focus mode switch on the front of the camera on the right (if you're looking at it from the front) of the lens mount, with three positions: C, S, and M. Set this to ""C"".


 The C-S-M switch on a higher-end camera; set this to ""C"".



On all other cameras: you might have a similar switch in the same place, with AF (autofocus) and M (manual focus) positions. Set this to ""AF"", if you have it. You'll have to dig through your menus (again, different from camera to camera) in order to find the setting for continuous-servo AF.


 If you have an AF-M switch, switch to AF, then dig through the menus to find the setting for continuous-servo AF.



, Like all film and digital SLR cameras, your camera will go to sleep when it is not used, and it will consume almost no battery power at all when it is turned-on-but-asleep. Having to turn your camera on when something happens is a sure way to miss shots, potentially great ones., This is beyond the scope of this article, but the basics of getting great photos are covered in How to Develop Your Photography Skills., The whole point of an SLR is to use the instant optical reflex viewfinder (the ""SLR"" in ""digital SLR""), rather than the slow LCD of a point-and-shoot. What's more, this means ditching the intelligent, fast phase-detection autofocus that Nikon have perfected over two decades and replacing it with a slow, inaccurate contrast-detection autofocus system from a cheap camcorder. If you're not sure you want guaranteed missed shots and/or poor focus, use the viewfinder rather than the LCD., If your camera has a ""MODE"" button, you change the exposure mode by holding this down and spinning the main command dial until the desired mode appears in your top LCD and in your viewfinder. Other (cheaper) cameras will have a big friendly mode dial on the top of the camera to the left of the viewfinder. The basic modes are the same on all cameras, and there are only three that you should care about:


Programmed automatic (P). This will select both an aperture and shutter speed for you. Most of the time, and especially in normal lighting, this is the mode you want to use. Yes, it's a fully-automatic mode and you've been told that this will hinder your creativity. This is nonsense on stilts, especially given that you can shift the program using the main command dial on the rear of the camera. So if the camera picks a shutter speed of 1/125 at an aperture of f/5.6, you can shift this to 1/80 at f/7.1, or 1/200 at f/4.2, etc etc, right up to the limitations of your aperture and shutter.


 Programmed automatic, as used in this shot, works for most shots most of the time.



Aperture priority (A). This will allow you to select an aperture for the lens (you usually do this by turning the secondary command dial on the front of the camera; if you don't have one of these, use the main command dial on the rear), and the camera will select a shutter speed for a correct exposure. The primary reason to use this is for control over your depth of field. Large apertures (smaller numbers, like f/1.8) will give you a shallower depth of field (less of your photo in focusand faster shutter speeds, useful for blurring the background of a portrait, for example. Smaller apertures (larger numbers, such as f/16) will give you more depth of field, and also force longer shutter speeds.


 Aperture priority mode is useful to force a shallow depth of field, and to throw the background far out of focus (or the complete opposite). This was shot on a 55-200mm VR, at 200mm, with an aperture of f/5.6.


Shutter priority (S) will allow you to set a shutter speed with the main command dial (which will appear in your viewfinder) and the camera will choose an aperture on the lens to match. Use this if you want to freeze motion (like sports, or anything else that moves), or if you're using a telephoto lens that mandates using a faster shutter speed to avoid camera shake.
The rest. On the entry-level and mid-range cameras, the mode dial has an ""Auto"" position. Don't use this; it's much like programmed automatic, but inflexible (you can't shift the program, for example) and ruder (it pops the flash without asking). The various ""scene modes"" on the cheaper cameras should be ignored for the same reason. If you want to party like it's 1976, there's also a fully manual (M) mode on all cameras; there's almost no reason to ever use this., This is more important than any other setting on your camera. The human eye automatically compensates for different kinds of lighting; white looks white to us in almost any kind of lighting, whether that's in the shade (in which case it's slightly bluer), or under incandescent lighting (where it's shifted towards orange), or under some weird artificial light sources (which can change several times a second!). A digital camera sees colours as they really are, and the white balance setting shifts the colours so that they look natural in the finished photo.On most cameras you have a ""WB"" button; hold this down while spinning the main command dial. These are the settings you care about:


Cloudy and shade, marked with a cloud symbol and a picture of a house casting a shadow respectively, are where you want to be most of the time when you are outdoors, even when under direct sunlight. ""Shade"" is slightly warmer than ""cloudy""; experiment with this to find the one that's right for you.


 Even in sunlight, shade (used here) white balance can be used to warm your scene nicely. (Nikon D2H and 50mm f/1.8D wide-open.)



Auto, marked with an A, will attempt to set the white balance automatically. This sometimes results in colours that are too cool; as it has been said, ""engineers are interested in copying color test charts, not making a good photo"".On the other hand, this might be a good option for shooting under really weird artificial lighting like mercury vapour lamps, or under mixed lighting sources. Newer cameras do a much better job of guessing this than older ones.

Daylight, marked with a sun symbol, is supposed to be best for direct sunlight. Again, the colours sometimes come out a bit too cool.

Tungsten and fluorescent, marked with a light bulb and a fluorescent strip-light respectively, are for shooting under artificial lighting indoors. This can be safely ignored for real photography; indoor lighting is boring and you should be outside shooting things. On the other hand, you can use these outdoors to great effect; for example, you can use tungsten to make skies turn blue.


 Tungsten white balance is meant to balance out incandescent lighting, but it can also be used towards artistic ends. (Nikon D2H and cheap 18-55mm lens.)



, If you want better than boring washed-out party snapshots, don't get stuck with indoor lighting that forces you to nuke your subject with direct flash. Get outside, where the fun light happens. On the other hand, Nikon's excellent flash system (and the insanely fast 1/500 flash sync on older cameras) is great for filling shadows in bright outdoor lighting, to avoid (for example) dark shadows under eyes in daylight., The ISO is a measure of the sensor's sensitivity to light; lower ISOs mean less sensitivity to light, giving less noise but slower shutter speeds (making camera shake more likely), and higher ISOs do the opposite. If you're shooting in bright daylight, leave this at the slowest speed (usually 200, and sometimes 100).
Otherwise, there's a quick and easy way to work out what your ISO should be. Take the focal length of your lens (e.g. 200mm), and multiply it by 1.5 (on all cameras but the D3, D4, D600, D700 and D800, giving you 300 in our example). If you're using a VR lens (you should) and have VR turned on (you should), divide this figure by four (e.g. 75). As a general rule, you want to choose a shutter speed at least as fast as your resulting number (e.g. roughly 1/80th of a second, or 1/300th without VR). Kick up your ISO until you're able to shoot at shutter speeds at least this fast.
On most cameras, you can change the ISO by holding down the ISO button and turning the main command dial; the LCD (or one of them) will show you your ISO as it changes. You're still left to dig through the menus to find an ISO setting on the D3000, the D40, and friends., Hopefully, you'll get lucky, and the camera will pick the right focus point (the little rectangles dotted around your viewfinder) and lock on to the right thing. When the camera is in focus, a small, green confirmation dot will appear in the bottom left of your viewfinder. However, there's a few scenarios in which that doesn't hold true.


Off-centre subjects. Depending on how far off-centre, and on your camera, it might pick the wrong focus point. If this is so, centre your subject in your frame, focus, then hold down your AE-L/AF-L button as you recompose the shot and shoot. (A trick: use this on portrait shots. Focus on the eyes, lock, then recompose.)


 The autofocus lock button will allow you to centre something in the frame, focus, and then recompose while you hold it.



Subjects with something closer to them than the subject. On all cameras some of the time, the camera will try to focus on the closest thing to the camera. Handy, but that's not what you want all the time. You'll have to set your camera to single-area AF (not to be confused with single-servo AF), which will allow you to pick a single focus point rather than letting the camera guess one for you.
To set this on most cameras, you'll have to dig through the camera's two thousand menu options for autofocus setup (though you get a dedicated button for this on the high-end cameras; switch this to the single, small rectangle). Once you've done this, you can use the multi-selector on the rear to pick an autofocus point.


 In this shot, there was a branch closer to the camera than the subject (the white blurred area at the bottom of the shot); to prevent the autofocus locking on to this, a single autofocus area was manually selected. (Nikon D2H + 55-200mm VR.)


Really low light. You'll have to manually focus. Set your lens to M (or the switch on your camera, if you're using a traditional screw-type AF or AF-D lens). Grab the focus ring and turn it. Of course, if your camera is hung up and can't focus, then you probably won't have much better luck telling whether you're in focus or not. If your lens has a distance scale you can guess the distance and set it on your lens, and pretend you're shooting a Voigtlander Vito B from 1954.
Some combinations of camera and lens when zoomed all the way in just don't like each other and refuse to find focus in any situation. The D300 and 55-200mm VR lens do this sometimes.If this happens to you, zoom your lens out, focus on your subject and zoom back in again once it finds focus.

, Actually, take two or three; hold down the shutter button (you did set your camera to continuous shooting, right?). That way if, by some stroke of bad luck, one of your shots isn't sharp because of camera shake, at least one of them is likely to be sharp, even if you're at a shutter speed that's too slow for your lens' focal length., Look for areas that are blown out to pure white which shouldn't be blown out to pure white, and look for areas that are way too dark, and then...
, This is the button marked +/- next to your shutter button, and is the other absolutely critical adjustment on digital cameras. While Nikon's matrix meter is smart, it won't get exposure absolutely perfect all of the time, and isn't a substitute for artistic judgment. Exposure compensation simply forces the camera to over- or under-expose by a given amount.
To set exposure compensation, hold the exposure compensation button down while turning the main command dial; either to the right to underexpose (darker), or to the left to overexpose (lighter). If in doubt, underexpose it. Blown highlights on digital can never be recovered short of painting them back in by hand, but you can recover from all but the most terminal under-exposure (at the cost of bringing out more noise, which isn't that important).
, You might have to adjust exposure compensation and white balance from shot-to-shot as the lighting changes, so regularly review your images on your LCD., Learn to do some very basic post-processing in image editing tools like the GIMP or Photoshop, such as sharpening, adjusting contrast and colour balance, and so on. Don't rely on post-processing tricks to make your photos interesting."

Remember that human sight can perceive a much wider range of light intensities than a digital camera sensor (which is referred to as the camera's dynamic range). We can look through a window and still see what is inside at the same time, even though the light conditions inside are totally different from these outdoors. Cameras, and especially digital cameras, cannot. So on camera, you will only see what's outside through the window or what's inside. Consider this when picking your subject.;
, If you have a tripod, use one; if you have a solid surface to rest on, then do so. Not that a tripod is as necessary as many people say it is; but to observe the effects of various camera settings, it's best if you get several shots of exactly the same thing. Tripods really come in handy for slower shutter speeds. Most pictures go bad because of a camera shake. Though as mentioned above, if your lens has an automatic stabiliser, use it....

, On some cameras, there is also an auto-ISO (sensitivity) mode to set separately in order for the camera to choose that automatically. Some cameras or lenses have a switch to choose among manual focus and one or more auto-focus modes. Generally you will want auto-focus, with the mode that checks for perfect focus before taking a picture (generally ""single shot""). Manual focus is helpful for low light and other conditions where the auto-focus gets confused; ""continuous""/""tracking""/""AI Servo"" auto-focus mode, which follows (what it thinks is) the subject continually as the shutter button is partly depressed to reduce delay before clicking all the way is best for sports and other fast-moving subjects.

, This will be the first camera setting that you will experiment with. You can set this in the camera's menus; many cameras will allow you to change this with a couple of button presses, too. The ISO speed is a measure of your camera's sensor's sensitivity to light; a lower number is less sensitive, and a higher number is more sensitive. Take a photo of your subject at its lowest ISO speed (or ""slowest"", typically 50, 100 or 200), and then take one at its highest (800, 1600 or more). Observe the following:



The photo taken with the slower ISO speed will have forced the camera to use a slower shutter speed (which we'll get to later on), while the photo taken with the faster ISO speed will have used a faster shutter speed. The difference between the two may have been significant enough to be audible. Being able to use a faster shutter speed means that you can, for example, freeze motion (and also avoid camera shake) in poorer light than you could with a slower one.
The photo taken with the slower ISO speed will have less noise (random discoloured pixels) than the one taken with a faster ISO speed (although digital SLRs, owing to their larger sensors, have much better high-ISO performance than small point-and-shoot digital cameras do). Hence, you're left with a trade-off between image quality and usability in low-light conditions. At a concert, for example, a higher ISO speed may well be more appropriate; in bright daylight, or when you're using a tripod and--even better but not critical--a remote release too, lower ISO speeds may be more appropriate.
Use the minimum ISO speed that allows an adequate shutter speed (generally 1/focal length for handheld pictures, one or two stops slower with image stabilization, faster such as 1/250 for action or sports) and an adequately small aperture to have all important detail elements (such as people) within the depth of field. This will often be a pretty high ISO. No matter -- a few discolored pixels here and there is much, much better than pervasive defocus or motion blur smearing the image or large parts of it across many, many pixels. Some cameras can automatically pick a reasonable ISO.

, We'll get around to exactly what this means in a second. For Canon, it's called ""Av"" (for Aperture value) on your mode dial. For Nikon, it's called ""A"".

, This might be a dial on your lens with a series of numbers on it (which will typically fall anywhere between around 1.4 and 22 on most lenses); otherwise, refer to your camera's instructions. The diaphragm is just that: an opening towards the front of your lens that lets more or less light onto the sensor. The size of the diaphragm is expressed as a ratio of focal length to aperture size (hence, they are referred to as, for example, f/5.6); consequently, a smaller aperture (less light onto your sensor) is expressed by a larger number. So, take two photographs, one with a larger aperture, and then stop down and take one with a smaller aperture. Observe:



The background of your subject is less sharp with a larger aperture than it is with the smaller one. This is called the depth of field. So, if you want to make a subject stand out from the background, use a large aperture to blur the background; if you need to get more of your scene in focus, use a smaller aperture. Some lenses have pairs of lines that will fit around different distances on their focusing scales to show what range will be fairly sharp at a given aperture. (The area outside of that range will be more blurred the further outside it is, but less blurred at small apertures than at large ones.) Because defocus depends on the angle at which light rays diverge from the object to enter the lens, it increases more rapidly the closer something is to the lens -- focusing on something, say, twenty feet away with a typical lens will put objects from several feet away to infinity more or less in focus, while focusing on something one foot away will put only that which is very close to one foot away in focus.





The smaller aperture lets less light onto the sensor than the larger one would have, forcing the camera to compensate for this by using a slower shutter speed. This is what ""aperture priority"" exposure control is about. In automatic mode, the camera will adjust either the aperture or the shutter speed to get the right amount of light onto the sensor; Av mode forces the aperture to take priority and the camera will only adjust the shutter speed. However, this means you won't see the effect of the changed aperture in Av mode on overall exposure, because the camera would have automatically compensated for it. So try setting your camera into fully manual mode (M) to see the effect of the aperture on light.
Hence, there is a trade-off between depth of field and low-light performance. You can either have a wide open aperture, which will give you little depth of field but plenty of light onto the sensor, or a smaller one, which will do the opposite. There are also problems with diffraction effects stealing sharpness at very small apertures; as a general rule, don't use one smaller (remember: larger number!) than f/8 or f/11 unless extreme depth of field is really needed., This will tell the camera to give up all control of trying to expose your picture properly. Most of the time, you will not need to use this (and shouldn't; exposure control exists for a reason). But we'll need to do this if we're going to show the effects of shutter speed.

, See your manual for the exact details of how to do this. Shutter speeds are numbers which go up in a sequence that roughly doubles each time, and normally expressed as a fraction of a second; i.e. 1 second, 1/2, 1/4, 1/16, 1/25, and so on (each one usually being called a ""stop""). Take two pictures at shutter speeds a couple of stops apart. Observe:


The photo with the fast shutter speed will be darker. This can either be a good or bad thing, depending on lighting conditions.
The photo at the slower shutter speed might show some motion blur if you were holding it by hand. Even if you're setting your camera on a tripod, at very slow shutter speeds (of half a second or more, such as one would use at night), you might see some blur because of camera shake.
Hence, in very dark conditions, you will need to use a slower shutter speed; but such slow shutter speeds can cause motion blur. In brighter conditions, you will need to use a faster shutter speed, which will have the effect of freezing motion. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. If you need to get a longer exposure during the daytime, use an ND filter.

, Think about it in terms of light; you can adjust either your aperture, ISO speed, or shutter speed to compensate for various strengths of light. Adjusting either of them will have effects on your image, for better or for worse. Memorise these effects, and for a time, think about these things while you are taking photographs, until they become second nature.

, It's nice to know the above things, and in time you'll learn when to use each of time. Most of the time, Program mode will be sufficient.

, If you don't, the chances are good that you have a zoom. Either is fine. Fixed lenses of different sizes have different focal lengths; zoom lenses have a variable focal length. The focal length is the distance in mm between your lens elements (the glass inside) and your film/sensor. The perspective you get is completely different for each focal length.


The standard 50mm lens is more or less equal to the sharp central field of view of human sight, if they are paired with 35mm film or a full-frame sensor. However, be aware that most digital SLR sensors are smaller than regular 35mm film. Therefore, your effective focal lengths are multiplied by about 1.5 on most digital SLRs (this is called ""FOV cropping""). Most of Canon's sensors have a 1.6 crop factor. Most Nikon DSLRs have a 1.5 crop factor.
Wide-angle lenses, like a 28mm, lets you fit a lot of the scene onto your sensor. It has a wide view. It also creates the impression that you are looking at your object from a distance. It therefore is good for taking pictures of small rooms (makes these look bigger), landscapes, etc. Things near the edge of the frame will appear stretched. This is interesting for buildings, but weird for people. Wide-angle lenses make the subject look big only when it is very close to the lens, but still take in a wide area of background. When the general background, such as a sweeping view, is interesting, a wide angle lens is good. When a small part of it, such as a colorful sunset near the horizon, is interesting, a telephoto lens and moving back is good.
The telephoto lens, like 80mm or longer, will bring things closer to you. Therefore, this is used for portraits (because it forces you to be further away from the subject; the perspective at longer distances makes noses appear smaller), and wildlife photography. However, bear in mind what was said about apertures earlier; for a long telephoto lens to let in the same amount of light as a smaller lens, it has to be a lot larger. An extreme 200-500mm f/2.8 zoom lens, for example, weighs nearly 35 pounds, and is still nearly twice as slow as the 50mm lenses of 30 years ago.Short of these kinds of extremely expensive lenses, most consumer grade telephoto lenses tend to be slow (i.e. its aperture in relation to the focal length will be relatively small compared to that of a smaller lens), forcing you to use longer shutter speeds if it is in a low-light situation. This can be compensated for by using faster ISO speeds, as described above; this is a trade-off you have to make. (Wide aperture lenses require a lot more money and have a lot more weight; it's often actually better to get the cheap ones that will be taken out and used even if that involves a little more noise from a high ISO setting. The cheap ones are basically just as good at apertures such as 5.6 and smaller which are usually desirable for significant depth of field. For shallow depth of field, one can use an expensive very-wide-aperture lens, or simply use a longer-focus moderate-aperture lens and move back until the subject is the same size.)

, Some cameras can automatically alter the images to compensate. If yours doesn't, try to avoid placing long straight lines close to parallel to the edges of the frame where this is likely to be a problem.

, Now that you have a better understanding of how your camera works, and how to use it in situations that your camera cannot do automatically, you need to get outside and start using it.

, SLRs generally can automatically control output of their internal flash, or an external flash with much higher maximum power, to provide even light across a subject. Use a flash at reduced power (applying negative ""flash exposure compensation"") in sunlight to soften but not eliminate shape-defining shadows. Use a flash in dim light to light the scene. Bouncing a flash off the ceiling (with an external unit with a hinged head) will softly light a large area. A flash is very brief so the part of an exposure coming from it is basically determined by aperture and ISO setting, not shutter speed (which is generally limited to 1/250 or slower due to the way a ""focal plane"" shutter common in DSLRs works). A slower shutter speed makes the scene's ambient light more conspicuous but don't use such a slow shutter speed that the ambient light can blur the scene due to camera shake or subject movement over a long exposure.

, Rotate it in its mount for maximum effect. Cheap ones can be fine, but check that they are coated (or multi-coated) to reduce reflection spots in the image and that the threads are not poorly cut, which could damage the threads in the lens--particularly if the filter threads in the lens are plastic.

, One part of the camera's processing of the raw image data is to adjust the colors so that the brightest, fully reflective, objects appear white rather than the true yellowish or bluish colors of light they reflect under incandescent light or open sky (and everything else appears to have the mix of colors it would under the sunlight our eyes are calibrated for). That is what the White Balance (WB) setting does. Automatic white balance (AWB) often doesn't work well; a setting for the kind of light most prevalent in the scene such as sunlight (flash and shade are about the same as it), incandescent, or fluorescent light helps. Some cameras can calibrate themselves to any color of light by first directing you to photograph a known white surface under that light; precisely how to do this is a more advanced subject.

This will reveal the slot where you should insert your film cartridge. Put the cartridge in the slot with the dark side facing up and the metal contacts facing down, then close the flap.If your Polaroid camera has an old cartridge that you’d like to preserve, remove the film in a completely dark room and place the cartridge in a container that protects it from any light exposure.;
, Immediately after you’ve loaded your film, a dark slide should emerge from your camera. This indicates that the camera is working properly and is ready for use!If a dark slide does not come out of the camera, it likely means that there’s a problem with your film or camera. If you’ve purchased new film, you might have a problem with the camera itself. Test with another cartridge to determine the problem.
You may want to save this dark slide, as you can use it as a cover to protect your photos during their exposure time after they emerge from the camera.

, These cameras require you to wake them up before use. Examine your model to determine whether you’ll need to open and close your flashbar or flip it up. These cameras turn off quickly, so simply repeat the process whenever you’re ready to take a picture.If you can’t see your flashbar on a 600-series Polaroid OneStep camera, that means you have a model that requires you to flip it up.
Polaroid SX-70 Land cameras do not have an on/off button. These cameras are ready to use as soon as your film is loaded., A camera’s exposure refers to the camera and film’s sensitivity to light, which will then be captured in the image. Most OneStep models include a small slider that increases or decreases the amount of light the camera will let in. Experiment with multiple shots at different exposure levels to see what produces the best results for your film and camera.If you’re shooting with Impossible Project SX-70 film, move the switch toward the darker side. This film has higher light sensitivity, which will make images appear over-exposed if the switch remains in the middle of the slider., Because OneStep cameras contain fixed-focus lenses, they use distance, or depth of field, to focus on their subjects. They don’t contain the electronics necessary for autofocus. Provide enough distance between yourself and your chosen subject to allow the camera to produce a sharp image.You may need to experiment with distance when taking photographs with Polaroid cameras. Some models may produce better images at a distance of about 10 feet (3.04 m). Some models may not work at distances above 10 feet (3.04 m), so be patient and get ready to test out your camera.
Some models may include a closeup setting that is supposed to allow you take pictures of subjects located under 4 feet (1.22 m) away from you. Unfortunately, these settings generally don’t work very well. Ignore them, and adhere to the 4-foot (1.22-m) rule., Unlike most modern cameras, the viewfinder doesn’t allow you to see through the camera’s lens. Since the viewfinder doesn’t provide you with a perfect replica of what the image will be, give yourself plenty of room on either side of your chosen subject when framing your shot., Once you’re ready to go, taking a picture with a Polaroid OneStep is about as easy as it gets. No need for adjustments. Just push down your button, take the picture, and get ready to view your handiwork!, When your pictures pop out of your camera, keep them from getting exposed to light. You can either immediately place them in a pocket or light-safe container, or cover them with a piece of paper. This will ensure that the chemical process necessary for development works properly., Keep your photos face-down or shielded from light the entire time they’re developing. While some old Polaroid film may be ready within 90 seconds, it’s safer to wait longer. If you’re using the Impossible Project’s new film, be especially cautious. You’d rather have a properly developed picture after a half-hour than a dud after five minutes.The Impossible Project recommends waiting 10 minutes for black-and-white film and 30 for color film., Polaroid cameras respond well to lots of natural light. They do best with outdoor shots taken on either sunny or slightly overcast days. When you’re starting out, try taking landscape shots first. This will allow you to get comfortable with your camera., This new film does best in temperate temperatures between about 55℉ (13℃) and 82℉ (28℃). Cold weather may lead to overexposed prints that don’t contain color contrast, while hot days could give you pictures with a red or yellow tint. To shoot at higher or lower temperatures, either heat up the film by placing it in a pocket and using your body heat or cool it down by putting in the refrigerator before taking your photos., SX-70 film generally isn’t light-sensitive enough to produce good indoor pictures. Because Polaroid cameras need so much light to give you clear images, it’s important to choose a camera that’s compatible with more light-sensitive film., Use the built-in flash on your camera. While the flash may produce harsh lighting in some of your pictures, it’s important to start with the flash in order to see how best to lighten up your indoor pictures.If you can, shoot in a room with plenty of windows to benefit from natural light even when indoors.

, Most older Polaroid cameras are designed for the flash to be in use at all times, so it’s often difficult or impossible to manually shut it off. If you want to see what turning off the flash does for your photos, use a small piece of dark-colored paper and some tape to cover the bulb., If you’re taking outdoor shots at night, shooting on a dark day, or are indoors, you may need to add some light to your subject. Try LED strobe lights aimed at your subject. For a simpler option, start by aiming a flashlight at your subject., OneStep cameras have fixed-focus lenses that allow you to simply point your camera and snap your photo. Polaroid produced tons of these cameras in the 1980s and 1990s, and they remain popular because they’re relatively easy to find and even easier to operate.You can purchase refurbished Polaroid 600 OneStep cameras online at the Impossible Project. This will provide you with a camera that has been inspected and tested by a team of repair technicians.For less expensive but potentially faulty cameras, look online or at garage sales. Because Polaroid produced so many of these cameras, there are a variety of ways to find them used. Be aware that this may result in a broken piece of equipment.
Many customers now buy Fujifilm instax cameras, which are a type of instant camera not produced by Polaroid. These newer options are extremely easy to use, and they produce durable instant prints. They require their own Fuji instax film that’s compatible with a variety of cameras that come in different sizes and colors., These iconic cameras are only available for purchase used on a website like Ebay. The generally easy-to-use camera gives you the classic Polaroid look with its white body and rainbow sticker. They don’t come with a built-in flash, making them slightly more high maintenance than 600-series options.You’ll need to attach the flashbar to the top of the camera. The camera should include the optional flashbar when you purchase it.

, The Impossible Project produces new film that’s compatible with all Polaroid cameras. Deciding to purchase this newer film is a surer bet than going with the used film you can find online. The Impossible Project’s film does require longer exposure times, and it’s usually more expensive than used film cartridges.Be sure that you’re purchasing the correct film for your camera. 600-series cameras require 600-type film, while SX-70 cameras need SX-70-type film.
SX-70 cameras can use 600-type film if you install a Neutral Density filter on your film cartridges. You’ll need to purchase these filters separately from your film. They’re available at the Impossible Project., Used film cartridges, like Polaroid cameras, can be found easily online. While this purchase could result in film that’s cheap and works well, you may also receive dead film that won’t produce pictures. If you’re worried about cost, try used options first, then move to the Impossible Project’s products only if necessary.The film cartridges contain Polaroid OneStep cameras’ “batteries,” so if the film doesn’t work, neither will the camera.

If you need to, you can go for a walk and pick up some ideas and inspiration and take in what things look like so you can paint them well later.

If you decide to group things together, bear in mind how to keep these things looking realistic or ""belonging"".
Take digital photos of scenes that really appeal to you. These might be exactly what you want to paint or portions of the whole scene. Having an image to remind you can be extremely helpful. Try to take the images at the time of day you're wanting to represent in the painted scene.
Vacation or holiday snaps can be a great basis for a sketch. Just be sure to use ones taken at the same time of day or the final scene might look unusual.;
, Draw the picture just as you want it to be, only using grey-lead pencil for now. Spend a decent amount of time on this preparation, as it will form the basis for your painting and is the time during which your ideas gel for the final scene.

If you didn't or can't take images of your own, you can search images online to see real images of the things you wish to draw. For example, if you wanted to draw a palm tree, search for ""Palm trees"" to see up close and from afar what they look like.
Have a rubber/eraser nearby, to easily undo any mistakes made during sketching.

, Is it as you pictured it to be? Is it realistic? If not, rub out any mistakes and re-draw those parts again. If you're not happy with your picture but what you've drawn is realistic, add extra detail and look back on texture. For example, an ocean could have peaking waves or a lagoon could have a ripple of a breeze across it; either body of water could be storm-affected or perfectly still, depending on the effect you're trying to evoke. The texture will help you to achieve the feeling you want your viewers to experience., Picture what you had in mind before you started. Is it the same? Do you like what you see? Is it better or worse? Reflect on your drawing and pick up anything you do and don't like. Ask others what they think and what you can improve on., Using the penciled sketch as a guide, begin to paint the scene in the colors and style you wish to use. The paint medium will impact the brushstrokes, level of color and style of your painting, so be true to each.

If the pencil is likely to show through the paint, erase it or make it lighter before painting.

, Keep in mind that many elements, such as trees, have different shades of the same colour.

For a good technique useful for trees, hillsides and water, use different shades to represent changing light. Hold the brush vertically and dab onto the paper down and up in different spots.

, For the shadier parts, make it darker and for the more sunny places, paint it lighter. Making a set of things lighter on one side (lighter on the left side of all trees and buildings) gives a clearer image of where the sun is located, even on dull, greyer days., Add detail to all parts of your picture, as this will make it look much better in the finished product. Remember to add plenty of texture and perspective.

Outlining with black felt tip pen can sometimes be helpful, depending on the paint used. This won't work with oil paints.

, Is it coming along the way you'd like it to? If not, make the necessary adjustments as you go, for it's much easier than having to paint over the whole thing again., Have the canvas scene framed. Show your masterpiece off to friends and family."

Look at your two ports, and buy a cable that connects them.If you have an SD slot on your computer, and your camera a uses an SD card, that is the simplest possible compatibility option. Most camcorders have ports for a FireWire and a USB 2.0. A FireWire, which was developed by Apple, is usually the best choice because it will transfer your video more quickly to the computer.If you don’t have those ports, you will need to buy what is called a FireWire expansion card at a local computer store or a FireWire adapter for a Mac. They are not very expensive. But don't get too hung up on the names; the bottom line: You need to check the camera port, and computer port, and then find or buy a cord which has those specific ends or pin sets.
If you have a USB cable instead, you can also use that cable to transfer movies/videos to your computer. The same is true whether you are transferring the movies to a PC or a MAC and for various types of camcorders.;
, You could store your videos in a memory card that you insert into your camera or camcorder. Memory cards are small square disks that store your videos.


To transfer these videos to your computer, simply insert the memory card in the slot on your computer. Some older computers don't have slots for SD memory cards, but you can buy an external card reader that attaches into the USB port of your computer.Go to your computer's settings, usually My Computer, and look for devices and drives. You should see the SD memory card pop up once you insert it.
Click on the icon for the card, and you should see your videos (and photos) pop up on the computer. It's that simple. Move them to any file folder you want.

, You should figure out whether your computer has the ports needed to transfer movies from a camera.


Check and see whether the device has a port for a FireWire and/or USB cable as well as a SD memory slot. The SD memory card slot is a thinner slot the width of a small memory card. It's usually located on the front or side of your computer.
To determine whether you have a FireWire port, click on Control Panel, and then Network Connections (or Network & Internet Connections). Look for an icon labeled 1394 Connection. A FireWire port is a narrower slit, whereas a USB port is thicker and resembles a square with a smaller square on top.To determine whether there is a USB port, click on the start menu of your computer, select ""Control Panel."" Then choose ""Performance and Maintenance"" and ""See basic information about your computer."" You will be in a System Properties Window. Locate the ""Hardware"" tab at the screen's top, and click on it, and then ""Device Manager."" Locate ""Universal Serial Bus controllers"" on the list and click on the plus sign to open it. If you have a USB port, you should see the word ""enhanced"" as one of the titles.

, Be aware that Mac recently phased the FireWire ports out of its computers in favor of something called the Thunderbolt.You can buy Thunderbolt to FireWire adapters pretty cheaply, though. The Macs use USB 3.0 connectors.
The Thunderbolt technology allows for faster transfer speeds. You can often find the Thunderbolt ports on the back of the computer.For example, on the back of the Mac pro, you will find six Thunderbolt ports, along with two USB 3.0 ports.

, You will connect one end of the cable into the camera or other device, and the other end will go into the corresponding port on the PC or Mac (again, note, that you would need a FireWire adapter for many Macs). You need a cable that connects the two ports.


A FireWire is also known as an IEEE 1394 cable.A USB 2.0 connection can perform the same transfer with most devices. Most new PCS already have a FireWire port, where you plug in the cable or a USB 2.0 connection.
There are two types of FireWire connectors. They are called 4 pin and 6 pin. The FireWire port on the PC generally has 6 pins. The digital camcorder’s FireWire port (sometimes called DV out or i.Link) usually has 4 pins. So you generally need a FireWire cable with 4 pins for the camcorder or camera end, and 6 pins for the computer end.

, Plug one end of the cable into the camera. Plug the other end into the port in the PC or Mac..


This will connect your camcorder or camera to your computer. You will be able to make movies on the computer using free tools built into Windows or the Mac, such as Movie maker and iMovie.
Connect the 4-pin end of the cable into the camcorder and the other end into the IEEE1395 4-pin or 6-pin FireWire port on your computer.
If you don’t have a FireWire port, buy a FireWire CardBus Adapter to plug into the computer first., Use the cable that came with the device or buy a USB cable or FireWire adapter. You can also try connecting the Thunderbolt cable to your video camcorder or camera, but you may need the adapter.


If you are using a camcorder, set it to PC Connect mode. Your device might have a different name. This may happen automatically if your camcorder is connected to the computer and you switch it to playback mode.You could simply remove the memory card from your device, and insert it into the card slot on your Mac (you can also try doing this with a PC.)
Click on the import button in the toolbar. In the camera's section of the import window, select your camcorder or camera or other device. Sometimes you will see photos side by side with video clips.

, Your computer should automatically recognize your camcorder or camera device. Connect your camera to your computer, and turn it on.


If your camera came with software, the computer will recognize the camera. In most cases, it will be able to read it.
Windows is going to automatically install the necessary drivers. You will be prompted to import video using Windows Import Video. This comes free with Windows. Simply select import, and the videos will be loaded onto your computer.
Windows Import Video will rewind your MiniDV cassette and begin importing your video. It will play your video while importing it, and turn it into an .AVI file.

, On your computer, you will need to open or install video editing software if you want to alter the video.


Most computers have video editing software already installed. You will use this software to complete the video transfer process.
For example, Windows has basic video editing software already installed. It’s called Windows Movie Maker. If you have a Mac, you won’t be able to use Windows Movie Maker. Instead, Macs have the iMovie video editing program installed in them.
You will be able to use Windows Movie Maker or iMovie to edit the video. You could purchase more professional video editing software if you wanted to but it will not be necessary for most edits.

, Editing software can usually direct you to the correct spot to import videos from a connected device. Open your OS's native software and find the Import function to begin.

, You can simply drag the files into a folder in your computer.The program will give you an option to import video. Give it a name. Either import the entire video, which will rewind it, and import it all into the file, or you could choose parts of the video to import.
For example, you could import 30 minutes at a time. The screen allows you to select the amount of minutes you want it to stop importing after. You can rewind or forward. Then click import., Click review, organize and group items to import. Click next.


Click import all new items now if you want to do so at once. Type a name for the videos, and click import. Handle photos the same way. All of the photos and videos will be imported.
Select groups of videos to import. If you want to select several videos to import but not others, you can check the box next to the groups of videos you want to import. Do not check the boxes next to the videos you do not.
You can view all of the videos in a group of videos, by clicking view all items next to the group. Go to photo gallery. Select the check box in the upper left corner for each video you want to use in your movie. On the create tab, in the share group, click movie. This will add selected videos to the storyboard in Movie Maker.

, In Movie Maker, for instance, you will want to connect your digital video (DV) camera to the PC using a FireWire or IEEE 1394 cable.


Switch your digital video camera to Playback/VCR mode. Click the Movie Maker button, and then click import from device. If the photos and videos will be imported into photo gallery message appears, click OK.
In the import photos and videos window, select the DC camera and then click import. On the import video page, click more options.
Select a file name. If the videotape contains several different scenes, you can import each scene as a different file by choosing the Import videos as multiple files (unavailable for HD video) check box.
On the import video page, type a name of the video you want to import, and then click import the entire video to import it all or choose parts of the video to import.

Make sure your camera lens is clean and if you are using a Digital SLR, you also need to make sure that the sensor is clean.,
Read your camera’s manual.,
Get your subject in the right spot.,
Framing, this is what 80% of photography is all about.,
Get the lighting right.,
Control the exposure.,
Understand about Depth of Field.,
Have your camera to hand.,
Lighting: If you are shooting in daylight and want the best picture possible, then use the sun to your advantage.,
Try to use a prime lens.,
Don’t be frightened to shoot vertical.,
If you are taking pictures of people you don’t know, then make sure you smile!",How to Take Good Photos Using a DSLR," This is easy to do and will avoid your images having any unwanted dots, smears or marks on them. Use a lens cloth that is only going to be used on the lens. Firstly, breathe on the lens and then clean it with a circular motion. For the sensor, to reduce dirt getting onto it, always turn the camera off before changing the lens and try to do so in a ‘controlled’ environment like the back of a car. Essentially, try not to change the lens on a really windy beach or in the desert! Most DSLR cameras have automatic sensor cleaning when you turn the camera on and off so that helps a lot! I know you can always Photoshop dirt out in stills, but if you are using the video function on your camera then removing specs and unwanted dirt is not an easy option – unless you have got months of spare time on your hands.;
, It sounds boring, but 1-2 hours with the manual and your camera in hand will guarantee that you will learn to understand it quickly. The sooner you can operate in full manual mode the better. It is the only way to start pushing your photographic skills.

, If you are shooting a portrait or a group of people, position them where you want them. Make sure there is nothing growing out of their heads and if you want to feature your background then do so. Ask your subject(s) to move forwards or backwards and framing your shot with your subject framed hard left or right can work really well. Never be shy to move your subject(s) around, it is the best way to learn.

, Look at images in magazines, watch movies and see how they are framed. You need to allow enough headroom, but not too much otherwise the image can look clumsy. Don’t crop half a hand or part of their head. Try not to place people directly in the centre of the frame. Soon your eye will get used to framing and you’ll know what looks good. The best thing I was ever taught was ‘If it looks good, it is good!’

, Lighting is really important and helps set mood and atmosphere. While using additional flash units can be a little advanced, setting your internal flash to the correct level for your lighting environment makes a big difference. This is where we come back to reading the ‘dreaded’ manual. On most cameras accessing the flash control is only a few clicks away on the menu. Learning how to do this will definitely help. If you have a DSLR, get an external flash and experiment using it off the camera.

, Being able to control the aperture size (exposure) and shutter speed manually will mean that you can expose what you want to expose for and not what the camera thinks you want to expose for. When the camera is in auto exposure mode it will expose whatever is largely in frame. For example, if you are taking a picture of your subject and a waterfall is in the background then the camera will close down the iris to expose for the white waterfall and as a result your subject will be under exposed/ dark. By knowing how to use exposure and shutter manually (which each directly affect each other) this will allow you to take control and make decisions on what part of your image you want to expose for.

, Learning the basics of depth of field (DOF) and how exposure (Aperture or 'F Stop') increases or decreases what is in focus will expand your creativity no end. Learning about how slow and fast shutter speeds can affect your work will increase your creativity. Switching to manual focus for specific shots is also very helpful especially with macro (close up) work. This means you can set the focus to exactly where you want it to be.

, Again this might sound obvious, but Photography is all about catching a moment and moments only last a moment… So leaving your camera in your bedroom or buried deep in your bag is never a winner.

, Backlit photography can look fantastic, and is very helpful to separate your subject from its background and can give a much more 3D image. Just be aware of lens flare entering the lens and decide if you want that effect. You can flag the flare by using a lens hood or simply using your hand. When possible use a piece of white card or a reflector to bounce light back onto your subject's face. You will be surprised how effective this method is and it will dramatically lift the shadows from your subject's face and improve your images.

, It doesn't mean you should go and buy an expensive fixed focal length lenses; just set your camera lens on the zoom to about 50mm, which is approximately what our eyes see. Then, rather than zoom the camera in and out, keep it fixed and physically move yourself around. Get close to your subjects and down on their level. Don’t always shoot from standing up, just because it is the most convenient.

, Vertical can really suit certain shots, especially portraits. Try it out.

, Sounds simple, but people always appreciate it. You are taking their image so it’s the least you can do. It will help them feel more comfortable and they might even smile back.

Check for a lens error pop-up.There are lots of things that could possibly explain a digital camera lens problem.,
Consider anything that may have happened to the camera recently.,
Read the camera's user manual.,
Take out the battery and memory card.A common trick with most devices (including cameras and cellphones) is to disconnect the power for a few minutes.,
Smack the side of the camera.Although it may seem like an act of last-ditch frustration more than a helpful repair technique, some people have reported having success with slapping the side of their camera with the palm of their hand.,
Clean the lens barrel.A compressed air spray duster can get into the cracks of your camera's lens barrel and clear out the built up gunk.,
Plug in the AV cable.It may be that your camera simply need an added boost of energy to deal with dust particles clogging the lens.,
Adjust the lens housing manually.Sometimes, the problem with your camera may be mechanical.,
Force an autofocus.,
Call the manufacturer.,
Take your camera to a repair shop.If you're out of luck and can't find a viable solution to your camera troubles at home, it may be time to seek professional help.,
Buy a new camera lens.,
Consider buying a new camera.",How to Repair Lens Problems on Your Digital Camera," If you're having trouble with the lens, first check your camera to see if there's a lens error pop-up on your camera screen. If this is the case, it means your camera has picked up on the issue as well. If there's nothing, it may mean that the issue is external (too much dirt on the lens) or a possible glitch in the system.;
, Most errors with a digital camera lens are caused by dropping the camera. There are lots of potential circumstances where a phone could be dropped. Spilling liquids on a camera or putting the camera somewhere coarse (like a sandy beach) will also damage a camera's lens and software. Knowing how the problem arose won't ensure you'll be able to fix it, but it may be able to steer you on the right path.

, Camera user manuals usually have a troubleshooting section with common problems typically associated with a given model. Although most digital cameras tend to function in a similar way

, This allows your device to reset. If the lens problem is due to an issue with the software, taking out the battery and memory card for 15 minutes may remove a lens error pop-up.

, If the camera's issue is that the lens house is stuck, the force of a smack may loosen the camera's insides, solving the problem for you.


Using the side of a pencil to tap the camera barrel works too, if you're worried the force of your hand might damage the camera further., Spray it evenly in the cracks, and anywhere else on your model you think excess dust may have built up. Power off and restart your phone to check and see if this technique worked at all.

, Plugging in your cable for 5 minutes will give your camera extra energy. If this is the case, your camera should be fine within a few minutes.

, If the lens won't extend, only extends partially, or extends and then retracts again, then gently moving the lens barrel around may help to unstick it. You can gently push or pull on the lens, which may be enough to loosen whatever is causing it to stick. If the lens won't extend even a little, turn on the camera and then tap the front of the camera against a cupped hand.You should hear a click as your lens barrels pops back in place.

, When digital cameras extend their barrel, they will attempt to auto-focus themselves. This may help fix whatever problem your camera is having. Hold down the shutter button to begin moving the barrel. While you have the shutter button held down, press the power button.It helps to plant the camera on a flat surface, with the lens facing up., If you've been able to rule out some easily solvable issues, it's a good idea to touch base with the manufacturer. Call the hotline of the company that produced your camera. Once you're patched through to a company representative, outline the problems you've been grappling with. If it sounds like a common issue with the camera, he'll be able to lead you through some of the solutions that are specifically suited to your model.


Digital camera companies will usually have a hotline listed on their website.

, Camera and electronics repair stores will take your camera and fix the problem for a price. It's only recommended that you get it repaired if you've exhausted all the easy possible fixes. You'll still be charged an expensive fee even if the solution takes them two minutes, so make sure it's worth your while to do so.


Repairs can be very expensive. In some cases, they may actually be more expensive than the value of the camera. Keep this in mind and make sure you get a price estimate before handing your device over for repair., Camera lenses can be removed and replaced. Chances are your camera model is fairly common. Rest assured you're not the first person who has had a foul-up with the lens. If your digital camera works perfectly otherwise, you might consider getting the lens replaced. You can either get it from a camera store, or have it ordered directly from the manufacturer.


Only replace the camera lens yourself if you really know what you're doing. The user manual that came with your digital camera should offer some guidance in this regard.

, Unfortunately, it may come to a point where you have no option but to count your losses and send your broken camera to the dumps. Getting a new camera will save you the effort of having to repair it, and though you'll be potentially putting down a lot of money for a new one, you stand to gain a more advanced model than the one you had before. If you use your camera enough, you might even find that getting a sharper type of camera will have been worth it all along.


Most modern cellphones come equipped with built-in cameras. This can absolve you of the need to purchase a replacement digital camera if you already have a phone cam.

Set a basic budget on how much money you want to spend.,
Determine your experience level.,
Consider what you will use your camera to capture.,
Be aware of the difference between a global shutter versus a rolling shutter that can give odd looking results when shooting a high-speed airplane propeller or wiggle in video.

,
Decide if you want to capture video with the camera.,
Check reviews on the web.,
Make a list of which features are important to you, and prioritize the list.,
Consider which type of batteries would be most useful to you.,

, Are you a novice or an expert when it comes to digital photography? If a novice, a point and shoot might suffice. Experts will want more manual control over the exposure process.

, For kids or wildlife, get a camera that acts fast after you click the shutter.

,, If you want true HD capabilities, look for 1080 resolution video. If you want to catch close to professional or professional sound, look for a camera with microphone input.

, http://www.dpreview.com, http://www.imaging-resource.com, and http://www.steves-digicams.com are the leading sites for serious photographers, while http://www.cnet.com has good reviews for more casual users. When you're trying to decide between two choices, or just want to explore similar cameras, search for information online.

, Keep in mind that there are tradeoffs, for example, size vs. optical zoom. You probably won't get everything you want.

, Your main options are either AA batteries or a rechargeable lithium battery pack. Rechargeable pack may be lighter and last longer, but when it wears out, it may be difficult to buy a replacement. If camera takes AA batteries, it can usually run on rechargeable AA batteries as well - these are not manufacturer specific and can be easily replaced when needed.

, Decide what's important and get something best at that, rather than middle-of-the-road in everything.

, There are many other things, including the lens, that determine the quality of the image. 3 megapixels is the minimum you should look at. A 3 megapixel camera will get you excellent 4x6 prints, if you want anything bigger consider a 4 or 5 megapixel -or more if your budget will allow. Talk to a photo store professional for more information about how many megapixels you will need your camera to have to make a quality picture in the print size you want.

, Price comparison sites can be helpful but often the best price merchants have terrible service.

, Most cameras come with a limited one year warranty, but extended warranties are usually available.

, If you have time to wait or do not need your camera immediately, we recommend you use price comparison sites such as PriceComparison.com or DealTime.com. You will save time and money finding the lowest price. Consider shopping at a local camera store. You will be paying about the same as you would off the internet, you are getting a person behind the counter who knows more about cameras than the internet, and also an easy place to take your camera back if it should happen to malfunction sometime down the road. And economically speaking, you will be supporting your local towns and creating jobs and keeping the money circulating locally.

,, To save file size and increase readability, you want to strip out as much extra color information as possible. You can automate this process: Start recording a new action. Then select Image>adjustments>threshold to convert to black and white - drag the cutoff slider to where it looks most readable. Save the images using File > Save for web and devices. Save in the gif format. You only need two colors, and you may safely crank up the lossy compression. Using this method you can compress six megapixel images down to under 200 kb, down from the roughly 2 mb original files.

, Now that you have created your action, open Photoshop and select file > automate > batch. Select the action you just made, as well as the original images you want to work on. Then select a destination and numbering scheme. Run the process and you should end up with a number of compressed GIFs. Review your images again. If any of your images were underexposed or out of focus, they will be illegible.

, There are a number of ways to do this, but the easiest is to use Mac OS X's automator. Simply drag your image set into the automator window, add a ""New PDF from images"" action, select a destination, and run the process.

Review footage in the event of an incident.",How to Purchase and Install a Dash Camera,"


Websites like amazon and eBay are flooded with many different cameras, and the quality of many of these cameras can be questionable.
While you can get a dash camera for $20 -$30, the quality of these cameras are probably very poor. Most high quality cameras are around the $100 price point. The extra cost is worth the investment, since it might make the difference of being able to read license plates with the camera or not, which would be extremely important in a hit-and-run accident.
A good site that lists many common dash cameras is dashcamtalk.com. This website provides in depth information regarding quality of cameras, as well as reliability and where to get them on secrool.com.
In addition to buying a dash cam, you will need to buy a microSD memory card to go along with it. You can purchase this from various local brick and mortar retailers.;
,


Usually in a place out of sight from the driver and passenger is best, behind rearview mirror. You will want to see what the camera placement will look like from both the driver’s seat and passenger seat, to make sure that both views are not blocked by the camera, which could be distracting.

,
A good rule of thumb here is the old saying measure twice, cut once, since most adhesive mounts will not allow adjustment after being affixed to the windshield.
Once you feel confident that the camera is correctly lined up, go ahead and mount it with the adhesive strips provided.

, Another option that you can use is semi-permanent plastic hooks. Using this method works well at holding the cables up, but allows you to easily remove them if you needed to.

,


Most dash cameras have the ability to start / stop recording when it receives power. Depending on your make and model, power either shuts off when you turn your car off or stays on even when the ignition is switched off. If your car turns the power to the cigarette lighter off automatically, then all you have to do is plug in the power adapter and forget about it. If your vehicle does not automatically do this, then you will have to unplug the camera’s power cord when you park your car, and plug it back in when you start it up next time.

,


If you are involved in a crash, you can review the footage on the unit itself, as long as it has a screen on it.
If you need to review the footage on a computer, either take the unit from the car and plug it into your computer via a provided USB cable, or remove the microSD card from the unit and plug it into your computer.
Once you have the device/card plugged into the computer, open the files with a video player such as Windows Media Player or VLC media player. Most cameras break down clips into small intervals, such as in 1,3, or 5 minute segments.

Decide if you want to do a dry or a wet clean.,
For a dry clean hold the camera over your head and, taking care to keep the nozzle away from the sensor, blow the specks of dust away.

,
When using a static brush make sure the batteries are charged enough.,
If a dry clean does not remove all the debris then it is time for a wet clean.

,
You need to use a lint free wipe, often referred to as a ""pec pad"" and a fast drying cleaning fluid.,
You should obtain either a wooden Popsicle stick or a flexible plastic fork knife, spoon, whatever.",How to Clean Your Digital Camera Sensor," Dry cleaning can be done with a bulb device such as the Giotto rocket blower or with a statically & nbsp;charged brush like the Arctic Butterfly.


Cleaning is best done in a room that is as dust free as possible. You don't need to be in a room with a white suit on like the people who work on computer chips but at the other end of the spectrum, don't go outside while it's windy or to your coffee table while the kids are having a pillow fight in the room. Bottom line, the best place is probably somewhere like a dining room table while no one else is there and the house is relatively clean and quiet. In some houses the bathroom is also a good place. There should be adequate light. You will be able to see the dust on the sensor if you reflect an overhead light off it's shiny surface.
Consult your owners manual for ""mirror lockup"". This function, as the name implies, will lock the mirror up out of the way when you press the shutter release button on your camera and leave it there until the shutter is pressed again.






NOTE: You may choose to place your camera on ""bulb"" setting. This allows the cameras mirror to stay up until you choose to close it. Please consult your cameras manual to learn how to set a bulb exposure. Nikon cameras have a mirror-up for cleaning function which is the best way to lockup your mirror.





;
,, Switch it on and give the device a chance to build a static charge before brushing your sensor.

,,


Pec pads are 99.99% lint free pads that are non-abrasive and won't damage or scratch your sensor.
The cleaning fluids are generally methanol based, flammable and dangerous so you have to be careful. Some places won't even ship these items in the mail due to regulations about mailing ""hazardous materials"". There are some alternatives to the methanol based products but not as good. Also, if you are going to be traveling by plane with your cleaning fluid, you may have a problem unless it's in a certified safe/non-toxic packaging. In all cases use these products in a well-ventilated area, don't breath the fumes and don't get them on your skin, clothes or any furniture.

, It doesn't matter which, because you will be using the handle end. You will also need some masking tape.


You are going to place the pec pad in your hand and lay the handle into your hand on top of it so that the very end of the handle (or Popsicle stick) rests about in the middle of the pad.






You then want to fold the left side of the pad over the handle, the top down over so that it rests on the top of the left half you just folded and then bring the right side over to the left and make it tight. (This sounds confusing so there are pictures available at the site listed above.)






Once you have done this you should tape the pec pad near the base (closer to the top of the utensil's ""business end"". You want the tape to be far away from the camera as scotch tape is abrasive and you don't want it to touch the sensor.






You want to end up with a flat end of pec pad with a relatively spongy feeling. It has to be soft because you're going to sweep this across your sensor VERY LIGHTLY. You want it flat because you are going to sweep across the sensor from one side to the next in about 3 to 4 passes, moving over about the width of the pad with each pass, in order to sweep the whole surface. Of course, prior to doing this you should add a couple of drops of the cleaning fluid to the flat tip of the instrument you just made.






This should go without saying but NEVER pour the liquid directly into the camera. NEVER push hard on the sensor. Just lightly sweep across it. You are sweeping dust after all and not grinding off nuggets of dirt. VERY, VERY light pressure.






Now you are done! Dispose of the pec pad (safely. i.e., no kids or animals can get to it) and make sure the rest of them are sealed in the zip lock bag they probably came in (if not, put them in one that is new so there will be no dust in it). Seal up the fluid bottle and put it all away in a safe place.






To test to see if your sensor is free of dust, you can put on a lens (that you are also sure is free of dust) go outside on a bright day, open your camera to its maximum f-stop and shoot a few pictures of the sky. When you go to review them at high resolution on your computer, you should see a nice picture with no dust.

Make sure all the camcorder’s buttons and features are easy to access., A flip-out LCD is a screen attached to a digital video camera where you can watch your videos as you shoot them and review them after you’re done. LCDs are usually 2 ½ to 4 inches (63.5-101.6mm) wide, but some camera models offer larger screens.Flip-out LCDs are a useful feature if you want to see how your shots look as you shoot them, but it may not be necessary if you’re using something like an action camera that is hands-free.

, Image stabilizers are either optical or electric, with both types working to stabilize the videos you shoot so they don’t look shaky when you view them. An image stabilizer is useful if you plan on shooting a lot of videos using your hands, but it might not be a necessary feature if you own a tripod or other camera-steadying device., If you’re planning on capturing subjects from far away, you want a digital video camera with a zoom feature. Most camcorders come with digital zoom, but not all of them come with optical zoom. Optical zoom allows you to zoom in on people and objects when you’re shooting without sacrificing video quality. If you’re getting a camcorder for personal use, you might not need optical zoom, but if you’re looking to shoot professional-style videos, the optical zoom feature is definitely something to consider.

Some optical zoom lenses can magnify objects better than others. The higher the number given for an optical zoom lens, the better zoom it has. For example, a 50x optical zoom lens can magnify an object more than a 10x optical zoom lens., All digital video cameras come with a built-in microphone, but sometimes the sound quality is low, depending on the model. For professional videographers, it can be helpful to have a camera with a jack for an external microphone.Using a high-quality external microphone will help you shoot videos with better sound, saving you time during the editing process.

, A tripod will hold your camera in place so you can take beautiful shots that aren’t shaky. If your digital video camera doesn’t have an image stabilizer built into it, a tripod is even more necessary.

When shopping around for a tripod, look for tripods made out of aluminum. They’re cheaper and more sturdy than tripods made out of other materials like carbon fiber., The memory card that comes with your digital video camera probably won’t be enough to store all your videos, especially if you plan on shooting a lot of footage. Get some extra memory cards and store them in your camera case for when you need them. Before you buy new memory cards, check that they’re compatible with your camera., You can find video camera bags ranging in style and price online or at any camera store. Keeping your camera in a bag when you’re not using it will protect it from the elements and make it easier to travel with.

If you’re worried your camera is too heavy or bulky to carry around, look for a camera bag with shoulder straps that will make it easier to carry., Look in the manual that came with your camera or check the battery itself to see what kind of battery your camera uses. You can order spare batteries online or go to a camera store and ask if they sell the battery type you’re looking for. Having extra batteries around when you’re filming will prevent your camera from shutting off in the middle of a shoot.Make sure your spare batteries are fully charged before tossing them in your camera bag. Most camera battery chargers have a light on them that indicates when a battery is fully charged.

Remove the battery from the device.,
Find some AA, AAA, or 9-volt batteries.,
Identify the positive and negative connectors on each battery.,
Match voltage of your battery which need to charge and other battery (AA, AAA or others with enough power to provide).,
Obtain two pieces of metal wire.,
Tape or clamp the wires to the battery that will be providing a charge and the battery that requires a charge.,
After some time, the battery should be charged.",How to Charge a Battery Without a Charger1," You will need access to the connection points on the battery. Keep in mind that the battery is not intended to be accessed on certain models of cell phone, so know what can be done with the model you have. On most (but not all) Android and Windows phones the back can be removed with the appropriate amount of pressure in just the right spot. Do not attempt this with most Apple products.






;
, Unlike the power that comes from the wall outlet (alternating current), the power in common household batteries is no different from that used by your cell phone or camera battery.Perhaps you are baffled that anyone would suggest using one battery to charge another. Maybe you were expecting some magic trick that would allow you to add charge to your battery without having to find an alternate source of electric power. In fact, that is not possible. One of the fundamental laws of physics (the law of conservation of energy/conservation of mass) makes clear that you can't get something for nothing.Deal with it.
It is recommended that you charge your battery rather than attempt to hotwire your electronic device and use the alternative batteries directly. Using the improper amount of amperage or voltage can potentially damage complex circuitry, so such methods are obviously not worth the risk.

, On the AAs and other household batteries, these will be marked. For most cell phone batteries, the positive connector will be the one closest to the edge, while the negative connector will usually be the one farthest from the edge (there may be three or four connectors, but the middle one or two are used for temperature regulation and other functions).

, Normally now a day's Cellphone battery needs more than 3.7V DC to get charged. So multiple AA or AAAs or one 9V battery will be idle for providing a charge. Keep in mind that normal AA or AAA battery on everyday household use provide 1.5V each. So to gain more than 3.7V, you need 3 AA or AAA battery connected in series. 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V = 4.5V would be your power source if battery on your hand is either AA or AAA model.

, Ideally, these will be covered in plastic insulation except for exposed ends.

, These wires may get hot (though most likely they will not if you are doing it properly). It will also take quite a long time to transfer the charge. You don't want to be holding them the whole time.









If you are using AA and AAA batteries; you may want to connect them to each other ""in parallel"" before attaching them to the battery requiring a charge. This means using wire to connect the negative side of all the small batteries to the negative connector on the battery that needs a charge, and the same for the positive side., Keep in mind that it probably won't be fully charged, but you should have at least some use of the device that you needed.

Remove the battery from the electronic device.,
Rub the battery hard by using both of your hands to generate enough friction and heat.,
Place the battery back in the electronic device.",How to Charge a Battery Without a Charger2," Hold it in your hands.








, Continue to do this for 30 seconds to several minutes.









Note: Your battery is not being recharged. Some internet commentators have suggested the rubbing the battery provides it with additional charge, perhaps from built up static electricity.This interpretation is entirely incorrect.
Lithium ion cells, like all genuine batteries, release electricity as a consequence of chemical reactions. As predicted by the Arrhenius equation, these reactions become more powerful as temperatures increase.Essentially, you are improving the conductivity of the battery by raising its temperature.

, You may only have a few moments of battery life, so make the most of them.

Think about what you plan to use it for.,
Determine your budget.,
Check when the camera was released.,
Look at is the camera’s Mega Pixel.,
Consider a full frame sensor.,
Find out what format the camera uses.,
You should look at size and camera weight as this could be a factor to consider.,
Do you require a video function?,
Find out what video abilities (if any) it has.,
Choose Lenses: If you have lenses from another manufacturer, it doesn’t mean you have to stick with the same manufacturer for your camera body, as there are so many adaptors available on the market.,
Find out about Compatibility.,
See if it is upgradable and updatable.",How to Choose a DSLR Camera," What do you need it for? Fun, general or professional use? I would suggest writing your individual needs down to ensure the camera you choose best fits your requirements.;
, What is your budget? You have to remember it’s not just about the camera body, lenses are equally important. So consider this when budgeting along with additional batteries, memory cards, filters, flash, tripod and camera protection such as bags and cases. Buying a DSLR means buying more than just the camera body so take this into account when looking at your budget. There are some great deals and package ‘Kits’ out there where you can buy the body + lenses + tripod in a Kit so it is worth looking into these options as well.

, You don’t want to spend hard earned money on a product, only for it to be upgraded next week. Many cameras now have firmware upgrades, which is a great help in prolonging the life of your DSLR.

, These days Cameras have so many mega pixels. Only four years ago 8MP was considered high - it’s actually what Canon 1D started off with and that camera was used for incredibly high-end work. Now the Canon 5D Mark II has 21.1 MP. In all honesty, anything above 10MP is fantastic. Requirements depend on your individual needs, if you want to create large professional prints then high resolution is essential. For small images to email to family, then it is not essential.

, Do you need a Full Frame Sensor? A full frame sensor means that you get the exact same frame size as you would with a traditional 35mm film camera. This means that you get the true angle of view from the lens you are using – this is good for wide angle architectural or landscape work. They also perform very well at a high ISO. Many people have gotten used to the crop size of a smaller sensor and having that little extra on their zoom – this is good if shooting nature, wildlife or sport to get tighter shots. The Canon 5D Mark II has a full frame sensor, whilst the Canon 1D Mark IV does not even though the 1D is more expensive.

, Do you need to shoot in RAW? RAW is what many professional photographers shoot in. RAW captures large files that can be non-destructively graded and manipulated in the post stage without an image quality loss. Many Cameras now have the option to shoot in RAW and it can dramatically improve the quality of your final image and your digital dark room experience.

, This again comes down to use. Will you be running around shooting wildlife or travelling a lot? If so, then a small and light model would be best.

, Personally, even if you are a Stills Photography purest and never think you will use it, if you are buying a new DSLR today I would suggest getting one with a HD Video function, simply because they are so good. People are shooting high-end commercial work on them. Even if you don’t think you will ever really use it, having a HD Video Camera to hand built into your DSLR is never a bad thing.

, If you require a video function, is it important to be able to shoot in slow motion? If so this will narrow your choice of DSLR’s that can do this.

, You can use a Nikon Lens on a Canon camera by simply using an adapter; this helps widen your choice. For more information on choosing a Lens, please read my article on Top 7 Tips for choosing a Lens for your DSLR.

, Some models of cameras are compatible with each other, in terms of using the same batteries, chargers, battery grips and so on. If this is important to you this may affect your decision. Previous gear and accessories that are compatible with your new DSLR can help reduce cost and save you having to buy all new gear again.

, At the end of day, you want your DSLR to last as long as possible and not be outdated next month. Spend as much as you can afford and getting the model that best suits your needs whether as a consumer, pro-sumer or professional. It might be worth spending a little more on a model that will keep up with future upgrades and allow you to grow and learn with it, rather than buying a cheaper entry level model which will soon be out of date and although cheaper might not be beneficial in the long run.

Remove the winder lock spring.,

Remove the 5 screws that hold the film crank in place.,

Remove the screw holding the lock lever if you need to bend or make adjustments to it so that it will engage the lever which is operated by the shutter.,

Reassemble the camera in reverse order.,

Put the brass washer in this exact position when reinstalling the shot counter.,

Open the back of the camera and rotate the counterclockwise until S is at the 2 o'clock position.,
Reattach the leather.",How to Disassemble a Yashica Mat EM Winding Mechanism," You can use a very small punch and lightly tap one side of the pin until it comes out. Lift the crank handle off and remove the small cover beneath it.
, You can use the flat edge of a small screwdriver to carefully remove it. This can be glued back on with rubber cement or you can use double sided tape after re-assembly., They are very small and it might be necessary to file the end of a small screwdriver so that it will fit better. On the left side of the crank, there is a small opening for you to put a screwdriver into and pry the cover off. Remove carefully because there is a small disk spring that keep tension on the film take up spool gear. The cover holds this disk spring in place., This is backwards threaded so turn to the right to unthread. Take notice of small spring that is keeping tension on the silver gear. Remove both the silver and brass gears., All screws are regular threaded from here on out so turn left. Remove shot counter., Carefully lift this up and rotate it out of the way.

You can put this screw back in after rotating the leaver out of the way so that you don't get it mixed up with the other screws.

, Use pliers to remove spring from lever. Finally, remove the screw that holds the lever in place., Remove the screw that holds the assembly in place.

Look at how the small spring goes into the lock leaver and the small notch cut in it. This makes reassembly easier. Also, the crank locking leaver is almost always the cause of the grinding noise or the reason that a Yashica Mat will not crank. When the shutter button is depressed you should see the crank lock rotate forward and out of the way of the teeth on the crank gear. If it does not move then continue to the next step.

, Grab the film crank and lift the entire assembly out of the camera., Press the shutter button a few times so that you can see how the mechanism operates. After each adjustment set the crank assembly back on the camera so you can see if it is operating the crank lock release from the top.

Turn the focus adjustment all of the way in and all of the way out during adjustment because this will change the position where the shutter release lever makes contact with the crank lock release lever.

, Be sure that the pin goes in to the crank winding slot that was detailed in red in the last step. Stop reassembly at step 5., Make sure that the pin goes into the small hole in the shot counter and start the screw that holds it all in place but do not tighten it., Rotate the spring containment assembly clockwise until you can feel resistance. Slowly back off of it until the resistance stops and you can remove your finger. Tighten the screw down. Rotate the frame counter to the left and make sure that it returns to the start position freely on its own under the power of the spring. Continue reassembly in reverse order., After putting the outside cover back on the camera and installing the final screws, use Rubber Cement to reattach the leather to the camera. Only spread it on the leather. When it feels tacky to the touch, you know that it is ready to be placed back on the camera."

Buy a camera lens blower.,
Squeeze the blower away from the lens a few times.,
Use the blower to puff air across the surface of the lens.,
Store the blower in a sealed bag.,
Buy a brush specifically for camera lenses.,
Swirl the brush around the lens gently.,
Store the brush with a cap or in a sealed plastic bag.,
Buy single-use camera lens wipes.,
Wipe from the center of the lens in an outward spiral.,
Dispose of the used wipe.,
Choose a cleaning spray for camera lenses.,
Spray a microfiber cloth with the cleaning solution.,
Wipe the lens from the center outward.,
Store the cloth in a bag.",How to Clean a Camera Lens," Go to a camera or electronics store or order the blower online. Lens blowers are small, rubber squeeze blowers, which shoot a puff of air on the lens. Giottos is a commonly bought brand, but other brands also manufacture lens blowers.This may seem like a waste of money when you could blow on the lens with your mouth. Experts specifically recommend against blowing on the lens as you’ll often blow saliva onto the lens making it dirtier than before.
Do not use compressed air, which can harm your camera lens. Manual blowers are the safest cleaning option for your camera lens.;
, Each time you use your lens blower, squeeze out a few puffs of air before you use it on the lens. This will clear any dust that may be inside the blower. If you don’t do this, you could blow more dust onto the lens., Position the blower as close to the lens as possible so you don’t blow contaminants from the air onto the lens. Hold the tip at a slight angle to the lens. Squeeze a few puffs onto the lens, aiming each puff toward a different part of the lens.Hold the point of the blower in the center of the lens and angle it slightly toward the outside of the lens.

, When you are done using the blower, put it into a plastic baggie for storage. This helps keep the blower clean and free of outside contaminants. Seal the plastic bag and store it with the rest of your camera cleaning supplies in your camera bag.


It’s important to store it in a sealed plastic bag, because any type of cloth bag will allow dust to sift through the fabric and get into the blower.

, LensPen is one of the most recommended brands, but many others are available. A camera lens brush uses soft camel hair bristles which are gentle on your lens. Never use a brush that is not designed for lenses, because the bristles can scratch the glass.Most brushes have a cap to keep them clean, and other are retractable.
Never touch the bristles of your brush because you’ll leave finger oils and the brush won’t do its job.

, After you’ve blown the dust away, press the bristles of the brush gently onto the lens. Twist the brush back and forth in circles to remove particles from the lens. Some brushes also have a soft felt pad on the other end which helps remove oils from the surface of the lens.Make sure that you don’t jam the bristles against the lens. You’ll damage the brush and it won’t clean the lens effectively.

, It’s important to keep the brush clean, or it won’t be useful. Always put the cap back on when you’re finished with the brush. If the brush doesn’t have a cap, store it in a sealed plastic bag to keep it away from dust.

, Pre-moistened lens wipes are the best option for cleaning stubborn smudges or dirty spots on your lens. Zeiss and PEC-PAD are trusted brands for non-abrasive, lint-free wipes. Do not use cleaning wipes that are not specifically labelled for use on camera lenses.

, Take a wipe from the pack and press it against the center of the lens. Move the wipe in a circular motion, slowly spiraling toward the outside. Try not to wipe the lens multiple times in the same spot or you’ll simply move the dirt particles around.If a second pass on the lens is necessary, use a clean portion of the wipe or use a new one.

, These lens wipes are not meant to be reused, so throw them away after you use them. Using old wipes will transfer grime back onto your lens, and this may end up scratching the glass.If the wipe is still damp and a section of it is clean, use it to wipe down another less-fragile piece of your camera equipment before you throw it away.

, Visit a photography store, an electronics store, or order lens cleaning spray online. Zeiss, ROR, and Nikon make lens cleaning solutions that are highly effective. Never use your breath, glass cleaner, or any type of chemical cleaner on your camera lens., Find a microfiber cloth and use it only for your camera. Never use your t-shirt or any cloth that isn’t a microfiber cloth, as other fabrics are too abrasive and can scratch the lens. Spray the solution on the cloth and never directly onto the the lens.You may find microfiber cloths that are also specifically designed to be used on lenses.

, Gently press the damp cloth to the middle of the lens and begin to wipe it in circular motions. Wipe the lens in a spiral, moving toward the outside of the lens. Be sure not to press too hard. Wipe the lens only once if possible. It’s best to minimize contact with the lens.

, When you are done using the cloth, store it in a bag so it stays clean. Rinse the rag out with clean, cold water after every three uses. Do not use commercial detergents to wash the cloth, as these could end up getting on your lens.

Leave batteries out when not using the camera for a long period of time.,
Don’t leave your camera exposed in bright sunlight all day as this heats everything up.,
To add to this, cold temperatures are a no-go.,
Use a camera strap.",How to Care for Your Camera2," This can save much-needed battery life for more important situations.

, The heat can break/melt the lubricating greases, which will seep through and damage hardware. Camera parts will also expand when they get hot.

, Both extremes of temperature can be permanently damaging to cameras. Keep the camera warm in cold conditions, and cool in hotter temperatures.

, These are more often than not supplied with cameras and are another vital part for safety. If small, stylish, point-and-shoot cameras are what you use, perhaps this is not for you. However, with larger cameras, a strap is necessary to avoid the consequences of sudden moments when the camera slips out of your hand.

If water comes in contact with your camera, the immediate thing to do would be to wipe it down with a cleaning cloth.

Another major factor to look out for when using a camera at the beach is sand.",How to Care for Your Camera3,", Water can damage camera hardware and inevitably render it useless – i.e. permanently destroy it! Make sure a cleaning cloth is always handy, and try to avoid getting soaked in the meantime!

, Wrap a plastic bag around your camera tightly, and then cut the appropriate-sized portions out for the lens and viewfinder/LCD screen (depending on your preferences for viewing). When covering the camera with this, wrap a tight rubber band around the lens protrusion to secure the bag there.

, Though the lens is still exposed (for this you can apply a simple UV filter, and wipe clean between intervals), the camera body will not be infected by water. Using a plastic bag is a very simple and cheap way to achieve this. Underwater photographers, this is definitely not for you though! The plastic bag technique people photographing in rainy conditions.

, These fine particles of rock and shells can scratch your lens with the simplest of breezes. Though this happening is not likely, you might want to consider covering the lens while not engaging in photography – alternatively, put it in your camera bag! Take care, and when using the camera on sand, maybe place a towel underneath to prevent it entering the hardware.

Consider a cheaper and simpler point and shoot camera.,
Consider a digital SLR camera for more control.,
Don't assume a high price or popular brand means quality.,
Pick a camera that suits your mode of transport.,
Find a camera you can hold comfortably.,
Count the cost of the accessories.",How to Buy a Digital Camera1," If you want a simple, inexpensive camera with a low learning curve, consider a point and shoot digital camera. These have a viewfinder that's simply a ""window"" through the camera, rather than an exact image of what the camera will photograph, and may have fewer settings to alter.The picture quality will likely be worse because of this, but there is a wide range of quality in point and shoot cameras, so do not rule them out before you investigate.;
, An SLR digital camera (sometimes referred to as DSLR) provides you with much more creative control. Most of these have both automatic and manual adjustment for lighting and focusing. If you want additional control over the technical aspects of photography, or if you enjoy playing around with color settings and flash, look for digital SLR cameras. Be aware that these are almost always more expensive than point and shoot cameras.


SLR stands for ""single-lens reflex"" and describes the mirror and prism system that sends an accurate image to the viewfinder. Nowadays, most digital cameras of this type have an electronic display, but they are still referred to as SLR or DSLR cameras.

, Remember that sometimes an inexpensive camera will satisfy your needs better than a more expensive one. Similarly, brand names are sometimes associated with higher quality, but that does not mean a less well known brand won't satisfy you. Judge cameras based on their qualities, not on the hype of a price tag or advertisement.

, Before you get carried away with the extra features and higher quality of a fancy camera, keep in mind that you'll have to carry the camera away as well. Generally speaking, a small camera is lower quality than a larger one, but the sacrifice may be worth it if you plan to carry the camera on a whirlwind tour of Europe.


Consider the case it comes with as well, and how much protection it provides. You may wish to purchase a higher quality case if you are going to be traveling. Soft camera cases are portable and easy to store, while hard camera cases provide better protection and waterproofing, which may be necessary for non-compact cameras., Even some larger cameras have uncomfortably small hand grips, while many small cameras have no grip at all. Ideally, the grip should just fill the inside curve of your fingers, or the camera should be light enough that you can comfortably hold it steady. Will you get a major finger cramp just trying to hold on?


Small cameras without grips should still have a loop of nylon or other material that you can slip around your wrist. This could save your camera from damage if it is dropped or knocked from your fingers.

, Before you compare the cost of cameras, add the cost of a memory card and memory card reader if necessary. An extra set of batteries and extra charger are also a good idea. Decide whether to buy a more protective case as well. Once all of these are added up for your top two or three choices, you have a much better idea of how much each option will cost you.

Define your need: After using your camera with whatever lenses you have now, you may find that you can't get the photos you want because your subject is often too far away, or your subject may often be too large to get all of it in the picture.,
Mid-range zoom: This is a lens with a focal length of approximately 18-70mm.,
Telephoto zoom: This is probably the lens you'll buy next.,
Wide angle zoom: Get out your wallet -- there are no bargains here.,
""Normal"" lens: A lens that covers a modest angle of view is simple to design to perform well at wide apertures with cheap materials.,
Quality: Virtually all prime lenses are better than a zoom lens that covers the same focal length.,
One-lens system: A mid-range zoom such as an 18-55mm or 24-70mm will cover most photos you'll want to take.,
Two-lens system: If you only want to carry two lenses, use a wide-angle zoom like an 18-55mm, and pair it with a good telephoto, such as a 75-300mm.,

",How to Buy Lenses for Your Digital SLR," ""Standard"" or ""mid-range"" focal lengths can range from 35mm to around 80mm, and are closer to what the human eye sees. The ""telephoto"" range is generally considered to be any focal length from around 85mm and higher, and is used to make subjects appear closer. A ""prime"" lens has only one focal length, such as a 50mm lens. A ""zoom"" lens covers multiple focal lengths, and is described (for example) as an 18-55mm lens, meaning it covers a range from wide-angle (at 18mm) to mid-range (at 55mm).
, Or, perhaps your current lens's image quality is poor. That will help you figure out which lens to purchase.

, You'll probably use it for 75% of your shooting. Luckily, all DSLR makers offer a ""kit"" lens in this range, and most discount it heavily if you buy it with the camera. The optical quality is generally very good for the price. It's pretty much a no-brainer -- grab it.

, Commonly used for nature photography, sports, or any time you want to take a ""close up"" of a distant object.

, WA zooms are fiendishly tricky to make and you'll pay top dollar. A 10-20mm will cost about as much as you paid for the camera, but the results are worth it (assuming you like the exaggerated geometric effects, which tend to make people look just weird). Since not many folks will shell out for a WA zoom, your super-wide pix will really stand out.

, A 35 to 50mm f/1.7 - f/2 lens is great for low light and portraits. For whatever reason the 50mm is generally much cheaper; it will give a somewhat narrower angle of view on consumer (small sensor) DSLRs and work on film and full-frame digital too. It will have excellent image quality.

, Similarly, a lens that zooms from wide-angle to telephoto sacrifices image quality to provide convenience.

, Lightweight and easy to use, most photographers primarily use a lens in this range, referred to as their ""walkabout"" lens.

, You'll find a number of lenses in each of these ranges, with image quality and prices that vary widely. This will give you coverage from wide-angle through telephoto.

Don't make decisions based on megapixels.,
Consider your need for speed.,
Evaluate the zoom ability.,
Consider battery type.,
Know the memory card format.",How to Buy a Digital Camera2," The difference between a 5 megapixel camera and a 13 megapixel camera is barely visible even if you are printing your photos as posters.Even if you plan to print 8 x 11 prints of partial photographs, an 8 megapixel camera should have more than enough resolution., Many cheap cameras have a substantial time lag between pressing the button and actually taking the picture. If you're going to take photographs of your kids, sports games, or people performing fast actions, find a camera with a lag time of 0.2 seconds or less.If this will be the primary purpose of your camera, consider an SLR camera with a continuous shooting mode, which will allow you hold down the button and take a whole series of photos at once. The continuous frame rate tells you how many photographs the camera can take per second; for a camera used for fast-paced situations, this number should be at least five frames per second.



Note: be sure to look up or ask about the camera's internal memory buffer as well. This tells you how many photographs it can store during continuous shooting mode before it has to pause and save them to the memory drive.A high frame rate won't help much if the camera can only take a half second of continuous photos at a time.

, A zoom function allows you to adjust the distance of focus by the amount specified, for instance 4x or 50x the normal focal length. This specification isn't as simple as looking at the number advertised, however. Optical zoom alters the arrangement of the lens itself to focus on more distant objects, producing a high quality image. Digital zoom only enlarges the center of the image electronically, cropping out the rest of the photo without focusing further. Digital zoom results in a much lower image quality, and since the photo can be easily cropped later with image editing software, digital zoom is only useful for helping you find a distant object to photograph, not for taking high quality photos at a distance.


If you plan on zooming in on distant objects frequently, consider a camera with ""image stabilization."" This helps keeps your image steady even when focusing on a tiny, distant area, and reduces the chance of blurring.

, Many cameras use proprietary batteries, rather than standard AA batteries. Someday, the battery that comes with your camera may stop working or get lost, in which case you will need to obtain a replacement. Find out how to obtain one, and keep a back up battery charged and ready to use if possible.

, While your camera may already come with a memory card, you should find out which type of card anyway in case you need to buy a replacement. SD or Secure Digital cards are the most popular card format in consumer cameras, but the SDHC and SDXC varieties may not work in the SD slots of older models. These can come in standard, mini, and micro size. CF or Compact Flash drives are more commonly found in higher-end, DSLR cameras.


If you do need to purchase a memory card, consider how many images you need to store. This online calculator will show you how many photos each memory card will store based on your camera's megapixels. Typical users enjoy having a camera that can store around 400 photographs, but keep in mind that video uses up much more space.
If you do not have a memory card reader of the correct type, or a memory card slot of the correct type on your computer, you do not necessarily need to buy one. Most digital cameras come with USB attachments or other ways of transferring photos from the camera to the computer using common attachment methods.

, The lens (or rather, the adapter attached to it) should drop into place with no real effort, just like any Canon lens., Again, this is the same as fitting any lens to the Canon., Since the camera will have no way of controlling the aperture of the lens, this will be the only one that works (except manual (M) mode, which may be more complex than you want to use). ""Aperture priority"" means that exposure control will be done by the camera adjusting its shutter speed according to the aperture you have chosen., Given that you will be focusing manually, it is essential that the view through the viewfinder is as sharp as possible, and you may not have bothered with this if you had autofocus to fall back on. Set your lens to focus at something a known distance away (or, simpler, focus your lens to infinity and aim at something a little further away than the next closest distance on your lens). Look through the viewfinder, and turn the dioptric adjustment dial one way or the other until the picture is no longer fuzzy., With a normal M42 camera, in ""Auto"" mode, a lever inside the camera would depress a pin on the back of the lens to stop it down to your selected aperture during metering, or when taking a photograph. Of course, the EOS camera body has no such linkage, so you'll need to stop down manually., smallest f/number. You need to do this to make the screen as bright as possible for focusing., Since you often won't have any aids on your mirror, like a microprism ring, to help you focus accurately, this can be awkward. It sometimes helps to keep turning the ring until you are in focus, turn it a little further till you're out of focus, then very slowly turn it back. Once you're in focus, stop your aperture down by a couple of stops; this will give you a greater depth of field to compensate for the inevitable focusing error, however small., Take several photographs of well-lit subjects. Look at them on your LCD screen; the chances are that you will find your lens consistently under- or over-exposes in certain conditions (for example, the Pentacon 50mm 1.8 tends to cause the camera to overexpose by about +1 to +2 EV), so you will need to..., Exposure compensation on an EOS maintains automatic control over the shutter speed, but will underexpose or overexpose the picture by a given amount. Experiment with varying degrees of compensation and take as many photos as you need to get it right., Every lens has limitations, and many of them will have unique strengths. Ultimately, you can only find out what these are by taking as many photos as you can."

Purchase a digital display shade.,
Try an LCD anti-glare film protector.,
Stand in the shade of a tree, structure or building.,
Set up under an umbrella.,
Wear a hat.,
Put a towel on your head.,
Cup your hand around the screen.",How to Reduce Glare on a Digital Camera Screen," A pop-up, snap-on hood for your camera model may be an inexpensive solution. If your camera manufacturer does not have one available, you may want to try a generic one for a good fit––take your camera to the store to ask the retailer to fit it first.


Be sure to get a device that is simple to remove, as you'll want to be able to pack down your camera into its case without the shade in place, and you'll also need to be able to remove the shade for indoor shots and non-glare times.






Shoot photos using the shade device to see how it works for you. Some photographers find that it interferes with their usual photo taking approaches and need to find an alternative. You don't want to discover this mid-way through a professional shoot!





;
, This can be purchased from stores that sell digital cameras. It is a layer of film that can be applied to the LCD; it creates a polarizing effect to reduce some of the glare. While the lack of having something additional hanging off your camera makes this option seem more desirable, this may not be as effective as the digital display shade. Experiment to see if it works for you.

, The simplest solution is to position yourself in a place where there is less glare from the sun. However, as simple as this is, it may involve squatting down, sitting or changing where you want to take the photo from. Weigh up the benefits of a change of position for the sake of getting shade with the outcome for the photo that you're seeking.


Another drawback of standing in shade is the impact that the change of light will have on your photo quality. Take this into account when choosing the shade option.

, Some umbrellas have a clamp at the handle for attachment to your tripod or chair. You may also ask a friend to hold the umbrella for you. When a friend is not available, it is possible to prop the umbrella handle over your shoulder and support the canopy with your head, leaving both hands free for the camera. This also works well in bad weather.

, Your favorite baseball hat was designed with a long brim to shield your eyes from the light. Hold your camera close enough, and your cap will cast a shadow over the screen.


Instead of a baseball cap, look for a comfortable hat with a broad brim all the way around that protects your facial skin and provides adequate shade. If it's windy, choose a hat with elastic or ties to help keep the hat in place.







, Find a towel, bandana, or cloth that is dense enough to block the light of the sun. Place the towel on your head and drape it over your camera. Remember to keep your lens entirely uncovered.

, This is probably the least helpful suggestion because most people use both hands to hold the camera and shoot, but in a pinch, you may be able to manage both to hold the camera, cup one hand around the screen, and shoot. The effectiveness on this will be completely dependent on your camera size and your own dexterity. At least give it a try.


Some digital camera have a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen which allows you to hold the camera to your eye thus completely eliminating glare. This may also increase battery life since the viewfinder draws less power than the LCD. There is usually a button on the back of the camera to toggle between the LCD and the viewfinder.

Re-varnish your painting.",How to Preserve Expensive Oil Paintings1," Use a natural-hair artists brush or Japanese brush when dusting. Tilt your painting forward on a clean, padded, surface so that the dust rolls down. Once your painting is safely secured, dust it in a back and forth motion until the entirety of the painting is clean.


Do not dust your painting if the paint is chipping or cracking.Do not use conventional feather dusters or rough cloths to prevent scratches.
Don’t use water, sprays, or cleaners that may interact with the varnish or paint.;
, Moisture can destroy and warp a painting and its frame, so it’s important that you store paintings carefully. Use tissue paper, breathable sheets, or foam to protect your oil paintings while you store them. Avoid using material like bubble wrap because it can trap moisture in.Make sure that the painting has air circulation.
Store it in an area that is not prone to bugs, animals, or dust.

, This is especially important if your painting is damaged, flaking, cracking, or peeling. Painting Conservators have years of experience and will be able to preserve and restore your painting without affecting its value. They can also give you additional tips on preservation while you store or display the painting at home.


To find a licenced conservator, visit the website for the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, or the AIC., Before re-varnishing a painting, make sure you consult with a professional so they can advise you. Varnish protects the paint in your art by locking out dirt and dust. It also evens out the appearance of oil paintings.Use a flat varnishing brush and apply the varnish from the top, working your way down the oil painting in a crisscross pattern. Use a flat surface to work on, and don’t apply the varnish vertically. Make sure to cover the entire painting, and let it dry in a warm, dust free room.Virtually all oil paintings are varnished, and over time, need to be re-varnished.

If you can afford it, stick to well known brands such as Lexar and SanDisk.",How to Add Memory to a Digital Camera," The majority of cameras are only compatible with one type of card.;
, This will depend on the resolution of your camera, whether you are shooting raw or JPEG and how many photos you take in one outing. You can easily work this out by seeing how large the photos you are taking are, and multiplying this figure by the amount of photos you are likely to take in a single outing.

, This refers to the amount of memory on the card, not the physical size. Some cameras will have a limit as to how large the card can be.

Avoid stacking paintings on top of each other when moving or storing them, as this can easily damage them and reduce their value.If a painting is too large for you to move yourself, have a friend help.
Never lean your painting against a sharp object, or something that could scratch it.

, If you are transporting a painting, wash your hands and avoid touching the surface of the art.Use both hands and lift the painting by the frame with your hands securely centered on each side of the frame.


The natural oils in your hands can leave fingerprints and damage a painting's value., Hanging jewelry or wearing other sharp stones could potentially scratch or poke the surface of your painting.Poking the backside of a canvass can create a bulge that will create spider-web cracks along the surface of your art., A faulty frame could cause the painting to fall out of your hands and get damaged. Frame keys are small triangular wedges that regulate the dimensions of the stretcher frame and can fall out over time. Make sure to replace these by inserting new ones if they fall out.You can buy framing keys at most art stores.

Exposing your paintings to heat could create cracking and blistering.
Keep the temperature at 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit (21-24 degrees Celsius)., Avoid areas with high moisture or humidity like a damp basement, attic, bathroom, or kitchen.Damp areas could cause mold to grow on your art which will need to be removed by a professional.
Keep the humidity level between 40% and 60%.Purchasing a dehumidifier can help you regulate humidity in your house.

, UV lights are used to inspect paintings for restoration work, but should not be used over prolonged periods of time.The reflection of the UV light on the surface of the painting can create cracking or lifting.When you're inspecting your expensive painting, make sure that when you're done, you turn off all the UV lights that were used to inspect it.


Certain dyes and colorants used in oil paint will fade and dull over time, if exposed to UV lights., Never screw your painting into the wall using drywall. Use a stud finder to find wooden studs, then use painting hooks to secure your painting to the wall. Make sure that it’s secure and doesn’t tilt or move to one side. The painting hooks will prevent the art from falling, which could damage your art and your wall.


Make sure to use a tape measure and level when hanging art.
Never drill directly into the frame unless you have frame screws.
Do not use nails with your expensive art.

, A glass or plexiglass encasement is an added precaution you can take when displaying valuable paintings. This will preserve them from dust, or any unwanted fingerprints that may occur in an open area.Museum grade glass and certain plexiglass also come with UV filtering, to prevent the painting from being damaged from prolonged exposure to sunlight.Regular glass is heavier and easier to break, but plexiglass is a polymer which may interact with your oil painting over a long period of time.

",How to Buy a Waterproof Digital Camera," Waterproof cameras differ greatly in use and price. Common uses include photographs of hiking, boating, swimming, snorkeling and scuba-diving.


For example, you should know to what depth you need to be able to use it. If you only need it for the pool and outdoor sports, a depth of 10 feet (3.0 m) should be adequate, but if you need it for scuba diving, its depth should be substantially more.;
, Questions that need to be asked include:


How deep will you be going?
What budget do you have to work with?
What sort of photos will you be taking? Stills? Maybe creatures moving through their natural underwater environment?

, Point-and-shoot cameras tend to be smaller, less expensive and good for every day use. SLR digital cameras are more expensive and are used for professional-quality photography.

, Digital waterproof cameras can differ in price between $100 to thousands of dollars.

, Go to a photography shop to get information about the best models for high-quality photographs, if you plan to print or sell these pictures. Go to an electronics store or an online site to look at the available models for lower cost every-day use.


Go to snapsort.com to look through popular cameras based on your uses. This is a good starting point to begin reading about cameras and what they offer. Then you can move to electronics stores or Amazon to see what prices are being offered at different outlets.
Look for cameras that have 7 to 10 megapixels. Waterproof digital cameras generally do not have very advanced zoom functions so it is important that the resolution is good to begin with.
If you are looking for an underwater digital camera for scuba diving, popular models are likely to range between 2 and 4 megapixels. Some models can be mounted above your mask. Popular models include the SeaLife Reefmaster DC250 and the Sea & Sea USA AquaPix digital camera. These are very specialized models that are only available through Scuba stores or online.

, These are available at reviews.photographyreview.com, dpreview.com/reviews and other sites.

, Some websites suggest that the best time to buy an old-model camera is in March because manufacturers are looking to get rid of old merchandise before the new models arrive. Best Buy, Sears and local electronics stores may also have Black Friday or after Christmas specials.

, These stores often sell the camera with a case or an extra lens at a reduced price.

, Give preference to places that return and exchange, rather than just exchange. Look for a warranty of at least 1 year, in case the camera breaks.

, This will allow you to track and return it more easily. Also consider buying a neck or hand strap or case to ensure it stays in good condition and follows the warranty.

Lay over the felt piece in readiness for drawing and painting on., You can either mark this directly onto the fabric, or use tracing paper and transfer the image to the fabric., Place it on your index finger. For smoothing the paint, use the nib and rub the paint in the same manner as you'd mix sugar into milk., Start applying the paint from nib onto the cloth, in its respective place.

While painting, you will note that it appears like a line. You have to paint like this all over, continuously adding more lines to form the image parts.
You can mix two colors while painting, to get beautiful shading in the scenery or image.

, For example, if small flowers are to be painted, use a round nib. Just keep the nib in the paint and make sure not much paint is settled on the top of the nib. Press the nib where the petals of a small flower or a cloud are to be made.

Take your time. There is no need to finish the painting at one sitting. You can take several days to complete it, as desired.

Dispose of materials properly.",How to Clean Oil Paint Brushes," Plan to clean your oil brush as soon as you are done using it. Do so even if you intend on coming back to your painting project in the near future. Always clean your brush promptly to ensure a thorough job with minimum damage to the bristles.If you are going to resume painting shortly, don’t soak your brush in paint thinner in the meantime as a substitute for cleaning. Over time, paint thinner will eat away at the glue that binds the bristles to the handle.
Although oil paints dry at a slower rate than other types, it is still easier to clean your brush before they have a chance to dry at all.;
, Set up your cleaning station before you begin painting. Have a pair of cleaning gloves and protective eyewear ready to protect yourself from chemicals. Lay out newspaper, old towels, or drop cloths to keep surfaces clean., Make sure you have what is needed before you really need it. Guarantee a quick and easy clean-up without having to search for this or that while the paint dries in your brush. At the very least, you will need:Cleaning rags, newspaper sheets, paper towels, or similar materials
One sealable container with a lid.
Paint thinner (mineral spirits or turpentine, depending on your medium) or safflower oil
Soap (preferably designed specifically for paint brushes; if not, dish-washing soap or shampoo is acceptable), Use your cleaning rags or similar material. Wrap it around the metal where the bristles connect with the brush (known as a “ferrule”). Squeeze with moderate pressure so the paint is pushed out of bristles at end of stroke








Pinch the base of the brush’s bristles through your cleaning rag.
Drag your fingers over the bristles from their base to the tip while maintaining pressure.
Repeat as needed with clean sections of your rag until no more paint drips off the tip.

, First, pour either paint thinner or safflower oil into your container.Fill the bottom until it is deep enough to submerge the brush’s head. Dunk the bristles into the liquid. Then:









Brush the bottom of the container to dislodge paint.
Remove the bristles from the liquid.
Squeeze out more excess paint as before. You can gently push the brush on the side of the jar if it doesn't seem that the spirits saturated it, but don't swish too much.
Be cautious as you clean, since excess paint will now be runnier. Try to keep the spirits transparent when wetting the brush in thinner.

, To be as thorough as can be, set up two more containers. Fill their bottoms with more thinning agent. Thin your brush’s paint in the second container and squeeze it clean as before. Then repeat with the third container. Note that the liquid in each container should appear less clouded by paint than the one before, with the third appearing relatively clear.








Be aware that your brush will still appear stained by the paint afterward. This is normal., First, squirt some liquid soap into one palm. Hold the brush by your other hand. Dip the bristles into the soap and brush them back and forth across your palm. Then:








This is where you can submerge the brush. Notice that this is water, however, and not a harsh, chemical solvent. Also, be careful at how hot the water is in this stage as this can warm up the glue holding the bristles together inside the ferrule, which can deteriorate it as well.
Continue brushing until a lather forms.Stop once the lather turns the same color as your paint.
Rinse the brush and your hand under warm water.
Repeat until the lather no longer turns color.

, As before, use a clean rag or similar materials. Wrap it around the ferrule and push out any remaining soap or paint.If the bristles still seem to hold a lot of soap, rinse them more thoroughly and repeat. If they hold any paint, wash and rinse again.









The bristles may still appear stained, even after cleaning. This is to be expected and does not mean they’re still dirty., If it is a flat or fan brush, the flat side should be down, parallel to the floor. If the brush isn't huge or heavy and has some memory to its bristles, let it hang off of the edge of a flat surface just at the ferrule. .









Drying your brush thoroughly will prevent mildew from growing. A few wipes is usually all that's needed, unless it's a thick watercolor brush. Most often, however, if you've purchased a $70 number 7 sable watercolor brush, you will get a lot more life out of it if you stick to watercolors with it. This leads to optional step 7.
If you're in a hurry, aim a fan at the bristles. They should be dry unless they're any bigger than an inch and a half. Continue pressing and blotting the bristles with clean rags or similar material as before to remove all moisture. Use new sections of rag or new rags each time so you can tell how wet they are afterward. Continue until the rag remains dry after use.

, Use your fingers to gently press the bristles at their base. Sculpt back into their original shape.Always work from the base to the tip to avoid squashing your bristles.








, If your brush is old, gauge how dry and coarse the bristles have become as you reshape them. If they feel brittle, wet them again. Then use your fingers to rub in a tiny dab of hair conditioner. Rinse, dry, and reshape your brush afterward.








Apply this technique sparingly, only when necessary. Applying conditioner each and every time you wash your brush will cause the bristles to grow misshapen.
If you need your brushes to be dry and not oily (or waxy-feeling) upon returning to the studio, you may want to skip this step. However, conditioning your brushes should extend their lifespan.
You can also condition with mineral oil, or a product from an art-supply store. Don't trust the brush-restorers at hardware stores, as they'll eat brushes nearly down to the ferrule; they're made for contractors' commercial paintbrushes, not yours. Your brush will never be restored to store-bought quality, but the process can still help.

, If possible, use a container with a lid to keep moths out.Stand the brush upright with the bristles on top to preserve their shape. When storing several brushes in one container, be sure that you can reach the handle of each one without disturbing the bristles of any surrounding brushes. Use more than one container to ensure this if necessary., Seal the container and let the liquid rest overnight. Wait for the paint to settle to the bottom. Then pour the clear liquid on top into a second container. Seal and label both containers.Store them in a safe place out of reach of children or pets. Be aware that paint thinner is flammable, so keep it away from flames, heat sources, and excessive heat.For future projects, dump your dirty thinner into the container with the paint remnants.
Allow them separate and then transfer the clean liquid back into your thinner’s container.
Repeat until the container holding the separated paint is full.

, Contact your local government. Find out if and when they collect hazardous materials such as solvents and paint with curbside pickup. If they will not pick it up, ask where drop-offs are accepted. Do not dispose of such chemicals down a house drain, sewer, or into the ground, since they are toxic.Safflower oil (a cooking oil that is safe to dispose down the sink) makes a great substitute for paint thinner if disposing of hazardous chemicals correctly is too burdensome."

Use paper towel to squeeze most of the fresh oil paint out of the brush with a ferrule to tip pinching action.,
Place a 1/4 oz of baby oil in a shallow plastic container, dip the brush to coat it.,
Remove the baby oil out of the brush using a piece of clean paper towel, with a squeezing ferrule to tip pinching action.,
The baby oil left in the synthetic and natural hair brushes prevents any residual oil paint left in the brushes from drying, no matter how long you leave it between paintings, and also conditions your brushes, your hands, etc.

",How to Clean and Store Artist's Oil Brushes With Baby Oil," This will not work for already dried in oil paint.;
, Do not swish it around in the baby oil, as this will cloud up the oil and you will not know when your brush is really clean.

, Repeat dipping and pinching action, until brush no longer leaves paint residue in the paper towel and is wiping out clean.

Add mineral spirits to a small non-plastic bowl.,
Dip the brush in the mineral spirits and run back forth on your hand.,
Pour some dishwashing soap on the brush and rub it in.,
Squeeze out the liquid from the brush.,
Rinse the brush under hot water.,
Dip the brush into the mineral spirits and add dishwashing soap again.,
Place the brush on folded paper towel and squeeze out the excess liquid.",How to Clean Oil‐Based Paint1," To help thin the oil paint on your brushes, you’ll need a paint solvent. Odorless mineral spirits work well, so fill a small glass or ceramic bowl with a small amount of the liquid and place it in the sink where you plan to clean the brushes.You can also use turpentine to remove oil-based paint from brushes. However, it has an extremely strong odor so it’s important to ensure that you’re working in a well-ventilated area.;
, When you’re ready to clean the brush, submerge it in the bowl of mineral spirits to ensure that all of the dirty bristles are coated. Next, rub the brush back and forth against your hand to work the mineral spirits into the bristles.Make sure that you rub both sides of the brush over your hand to ensure that you work the minerals spirits into all of the oil-based paint stains.

, After you’ve worked the minerals spirits into the brush, squeeze a small amount of dishwashing liquid soap onto the bristles. Use your fingers to vigorously rub it into the brush.Any dishwashing liquid soap that is marketed as being able to cut through grease will work for cleaning your brushes.
The precise amount of dishwashing soap that you’ll need will depend on how large the brush is and how dirty they are. Aim for a 1- to 2-inch (25- to 50-mm) dollop of the liquid.

, Once you’ve worked the dishwashing liquid into the brush, use your fingers to carefully squeeze all of the excess liquid from the bristles. Try to remove as much of the paint, mineral spirits, and dishwashing soap residue from the brush as possible as you wring it out., After you’ve removed as much of the liquid from the brush as you can, turn the water on in the sink and let it run for 30 seconds or so until it’s hot. Run the brush under the water to rinse it clean, and squeeze it again to ensure that you remove all of the lingering residue.If the brush is extremely dirty or the paint stains are old, you may need to repeat all of these steps two or more times to remove all of the paint.

, When you’ve removed all of the paint that you can from the brush, submerge it in the mineral spirits again. Next, squirt a pea-size amount of dishwashing liquid on it and work both into the spirits and soap into the bristles with your fingers.After you’ve worked the cleansers into the brush this time, do not rinse them out.

, With the minerals spirits and dishwashing liquid still on the brush, set it down on a folded piece of paper towel. Squeeze the paper towel around the bristles to remove the any remaining liquid. Leave the brush out to air dry completely.Leaving the film of minerals spirits and dishwashing liquid on the brush to dry will help keep the bristles soft so it’s like new when you use it the next time.

Combine lemon essential oil and coconut oil.,
Rub the mixture all over the affected skin.,
Wash your skin with soap and water.",How to Clean Oil‐Based Paint2," To create a cleanser to remove the paint from your skin, add a small scoop of coconut oil and 2 to 3 drops of lemon essential oil to a bowl. Mix the ingredients well to ensure that they’re thoroughly combined.You can use any type of oil, such as olive oil, jojoba oil, or canola oil, to help break down the oil-based paint. Coconut oil usually work best because it is solid at room temperature so it won’t make as big a mess as you rub it into your skin.
The amount of coconut oil that you’ll need depends on how much paint is on your skin. Start with a small amount and add more if the paint isn’t coming off.
Adding the lemon essential oil is optional. However, it is believed to be an extremely effective cleanser so it may help the paint come off more easily.

, After you’ve mixed the coconut oil and lemon essential oil, use your fingers to apply the mixture to the areas where the paint has stained your skin. Massage the coconut oil into your skin until the paint breaks down and comes off.If all of the paint isn’t coming off, add a little more coconut oil to your skin to help break down the remaining paint.

, After you’ve removed the paint with the coconut oil, use your usual hand or body soap and water to clean the residue from your skin. Pat your skin dry, and follow up with a moisturizing lotion to keep your skin from drying out.If you have a lot of paint on your skin, you may need to repeat the cleaning process two or more times to remove all of it.

Scrape off the paint and blot the fabric.,
Rinse the stain with water.,
Blot the affected area with turpentine.,
Apply dishwashing liquid to the stain and allow it to sit overnight.,
Rinse the fabric.,
Launder the item as usual.",How to Clean Oil‐Based Paint3," As soon as you notice that you’ve gotten oil-based paint on fabric, use a utility knife, plastic knife, or even a piece of sturdy cardboard to scrape it off. Next, blot the paint stain with a clean white cloth or rag to absorb any excess moisture from the paint stain.It’s important to use a white cloth to blot the paint stain to ensure that no dye transfer from the cloth to the fabric that you’re cleaning.

, After you’ve scraped off and blotted the paint from the fabric, use warm or hot water to rinse the area. You can squeeze the excess moisture from the fabric afterward, but don’t allow it to dry completely.Check the care instructions for the fabric that you’re cleaning. Use the hottest water appropriate to rinse the paint stain.

, Once you’ve rinsed the fabric, place it on a clean white towel. Use a clean white cloth to blot the area with turpentine to help lift the paint stain from the fabric.Turpentine may cause some fabrics to fade. Test a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric to ensure that it won’t be damaged.
If you don’t want to use turpentine to blot the stain, you can use minerals spirits.
You may need to blot the stain with turpentine several times to remove all of the paint.

, After you’ve blotted the stain with the turpentine, rub a small amount of dishwashing liquid over the remaining stain. Next, place the fabric is a tub or bucket filled with warm water and allow it to soak overnight.Use a dishwashing liquid that’s designed to cut grease.
You can soak the fabric in a sink if you prefer.

, When you’re finished soaking the fabric overnight, remove it from the tub or bucket. Use warm water to rinse the dishwashing liquid from the stain in the sink. , After you’ve rinsed the fabric, wash it your washing machine.

Buy linseed stand oil and turpentine from an art store.,
Pour stand oil into a mixing jar.,
Add two parts turpentine for one part of the oil you're using.,
Stir the glazing medium.,
Explore different oil and turpentine combinations.The small differences in ingredient proportions will result in slightly different finishes.",How to Make Your Own Glazing Medium for Oil Painting1," If you don't have ingredients handy yet, everything you need may be purchased at a local art store. Turpentine and linseed stand oil may be used for a standard oil glaze. Two parts turpentine should be used for each part of stand oil you use. Although linseed and flaxseed oil come from the same plant and are similar, linseed stand oil might have additives to improve its paint-cleaning abilities.Because glaze is used in relatively small amounts, you should use the smallest containers available, so long as you're able to get the proportions right. Empty and cleaned baby food jars (about 2 to 4 ounces) are a good size to use.
Poppy seed oil, walnut oil and other types of linseed oil will work as well. However, these alternatives result in slightly yellowing your painting.
Mineral spirits may be used in lieu of turpentine if you don't have turpentine available.;
, Most artists will only need a small amount of glazing medium, so you'll want to create about 2 to 4 ounces of glazing medium. To make this amount, start by pouring about 1 ounce of your linseed stand oil into a resealable airtight jar. Be sure to use a jar that has a screw-top lid so that you can simply screw it on and save unused oil for future use.Use caution when handling the linseed oil, since it is highly flammable. If you use any rags to wipe up linseed oil, avoid simply throwing them in the trash since they can spontaneously combust. Instead, soak any linseed oil rags in jar filled with water and take them to a local hazardous waste site for disposal.The jar used for mixing should be cleaned out and dried prior to mixing anything. Choose a small jar so that your glazing medium isn't exposed to too much air which could cause it to dry out more quickly.

, Add twice as much turpentine to the jar as the stand oil you added. So, if you've placed 1 ounce of stand oil in your jar, add 2 ounces of turpentine. These two ingredients combined will give you a basic glaze to work with in your paintings.Linseed oil is quite thick so you'll need less oil in comparison to the amount of turpentine needed.

, Take a wooden stick (like a craft stick) or use the end of an old paint brush and stir the turpentine and oil. The mixture will need a lot of stirring to combine it. As soon as you've combined the glaze, you can begin to use it (especially because it will begin to separate). You can use the medium directly out of the jar, or pour a small amount into a saucer to use.Avoid shaking the glaze. Vigorous shaking will introduce air bubbles into your glaze which could be transferred to your paint. Air bubbles will cause your paint to dry poorly.

, While linseed oil is typically seen as the go-to oil to use in homemade glazes, many other oils can be used as well. If you want to experiment, you may find certain glazes achieve a different end than others. If you're interested in working with different glaze combinations, you should make multiple batches at the same time. You'll be able to compare them directly with one another this way.


Glazes will also respond differently based on the makeup of the paint you are using.

For cleaning paintings, always make sure that the brush you are using is made of soft bristles.,
For cleaning the back of the painting, first remove the painting from its frame and put it down carefully on a clean surface.

,
Now with the help of a small nozzle with a brush attachment, vacuum the dirt slowly and carefully.

,
If necessary, you can place a paper cover on the back of the painting to prevent dust from getting accumulated there.

,
If the varnish of the oil painting is looking aged, buy a gentle solvent known as ‘conservation liquid’ to clean it.

,
Before using the solvent directly on the painting, first test the reaction of the solvent by applying it on just one corner.

,
If the solvent is good, put the painting in an area with sufficient ventilation.

,
Now apply the solvent very carefully on the surface of the painting with the help of a cotton swab.

,
For removing the surface dirt, use cotton swabs dampened with distilled water.,
In case the painting is showing signs of cracks or loose flakes, carefully dust the surface with the help of an extremely spongy and dry bristle brush such as a baby toothbrush or shaving cream brush.

,
And if the surface of the oil painting is muggy, dirty or oily use a gentle detergent solution.,
For recently done modern paintings, make sure that your oil painting is free of built-up dirt, smoke, pet hair, dander, as well as bacteria or any fungal growth.

,
For cleaning oil paintings covered in dust or yellowed varnish, look for a qualified professional.

",How to Clean Oil Paintings to Preserve It for Years," Soft brushes remove the dirt accumulated on the painting without damaging the painting.;

Don't fuss over small mistakes.,
Complete the painting with highlights and shadows.,
Add a backwash (optional).",How to Oil Paint Faces," Choose a painting of a face that you admire. Load it into Photoshop or another image editor, so you can zoom in and study how the artist created the work.

Zoom in so you can see pixels then use the color dropper tool to select various areas of color. This gives you a sense of which colors make up different areas of the face or skin tones.
Note that your software's color chart will only help you out if you can set it to the RYB color model used in painting.;
, To guide your painting, start with a sketch. While practicing, you may want to create a watercolor under painting as well, if the surface is suitable for both watercolor and oil. This will give you a guide for the oil painting process.

Alternatively, create a fairly light, neutral color mix such as burnt ochre, yellow, and white. Add mineral turpentine until watery, then draft the features onto the canvas. This mix is is transparent and dries quickly, so you can easily paint over it. If you make a mistake, gently dab it away with a dry cloth.

, You don't need to know everything in advance, but get a sense of what the painting will look like. Where is the light coming from? What expression will you paint on the face? Pay special attention to these areas, which are tricky to paint and can drastically change the effect of the painting:

Position of the nose relative to the eyes, and its contours
Hair style
Eyebrows

, To mix a skin tone, try one part carmine red, one part cadmium yellow, and one part ultramarine blue to make brown. Add titanium white gradually until you have the desired color. Use quite a lot of paint, so you have a baseline which you can alter for different parts of the face.

Too much white can make the skin look grey. If you want a much lighter skin tone, add a little more yellow.
Oil paints are difficult to mix on the painting without muddying them together. Pre-mix the colors you'll be using on your palette before you begin.

, This can be made from any material, but a natural sable brush works particularly well for smooth skin textures., Beginning painters often put too much paint on the canvas. Always use just enough paint to cover a small space. This will make it much easier to correct mistakes., Look at your sketch and imagine it as a three dimensional object, with the light coming from a particular direction. The lowest, shadowed areas of the face will use the darkest colors. Start with these, and avoid muddying them with any lighter colors., When painting an elevated, well-lit area of the face, start by placing your lightest color in the center of the area, furthest from the areas of the face that will remain darker., Clean the brush so there is little to no paint left on it, then gradually work colors together where they border each other., To achieve realistic depth, you'll need to layer lighter tones several times. Try working from the outside in on the lighter areas, making each layer smaller and more centralized.

To emphasize shadows and contours, mix together two complementary colors, plus a little bit of white. (You should get a subtle grey that doesn't overpower your painting.) Apply a tiny bit to the wet paint and blend with your paintbrush.

, Oil paint is a forgiving medium, although it takes a long time to master. You can paint over the same area several times as long as you avoid building it up too thick. More importantly, accept that you will be learning with every painting. Identifying a mistake and an alternate approach is part of the path to improving as a painter.

If the mistake cannot be fixed by blending, wait patiently for it to dry before you paint over it.

, Pure white highlights and pure black shadows improve the contrast of the painting. Add these once you are satisfied with the composition of the painting., This is especially useful if you drafted the painting with a turpentine mix, and it ends up visible outside the borders of the face. To cover this, or just for aesthetic effect, mix mineral turpentine into colors of your choice until watery and somewhat transparent. Use a thick brush to apply this to the background, working in downward strokes from the top of the canvas. Never soak the brush or let the mixture drip onto the portrait, as turpentine can wipe away your oil paint.

Green, turquoise, and blue are common choices for a backwash that makes the face stand out.

Purchase linseed oil, turpentine and Damar varnish.,
Pour the ingredients together into a sealable jar.,
Stir the glazing medium.,
Add a few drops of lavender oil to your glaze just before using it.Use 3 drops of lavender oil per ounce of glaze you are making.",How to Make Your Own Glazing Medium for Oil Painting2," A Damar varnish glaze will give your painting a much stronger shine than the basic turpentine formula. A basic formula is two parts turpentine, one part linseed oil, and 1 part damar varnish. So, you'll need 2 ounces turpentine, 1 ounce linseed oil, and 1 ounce of damar varnish.All of these ingredients may be found at a local arts and crafts supplies store.
This will make about 4 ounces of damar varnish glaze. Depending on how heavily you apply your glaze, this may be too much. Consider making half of this amount and making more as needed.

, A clear jar is optimal, as it will allow you to observe the ingredient proportions and the mixing process. Take caution while you pour in the ingredients, as turpentine and varnish are flammable. It helps to know the capacity of the jar prior to mixing them. That way, you can fill it up according to the glaze's desired proportions.


If you use any rags to wipe up linseed oil, avoid simply throwing them in the trash since they can spontaneously combust. Instead, soak any linseed oil rags in jar filled with water and take them to a local hazardous waste site for disposal., Take a wooden stick (like a craft stick) or use the end of an old paint brush and stir the turpentine and oil. You can stir the mixture after adding each ingredient so that the glaze combines well. Once the mixture is combined, you can begin to use the glaze. You can use the medium directly out of the jar, or pour a small amount into a saucer to use.Don't shake the jar too much before using it. Vigorous shaking will introduce air bubbles into your glaze which could be transferred to your paint. Instead, stir the glaze right before using it.

, Adding this to the glaze right before using it will give the glaze a thicker body, as well as improve the ""wet time"" that the artist can work within while painting.


Look for oil of spike lavender at most fine art supply stores.

Pour a small amount of glaze onto a palette.,
Add paint and glaze together on the brush.,
Consider using multiple types of glaze in a project.,
Allow your painting ample time to dry.,
Use glaze in moderation.,
Seal the medium when not in use.",How to Make Your Own Glazing Medium for Oil Painting3," Because glaze is used in relatively small quantities (only an ounce or two at a time), you should pour out a small amount into the palette you're using to paint with.


Make sure to keep it separate from other paints and mixtures.

, Dip your brush in glaze, then add the paint you are using for the area. Combining glaze and paint on the brush will help ensure that the glaze matches the shape you want to have emphasized.


You should use a high-quality artist's brush in order to get the best effects from your glaze.

, Different combinations of oil will result in different transparencies and shine. Because of this, it may be worthwhile to experiment with a few different types of glaze in your work.


Using poppy seed oil, for instance, will result in a yellow tinge, which may be desired if you want your painting to look artificially aged.

, Using a glaze with stand oil means your painting will take significantly longer to dry. Because of this, you should allow a full week for an oil glazed painting to properly settle. If you don't want to wait as long, you can minimize your use of glaze, or even go without it entirely., Glaze should be used as a way to accent important aspects of the painting's foreground. The effect is lost if you glaze your painting excessively. Try to limit your glaze to the shapes you want to pop out at the viewer.You can also apply several light layers of glaze so you have more control. If you apply multiple layers, you may need to mix up more glaze.

, In order to keep the glaze fresh and useable, keep it sealed whenever you're not using it. It is good to keep the glaze sealed in the jar you made it in.When stored in an airtight jar, glazing medium will last several weeks up to a few months. If exposed to air, your glaze will dry out.

Remember, money is skill.,
After looking at a photographer's samples, give them a call (assuming they are in your price range).,
Email to set up a time, and be sure they are responsive.,
After you feel comfortable that your photographer is responsible and easy to work with, it's a good idea to see if you can meet with him or her before the session as well.,
On the day of the shoot, the best thing to do is to take things lightly; don't be too worried about trying to get the perfect shot, because it will come if you give the photographer enough time.

",How to Choose the Right Headshot Photographer," But not always! Sometimes someone who is a natural at photography and is just getting started in the business can give you great headshots for a low price! But always look at their samples first, because you don't want to spend even $20 if what you are getting back is absolutely useless.;
, You can email them but it's a much better idea to call because you want to get an idea of what kind of person they are by talking to them over the phone. Do they have time for you? Do they even care? Don't work with them if they don't seem to be interested in talking to you, or if they seem to busy to want to deal with you. They probably won't end up giving you as good results as someone who really does care about giving you the most for your money.

, This goes for any professional you might be working with: if they take more than two days to respond, that's not a good sign. You need to always feel comfortable knowing that they are prepared and ready to serve you. You're paying them, so why should you be worried that they might not show up?

, But many photographers are very busy and can't offer their time like that. If it is an option, however, it can be good to get to know them better and see if you get along well. The photographer should be able to make you laugh and you should feel comfortable around him/her, as it is the only way you will get good pictures.

Write down what your primary goal is.,
Write down how many times you expect to be using the camera.,
Write down how much you want to spend.,
Decide if you want analog or digital.",How to Choose a Camera1," Why do you need a camera? If all you need is a camera for vacation snapshots, then a cheaper model might be better for you.;
, The more you use it, the more likely you are to upgrade your camera. Buy nice or buy twice.

, This is a good way to gauge what quality of camera you will be buying. Don't be afraid to go a little over so that you can get a camera that you will keep much longer.

, Both types have pluses and minuses:



Analog (film camera): Now that a good number of hobbyists and professionals are going digital, film cameras have the advantage of being extremely cheap compared to a digital camera of the same quality. Film cameras do not have the same issues with noise as low-range digital cameras, though of course you get grain from the film. On the other hand, developing film can get expensive if you're taking lots of photos. Bear in mind that you might want to include a good-quality scanner in your budget.

Digital: The main advantage of digital cameras is the ability to view the pictures that you have taken right after taking the shot. This results in not wasting money on unwanted prints and you can retake a shot if needed. A beginner should almost invariably buy a digital camera, not necessarily an expensive one though something with available manual control such as a mid-range point and shoot or low-end or old DSLR is good, since the process of improving generally involves taking a great many bad photos and seeing what went wrong. Digital cameras let one get through this process quickly and unconstrained by budget. You can also print and edit any picture you want. These days, you can go to Kodak or cord camera's website and upload your pictures and they'll send you prints for about 15 cents a pop. It's much cheaper to have a picture (or group of pictures) printed by a commercial printer than to print it yourself on an inkjet printer.

Familiarize yourself with the difference between SLR and Point and Shoot


Point and shoot cameras are just what they sounds like: you point your camera at the subject, zoom in or out, then press the button to take the picture.,
Look at your needs.,
SLR cameras comes in digital and analog formats.,
If you are not sure about making photography your hobby, get a point and shoot with advanced options.",How to Choose a Camera2," Such cameras require very little effort on the part of the photographer; they typically focus themselves and adjust themselves to light conditions.
An SLR (single-lens reflex) camera, on the other hand, is the sort of thing you see professional photographers use. With a DSLR (and many SLRs), you have total control over the photograph. You can adjust the shutter speed alone, the aperture alone, change the ISO speed to whatever you want, or just use it like a large point and shoot. Unlike point and shoot cameras, you can use interchangeable lenses. This means that you have a wide range of lenses to choose from depending on the manufacturer. The downsides of DSLRs are that they weigh more and don't record videos.

, Do your needs really match up with what a SLR has to offer? Unless you're either experienced with an SLR or willing to learn the basics of using one, you don't need an SLR. As Bas Scheffers writes, ""n general, unless you have been using an SLR for years as advanced amateur or professional, if you need to read this article to learn about digital photography, you are not ready for a digital SLR. You have been warned.""SLRs also hit the wallet a little harder too. On the other hand, if you have any desire to capture fast moving kids/pets, the shutter lag of a point and shoot will make it impossible, and the only thing that can capture them is a DSLR.

, With a digital SLR, you don't have to pay for film and developing fees, can experiment more freely, and can instantly see the picture after you take it. However, film SLRs can be purchased at a lower price and the cost of taking a picture can be help improve your photography skills because you'll be thinking more about if the picture can be further improved.

, They are not as expensive as an DSLR, but do give you the ability to experiment with different settings.

Understand.,
Nature Is Mighty Beautiful.,
Technique


Landscapes.,
Show the mood.,
Experiment and practise.",How to Capture the Perfect Shot," In order to achieve a good shot, you must know how a photograph will be perfect. Different fields of photography have different criterion.


Landscapes are meant to show simply the beauty of nature. The most important criteria in landscape photographs is the light and background. These two factors are differently used to express sadness, happiness, might, peace etc. in the landscape.
Portraits are where the society is shown by taking pictures that represent the different sections of society, divided on the basis of age, occupation and social stature. These photos mainly consist of one or two people at a time. The main effort is to create a vast emotion through the photograph. These photographs often depict tales about the person. Their miseries, sorrows, happiness etc. are captured in one frame. In order to achieve such influential photos, the colors and sharpness along with the background are shown with great emphasis. A boy who performs tricks for people at a bus stop and lives right on the footpath would be depicted with a monotone or low contrast with a blur street in the background and the boy in his costume. These photos must capture the natural expressions.
In wildlife photography, the background, expression and subject play an important role. The animals or birds must be highlighted in the background. The expression of might, focus, beauty, slyness, concentration, elegance, mischief, suffering, elegance or solitude must be clearly expressed.;
, You must always remember that nature is beautiful in every moment and that each moment once gone, never comes back.

, When taking the a photo that consists of land and sun/moon, try using a wide angle lens i.e. between 18 to 250mm. This way you can capture a wider image. Adding filters can also help in a better contrast and sharpness. Landscapes can be used to express beauty or harshness. They need a lot of patience and can not be fully controlled because we can't control the weather and nature.
Social and Portrait Photography. Manipulation with contrasts and detailed sharpness are required. These photos can create a deep impression if taken properly. This type of photography consists of portraits and journalism. You can use this type of photography for displaying the various characteristics of a person or society.
Wildlife Photography. In this type of photography requires wast amount of traveling and sharp images. The subject must always be highlighted in a suitable environment. To show sadness you should have a deserted background. The creature must represent itself the way people think it to be eg: lion shows death or elegance, elephants bathing show relaxation etc.

, By adjusting the color scheme and contrast, you can change the mood. You must also try to be completely in this subject so that you can even make a useless image into a masterpiece.

, Try different things like adjusting the saturation, contrast, color scheme, focal length etc. This way you can improve and excel.

"
"
Improve clarity and provide lens protection.,
Reduce glare and improve saturation.,
Extend exposure time.,
Change white balance.",How to Choose a Lens Filter1," Try a UV filter. UV filters are mostly used to protect the camera lens. It’s much cheaper and easier to replace a UV filter than to replace a broken glass.;
, Try a CPL, or circular polarizer, filter. CPL filters can darken skies, manage reflections, and suppress glare from water bodies. Rotating a CPL filter on your lens can make dramatic changes to a simple image.

, Try an ND, or neutral density, filter. ND filters reduce the amount of light entering the lens. This makes it easier to achieve effects such as a shallower depth of field or blurred motion.

, Try a warming or cooling filter. These filters adjust the white balance by compensating for different light sources. By adjusting the white balance, the image will appear different in color than what they actually look like.


Managing white balance can be easily done during post-processing, especially with digital cameras.

"
"
Shoot landscape and nature.,
Shoot bodies of water.,
Shoot areas with special lighting.",How to Choose a Lens Filter2," CPL filters are good for skies, waters, foliage, and the like. They can dramatically enhance these natural elements, giving images better appearance.

, ND filters are good for rivers, waterfalls, and other bodies of water, especially under bright light. The longer exposure times allows for smoother water movements, shallower depth of field, and blurred motion.

, Warming or cooling filters adjust the white balance by compensating for different light sources. They have cool- or warm-colored tints that can compensate for the actual light being received by the camera.

"
"
Check the lens size.,
Consider filter adapters.",How to Choose a Lens Filter3," Lens sizes are expressed in diameters, which are usually listed on top of the camera lenses. The unit of measure is in millimeters.


Screw-on filters can only fit on lenses with the exact measurements.

, Filter adapters, whether step-down or step-up, can allow filters of a different size to be used on a lens. However, do note that vignetting may occur as the filters may block light at the edges."
"
Determine the focal length of your camera lens.,
Decide on the aperture setting you are going to use.,
Read the instruction manual that came with your camera.,
Set up your camera on a tripod facing the scene you are going to shoot.

,
Select your manual camera settings based on this chart.

",How to Calculate Hyper Focal Distance," Very simply, focal length depends on the type of lens you have on your camera. If you have a zoom lens it will be written on the lens barrel, for instance 100-400mm or 18-24mm. Typically, camera manufacturers produce a large variety of lenses ranging from 12mm to 135mm and every lens has the focal length written on the lens barrel. Not all lenses are zoom which means that the focal length is fixed, for instance, 17mm and means that you cannot zoom in and out, so if you want a closer shot you have to stand closer to the subject.;
, This means an aperture fstop number that is low, for instance, f8 will let in more light than a higher number like f22. Using a high number aperture like f22 means you will have to allow enough time for the light to reach the camera sensor so it is essential that that you use a tripod to avoid an out of focus shot.


Use a high 'f' number like f22 to have some of the foreground as well as infinity in focus -- best suited for landscape shots.
Use a low 'f' number like f8 for the shot to be more focused on the foreground, and the distant view less sharp.
Remember hyper focal distance is about maintaining sharp focus in the middle of the shot all the way to infinity.

, Some cameras will automatically select the correct speed depending on the aperture selected.

Know the brands.,
Check your computer's operating system and specs.,
Get an inkjet.,
Consider the features.,
Don't make the price your least priority, know your budget.,
Pick one -- Functionality or Quality?,
Consider some additional factors:


Media Handling - As a photo printer it should be able to support several types of media and specialty papers aside from typical glossy paper.,
Read Reviews and Customer feedback.",How to Choose a Printer for Photographic Printing," Not everyone's aware of all the printer brands available in the market. It is best to get yourself familiar with the most well known brands.(HP, Canon, Epson are some of the tech-giants in the Print Industry).;
, Nobody wants to purchase an exorbitantly priced machine only to find out it's not compatible with their PC/Laptop. You won't get much problem with PCs running Windows OS. Whilst there are brands for Mac and Linux that will most likely work, you might have to make a research. (Canon and Brother inkjet printers would be your best buddies).

, The thing is, what do you prefer -- single-function or multifunction?

, Wireless capability is a great factor, especially if it supports Cloud Printing. While for digital camera enthusiast, PictBridge support is a plus. Latest inkjet printers nowadays feature LCD touchscreen displays for previewing files and images. Your challenge is to look for the one with decent screen resolution, size and touch-sensitivity.

, Finally you found the model which you decided to purchase, but then it doesn't fit to your budget. Failure of expectations, avoid it. Filtering your criteria will tend to narrow your options, but it can't be helped especially for someone with a limited budget. But don't loose hope, if no retailer downtown can offer what you need, try to search online.

, These two factors should be in a nice balance. However, it still depends on how you weigh each factor. But don't let the functionality compromise with quality, and vice versa. For this matter, quality ranks higher than functionality. You need a printer that is mainly built for photographic printing. For example, prioritize how well a printer can produce quality image printouts, rather than how fast it can print images.

, If you're planning to use the printer for special printing purposes like labels and banners. Choose a model that supports various media sizes, preferably one that can print up to A4-sized images.
Print Speed - Inkjet printers are typically slow, but that issue was actually years ago. In fact, the most latest photo-printers in the market nowadays can churn out results at a speed comparable to a laserjet printer. A compact photo-printer with a rated speed of up to 3-4IPM (image per minute) is quite decent.
Paper Capacity - Unless you're planning to get a printer for business, then you should check this one. Otherwise, give it a low rank if you'll just use the printer for occasional photo printing or non-profit purposes. Nevertheless, don't ignore this printer spec. Photo-printers' paper capacity basically range from 100-200 sheets at standard.
Interfaces - These include a USB host/port, PictBridge port (for digital cameras), Memory Card slots, WiFi and Ethernet. You can get all of these in a single printer, just make sure your wallet is prepared for the spending.
Cost Per Page - Determine the overall running cost of a given printer.
Connectivity - It's either you get a wired or a wireless enabled printer, the choice is up to you. Perhaps knowing how many laptops, tablets and smartphones you do have at home or at the office will surely give you the hint.
Dye Sublimation & Pigmented Inks - Most inkjet printers today use dye sublimation ink, primarily it is the standard type used in photo-printers. Distinguishing characteristic between these two? Dye-based are in liquid form while pigment-based are in powder.

,


Make use of the Internet. Using a browser, type the brand of printer you most likely prefer. See their full list of ink jets suitable for photographic printing. There you'll find a lot of models and make that might suit your needs and demands. Also, read the customer feedback and comments below the product description. A word from your fellow consumers might do the talking whether it is worthy to purchase it or not.
Check out some printer review sites such as PC Magazine, CNET, Printer-Comparison, Trusted Reviews and many more. Find what suits your needs. These reviewing sites provide detailed product specs and information including the pros and cons of a given printer. Their verdicts are reliable which may help you decide on what to choose.

Only buy attachments you will absolutely need.,
Buy from a popular brand if you're still uncertain about quality.,
Buy a smartphone with high megapixels.,
Use your smartphone camera for well-lit, still photos.,
Know that smartphones can't store as many photos as your average digital camera.",How to Buy a Camera," Digital cameras can be simple, point-and-shoot devices about the size of a cellphone, or they can have multiple parts and provide more detailed photos.


Point-and-shoot cameras are the smallest models you'll find. They tend to have fewer buttons on the back, and consequently, also offer fewer customized settings like photo-cropping or zoom capabilities. However, this may not be a bad thing since auto-modes require less fuss and technical expertise.
There are always trade-offs when choosing a camera.If you want the best image possible, you'll need expensive, specialized, bulky equipment. However, cameras which offer more settings (like different levels of zoom, interchangeable lenses, wide angle shot capabilities) also require the most effort and ""know-how.""
A relatively cheap and highly recommended point-and-shoot camera is the Canon PowerShot Elph 330 HS, which can go for around $180.;
, SLR stands for ""single lens reflex"" and simply means that the camera uses one lens to capture photos rather two lenses, which is characteristic of most smaller cameras.A camera which requires two hands to steady it is likely a DSLR. These cameras are bigger, heavier, and more expensive than others. However, they also offer the largest image sensors (for higher resolutions), fastest focus speeds (for ""action"" shots), and a wide variety of lenses for controlling zoom and light exposure.
When you look through a DSLR lens, you are seeing exactly what will be captured. On two lens cameras, the lens you look through is different than the actual lens used to take the picture. Since DSLRs provide the most accurate picture with little margin of error, they are generally preferred among professional photographers.Another benefit of single lens cameras is that they capture photos almost instantly with no lag time. This is optimal for capturing moving objects, like children playing sports.DSLRs are the most optimal for professional use such as taking wedding photos or pictures for magazines.

, Mirrorless cameras lack a mirror to reflect the light from the image. Instead, the light passes right through the lens and directly onto the image sensor.


This model of camera is touted as a less bulkier version of the DSLR camera. While they usually require detachable lenses for zoom and light exposure control, they also tend to be more portable and easier to use than DSLR cameras.
Because these models lack a mirror system, they tend to be smaller and simpler to use, but they still yield resolutions which rival those of DSLRs.Unfortunately, mirrorless models also tend to be quite pricey (reaching costs of up to $6800). The most reasonable priced mirrorless camera may be the Alpha 3000 (priced at about $350). Though this is considered an ""entry-level"" model, it will still yield high quality without putting significant strain on your back or wallet.

, Megapixels are typically the most highly advertised feature of a camera and relate to how clear an image is.


Specifically, a megapixel is a unit of measurement which represents one million pixels of an image. Pixels are those tiny dots of color which make up an image. Thus, more megapixels equals higher resolution photos.
Be wary of megapixel marketing ploys. Like all features, more megapixels means more money. In order to keep consumers buying their products, most companies advertise higher megapixels as a ""big upgrade"" from their previous models. While this may have been important to consider in the past, most point-and-shoot cameras today are packed with enough megapixels for making large prints.High quality point-and-shoot cameras have 12-18 megapixels and will give you relatively high resolutions. If you're only transferring photos to your computer, 1-3 megapixels will suffice since that is the average amount on a standard computer.For making prints on 6x4 paper, 2 megapixels are adequate. For printing pictures on 10x8 paper or larger, 5-7 megapixels should do.

, If you plan on capturing large structures like mountains or the sky, or snapping pictures of elusive animals, variable zooms will come in handy.


Most point-and-shoot cameras have different zoom qualities, labeled things like ""5x"" or ""7x."" This simply refers to how many times a photo becomes enlarged compared to its original distance.
For smaller cameras with a zoom function, a 28 mm wide lens is recommended. The reason is because the wider lens won't distort pictures which are far away, making wide-angle shots like group photos or family portraits clear and precise.To get even closer to the action, ""superzoom"" cameras are available. These offer zoom functions up to 50x and can resemble larger DSLR cameras. This is a nice balance between point-and-shoot and DSLR cameras, since the built-in zoom provides higher resolution without the need for detachable lenses. An affordable superzoom camera is the Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 (average cost of $280).

, No-zoom cameras tend to have big image sensors, allowing for wider-angle shots and yielding resolutions comparable to DSLrs.


A no zoom camera is best if you tend to take closer photos. You won't have to spend extra money for higher zoom functions and you can also avoid the complexities of detachable lenses.
While they provide high quality photos, no zoom cameras also offer the compactness of point-and-shoot cameras. Because of these benefits, however, no zoom cameras tend to be very expensive ($800-$2000 range).
A cheaper no-zoom camera is the Ricoh GR, which typically costs around $670. This camera has an optimal 28 mm wide lens while still being slim enough to fit in the pockets of your jeans., Auto-focus means exactly as its name states, and will automatically adjust the camera lens to obtain focus on the subject.


DSLRs tend to be manual focus, meaning that for each detachable lens, you have to rotate the tube of the lens until a photo comes into focus. While this may yield a better quality photo, it may also mean that you miss that perfect opportunity to snap something rare, like your son's soccer goal or your daughter's graduation handshake.One benefit of point-and-shoot cameras is not only autofocus, but features like ""face recognition."" This feature intelligently detects faces of people and places colored boxes around them to help you take the most precise portrait possible.

, Shutter speed refers to how long the camera spends collecting light. Faster times mean less blurry, accurate photos.


For example, a camera with a shutter speed of 1/125 spends 125th of a second collecting light. The higher the denominator in the fraction, the quicker the camera snaps the photo.Lower shutter speeds allow more light into the photo, which may be optimal if you are shooting at night or in dark areas. However, if you're trying to snap sports shots during the day, lower shutter speeds may result in blurring around the moving object., CNET.com and Overstock.com specialize in deals for a wide range of products, including digital cameras.


Overstock.com isn't just an online supplier, it is specifically aimed at providing deals to customers.Other online or in-person vendors will use marketing tricks like ""marking down an item 50%"" from a sometimes imaginary, absurdly high price that isn't stated.Instead, Overstock lists prices plainly and will sometimes tell you its original price and the real amount you'll be saving (for example, 34% savings).
CNET advertises price ranges, for example $150-$170. Instead of deciding on a single, standalone price, you can compare prices for one model or across different ones.
Online vendors like CNET, Overstock, and Amazon offer credible user ratings and reviews which you can also read to inform your decision. For instance, if you notice a camera is only $200 but has a 1-star rating from 800 different users, you can probably surmise that it isn't worth your troubles.

, Unlike microphones and headphones, which tend to be more delicate electronics, cameras tend to be more durable and will still be usable provided that the lens is in good shape.Amazon.com will specify the exact condition the used product is in. For example, it it will classify items as ""Good,"" ""Very Good,"" or ""Like New."" These are the qualities you want. If you can, buy a ""Like New"" item, as this will most likely be a new item that is technically classified as ""used"" because it has been opened.
Online vendors may also provide further details of the used product. For instance, ""This camera is only 7 days out of the box. I am selling it because I found a cheaper deal on a better model."" Or, ""This camera is still relatively new. I've only had it for a week. There is some light scratching around the shutter button but the lens is scratch-free.""
Avoid buying used items from disreputable vendors or from users with no ratings. People with high user ratings typically sell their items exactly as described and will be less likely to scam you with a damaged product.
Craigslist is only slightly reputable, as scams have commonly occurred between users. If you do choose to buy from Craigslist, be sure that images of the camera are displayed on the ad, that you talk to the vendor over the phone first, and that you make your transaction in a public place., The benefit of buying offline is that many electronics stores will let you use the product to determine if it is to your liking.


Cameras are often tethered to a display in-store to prevent stealing. However, if you ask to use the camera, some salespeople will un-tether the camera and let you snap pictures freely.
Holding the camera in your hands is a small but invaluable feature that online stores simply can't offer. Knowing how comfortable the camera is in your hands, seeing the actual picture quality, and listening to the salesperson highlight its benefits/disadvantages will help you make the best decision possible.
Electronics stores also tend to offer warranties and return periods that online vendors don't. If you buy a camera online and decide it's not to your liking, you might have to pay a shipping and re-stocking fee just to get your refund.
For the best of both worlds, test a specific camera model in-store to see if you like it. If you do, try to find a better online deal for that same model.

, Some stores like Target, Best Buy, and Fry's Electronics will match deals from certain online websites.


Your deals may be limited to specific websites such as Amazon or B&H Photo Video. Also, other stipulations may be in place, such as only matching one item per customer, or only matching items which are currently in-stock on the rival website.Regardless of the stipulations, this is your best chance to find a good deal while also testing the camera in person. Don't be afraid of haggling or trying to bargain with the salesperson for an even better price.

, Since the features are already built into these cameras, you'll most likely only end up paying for nonessential accessories like camera straps or carrying cases.


DSLRs and mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras require you to purchase detachable lenses for different zooms and for controlling how much light is allowed into a photo. While lenses are technically optional, some experts suggest that you need 3 different lenses for the best DSLR experience.The most basic detachable lens can still cost about $200 dollars, which is the total amount of some point-and-shoot cameras. Quality lenses can cost up to $1,000 and sometimes even reach $11,000, costing more than some of the more affordable DSLR cameras themselves.
In addition to lenses, DSLR cameras insist on using other ""essential"" items like light reflectors, tripods, or camera filters.For experienced photographers, you'll be able to easily discern which accessories are needed and which are optional. The average camera user, however, may feel overwhelmed and obliged to buy attachments they won't use.

, Maybe you are a indeed a professional photographer who requires a DSLR camera. In this case, think of exactly the type of photos you'll be capturing and buy your accessories accordingly.


For example, if you're snapping football pictures for a sports publication, you probably won't have to worry about shadows in the picture. Photographers who snap models typically suffer the most from unwanted shadows and will probably purchase something like a mini softbox to eliminate harsh shadows.If you're lugging around a heavy camera all day, you'll probably want a neck strap to rest your arms in between shots. Though they make a camera look more ""official,"" a neck strap won't be necessary for lighter DSLRs or mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras.
Some items will be very necessary for maintaining your camera. For example, a camera carrying case will snugly and safely fit your camera when you transport it. Also, a cleaning cloth will keep your lens free of blemishes and won't be as abrasive as other, non-specialized cleaning tools., Chances are that Canon, Sony, and Nikon will provide better quality cameras than unknown, obscure brands.


Off-brand digital cameras are usually inexpensive because they don't deliver the same speed, power, and image quality as proven brands. Though this isn't always the case, just remember that the popular brands are popular because they tend to produce consistent results.
Just because you buy from a known vendor doesn't mean you have to buy the most expensive model. Buying a cheaper Nikon will probably be safer than buying a similar Insignia model at the same price.

, Smartphones are becoming smarter and smarter, and some believe that they'll soon replace digital cameras altogether.The iPhone5 model boasts an 8-megapixel camera and other features like panoramic view.The HTC One has 5 different levels of flash for low-light settings, as well as a 28 mm lens for detailed wide-angle shots.
The Nokia Lumia 1020 offers an astounding 41 megapixels, which is significantly greater than your average point-and-shoot camera. In addition, this phone has a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) image sensor, rivaling a Nikon DSLRs 1.69 inches (4.3 cm).The image sensor determines how much light your camera captures and ultimately decides the overall clarity of the megapixels., While cellphone resolutions are rivaling and surpassing their digital camera counterparts, they also lack certain features that will improve the overall quality.


While convenient all-in-one devices, smartphones also lack high quality optics and sensors. This means that poorly lit photos won't be as detailed on your phone as they are on digital cameras.You also won't be able to control your smartphone's shutter speed, which can yield blurry action photos.
Smartphone cameras are best used as alternatives for point-and-shoot cameras. Since point-and-shoot models are aimed at casual photographers, chances are the few extra features that are available will end up being unused anyway.Cellphone pictures also suffer from inappropriate vertical portrait framing, meaning that photos taken sideways can sometimes have black borders around the actual photo.

, While a frugal alternative, your smartphone won't be an adequate substitute if you want to snap photos for a living.


Digital cameras use high capacity SD cards, capable of holding 256 GB or more. That's enough storage to hold 64,000 photos!Even the most top-of-the-line smartphones offer up to only 32 GB of storage, most of which will support other features besides your camera.

Canon DSLR cameras, in my experience, are the best in the business. The bottom-of-the-market bargains start at $1000NZD; a little price to pay but it can prove to be quite beneficial if you’re using your camera frequently.;
, Play with it. Familiarise yourself with the functions, the buttons and all the knick knacks that come with it. JUST DON’T BREAK IT!

, Lighting and distance. Subjects are great indications of where and what you are doing wrong. Experiment! Capture your subject in different lights and at various distances. Adjust the settings of your camera to suit the lighting conditions and the distance between you and your subject. Use the flash to a minimum! Use as much natural light in your compositions as you can, this provides for a better quality in your image and also allows you to utilise the functions on the camera more, effectively keeping you from depending on your flash for lighting. Blur, Angles and Balance. Landscape and environmental compositions are also great practice runs for your camera. Use the camera around your house experimenting with different lines and shapes in the lounge for example. Colour is also a great compositional solution to experiment with. The backyard promises for some amazing colours and natural outdoor light.

, Preparation notes and to-do’s are great guides for you to follow.

, This is possibly as simple as asking someone if you can take photos of them or asking them their names. Although there is no law against taking photographs of a person, even if he or she doesn’t know you are doing it, it is always a good idea to get permission, unless plans have been pre-arranged by you and your subject. This prevents any arising debates that may occur.

, This way, working with the subject becomes a lot less awkward and a lot easier for you.

, Choosing the image that sells the story is one of the key tools in successful journalism: when one analyses a newspaper or magazine article, they are roped in by the image. Choose images for your final article that contain compositional solutions which affect people’s emotions.

, However, photos aren’t always how you want them to turn out so make it a habit to re-fine your work. Refining your work illustrates your eye for perfection: this comes down to removing red-eyes, re-touching conspicuous flaws, adjusting the brightness, contrast or saturation of your image etc (highlighting shadows, enhancing colour using pictographs to name a few). I have found this step to be one of the most important in my pursuit of journalistic success. Being able to re-work original material shows the processes in which you have taken in creating a masterpiece from a simple photographic concept.

The hardest part about taking pictures of dogs or cats is getting them to sit still long enough to take the picture.;
, A good picture of pets will be from the pet's eye level, not yours with the pet looking up at you. (This also applies to small children.)

, This might be needed for a happy-go-lucky pet that wants to keep moving around. Setting your camera to sports mode does two things. 1. It uses a faster shutter speed to ""freeze"" the subject. If your pet is moving around, a slow shutter speed might leave you with a blurry picture. 2. It will use a special focusing system that constantly adjusts the focus of the camera. Without this, the camera focuses once and locks that way. If your focus is locked on your pet and he or she moves, you might end up with out of focus pictures.

, If you have a inkjet printer, then you can easily make the prints yourself using the digital camera software. Otherwise use an online photo service such as Mpix, shutterfly, Snapfish or oFoto to buy prints of your digital pictures. Follow the instructions on the websites for uploading and ordering prints.

, You are likely to get a large selection of new and used backdrops. Choose based on the seller ratings as well as the product description, because they are often a good way to judge the accuracy of the descriptions.


eBay and Amazon are excellent places to look for studio kits that include backdrops, lighting and stands. If you are just getting started with your business, look for a kit that comes with basic black and white backdrops.

, Stores like Ink & Elm provide unconventional backdrops, such as rustic wood, sequins jacquard, ikat and more on vinyl. They occasionally run specials where you can receive a free backdrop by purchasing 2 or 3.

, Although finding pre-made photography backdrops may be difficult, you can collect vintage fabric, upholstery fabric, antique posters and rustic wood that can be used as a backdrop.

, This website has a large array of options for pre-made photography backdrops. You can choose from categories such as fantasy, fur, canvas, vinyl, muslin, chroma key and alternative.

, You can also find other photography equipment on these sites. They often feature promotions, so be sure to check their sale or promotion sections.

, You can create a Google Alert using the Craigslist website and keywords like ""photography"" or ""backdrop."" The alert will arrive in your email inbox whenever it finds something matching your specifications.

, If you want to see your backdrop before you order it, then a large photography store may be the best place to go. They may also have catalogs that you can order from.

, If you cannot find the textures, colors and patterns you like, then you can make custom backdrops for your studio or stand. Many people start by buying muslin at a craft store or outlet and dying it in different colors.


Blogs like diyphotography.net show you how to create your own backdrops by mixing dye, bunching up white muslin and leaving it until it darkens.

",How to Take High Quality Photos in Low Light With a Camera Phone,",, Changing these settings will help increase the quality of your photo. Here are some things to look for:
White Balance: Some camera phones have this feature that will allow you to change the settings for what environment you're in and will help optimize your photo with it. Choose something in this category that will allow a lot of light into the camera lens. Some of the most common choices are Darkness, Cloudy, Sunny, Tungsten, Fluorescent, and Daylight. Each are design for different environments.
Darkness: This will increase the camera's light sensitivity to a higher level. It will help in a low light environment. Please note that when using this level, the frame rate will look really slow. This is because it uses a lot of processing power to digitally allow more light.
Cloudy: This makes the image look more a bit yellowish. This was designed for environments with a cooler tone. Using this preset in a warm toned environment will make it look too gold.
Sunny: This is just as the same as the Cloudy preset, but less yellowish.
Tungsten: If your using the camera in a really warm environment, use this setting. This will cool down the image so it won't be to gold looking. If you set it in a cool toned environment, it will look too blue in the image.
Fluorescent: This will give a natural Fluorescent tone. It won't make the image too blue or too gold. It actually blends the two with balance of the color temperature levels.
Daylight: This setting is best used in a daylight environment. The light sensitivity is a little less then the Darkness preset.
Auto (or Automatic): This preset will automatically adjust to the optimal setting based on the scene and what you're trying to take.


Resolution: This is a critical aspect if you want very high quality images. Increase this to the maximum resolution as much as possible. Or use a resolution your comfortable in. Many camera phones have from Photo ID size up to 5 megapixels.
Brightness: Some camera phones will change the brightness level regardless of the actual light that is let in to the camera. Do mess around this feature, some camera phones brightness controls will emphasize the highlight levels. Some will do the shadows. Highlight levels are focused on the bright-most parts of the image while the shadows are focused on the dark-most parts.
Flash: This will enable the camera to flash while the image is being taken. Flash though is not a critical aspect and it is better if the flash is turned off or set a low level (where possible).
ISO: This is not usually seen in camera phones but if you do also have this feature, it would significantly help. This will adjust to how sensitive the lens are to light. Do note that when set to a higher level, the more noises you'll be experiencing in the image. So make sure it's not set too high if the maximum ISO rating of the camera can go as far as 2000. Most camera phones won't go as far as 2000.

, Once you've set all the settings that are optimized for low light picture taking, then prepare the camera., It helps if you rest your phone on a table and hold it still or lean it against the wall. It also helps if you used a self timer function (if applicable). Pushing the ""Take"" button will cause your hand to move just slightly. So the self timer will allow you take take the time to get positioned and keep still from there., If the timer is on, gives your self some time to carefully position the camera. It will take the picture once time is up. Otherwise, keep the camera really still and hit the ""Take"" button. Keep in mind that once you hit the button, don't move the camera at all. It will make it look a bit blurry due to the motion. (see Tips for details), This will only work if:
You have a phone with memory card and a memory card reader that will support the one on your phone installed on your computer;
Your phone can upload and download images via USB connection and appropriate software installed on your computer (where applicable).

Stable platform (e.g. tripod)



 


Fairly fast lens - A fast lens will have a 'wide open' aperture of 1.8 or 2.8. Because it is counter-intuitive, consider it as a fraction. An aperture of F22 would be 1/22 which is a small number and would be a small opening. An aperture of F1.8 would be 1/1.8 and would be wide open and a larger opening.






The ability to increase your ISO to a fairly high level (e.g. 1600 or more)






Note: You don't necessarily have to have all three to get a great shot, but they each have a contribution to make.

;
, Early morning and evening are the best times. If doing it when it is completely dark, you will need to have some way of lighting the scene.


The last half hour before sunrise or after sunset if taking outside pictures are the best times for those.

, Different types of shots are:

Star trails

Any star trail photography will take from several minutes to several hours, depending on what you want, where you are, and what type of equipment you are using.Having a digital camera does not preclude you from being able to do 'astrophotography'.Look into finding tutorials addressing the type of camera that you have.
Light trails (traffic and light painting)






With light trails, you can take the often times, ugly, light pollution and do something creative with it at night using long exposures.






Take your camera out of full manual mode and start experimenting with shutter speeds.Cave photography is not for the faint of heart. Not only are you dealing with very closed in spaces, but those closed in spaces are pretty dark! If you are not an experienced caver, do not go into a cave alone. Even if you are, be sure to bring someone along for safety.
Christmas pictures taken by the light of the tree






Late night athletic events
Evening birthday parties
Sunrise or sunset is a great time to get beautiful pictures.







, Once you have reached a certain comfort level and skill level, try something else.

Start with a low ISO (100, 200, whatever your camera might allow, an aperture of about F20 (pretty small) and shoot for a few seconds, using the 'Bulb' feature.






Start with a higher ISO, open up your aperture a bit, and shorten the time.
Depending on your camera, find a way to hold open the shutter. You might have to use a remote to start and finish it, a cable release, or computer software. But all, long exposure shots will have to have a tripod. Most, if not all, businesses, and most especially computer/digital items, have an Internet presence these days. Find their website and see if you can find any information on your particular type of camera. Also, to get increased exposure time, you will need to decrease your aperture (F20 or higher). You will get greater depth of field and more exposure time.Try doing this at several times of exposure using whatever method your camera manufacturer suggests.







, The freedom that a digital camera has, that a regular film camera doesn't have, is the ability to get immediate feedback on the shot that worked, so you can know if you are using the wrong method. This gives you the freedom to use the various manual settings on your camera. You can go completely manual, Aperture Priority, and Shutter Priority.

, One of the things that photographers like to use is, exposure bracketing. Your camera will shoot three photos of the same shot, one with more, and one with less than the programmed exposure.,

At least a half hour, but check with the photographer first. You have to prepare. Just because you aren't the photographer, doesn't mean you get to just ramble in around 6:00.

, In order to be the best assistant you can be, you need to know what he has and how to use it (for the most part). Obviously, you are wanting to learn from the photographer, but you don't want to be clueless.

, While the photographer might want to pick his own sites, you can certainly help them with some preliminary ideas.

, Always be alert and watch for issues. Try to be a pro-active problem solver.

, That is wrong on just about every level.

, Think of different poses as of what the person will do or different places to be. You might even have the person/s do something while the picture is being taken.

, Most people won't be able to see what you are thinking about so you will have to tell them specific instructions. Guide them with your hands unto where you want them to go.

, Unless the family wants the sun, block it out. This can cause glare in lenses or your camera. IT may also cause people to squint or blink.

, No one likes a picture where people are smiling. Babies are especially hard since they can't understand you. Hold up their favorite toy or character.

, Again, babies tend to be difficult while doing this, along with dogs. Hold out toys or squeak a squeaky-toy to get the dog's attention.

, Don't take all of the pictures in one area, take some in one area, move to another, and take some more. Try to keep close, as most families like to stay close to their home.

, Edit out red eyes, blemishes, and glass glare. Add touch ups like borders and backgrounds. Don't do anything without the buyer's consent though.

Turn the camera on.,
Insert a memory card.,
Familiarize yourself with the buttons.,
Take a few pictures.,
View your pictures.,
Transfer your photos to your computer.",How to Take a Picture with a Digital Camera1," The first step to using a digital camera is simply turning the device on. Most cameras have a small on button located somewhere on the side of the camera. If you don't see your camera's on button, read your manufacturer's instructions. They should explain how to find the on button.


Most digital cameras have to charge. If your camera's battery is dead, it will not turn on. Don't panic if your camera is not turning on. Usually, a charger comes with the camera. The charger plugs into the wall and then into your camera. In the event your camera does not turn on, try plugging it into the charger, waiting a few minutes, and then trying again.;
, Most digital cameras only have enough storage to hold a few pictures on their own. You'll need to insert a memory card into your camera so it can hold a large amount of photos. You can buy a memory card at most electronic stores or supermarkets.


The most common type of memory card is the Secure Digital (SD) memory card. These are compatible with the vast majority of digital cameras. A Secure Digital 'Xtra Capacity (SDXD) memory card holds more pictures than the SD, but may not be compatible with older digital cameras. xD memory cards are also compatible with the majority of digital cameras, as are Multi Media Cards (MMC).Other types of memory cards, like xD Picture Memory Cards and Memory Stick Duo Memory Cards, are only compatible with certain types of cameras. Your camera's user manual should say which memory cards are compatible with your camera. The packaging of a memory card should also indicate which cameras are compatible with that card.

, Digital cameras come with a variety of buttons. You should spend some time familiarizing yourself with what these buttons do. Some buttons help you zoom in and take pictures. Others allow you to adjust settings on your camera.


The shutter button is a small button, usually on the top right corner of the camera, you press down when taking a picture. The zoom button is usually a long line, which you toggle back and forth to zoom in and out on a subject. These are the basic buttons you need to take a picture.The ""mode"" button is usually a rectangular button labeled ""mode."" You press down on this button to switch from picture mode to video mode, in the event you want to shoot videos. A rectangular button labeled ""menu"" allows you to switch the settings on your camera. You usually navigate through the menu mode with the hep of a scroll wheel you rotate to select and adjust settings.A triangle-shaped button, much like the play button on your VCR, allows you to playback pictures you just took. You can scroll through pictures using the scroll wheel., If you want to start using your camera, begin by taking a few pictures. Choose a subject, like a landscape or a pet, focus your camera for a moment, and then press the shutter button. The camera should capture this image. To get the hang of using your digital camera, take a few pictures around your house.

, Once you've taken a few practice pictures, review your pictures. Press down on the play button. The pictures you just took should appear on your camera's screen. You can scroll through the pictures using the scroll wheel.


As these are just practice pictures, you may want to delete them. You can usually select an image on screen using the scroll wheel, shaped something like a trash can, to delete unwanted pictures.

",How to Take a Digital Photo," Make sure your camera has healthy batteries. Set your camera to camera mode.;
, Try to look for something interesting--it can be a person, a location, or an inanimate object.

, For example: the eye on a dog, the cherry on a sundae, the head of a horse, or the ladybug on a flower.

, If you are indoors, it might be best to use your flash (bounce off a wall or a roof if possible). If you are outside, your back should be to the sun and the flash should be off (make sure you don't get your own shadow in the picture).

, Your photo should have some dark areas and some light highlights. The best way to do this is to imagine your photo in black and white. You should have a white spot, a black spot, and a gray spot in your photo.

, Your emphasis shouldn't be in the centre of your photograph. Imagine a Tic-Tac-Toe across your photo. The emphasis should be at one of the four points where the lines cross.

, Make the subject take up the whole photo. Unnecessary empty space can take the emphasis away from your subject.

, Looking at something from eye level is often boring. Try taking the photo from above or below eye level--unique angles are always interesting!

, Shaky cameras make blurry photos. Hold the camera close to your body for stability. You may also purchase a tripod to rest your camera and keep it still.

, Utilise stability, setting, photography and snap your desired photo.

, You may have to snap a few more photos to ensure quality and satisfaction, so do not get frustrated if your photos do not turn out well the first few clicks.

Decide between auto or manual focus.,
Pick your shutter speed.,
Choose your aperture.,
Do not adjust the ISO speed.,
Decide on a picture quality.",How to Take a Picture with a Digital Camera2," The first thing you should do when adjusting your camera's settings is make a decision between auto or manual focus. In auto focus, your camera will focus in on pictures on its own. When using manual focus, you will have to focus the camera yourself.


In auto focus, the camera will choose a spot on frame and focus on that just before you take the picture. In manual focus, you are able to choose an area of focus on your camera's lens. You usually do so using the scroll wheel.If you're new to photography, you should go with auto focus for the most part. There are few shots where manual focus will benefit you. If you get into photography on a professional level, you may want to consider manual focus down the road. For casual photography, however, auto focus should be sufficient., Shutter speed is how quickly the camera's shutter moves, effectively allowing you to choose how fast you want to take a picture. A higher shutter speed will allow you to freeze action in a shot. To capture moving water in detail, for example, pick a higher shutter speed. A lower shutter speed will blur action. If you want a hazy photograph of a waterfall, pick a low shudder speed.If you're shooting at a low shutter speed, shaking your camera could result in blurry photos. It takes awhile to get a steady hold on a camera when taking pictures. Therefore, it may be a good idea to see if your camera has a shake-free shutter speed option. If it does, set your camera to the shake-free option when operating at a lower shutter speed. This will help your pictures come out crisper., Aperture refers to the opening of a camera lens, which is formed by a set of blades. Adjusting the aperture settings allows the blades to open more or close more, letting more light into your shot.The aperture setting you want depends on the type of picture you're taking. For portraits, faces, and other close-up photos, select an aperture between F1.4 and F5.6.For landscapes, an aperture between F11 and F22 should work well. For the sharpest possible landscape photos, you can go as high as F23.For any other pictures, stick to an aperture between F8 and F11., A camera's ISO speed is the speed at which a camera picks up light. A higher ISO speed results in brighter photos, but pictures may become grainy if your ISO speed is too high. For the most part, you will not need to create brighter photos. Leave the ISO speed alone until you're a more experiences photographer., The default file setting for pictures in most digital cameras is JPEG. JPEG photos are easily shareable. However, as JPEG files are compressed, some information is lost when photos are uploaded. If you want to avoid having your photos compressed, consider switching to RAW picture quality. This setting does not compress or tamper with the pictures when you upload them onto your computer or other device."
"
Use the rule of thirds.,
Angle up to shoot buildings.,
Take shots of people from a downward angle.,
Avoid flash in most cases.,
Practice.",How to Take a Picture with a Digital Camera3," The rule of thirds is concept of photography that says you should divide every photo you shoot into nine parts. Imagine a grid on your photo with two equally spaced vertical lines and two equally spaced horizontal lines, slicing your photo into nine even sections.Important elements of the picture should lie on one of the lines or the intersection of lines. In theory, this creates a tension in your photo that makes it appear more interesting.For example, if you're shooting a sunset, position the horizon line in the intersection between a horizontal and vertical line. This should create a more interesting photo than simply shooting the sunset in the middle of the camera frame., When shooting buildings, it's recommended you angle the shot up. This will create a fun, triangular appearance for the building. Stand on the ground in front of the building and angle your camera upward, pointing to the building's apex., If you're shooting people, especially small children, it can be fun to take shots from a downward angle. Full body shots may be slightly easier to capture with a downward angle. You can also lie or kneel on the floor to get down to your subject's level., You do not need to use flash for the most part. A camera's flash often needlessly brightens pictures, especially pictures of people. People's faces often look unnaturally bright when flash is on, even if you're shooting at night. For the most part, turn off the flash setting on your camera.


You can usually turn flash off in your camera's settings. Oftentimes, a lightning bolt-shaped icon indicates flash is on. You usually select a lightening bolt with a cross going over it to turn off flash.
In some cases, flash may be helpful. If you're taking pictures very late at night, it can help to use flash to highlight people's faces.

, Photography is like any other craft. It takes practice to get better. Spend a lot of time experimenting with your camera. Adjust the settings and take pictures of many different subjects. Eventually, your pictures will start looking more professional.

Make certain that your camera actually has that option.,
If your camera didn't come with a good software (it should, but probably wouldn't if you bought it used), find a software that handles RAW files.,
Check out YouTube for videos on RAW files and what they can do for you and your photography.

,
Access your camera's menu.,
Start out shooting both JPG and RAW.,
Get a bigger memory card.,
Make the switch.",How to Switch to Shooting with RAW," Most, if not all, point and shoot cameras or cell phone cameras don't.;
, There are good free ones and some good low cost ones.

,, There should be a button on the back of your DSLR that will allow you to access it.

, Most DSLR cameras have that option. That way, you can be sure you got the shot until you are more comfortable dealing with your RAW file. There will be some difference. Your JPG file may actually appear to look better to you, but that is because it took away all the choices that shooting RAW affords you. It has already 'developed' that image.

, Depending on the camera, your files will be several megabytes. Otherwise, you will have to download, format, photograph, and download...repeatedly.


Be sure that your camera can support the size card that you are getting. Some cameras can only handle the smaller size of cards. The upside of this is, they are less expensive, so you can afford to buy multiple ones.

, After awhile, you will realize that you are wasting space by using both RAW and JPG files, and will switch to RAW.

, A large light colored towel can be helpful for many things in photography.

, Practice before you need it.

, A bad photograph can be quickly improved by changing the angle and, therefore, the light.

, An image may look good, 'artistically', but it will not help prove a case or help rehome an animal.

, A calico cat against a busy background is really difficult to see.

, This will increase the flexibility of your camera and the conditions it can shoot in.

, It's called 'spray and pray'. Shooting at the subject with no real intent and hoping it comes out ok...or thereabouts.

, Especially if the goal is adoption, choose or create a photo to show what a wonderful animal it is. If it's an active dog, show it moving. If it's a particularly beautiful cat, groom it and take a close-up portrait. If there was abuse or neglect in the animal's past, and you can tastefully show a before-and-after of its recovery, do so.

, With a video, you increase your odds of a good story and good photographs.

Find the best possible light: There is really no such thing as bad light, but it's hard to create high impact images during the middle of the day when the sun if high.,
Have the equipment you need, but don't break the bank to do it.,
Use many different focal lengths.,
Don't be a chicken.",How to Shoot Landscapes with Greater Impact,"


By midday, the sun tends to be harsh and it washes out color and texture with heavy dark shadows. Getting the best possible light in a landscape shot is the same difference between shooting a model with and without makeup.
The best time to shoot is when the sun is low in the sky, because it creates more interesting side lighting that will give the subject much more depth. The light is warmer, creating highlights with great texture detail. This low warm light is also found near sunrise and sunset, and those are obvious times to add amazing color to a landscape photo.
Another great place to find amazing light is at the edge of a storm. When a storm passes through, the clouds will often break up, allowing the sun to peek through and create a dramatic scene with well lit foregrounds against a dark sky. You absolutely must exercise patience.
You might be hiking during the day and find an incredible view, but it's midday and the light is terrible. To get the shot you desire, you may need to wait several hours for the sun to get lower and provide you with a beautiful sunset. Or the light may not do what you want, and you'll have sat for hours only to have to return the next day.;
, Equipment is not as important as you think: The common misconception that better equipment produces better photographs is completely untrue. Every photographer needs equipment, but equipment is nothing more than a vehicle used to transmit what is in your brain to someone else. You need to have a point of view and then you can use anything from a smart phone to a Nikon D3X and your results will be more or less the same.

, When most people think of a landscape photograph, they tend to envision a large shot taken with a wide-angle lens.


While there is nothing wrong with wide-angle photography, you should break the mold and try shooting with longer focal lengths. This will allow you to focus in on specific detail and see past all distractions.

, How many times have you arrived at a beautiful landscape and failed to get the shot because you didn't want to cross a creek or you didn't want to lay in the dirt to get an awesome new perspective? This is one of the biggest mistakes that you can make as a photographer.


Do not hesitate to go above and beyond when it comes to getting the shot you desire.

Find a good song that fits the story you are thinking about using in the AMV.,
Watch the episodes which can relate, for a couple of times and try to read out the story to get a better understanding.,
Try using songs that are more action type.,

Now comes the time to edit the AMV.,
If you are a person who shows quality editing instead of story, it may be easier for you to go pick up any random clips from the show and play a song, but make sure the song would fit a random situation.,After finishing the AMV, you want to make sure that you render them in good settings, in Sony Vegas, recommended settings are ""HDV 720-30p (1280x720, 29.970 fps)""under the Project Properties settings and keep to ""6 Mbps HD 720-30p Video"" in the Template when you finally go to render your project.,
After rendering, watch your work a few times before publishing it online, there are many great websites such as YouTube, Vimeo and AnimeMusicVideo.org too.,
Don't be afraid taking your work to next level.,
(Optional).,
Render again in HD and enjoy your finished product.,Upload your video on YouTube or any other website, in this case, you upload your Shot In The Dark AMV on YouTube and it will appear similar to the video below.",How to Create a Beyblade AMV," Not only is this important in Beyblade AMV's, but any editor using different animes should go through this step. An AMV is plain without a story, song and good effects in it. Try making Action Beyblade AMV's more often.
, It's also more helpful to get the clips you want to use first, rather than searching for them while making the AMV. You want to make sure things go neat and smooth.

Make sure you mute the audio from the episode while editing.

, It depends on what story you want to show. If it's a sentimental or slow story AMV, then go for a slow-paced song., After choosing a good song, and deciding what the story will be; open any video editor (in this case, Sony Vegas is being used) and gradually work your way through the AMV., For quality editing, it is also recommended to use effects. (Example here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRW7uHeHbMg )

In this case, suppose you are using the song ""Shot In The Dark"" by Within Temptation. You have the story ready, song in your mind and you have seen the AMV before even completing it. You then slowly work the way across the progress. Don't rush while working on your project, you don't want to ruin your masterpiece with little mistakes.
Set a minimum time each day to work on your AMV so it won't seem drab to you, 2 to 3 hours is enough.

,, Take some time out and relax and don't think your work is not great; it's common to make mistakes at the first stages. You only improve after making mistakes., Post your stuff on the forums of different AMV websites, share it with your friends and in time, you will see an increase in your views. It takes patience., After completing your ""Shot In The Dark"" AMV, you want to get it to widescreen, you will then have to first render the video and it's RAW properties. After that, open the rendered AMV again in Vegas (the only way you can stretch clip is by rendering the AMV first, then opening the whole, it will be a lot easier) and open the Event Pan/Crop. It will be on the top right of the video when you zoom in and you want to make sure you don't make any mistakes, make sure your Enable Snapping is enabled, don't tick the Size About Center and Lock Aspect Ratio. After that, gradually drag each of the ends of the aspect ratio inside till the video starts to fill the black gaps., One day, you might become big and famous, just never quit the race.

It's recommended to use the format MP4 H.264, it opens the dynamics of the colors in the AMV. But don't worry too much about it, even WMV will work just fine.

, The logo is pointless and just drags back the style of your Tech-Deck. Your mother may say ""Keep it - it's the logo!"". Well, you can keep it if you want, but popular opinion is, it'll look heaps better without it. Get rid of the logo by dotting over it with a black sharpie. Let it dry before you start finger skating again.

, Take out a SHARP knife, and cut a line between the two back bolts, so you can see the plastic behind the griptape. Then, either keep it like that, or use a different coloured sharpie (orange, blue, red, anything! even black, for an emo deck!) and colour the brown rim of the Tech-Deck. Trust me. It looks way cooler. Even black.

, Make sure to take the trucks off first. Then you can get markers and draw on the bottom to customize your deck your way.

, Tech-Decks come with a yellow tool and extra wheels of various colours. To change the wheels, put the tool in the nut of the wheel and twist the tool left. Keep doing this until the nut and the wheel come out. Then, put the nut in the tool, grab a different coloured wheel, and twist that in, but turn the tool to the RIGHT. Do this until the wheel feels secure. Try to experiment! You could always change them back. Try putting a black wheel, a green wheel, a red wheel and a blue wheel. This gives your Tech-Deck the ""Hard"" look.

, Take out a sharpie of the colour you want, and colour the trucks Take care not to colour the wheels though! Sharpie + Wheel = BAD.

, Give your Tech-Deck a type, e.g. Hardstyle, Versatile, Flipster, etc. I have 13 Tech-Decks of different styles. Try making up your own style! And impress other people.

, You want the nose of the board to be in the air but the tail shouldn't be dragging across the floor. This means you only have to put a small amount of pressure on the tail of the board to get it in the air.

, Your index finger should go near to the front axle but not be touching it (see picture below).

, When starting out, the movement can be done very slowly. Simply pinch the board very lightly between your index and middle finger. Push your index finger until the board is upright.

, By now, your middle finger should still be on the tail and your index finger should still be near the front axle. These fingers need to swap positions.

Wet the other end of the swab.,
Keep a glass of water handy.",How to Clean an Oil Painting1," Using your spit to clean a work of art might seem both crazy and profane, but it's a method museum curators around the world use. Saliva has enough enzymes to break down dirt and grime, but not so much that it will damage the paint.It'll take a lot of cotton swabs, though, so stock up with a full box.









Be aware that this method takes some patience — ask a museum intern how many hours it can take to clean a large painting this way. (Hint: It's more than 2.) But if you want to meticulously clean your painting with almost zero risk of damage to the oils, this is the way to go.;
, You don't want the cotton soaking wet, but it should be wet enough to pick up any dirt particles with ease.








, Don't move the cotton from side to side, but instead up and down in small, soft dotting motions. Aim to work around a square inch at a time.








, Once the first end has picked up so much dirt that it's no longer useful, move on to the other end. When that one is dirty, discard the swab and move on to the next.








, You should be working slowly enough that you don't feel like you're running out of saliva. Just in case your mouth does start to get dry, though, take a sip of water and wait a minute or two before going back for more spit.

Blend your oil pastels.,
Color mix or overlay your oil pastels.",How to Blend Oil Pastels1," When you pre-blend your oil pastels, you blend the colors together on a palette prior to applying the materials to your canvas. This method yields one color. You may wish to use it when you are trying to create a specific color and or do not wish to risk mixing the wrong colors together on your canvas.


Use a palette knife to cut off pieces of the oil pastels you wish to blend. Place the pieces on your palette.
Use the palette knife to blend or mix the colors together until they form a thick, oily paint.
Once you achieve the desired hue, apply the pigment to your canvas with the palette knife.Instead of a palette knife, you may use your fingers.;
, Apply one color of oil pastel directly onto your canvas. Apply a second color of oil pastel directly next to the first color. Use your tool of choice to blend, or rub, the adjoining edges together until the two edges appear smooth.


This method is used when you want to achieve a smooth organic gradient.It is possible to blend oil pastels in this manner because the material is thick and oily., Color mixing is a process of layering oil pastels directly on the canvas. This method is used to blend larger areas of color as opposed to smaller areas requiring fine detail work, which would be better achieved with blending. It creates extremely rich tones. Apply one generous layer of oil pastel to your canvas, followed by a second layer of a different color. Add additional layers and blend the pastels together until you achieve the desired hue.


Experiment with light pressure blending. Instead of layering thick applications of oil pastels, use minimal pressure to apply thin coats of oil pastels to your canvas."

Blend your oil pastels with the scumbling method.,
Use the cross-hatch method to blend oil pastels.,
Apply the sgraffito method.",How to Blend Oil Pastels2," The scumbling method allows artists to develop texture and value in their works. To execute this blending method, select two or more colors of oil pastels. Choose one color and begin creating controlled scribble marks across your canvas. Repeat this process with the remaining colors you selected, overlapping the colors at various, random points. Continue to layer the scribbled colors until you achieve the desired look and hue., When executing the cross-hatching method, artists blend colors together by drawing overlapping lines in two distinct directions.


Lightly sketch the area you wish to cross hatch.
Select two colors of oil pastels, preferably a light and a dark shade.
Determine the two directions of your lines. Assign a color to each direction.
Draw a series of lines with one color going in one direction.
Draw a second series of lines with the second color going in a different direction.
Continue to fill in the area with lines until you achieve the desired effect., In the sgraffito method, artists create a design or add fine details by scratching through layers of oil pastels.Apply multiple layers of oil pastels in various contrasting colors to your canvas. Often, the last layer is a dark color.Select a pointed object of your choice, such as: a paper clip, a comb, or a wooden stylus.

Use pastel brushes or shapers to blend the colors.,
Blend with tortillions or stumps.,
Use a chamois to blend the pastels.,
Blend with kneaded rubber.,
Use household items to blend the colors.",How to Blend Oil Pastels3," Your fingers are excellent and efficient blending tools. While your fingers are not as precise as other tools, they are ideal for blending colors together that cover large areas of your work. It is also quicker to blend with your fingers than it is to grab a tool. When using your fingers, remember to wash your hands frequently to remove the pigment and prevent blending the wrong colors together.You may wish to wear rubber gloves or finger clots. These will make it easier for you to keep your hands clean and will protect your fingers from being rubbed raw by the sand on the canvas or in the pastels.
Keep wet wipes near your workstation to remove the pastels from your hands.
It may be difficult to blend areas that are smaller than your fingertips., Pastel brushes and shapers are specifically designed for working with oil pastels. Pastel brushes, which come in a variety of sizes and styles, contain hairs on one end. Pastel shapers, which also come in a variety of sizes and styles, have a flat or tapered rubber end. While flat pastel shapers are ideal for blending large areas of colors together, tapered pastel shapers are perfect for blending minute areas.


You may purchase dual-purpose tools that contain a brush on one end and a shaper on the other end., Tortillions, also called stumps, are tightly wound rolls of paper with a pointed end. These inexpensive tools, which are shaped like pencils, are excellent for creating fine details and sharp edges.When the tip of a stump becomes dirty, you can unwrap the wound paper to generate a new, clean tip.These tools come in three sizes: small, medium, and large., A chamois is a soft and flexible piece of leather. This tool is extremely versatile. You may wipe or rub the majority of the chamois across your canvas to blend large areas of color, and you may also wrap a portion of the chamois around your finger to blend pastels in small areas.


To clean the chamois, you may either hand wash it or machine wash it., A kneaded rubber tool is a pliable eraser. In addition to functioning as an eraser, this multi-functional tool is also great at blending together oil pastels. You may form and reform the kneaded rubber into various shapes to meet your specific needs., Instead of purchasing traditional art tools, you may use common household items to blend your oil pastels. While these items are not always the preferred tool, they serve as an acceptable replacement when you do not have the right tools on hand. These items include:

Use a clean brush to blend the next shade, and repeat the technique using first crosshatched strokes followed by parallel stokes.,
Finished.

",How to Blend Oil Paint," This sketch is the framework you’ll use to differentiate the areas where you’ll need to blend oil paint from the rest of the painting.;
,, The underpainting should be painted with a thinned out base color. Use turpentine or your preferred thinner to create the consistency of a watercolor. More pigment should be for use in the darker areas of the painting, and additional turpentine should mix into the base color when you are ready to paint the lightest values. The varying tones in the underpainting will be your guide when you’re ready to blend oil paint.

, Typically, 10 to 15 minutes is sufficient.

, You may either mix all of your various shades for the blend before you begin, or you may lighten the shade as you work. For novices, it is generally best to have all of the shades at your disposal until you are satisfied with the blend.

,, Flat brushes tend to work best for blending. Round brushes are typically avoided.

, The parallel strokes should be perpendicular to the lighter shades.

, A clean brush should always be used when working with a new shade, even if the actual color is the same.

Wet your canvas before painting a base coat.,
Start blending.,
Add more colors.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Blend Acrylic Paint1," Use a damp (not dripping wet, just damp) paintbrush to get your entire canvas wet. Then, also using a damp paintbrush, paint a base coat with a generous amount of paint.









For example, if you want to paint a blended sky, wet the entire canvas with water, and then paint a solid medium blue background.
For ease and speed, you can use the same paintbrush to wet the canvas and paint the background color.
For this method, you must work quickly and complete all the steps before the background begins to dry. Starting with a wet canvas will give you more time to work with than a dry canvas.;
, Take another color that you want to blend into your background and start sweeping it across the painted background.









You can use any type of brush stroke (sweeping horizontally, scumbling, etc.). It just depends on what you want the end result to look like.
For this step, you don't need to worry about cleaning your paintbrush between colors because it will simply add to the blended effect.

, Use your paintbrush to add more colors to your blended painting.









For the sky example, you might want to add darker blue to the top of the sky and white (and maybe yellow) to the bottom. This will create a darker sky at the top blended to a lighter sky at the bottom.
But remember, you must complete all of this blending before the paint begins to dry.

, Once the paint is dry, you should have a nicely blended finished product.

Flip the painting around immediately after hanging.",How to Frame an Oil Painting," Measure the height and width of your oil painting.;
, If it is 5 by 7 inches (12.7 to 17.7 cm), 6 by 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm), 8 by 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm), 11 by 14 inches (27.9 to 35.6 cm), 16 x 20 inches (40.6 to 50.8 cm), 20 by 24 inches (50.8 to 61 cm), 22 by 28 inches (55.9 to 71.1 cm) or 30 by 40 inches (76.2 to 101.6 cm) then you should be able to find a frame yourself. If it is a different size and you can’t find the size in a craft store, then you will need to have a custom frame made.If you have a non-standard size, it will cost considerably more to have it custom framed. You may want to consider hanging the canvas without a frame on your wall.

, Choose a frame that fits the style of your oil painting. The following are common types of frames.


Molded plastic frames are plastic. They come in black, colors and faux antique finishes. They must have a wooden back so that you can install mounting hardware.
Wooden frames come in many different sizes and shapes. They can be antique or very modern. They can also have beveling. The more complicated the frame, the more it can be either distracting or flattering to the painting.
Metal frames. Gold or silver frames can highlight a painting, but they are generally chosen to match a room’s décor or antique style., Remove the glass and backing board. You will not need them to frame an oil painting, because this type of paint needs to breathe.

, You will need to be careful and strong to remove these small metal points that are used to keep the glass in place.


Don’t frame an oil painting with the glazier points still in, or you can damage the painting and canvas.

, Since the canvas will extend past the frame, it will not hang the painting. You will need to install a wire hanger later.

, Place the oil painting face down in the opening. Pick it up to see if it is spaced right.


Make any adjustments to its placement now.

, Frame clips are sold at art supply stores and online.


If the frame clips don’t fit around the wooden stretcher on the canvas, you will need to buy a pack of offset clips. These clips are used by professional framers. They must be screwed into the canvas and the wooden stretcher as well as the frame, so they require a more permanent change.

,, Cut 4 strips of tape and place them just outside your canvas.

, It will need to cover the tape and the painting.

,, Size it and press firmly to attach the dust cover. A dust cover creates a barrier between the air and wall and the canvas.,, Place them 4 inches (10 cm) down from the top of the frame and 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the side edge. Use a ruler to be as accurate as possible.

,, When the wire is straight, wrap the additional wire around the clips and loop it around the wire.

, Objects can adhere to the still-tacky surface of the paint. Pound a nail into the wall and hang your oil painting.

Be aware that these are just a few ways you can keep the cost of your art hobby to a minimum whilst fully enjoying your painting experience.",How to Save Money on Oil Paint Supplies," Although many books, videos and magazines have a tendency to advise you to buy the best equipment possible, it's really not necessary to spend a fortune on your supplies when you're learning how to paint. Temper the desire to buy shiny new things with the reality that it has only been in relatively recent times that artists have had access to such a huge selection of art goodies and that artists throughout time have achieved incredible things without this exceptional amount of choice before them. Indeed, question whether you will simply feel overwhelmed with wondering what to do with it all instead of creatively inspired. If your pocketbook can't handle the splurge, cease worrying. Your creativity can handle the budget road to oil painting.;
, There are different media and you'll need to find which ones suit you best through playing around on them over time. However, you will note that the choices tend to be rather affordable:


Canvas. This is the usual medium for painting on and it's available throughout many art, craft and hobby stores. When regularly using the same art and craft shop, don't be afraid to ask for a discount or to find out if they have a regular shopper card. Ask without any hesitation and you may get 20 percent off everything you buy. You could also take a look in the bargain ""pound or dollar"" shops which sell an A - Z of items. They sometimes offer a selection of smaller canvases for sale. And never overlook a sale or a closing down sale in such stores—canvases will often go on sale as part of such wider sales.
As an alternative to canvas, you can oil paint on MDF board, plywood, Masonite, or even hardwood. Purchasing these products from your local DIY store will enable you to buy the exact size you need, cut specifically to your requirements. Of course, these surfaces need to be prepared correctly, so remember to rub down with sandpaper prior to applying the base coat. However, this is definitely part of the tactile experience of oil painting, so look forward to it.
Practice on canvas pad sheets or inexpensive canvas boards before using expensive canvases. Home-gessoed MDF boards are inexpensive but cost a lot of labor. Canvas boards are great for small studies, practice and preliminary paintings. Canvas pads are sometimes gessoed heavy paper imprinted with a canvas texture. Better ones are real gessoed canvas and can be put on stretchers later if you like your painting.
Consider learning to stretch your own canvas, especially if you want to work on large or unusual sizes.

, Many artists use Gesso, a chalk-based, white liquid that has been used for centuries by painters. However, this can be quite expensive (unless you're spotting the sales). Instead, you could use acrylic primer/undercoat, which is available from paint stores. It is water based and dries very quickly. A typical application would be an average of six coats, using sandpaper to rub down in between each coat.

, This is the fun part of the oil painting: selecting your colours in many tubes. But here you can easily go overboard and by colours you like rather than colours you need. Before you even go crazy, have your painting project in mind and stick to the colours that you're actually going to be using. A list is budget rule number one for any sort of shopping! Other helpful ideas include:


Although artist quality oil paint can cost as much as £12.00 a tube (due to the purity of the pigments), you can buy student's quality oil paint which comes in 38ml tubes and is priced at around £3.00 per tube depending on the colour. Try Rowney brand, as it is quite good overall, both in pigment and in price, making it ideal for hobby purposes. It's also good if you want to try it and you're not sure yet whether you'll like it, or if you like to paint small and don't expect to cover large areas.
If you really enjoy painting often and want to experiment with different effects, purchase the Artist Grade paint in your most used colors and work with a smaller palette. The simplest palette would be Lemon Yellow, Permanent Rose (or Alizarin Crimson) and Ultramarine, with a larger tube of Titanium White and a tube of Burnt Sienna for building skin tones as a base, used as a thinner-thinned value painting first layer and as a darkener for yellow, orange and red colors that you don't want to turn too blue.
Then, in order to get the most out of the Artist Grade paint, buy extra linseed oil. Squeeze out a very little bit of paint and thin it down with linseed oil until it's as thin as the student paint. It will cover a lot more area and give more versatile textures. Use the artist's linseed oil, though; the salad oils are not pure enough for painting. Some frugal decisions don't work very well.
Get painting butter or Impasto Medium if you like using it thick with a palette knife, instead of using up the whole expensive tube. Artist Grade is cost effective if you need to cover more area and it makes techniques easier.
As you discover what colors get used up fastest, purchase those in larger tubes and use the smallest size the paint comes in for colors you use less of. For most subjects, ultramarine and burnt sienna get used up very fast, while yellow and red, though used often, don't get used up as fast. Obviously, this will vary with your style and favorite subjects. A painter who likes sunflowers more than landscapes may use up lots of yellow, red and yellow ochre but relatively little ultramarine.
Cadmium hues are the same color as expensive cadmium paints, but less opaque. If you don't care about them being opaque, even in artist grade, the cadmium hues will be among the cheap pigments and real Cadmiums more expensive. When you need a color like bright yellow or blue that isn't too greenish, look for whether there are more- or less-expensive versions.
Watch in general for pigments in the low cost series range. Pigments rather than mediums or binders are what costs more in artist grade.

,


Clean the threads on paint tubes after using them. Use thinner to get off any clumps of dried paint.
Clean out the caps on older tubes that have stuck. If a cap breaks, immediately contact the manufacturer to try to get a replacement cap. They may even replace the tube.
Cap the tube with something that will seal it completely from the air, like a couple of layers of plastic wrap held on with twist wire or rubber bands, just keep the tube airtight until you can get a replacement cap.
Save extra caps from empty tubes in case one cracks. Wash them out completely so old paint doesn't mix in with a different color.
Purchase an inexpensive device called a tube roller. You can squeeze out the last bits of paint from old tubes this way. If a tube dries out and you can't get through the plug in the opening, poke through that thickened paint with an awl and use the tube roller to press the still soft paint out from beyond the plug. The plugs happen when the tubes aren't sealed properly.
If a tube cracks, it will start to dry out inside the tube until it's unusable. Notice when this happens and do what you can to use it up while it's still soft. Sealing that hole in some way may save the tube. Or use the tube roller to roll the tube up past the crack and then seal it, so that you don't lose that expensive half tube of paint. Worst case, squeeze it all out and put it in the freezer in your palette with a kitchen plastic cover, and use it up within the next couple of weeks. Whatever that color is, choose a subject for your next painting that uses that color over a large area. If it was a red or yellow, think about doing a sunset with reflecting water; if it was a blue, think of doing a twilight scene where everything's tinted with blue or a monochrome blue portrait. It's better to use it than lose it.
Empty tubes are sold for artists who like to grind their own pigments to make their own oil paint. These are another solution for cracked and broken oil paint tubes. If you get a set of them, you can transfer the paint into a fresh tube. Squeeze it out, fill the new tube with it and then crimp the end using the tool that came with the set of empty tubes.

, There is very little difference between the cheap and expensive brushes for the amateur painter, so buy mid-priced or student brushes. There is no need for dozens of them. You can complete a painting with around six brushes, one of which should be a fan brush used to soften the edges of the painting.

, Available in various shapes and sizes such as oblong, round, and kidney shaped, and in numerous materials plastic, wood etc, the kidney shaped palettes do look very arty, though they are cumbersome and heavy when using regularly.


Cleaning and scraping palettes is time consuming, so if you would rather spend your valuable time painting, why not use disposable plastic or paper plates normally used at parties? The white background helps you to see the exact colour being mixed and there is no mess. You just thrown them away when you have finished with them. Grey is an even better color. If you can get paper plates in grey, you can see your values easier in light colors on grey.
If you use a palette on the table instead of holding it in your hand (what the thumb hole type of palette is for), then a plain piece of glass with white or grey paper under it makes a good palette. Grey paper shows the exact colour and value of the mixture.

, At £3.00 for a small bottle, pure artist turpentine, made from pine trees, is widely available in art shops. You can use this mainly to clean brushes and not, in fact, to thin paint. For mixing with paint, use odorless mineral spirits or odorless substitutes like Winsor & Newton Sansodor, Turpenoid, etc.


To avoid using too much thinner, go ahead and spend the money for a double dipper medium and oil container that clips on your palette. Seal the cups after painting so that any unused thinner doesn't evaporate. A one-time expense will save your wasting expensive odorless thinner and artist grade oils.
To clean your brush using a minimum of thinner, use a rag or paper towel to squeeze most of the unwanted paint out of it. Dip the brush into the thinner cup and don't swish it around, lift it out and scrub with the rag again. Repeat several times and it's clean while you still have lots of thinner in the cup.
Consider not cleaning your brush until you're done with the painting. Small traces of previous colors will mix with the color you're using to harmonize color throughout the painting. This is especially useful if you're using a small palette — very few colors — because they'll all have a trace of the other colors.
Don't throw away the ""palette mud"" - the mixtures left over after you've painted. Scrape them together with a palette knife, cover with clear plastic kitchen wrap, then put the palette in your freezer. Warm it up again and you can paint once more. The neutral mixture is a good base for many elements in a painting. It can be tinted more toward one or the other colors with fresh paint and still used.
Paint daily, at least a small painting. Again, this is a good use for left over paint when you're done.

, Instead of using very thick paint for texture strokes and impasto, get a thickening medium like an impasto medium or painting butter to extend artist grade paint, which is concentrated.


Try using the absolutely brilliant medium, Liquin Original, which is bought in appropriate quantities from art shops. It helps the paint to dry more quickly and at the same time provides a great glaze.

, A little time spent combing the places where people offload their unwanted hobby supplies can pay enormous dividends for building up your oil painting supplies. Here are some savvy finds:


Check Craigslist, eBay and other auction and swap sites as well as car boot (trunk) sales for bundles of supplies when someone else has given up oil painting (it happens frequently). You can get quite expensive supplies used at boot, used wares sales or auction sites in a bundle. This is also a good way to try artist grade paint and determine if it's worth it given your styles and habits.
If you use a lot of paint, snap up various lots and keep using what comes up as you discover how different brands behave. Most or all of them are compatible with each other.
Watch for clearance sales at art shops, art shops that are closing and especially sales after the holidays or before they start coming out with the new holiday catalogue. Very often expensive student or artist gift sets with lots of supplies are bundled together cheaper in the gift set starters, sometimes with a lovely wooden box to carry it all in. It was already a good cost effective bundle when it first came out, but when it's discontinued in favor of the latest gift sets, it's a steal. Some of the wooden box sets are well designed to use for painting outdoors too.
Online art supply companies like Jackson's in the UK or Dick Blick in the USA can often have regular prices at a steep discount from what they are in brick-and-mortar shops. For those of you living outside the USA, sometimes the biggest US art suppliers are cost-effective even with international shipping. Small and lightweight items may be more likely to come out worth the shipping cost. Get your easel locally but your most expensive paint tubes from those suppliers. It's also possible to split a large order and get extra savings by putting together a group order with other hobbyists, to take advantage of a 10% to 20% big order discount. Someone has to collect the money, place the order and have the rest over to pick up their stuff but it can save quite a lot.

, If you don't like a painting you've done, gesso over it and do a new painting; it's a tradition as old as art itself. Let your turpentine settle in a jar until the sludge settles out. Then, when it's mostly clean, pour off most of it into a clean jar where it can be used for cleaning again. If you don't like a painting you did on gessoed MDF, it's important to gesso both sides anyway so it won't bend - so add a bit more gesso to the clean, unused side, sand it smooth again, gesso again, paint on the back. Or do this even if you like the first painting so that you've got an interesting double-sided painting to frame just on the edges and hang or mount somewhere people can see both sides.


Ratty old brushes that are splayed out sometimes make good texture brushes and don't need to be thrown out. Just use them differently. You never know what new painting style you might discover when recycling drives your method.

, No doubt you'll discover more ways to trim down the budget and still achieve all that you want out of your oil painting hobby.

",How to Clean Oil Paint off a Paint Brush With Dish Soap," First, ask yourself this question: Why does the brush need to be cleaned? Here's why: oil brushes are easily stored for indefinite intervals--in a freezer. Therefore, the only reason to ever clean a brush is that the freezer is not large enough to store all the brushes needed; or, the there are so many new colors being added to the palette that storing brushes is not practical. Storing rather than cleaning is the greener solution. Oil paints do not mix well with the environment. If you can store the brush in the freezer; simply wrap it in aluminum foil; then, store. If you have many colors/brushes to store; you may wish to add a label.










Obtain rags (or paper towels), dishwashing detergent, container or jar.;

Paint a base coat.,
Use acrylic glazing liquid.Dab your paintbrush in the color you wish to blend and add a generous amount of acrylic glazing liquid to your paint brush on top of the paint.








,
Paint the color and the glazing liquid on the canvas.,
Add more colors and more acrylic glazing liquid.,
Let the paint and the glazing liquid dry.",How to Blend Acrylic Paint2," Let the base coat dry completely.









For example, if you want to paint a blended sky, paint a solid medium blue background and let it dry completely.
This method is better than the wet-on-wet method in some ways because you don't have to work as quickly. The glazing liquid does not dry as fast as the paint itself does, so this gives you more time to perfect the blending.
However, once the acrylic glazing liquid dries, you cannot paint over it anymore and you must wait until it is fully dry to start again if you need to continue blending.

,, On top of the dried base coat of paint, sweep your brush back and forth to apply the blending color and the glazing liquid.









For the sky example, you might want to add the glazing liquid and some darker blue paint to the top of the sky and some white paint with the glazing liquid at the bottom of the sky. This will give a nice dark to light blend for the sky overall.

, Keep adding paint (of various colors) and glazing liquid.Repeat this step as many times as you need to in order to achieve the desired look.








, Once everything is dry, you should have a perfectly blended painting.

Paint a base coat.,
Wait for the base coat to dry.,
Start blending the lighter colors.,
Use another paintbrush to continue blending.,
Blend the colors.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Blend Acrylic Paint3," Paint a base coat and let it dry completely. It should be darker then the color you want to blend over it, like black as the base coat to blending with grey.









Use sweeping horizontal lines to make your base coat., The black base coat must be completely dry before you continue.








, Using a damp paintbrush, paint a thin line of grey on the part you want to be the lightest in the painting.








, Take another brush, and dip it in water so it is damp.









You can also use the same paintbrush to add to the blending effect if you don't mind the previous colors being blended into the current colors.

, Carefully whisk away some of the grey onto the black so they blend. Do this is in a controlled fashion. The end result will go from grey to dark grey to black.








, Once the paint is dry, you'll have a nicely blended dark to light painting.

Wait at least a month after the painting is touch dry to use retouch varnish and give the painting a temporary shiny, finished look.",How to Oil Paint on Canvas," If you're just starting out, you can find many of these things by looking at gift sets that include all or most of them, sometimes in a nice wooden storage box or a table easel. What you will need at a minimum is:


A stretched canvas the size of the painting you would like to do. It's a good thing to also purchase several small ""canvas boards"" for practice and preliminary studies. You can also use canvas paper or canvas that comes in pads, as long as they say they're suited for oil painting and are gessoed. Try to choose a small board with the exact proportions of the stretched canvas but if it's not, get one larger so that you can mark up that shape on it.
Tubes of oil paint in a basic palette. If you're purchasing a set, it probably has all the most essential colors. The smallest essential palette has red, blue, yellow, Burnt Sienna and a large tube of white. If it's Winsor and Newton open stock, get Lemon Yellow, Permanent Rose and Ultramarine or French Ultramarine (they are chemically close.) If it's choosing primaries out of a set with more colors, use Alizarin Crimson or whichever the more purple cast red is, not the orange red. You could do without the Burnt Sienna but there's a reason for it besides mixing. If your set doesn't have it, use the reddish brown.
Buy the oil and thinner. Linseed oil is a traditional oil painter's medium. Some artists like walnut oil better. If you want your painting to dry faster, choosing a medium like Winsor & Newton's ""Liquin"" will make the oil painting dry faster. You will also need turpentine, or odorless turpentine substitute, sometimes called turpenoid, or white mineral spirits. This is a thin liquid that has a strong or slight odor, it's a paint thinner as opposed to a medium. Odorless paint thinners, like Weber's Turpenoid or Gamsol, are reputedly healthier to use, but always have proper ventilation when using volatiles. Oil paint itself is not toxic in the way that turpentine is in that it doesn't give off toxic fumes. But some oil paints contain toxic ingredients like cadmium and cobalt that can be quite harmful if ingested. Never eat, drink or smoke while using oil paint.
Buy some removable artist grade varnish such as Damar varnish intended for oil paintings. Varnish will probably have some toxic fumes and should be applied outdoors or in a well ventilated area. Definitely choose a removable artist grade varnish. Varnish is supposed to be added after the oil painting has completely dried all the way through and chemically changed to ""cure."" At that point a clear removable varnish gets added to give it a nice glossy finish and protect the paint layer. Every 25 to 30 years, the varnish should be removed by a conservator (or the artist or owner) with a varnish remover solution and reapplied, because the varnishes become yellow over time and aren't intended to be permanent. This is why very old oil paintings turn brown. They often just need cleaning and a clear new coat of varnish to look as bright as if they were painted last year. You don't need to buy the varnish before finishing the painting, since you won't use it till the painting's done and completely dried. ""Retouch varnish"" can be used as soon as a painting is touch dry. It doesn't hurt the paint layer, but the painting should feel thoroughly dry and you should wait a good month before using it. That gives a temporary finish if you want to sell the painting sooner.
Buy the brushes. Stiff ones are preferred. Bristle brushes are less expensive at the cheap end but good ones of either white synthetic fiber that's as stiff as bristle brushes are just as good. Some oil painters also use a soft sable brush with a long handle for different effects. Get a range of sizes, large medium and small, for blocking in areas, painting in the forms and objects and quite small ones for final details if you like detailed realism. A soft ""rigger"" brush with very long thin soft hairs gets used for ship's rigging, cat's whiskers and other long linear details in realism, it holds a lot of very thin paint and can be used to write your name small or do long smooth lines. For a beginner, it's recommended that you try a variety pack of bristle or synthetic bristle brushes with different shapes and sizes to discover the style each one creates.
Palette knife, painting knife or non serrated butter knife to serve as one for mixing paint. Palette knives are pretty cheap though if you get the plastic ones. The nicer metal ones don't stain and will last for years if kept clean. Painting knives have different shapes like trowels and angled things, each has a different effect and you can use those instead of brushes to do your whole painting.
Charcoal or a violet pastel pencil to sketch on the canvas.
A palette to put your oil paints on while using them. This can be an actual palette with a thumb hole or you can improvise with a cheap plain ceramic, glass or melamine plate. Something that could stand up to being washed off with turpentine is good. Many artists prefer a gray palette because the colors show up truest on gray. If you use a flat piece of glass on a table (very cheap if you take it out of a cheap photo frame) you can put gray paper under it to have a gray easily cleaned palette for every time you need it.
Two small cups for oil (or Liquin) and thinner. Some sets come with a ""double dipper"" that clips onto a palette, if so then your set probably also has a palette.
Painting rags. These can be any kind of clean rags. Strong paper towels will work but cloth rags are reusable if washed. Cloth baby diapers that have been used and washed, even worn out stained ones, make really good painting rags. Paper towels wear out fast––it's better to use old clothes that are soft like old t-shirts and stuff like that, actual rags. Try not to use fuzzy ones that shed though, since you may be wiping out painted areas with the rags. Use rags that are about at the end of their usefulness, unless you want to wash them out and keep reusing stained ones over and over.
An easel to work at, either a table easel set up on a table or a standing easel. This doesn't need to be expensive. The cheapest ""display easel"" will hold up any reasonably sized canvas at a comfortable working angle and its legs will adjust to a standing or sitting height. Unless you're disabled by age, disease or injury limiting the amount of time you can stay on your feet, it's much healthier to stand at the easel. This will also let you stand back every few strokes to see how the painting looks before adding to it, which makes for a better painting. You can also prop up the painting against a chair or other support, or otherwise improvise something. A ""painting horse"" is a bench with a board sticking up at the end that you straddle and prop the canvas into a groove.
Sketching supplies to plan the painting - pencil or charcoal, sketchbook or drawing paper or even scrap paper. They don't need to be archival since these are working sketches but if you like your sketches, you might as well get an actual sketchbook and use a soft pencil or even a pen or marker for it. Just something to sketch with and something to sketch on, your favorites. Your usual sketchbook and favorite drawing tools.
A safe, dust free place to put the wet painting to dry where nothing is going to bang into the wet side to smear it. Drying times for oil paintings vary from a few days to several months. Some types of oil painting take up to a year to ""cure"" before they can be varnished.;
, If it's a square, that's square. If it's rectangular or oval, decide if it's going to be vertical ""portrait"" orientation or horizontal ""landscape"" orientation. Do the notan drawings very small, just to place the light, dark and medium areas on the design. They can range from a large postage stamp to a business card size - the idea is to see it as if it was at a distance or a thumbnail. Do lots of them till you find the best design without worrying about the details.

, It can be quite detailed and shaded carefully or just loose to show you where the shadows and highlights are. This partly depends on how detailed and realist you want the painting with. A looser painting style can have a sketchier value sketch, but should still have one with more than ""white middle and black"" so that you can tell where there are at least five values - white accents, light value, medium, dark, black accents. Some painters like to not use pure black and white but just use ""light, light middle, middle value, middle dark, dark"" for the five values. It depends on the effect you want. If you don't like the sketch keep trying different versions of it till you get one you like.


In the sketch, make sure the light falling on the person, objects or landscape elements is all going in the same direction. Pay attention to where the shadows go. They should all go the same direction and are shorter when the sun or lamp is high, longer if it's later or earlier in the day and the sun is low (or lamp is low). Directional lighting will make all the objects look more three dimensional. Draw the shapes of the shadows carefully and most of your subjects will look three dimensional at that point. This makes for good Impressionism or realism.
If you want to do an abstract, do the pencil sketch loosely and work out where you want particular effects like spattering or strong texture strokes. Or skip the sketch stage on paper and proceed to the next.
Sketch the subject on the canvas board, canvas paper or canvas pad. Use charcoal or your violet pastel pencil. Mark up the exact proportions of the canvas on the board or pad if it's not exactly the same shape, so everything's placed the way it is in the planning sketches. Do this drawing as pure outlines. You can get detailed for realism by marking up eyes, mouth, any important shapes on it or you can keep it very simple just to the main shapes and main shadow shapes. Either way it should look like a Paint By Numbers canvas when the sketch is done. If you make mistakes, wipe off the charcoal or pastel pencil with a damp cloth, let that area dry and draw it again. Very correctable.

, Set out your yellow, blue, red and a larger dab of white with some distance between them. Optional, use Burnt Sienna as well. Leave all the other colors in the box if it was a gift set.

, Just paint right over the sketch into the areas of each color. Because this doesn't need to be detailed, you can try painting the color study with the palette knife or painting knife. If you don't like any of your color choices, use the palette knife to scrape off that bit and put the mixed-up paint off to the side on your palette in case you need some muddy brown. The mix of all three primaries will harmonize throughout the painting and so the mixed up paint can be separated and mixed with a little more to turn it into pale or dark browns and grays. No waste with a simple primary palette. Keep playing with the Color Study until you like it as a simple, bold painting done with a fairly big brush and not much detail. If necessary, do more than one of them till you work out what mixtures and colors you like. You're doing this little practice painting with the paint right out of the tube. It doesn't need either thinner or oil for this technique. If you like the look, you can do the big painting the same way just by using the palette knife and tube paint with bold strokes onto the canvas, no extra oil and no thinned out layer. That's a style of oil painting that's fast and powerful.

, On a landscape painting, using a violet pastel pencil is a very good choice because that color blends well with all the landscape colors without darkening or staining light colors as much as black. Charcoal and the violet pastel pencil are both easily corrected with a damp tissue or rag, so don't worry about making changes to the sketch! Draw it in, if you get it wrong wipe off the wrong bit and try again.

, Wipe your brushes and palette knife clean. Wash the brush you used if you used it for the color study, using the turpenoid - just dip it in the thinner and squeeze it out with a painting rag.

, Or if there isn't any white or much white in the three-color mud mix, use that for your brown thin layer. Thin it out by dipping your brush into the thinner, turpentine or turpenoid or Sansodor (the Winsor & Newton brand is good). Dip the wet brush into a little bit of paint and squeeze it around till you have very thin, transparent paint that's light. Paint in the light areas on your painting following the notan. Using a little more paint, do the medium light and successively darker areas with the Burnt Sienna, still thinning it till it's like ink in texture. Even the dark areas should have a fair amount of paint thinner in them. The more thinner you use, the faster this transparent Burnt Sienna value layer will dry.


Wow. The transparent value painting in Burnt Sienna usually looks pretty cool at this stage. It's still easy to change if you got it too dark somewhere or too light somewhere. Take a rag and wipe off the part you don't like and redo it the right value, or add a little more color. Or wipe out and change the shape. Gee, you thought oil painting had to be perfect, nope, it's very easy to correct and make changes all the way through. This stage will dry pretty fast, within a few minutes to half an hour. The thinnest parts may be touch dry by the time you finish the other corner. It only needs to be touch dry.

, This is structural. That first layer - the value sketch you paint over - was very lean - almost all turpentine or turpentine substitute, very little oil. Just the amount of oil in a little bit of staining paint to make it show up. It looks almost like watercolor on paper at that thinner layer. You can do successive washes in different colors if you want a fun technique at the ""wash"" layer. The next layer is ""Alla Prima"" or paint right from the tube the way you did the color study. That's sort of medium fatness, like someone who's not fat or skinny. After that, the more oil or Liquin that you add to the paint, the fatter it is. The problem of Lean Over Fat is that the oiliest layers dry the slowest, so the faster drying paint should be under it. Otherwise the outside will dry before the inside and the inside might remain squishy and sealed.


Worst case, a painting that has Lean over Fat can slide off the canvas on a hot day, losing all paint cohesion. This happened at least once to a past student of a teacher who told the story.
Never use oil pastels under oil paint because their oil formula includes mineral oil that never dries. You can optionally add oil pastel marks on the last layer of an oil painting when it's touch dry.

, Mix your colors half on the palette, half on the canvas. Start with getting the main areas of light and shadow blocked in with the right general colors, then add in more paint to modify them. Shade gradually and blend them gently where you want the paint to be smooth without showing much brush strokes. Dab on lots of it and leave it where you want strong textures like an Impressionist painting, or use knife strokes to make bold textures. Contrasting smooth textures and bold ones so that some parts of the painting are raised ""impasto"" texture and others are smooth and carefully painted is very lively. So vary the amount of ""alla prima"" texture you put on. Mix some of the oil into the paint if you want to lay it on thin and brush out the brush strokes to keep it smooth. As long as it's still wet, you can mix more oil or more paint in to make that layer fatter or thinner. But if it starts to dry or skin over, don't put anything leaner over what has fat in it.


Unless you want a really ugly special effect, like painting a zombie's face and putting a big pocket of fat in on the cheek, then letting it dry wrong, then ripping it open to have the paint skin dangle down and the clump of brownish-red fat paint hit the air and dry solid, maybe dripping over the rip. Almost any mistake can be turned into a special effect once you know how it works.

, This means you can paint all day, fool around with it, go to bed, put an empty box over the palette so your cat won't walk in it, start over tomorrow and keep making changes while it's wet. You can use the palette knife to scrape off whole areas of it before it dries and start over. Oil paint's slow drying time allows plenty of changes before you decide it's done and let it dry.

, It would take at least two weeks unless you used Liquin as your medium. Liquin dries faster than paint from the tube, so use at least a bit of it into all the paint so that it all bonds well. It's not fat, but oil right from the tube is. You can also get alkyd oils that have alkyd (the main ingredient of Liquin medium) right in the tube paint, where the painting may take only a couple of days to a week to touch dry depending on how thick the paint is.

, Start as described here, do the thin Burnt Sienna layer, then using tube texture paint and carefully brushing it, do a realistic black and white painting with all the details of your subject just using Ivory Black and Titanium White. Let that ""grisaille"" or ""dead layer"" dry thoroughly. It will look like a black and white photo in a way, very detailed. Then start mixing oil with all your colors, using them very thin, start painting over the grisaille layer. Covering the black and white painting with various transparent colors will let the light bounce back and forth within the dried layers and give it a unique luminosity. Only slow, heavily layered colored pencil rendering comes close to the effect. It's one of the things oil painting is famous for.


You can try this method if you have a lot of time to let each glazed layer dry before doing the next. But if you don't want to take that long, just let the grisaille dry, add a bit of oil, paint over it in the right colors and add one final glaze when that layer's dry. You can get as elaborate or as simple as you like with oil painting.

, Repeat several times till almost all the paint is off before swishing them in thinner, otherwise it wastes thinner. Store your painting rags and supplies away from any open flame or electrical circuits or heaters or anything that can start a fire. Seal them in a metal can if you have one handy. If you store your palette with paint squeezed on it in the fridge, it will slow the drying and you can use the squeezed out paint longer. But don't let anyone mistake it for food.

, You can build a vertical drying rack with a home built cabinet where you put peg board panels a couple of inches apart to lean one wet painting into each slot. If you do a lot of oil painting, this is a good DIY project to leave you more garage space. Since you are creating fumes with the thinner, it's a good idea to use the garage and other areas that people don't spend as much time in or have very good studio ventilation. Storing them in vertical slots reduces the amount of dust that falls on the painting while it's drying, it'll mostly accumulate on the top edge instead of the front of the painting.

, Just paint the sides too, either wrap the painting around or paint them black or put a design, do something fun with it. Then you don't need to buy a frame to either sell it in a gallery or give it as a present, it's ready to hang when it's dry and varnished.

, Some colors dry matte and flat, others shiny, it can be annoying till the varnish is on. Then wait another eleven months to add Damar varnish or any other removable conservator varnish and let that dry for a few days. Your painting will now last longer than you will.

Wet the dirty area.,
Apply detergent.,
Clean the damp spots.,
Rinse.",How to Clean a Teddy Bear1," First, dampen a cloth. Then gently apply the wet cloth to the bear. Moisten and rub the dirty area to loosen dirt without soaking the bear any more than needed.Don’t worry if you end up using “too much” water. All this means is that you will have to wait a little bit longer for your bear to dry before it is ready to play with again.;
, Add a dab of dish soap or laundry detergent to a clean portion of the cloth. Only use a small dab of detergent at a time. Avoid creating an excess of suds, which will be harder to rinse out thoroughly, thus making the fur crunchy as it dries.If you have several spots or bears to clean, or expect to have to clean toys often, mix either 1 teaspoon of dish soap for every 1 cup of water in a spray bottle,or mix a drop of liquid laundry detergent for every 1 cup of water. Spray the solution directly on the dirty spot.
If there is one, check the bear’s care label to see if it recommends or warns against any particular chemical.

, Gently rub the dirty area with that portion of the cloth until the dirt has been removed. Handle the bear gently as you do so to avoid damage. Apply another dab of detergent and repeat as needed.Only rub the dirty area. Avoid spreading soap and suds so that you don't miss any when it is time to rinse them off.

, Find a fresh, clean towel. Dampen it with water. Gently wipe the bear’s washed areas to remove soap and suds so that the fur doesn't become crunchy as it dries.This time, be sure to only slightly dampen the towel as opposed to soaking it, which may create or spread more suds while wiping the bear, and thus defeat the purpose.

Although there are dozens of brands of oil paint on the market, don’t be drawn in by the attraction of budget supplies. Buying cheap, poor quality supplies will make your painting difficult, tedious, and frustrating. Paying a few dollars more will give you paints that require one coat instead of two or three for the same vibrancy and blend-ability.


The most basic collection of oil paints should include the following colors: cadmium yellow, yellow ochre, cadmium red, alizarin crimson, ultramarine blue, titanium white, and mars black. You can use a combination of all of these colors to make any hue on the color wheel.(eg. yellow and red to make orange)
You will find that you likely will run out of white paint the fastest, so buy a large tube of this while purchasing small or medium tubes of paint for the others.
Avoid buying “student sets” of paint, as these will seem like a good deal, but offer the poorest quality supplies. Also avoid buying sets of paint that come with paint brushes, as the brushes will likely be of poor quality as well.;
, Beginning painters often fall under the tendency to avoid getting certain supplies to save money. While this is a perfectly all right practice, there are a few basic painting essentials you will need to make oil painting enjoyable and easy.


Choose a few basic paintbrushes of a high quality material. You don’t need many brushes to start out, but get a few of each kind. Start with differing sizes of round, flat, and bristle brushes.
Synthetic brushes are made of a very soft, fine bristle while natural hair brushes are a bit rougher. Use both for different painting techniques.
You will also need a palette knife for blending paints, a painting palette, canvas boards or stretched canvas, and some old rags and jars for cleaning your brushes.
Oil paint is very thick directly out of the tube, and must be made thinner for the first layers using white spirits or turpentine, and a blending medium such as linseed oil or poppy oil for later layers. The rule is 'Thick on thin', and this prevents later cracking or separation of layers.
Optional supplies include an easel or drafting desk, an apron, a drop cloth, and a specialized box for carrying all your supplies., Because oil painting does require a lot of supplies, you will need a large area to use. Set up your easel or table in an area that is away from foot traffic and direct sunlight, if possible. If you have one, lay a drop cloth down to prevent any paint spills from ruining your floors.


Oil paint can give off fumes, so make sure that your area is well ventilated with an open window or door.
If you are using an easel, adjust it to the correct standing or sitting position and angle. Make sure that it is sitting in such a way to make painting comfortable for you, not difficult.
Put on old paint clothes to protect your nice clothes and skin. Oil paint is notorious for being exceedingly difficult to clean off, so make sure that you take precautions to avoid coming into contact with it.
If you have long hair, pull it up into a ponytail or bun to make sure that it does not fall in the paint. Remove any rings or bracelets that you might be wearing.

, Use a hard pencil to create a light sketch of your subject. You can do this directly onto the canvas or onto tracing paper, and transfer it using a carbon copy. When you’re drawing your subject, keep in mind the composition and use of negative space.


Composition is the placement of items on the canvas. Choose the best placement so that the eye is drawn around the entirety of the canvas, rather than left to linger on a single spot.
Negative space is the space around an object. If you are using an item in real life and are drawing it onto your canvas, draw difficult areas by looking at the space around the figure rather than at the figure itself. Consider what you will fill the negative space with once you start the painting in order to make your subject pop.
Make note of overlapping figures, as these add depth to your composition. If your subject doesn’t have any overlapping shapes, consider rearranging until you do. This will add realism to your painting.

, To create a realistic painting, you must have obvious patches of light and dark. Look at your subject and determine the angle at which the light is coming from, and where shadows and highlights are located.


All light sources cast shadows, but if they are directly above the subject it can be difficult to see them. Try moving your light or your subject so that the shadows and highlights are more obvious.
You may not have incredibly dark shadows or incredibly bright highlights. In fact, you likely will have a range of values that are all very near each other. Don’t be concerned if your light source isn’t creating a strong definition of shadows and highlights.

, For new painters, it is often very difficult to match the colors of their subject to the colors they mix with their paint. This is because the brain provides an idealized color value; you see the sky is blue, so you mix blue paint, only to realize that your paint is much brighter and colorful than the actual sky. The trick is to get past the symbols of color our brain uses, and examine the actual colors being used. This will change the brightness of your paints.


A painting set at night will be darker and richer than one during the day, which is most likely brighter.
Check the color of the light source; on a bright sunny day, your subject will have a golden glow. On a gray day, the light is diffused through the clouds giving your subject a gray tint. You may also have actual colored lights - such as neon signs or tinted light bulbs - that affect the colors of your subject.

, Are you painting a still life with little to no movement? Or is your figure in a field on a windy day, creating a lot of motion? Paying attention to the movement of your subject is important for planning your brush strokes. Realistic paintings have brush strokes that create movement, or a lack thereof.

, Oil paint is extremely forgiving in the sense that it takes many days to begin to dry. However, it is nearly impossible to mix the same paint twice so mix your paints in large batches and preserve between painting sessions so that you always have enough of the right color.


Use a color wheel to help you find colors to mix. The color wheel shows primary, secondary, and tertiary colors and how to make them.
Pure hues are colors that have not been mixed with either white or black. You can mix the primary colors to create the secondary colors.
To create a tint, add white to your paint. This will lighten it and make a more pastel color.
To make a shade, add black to any paint color.
To make a tone, add white to a shade (any color with black added). Tones are the most widely used, as they represent most of the everyday colors we see.

, You can choose whatever painting technique you like, whether that be painting entire sections to completion or putting layers of paint over the entire canvas. When oil painting, though, use the thin-to-thick method in which you paint with thin paint before using thick paint.


Try painting basic subjects. All figures are made up out of a few basic shapes: the cube, cone, cylinder, and ring. Paint these in the form of real subjects, such as a box or orange, or paint a flat form of each.
To thin your paint, use a blending medium (linseed oil or terpentine) mixed with your paint. Don’t use too much to start, but gradually add more until you get the consistency you want.
It takes three days for a layer of paint to dry enough to add a second layer to the top, so be patient while you wait for your paint to dry.

, There are dozens of ways to perfect your painting, but learning them all as a beginner can be overwhelming. instead, focus on picking up some of these techniques one at a time.


Try blending your paints. This is the process by which you slowly fade two or more different colors (think of a sunset). To do this, add layers of paint so that they are directly adjacent to each other on the canvas. Then, use flat brush to smooth the paints together, working with the direction of the blend.
Try creating a glaze. This is when you use a solution of 1/3 linseed oil,1/3 terpentine, and 1/3 varnish to create a transparent color. You can use this mixed with any paint color to create a see-through hue over dried paint.Use stippling to create small dots. Use a natural bristle brush (dry often works best), and tap it vertically against your canvas. You can build up these dots to create a more opaque figure.
Try using a palette knife to paint. This technique is great for landscapes and creating movement on your canvas. Scoop up a bit of paint on the bottom edge of the knife, and sweep it across the canvas to create thick layers of paint.

, You have about three days (while the oil paint is wet on the canvas) when you can alter any mistakes or remove them completely with a damp rag. Before you decide the painting is complete, take a step back and look at your painting in its totality to see if any changes are needed.

, If you have a lot of paint left on your palette that was not used, save it for your next painting. Scoop it into small containers or into piles on your palette and cover with saran wrap.

, Oil paint will ruin your brushes if it is allowed to dry, so clean your brushes immediately after use. Use turpentine and an old rag to wipe away as much of the paint as you can then rinse them under warm water with a little washing up liquid. You can brush the bristles against the palm of your hand to make sure all the paint has been removed. Put the clean brushes, bristle-end up, in a jar or cup to dry. Make sure that the brushes get adequate air circulation until they dry: Put your brushes them in an open area-- on a shelf or desk, for example, not in a closed cabinet or drawer.

, For oil paint to dry completely, it may take up to 3 months, even longer if your painting has many thick layers of paint. Put your painting where it won’t be disturbed or damaged and allow it to air dry for the necessary time.

, When your painting has dried completely, add a coat of varnish to protect it and preserve the color. When the protective varnish has dried, you’re done! Hang your beautiful creation for all to see!

Rinse.",How to Clean a Teddy Bear2," First, remove any of the bear’s clothing that can be washed separately so you can clean the bear itself thoroughly. Then mix a dash of soap with warm water in a sink or large bowl. Submerge the bear.To prevent the bear from becoming overly logged with water, only submerge the first part (head, limbs, back side, front side, etc) that you intend to clean.
Use a high-efficiency (HE) dish or laundry detergent that produces few suds in order to make rinsing easier., Use your fingers to softly knead and massage any dirt, grime, or stains that come off easily.For tougher spots, use a sponge,face flannel, or towel. Gently rub the dirty areas until the dirt dislodges. For particularly tough spots, be sure to go soft and easy, regardless of the time it takes, to avoid pulling the fur out by its roots.


Make sure to clean behind its ears, along its neck, and any other areas where seams create crevices and extra dirt might collect.

, Empty the sink or bowl of soapy warm. Fill it again with only water. Submerge the bear again. Gently massage it to release soapy residue.Drain the sink or bowl and repeat as needed until all soap has been removed.

Check if a machine-wash is safe.,
Prep your bear for a safe wash.,
Run the machine.",How to Clean a Teddy Bear3," Inspect the age and quality of your bear. Also check the materials from which it is made, as well as those that adorn it. Since a machine-wash will be much rougher on the toy than a hand-wash, err on the side of caution and hand-wash it if you determine that your bear might not survive the machine. Do not machine-wash the following:Old teddy bears, those that are delicate by design, and those that have become fragile due to lots of use.
Bears that are made of wool, mohair, alpaca fur, or rayon.
Any with attached add-ons like sequins, buttons, or eyes that have been glued on.

, If your bear has any clothes than can be removed, take them off to prevent tangling and to make sure that the bear itself is washed thoroughly. Trim any loose threads and sew up any tears or holes so the problem doesn’t grow any worse during the wash.Give your bear extra protection by closing it within a sealable pillowcase or mesh bag., First, add an appropriate amount of detergent to your washer. Then set the machine’s cycle to “Hand-Wash” or “Delicate.” Finally, select cold or warm water. Then start the wash cycle.Do not use hot water, since this may ruin the bear.
Do not include items that are excessively dirty or whose colors may bleed in the same wash cycle as your bear.

"
"
Gently remove excess water.,
Allow your bear to air-dry.,
Use a dryer.,
Brush the bear.",How to Clean a Teddy Bear4," Once you finish washing your bear, get rid of as much water as you can without handling the bear too harshly, so that it dries quicker and more thoroughly. Squeeze water from its limbs, torsos, and head, but be careful to keep their original shape. Do not wring or twist them as you would with a bath towel.Then use a towel to softly pat any remaining moisture from their fur., For best results, let your toy dry on its own. Either set it on top of a drying rack, away from direct sunlight, and let it sit overnight, or set it in a drying bag and hang that from a laundry line, as long as the laundry line is shaded.Do not hang the bear itself from any laundry line or rack, since this may damage it.Setting up a fan to blow directly on the bear will help it to dry out quicker., For quicker results, use a laundry dryer or hair dryer to speed things up. However, there is considerable risk in ruining your bear this way, so be extra careful. If you use a laundry dryer, stick with the air cycle. Check the bear every few minutes to make sure no damage has occurred. If you use a hair dryer, be mindful of the heat.Set it to its coolest setting and hold the dryer at least a foot away from the bear as you dry it.


If your bear was too delicate for a machine-wash, consider it to be too delicate for a machine-dry, as well.

, Once the bear has dried out, use a clean comb or brush to freshen up its fur. Judge the feel of it as you do so. Although the fur’s quality won’t ever be the same once you start washing it, be on the lookout for any areas that feel crunchy. This may be a sign of soap that wasn’t rinsed out, so if your bear feels crunchy all over, either rinse it out and dry it all over again, or be sure to use less soap in the future."

You don’t have to necessarily limit yourself to one specialty, though, because you'll often attract more business if you offer more services. For example, you might advertise yourself as an event and portrait photographer. Those two specialties go well together because a couple who hired you to shoot their wedding and liked their photos may remember you when it comes time to have their children's portraits taken.Event photography typically means taking photos at weddings, parties, graduations, and other special events.
If you specialize in portrait photography, you’ll be taking photos of individuals, which often means families, children, and even pets.
Commercial and product photography usually involves taking photos of products, properties, and other items to help a business market themselves.
Stock photography refers to photos that are taken for the sole purpose of being sold. You can sell your photos through a stock photo agency, where individuals and businesses who need a photo of a certain object or situation can purchase them.
News photographers take pictures of noteworthy events and people. While it can be an exciting job, it’s extremely difficult to break into the field as freelancer if you don't have previous experience.;
, Like any business, a freelance photography business needs some type of permit or license to operate in your city, county, or state. In most cases, you need a general business license. However, if you are running your business out of your home, you may also need a Home Occupancy Permit. Don't start taking any photos before you have the necessary license(s).If you're unsure what license(s) you need in your area or how to obtain them, you can find more information on the Small Business Administration's website (SBA.gov).

, As a freelancer, it will be your responsibility to pay both federal and state taxes because they won't be automatically taken out of your earnings as they would be by an employer. Because it can be somewhat confusing, it's usually a good idea to consult an accountant, whose knowledge and expertise can often help save you money.Try to find an accountant who specializes in small businesses, so you can trust that they're up to date on all the tax codes and benefits that will affect you.
You can also ask your accountant for advice on what type of structure your business should take. Most photography businesses are usually sole proprietorships, meaning they're owned by a single person who receives all of the profits.

, Before you can start lining up clients, you need to know how much you plan to charge for your services. When it comes to creating a fee schedule, you should factor in expenses such as equipment, taxes, and operation fees. However, you should also consider the time that goes into each project, including transportation time, so you can ensure that you're making enough money to survive.There are various types of software, such as fotoQuote and BlinkBid, that help you estimate the costs involved in photography projects and create invoices for your customers.

, As you start your business, it's important to consider how you plan to collect fees from your clients. For example, you may decide to only accept cash. However, it's usually better to offer as many payment options as possible, so consider allowing credit card and check payments as well.If you want to accept credit cards for your photography services, there apps and dongles that make it possible to process them from your tablet or smartphone. You can also have your website set up to accept some type of online credit card payments.

, The most important tool in marketing yourself as a freelance photographer is an impressive collection of photos that you can show off to prospective clients. If you’re just starting out, ask family and friends if you can take photos of them for your portfolio. You can also seek out local models who might need photos for their own portfolios, so you can help each other out.Remember to consider your audience when you’re building your portfolio. For example, if you plan to market yourself as a wedding and event photographer, don’t fill your portfolio with nothing but product shots.
If possible, create both a digital and hard copy of your portfolio. Some clients may enjoy the convenience of looking at your photos online or through a link, while others are more impressed with actual photographs.

, When you’re starting a freelance photography business, you need a website to showcase your work so prospective clients can see what they can expect. You can also use your site to allow potential customers to get in touch with you, schedule your services, and deliver your finished photos. Make sure the site is easy to navigate, and contains only your best photos.If you don’t know much about building a website, WordPress is a good place to start because they have templates and themes designed specifically for photography.
It’s a good idea to incorporate a blog into your website. Post a new photo with entry, so clients can see what you’ve been up to recently.

, In addition to a website, social media is an ideal way to market your services online. Photography is a visual medium, so a great photo can quickly go viral and familiarize potential clients with your work. Create Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest accounts, so you can show off your work in a setting where it’s much easier for people to share it.Include links to all of your social media accounts on your website, so potential clients can easily find them.

, Word of mouth can be an effective way for freelance photographers to get new clients, so it helps to have business cards that you can give to family, friends, and existing clients. They can pass the cards onto people they know who might be interested in your services.Create a distinct look for your business cards by including one of your photos on it. It can be a self-portrait so clients remember you specifically or a photo that you're particularly proud of and showcases your skills.
Make sure that your cards contain all of your contact information, including your web address. You want potential clients to be able to find your online portfolio.

, Hopefully, word of mouth will spread about your photography skills, but you don’t want to wait around for jobs to come to you. By making connections with related businesses, you may be able to find new clients. For example, if you want to work as an event photographer, you might contact wedding or party planners, catering halls, and other event-related businesses to introduce yourself and your work. That way, if a person planning an event asks for a recommendation for a photographer, your contact can pass your name along.If you’re interested in working as a commercial or product photograph, you might try to find a contact at a marketing or public relations firm.

, When you’re just starting out as a freelance photographer, building word of mouth is key. That’s why it often helps to do some jobs for free -- you can gain experience and generate a buzz with potential clients. If you’re specializing in special event or portrait photography, ask family and friends if they need any photographs taken. If you hope to break into commercial or product photography, see if there are any small businesses in your area that might allow you to shoot photos for their marketing materials.You may also want to consider holding sessions where you don't charge for the session itself. Instead, the clients only pay if they decide to purchase prints from you. That can be an effective way to lure new customers in and still make some money.
Make sure to ask all of your free clients for testimonials after you take the photos. If they’re positive, you can use them in your promotional materials or as references for potential clients. If your free clients have any criticisms of your work, use them to improve your skills and services.

, If you want a career as a freelance photographer, you can’t take photos with your phone or an old point-and-shoot camera. That's why it's important to invest in an up-to-date digital camera that you can use to take high-quality photos and upgrade the equipment when your business starts turning a profit. When you're first starting out, consider purchasing a used camera and other equipment you might need to help keep costs down.
Depending on what type of photography you plan to specialize in, you may also need lights, diffusers, and reflectors to ensure that the lighting is right for your photos.
While your camera comes with a lens, you may want to purchase additional lenses, such as a wide zoom or pancake, to allow you to vary your shots.
In order to edit your photos, you’ll also need access to a computer and photo editing software.

, Some photography skills come naturally, such as having a good eye for composition, but there is some knowledge that needs to be learned, particularly if you’re not very familiar with using a camera. If you’re studying at or planning to attend college, your school probably offers photography courses, and may even have a major in the subject that can help prepare you for a career.If you’re not in college, consider taking some photography courses at your local community college or vocational school.
If you can't find any local photography classes, many online school offer courses that can help your refine your skills.
Art classes can also be helpful to a photographer because they can teach you how to develop a better eye and allow you to work on your composition.
If you’re going to be running your own freelance business, you may want to take some business, marketing, and accounting classes too.

, Before you branch out on your own, it helps to get some job experience in the photography field. Working as an assistant to a professional photographer can be a great opportunity to learn tips and techniques, and ask the photographer for feedback on your pictures so you can improve your work. However, you can also work at a portrait studio where you take the photos yourself, and learn firsthand the kind of photos that customers tend to prefer.All of your on-the-job training doesn’t necessarily have to be paid. You can offer your photography services to friends and family who are having special events, such as anniversary parties or graduations, and get experience that way.

, When you’re feeling more confident, entering photography contests can be a good way to see how well your skills stack up against other photographers. If you win, you’ll also have an ideal achievement to add to your resume. In most cases, contests will also encourage you to be more creative with your photos, which may help you down the road.If you aren’t aware of any local photography contests, do an online search. You’ll find a wide array of national and international competitions that you may be interested in.

, Receiving constructive criticism from fellow photographers can help you hone your skills and take your photos to the next level. If you're a student, your college or university may have a photography club where you can discuss your work with other photographers.If you're not in school, you might ask at your local retail camera store to see if there are any clubs in your area.If you can't find a club in your area, consider starting your own. Ask other photographers that you know if they'd be willing to meet on a weekly or monthly basis to critique one another's work.
Online photography groups or communities are another option if you can't find a group locally. You post your photos online, and other members can provide feedback. You can do an online search, but Google+ and Lightstalking are too good places to start.

Get a black bridal veil. You can buy them by the yard from an arts and crafts store (or you can get them from a nearby 'Goth' bride).

This helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.


Stretch a piece over lens and bayonet (usually about 4 inches square) the lens hood over the material.

It will tear up due to this use eventually, but buying it by the yard is fairly inexpensive.
'Black dot' filters can also be bought for a similar effect but aren't as easily portable.
For an even further amount of diffusion, rubber band the material around the lens. Because it is further away from the lens, it will soften it even more.


Open up the lens a half stop from the meter reading, however you acquire it.

, This has three strengths for different effects. The advantage to this is no exposure compensation.

,


Get a beat-up, ratty skyline filter.
Use clear nail polish and create some of the suggested effects to start with and then add to your collection.

Leave clear a slightly off-center circle about 3/8s of an inch. Apply small streaks of polish radiating outward from the clear area. This will apply minimal diffusion.
Leave the same area clear but cover the remainder of the lens with a heavy layer of polish. This is a moderate edge diffusion.
Try the previous effect, but when it is almost dry, stipple the painted area with the nail brush. This is a super soft diffusion.

Check that your camera has a tripod mount.,
Remove the camera plate from your tripod.,
Level the tripod.,
Screw the camera onto the tripod.,
Clamp the camera to the tripod.,
Re-mount the camera plate to the tripod.,
Take your pictures!,
Make sure that you're using the right camera plate.,
Hang your camera bag from the center column of the tripod.,
Don't attach the camera directly to the legs.",How to Attach a Camera to a Tripod," Most modern cameras are tripod-capable, but some smaller cameras are not. The tripod mount is a small hole with screw threads located on the bottom of the camera; it is usually about 1/4 inch in diameter. If your camera isn't tripod-capable, you will be unable to mount it to a tripod.


Most small cameras of the ""point and shoot"" variety have 1/4-20 UNC threads. Some larger, professional cameras may have 3/8-16 UNC threads.;
, The camera plate is the piece that fixes the camera to the tripod. Look for a quick-release clip or lever that will unlock the camera plate from the main body of the tripod. There are many ways to connect a camera to the main body of your tripod. However, almost all tripods use a detachable camera plate to make it easier to mount your device./images/thumb/4/49/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-2-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/4/49/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-2-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-2-Version-4.jpg









You don't technically need to detach the mount from the tripod. However, this step will make it much easier to screw the camera onto the tripod.
Make sure that the plate on the tripod features the same size screw as your camera. Not every camera is compatible with every camera plate. You may be able to buy a new camera plate that fits both your camera and your tripod.

, Adjust the legs so that they stand stably on the ground. Release the tensioners on the legs, and raise them to the height that you need them. You can technically attach a camera to the tripod before you set up the tripod – but your camera will be safer if you set up the base first. If you extend the legs, check that they are securely locked in place before you mount the camera./images/thumb/8/8b/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-3-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/8/8b/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-3-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-3-Version-4.jpg









Your tripod does not need to be absolutely level. It should, however, be balanced enough that the tilt isn't noticeable. Leveling is more important if you're taking panoramic shots and stitching multiple frames together into one image.
Some tripods feature a built-in bubble level that helps you stabilize the rig. Otherwise, you can always buy or borrow a small level.

, The camera might screw directly onto the tripod; you might need to clamp it into place; and you might need to tighten screws to hold the camera steady. Look for a threaded hole in the bottom of the camera. If your camera screws directly onto the tripod, then the camera plate (tripod mount) should have a matching screw. Twist the pieces together until they are snugly joined.
/images/thumb/4/45/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-4-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/4/45/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-4-Version-3.jpg









Some tripods will have a small screw-head on the underside of the plate. In this case, tighten the screw-head from the bottom of the plate instead of twisting the plate itself onto the camera.
The connection should be snug, but not over-tight. Too-tight screws can put stress on the mounting system, which could in turn damage your camera or tripod., Some tripod heads use a clamping mechanism rather than a simple screw. Some use a clamp to supplement the screw. Place the camera gently between the clamps, then find the tightening mechanism. You will likely need to tighten screws or twist knobs to make the clamps fit the camera. Adjust until the device is held securely in place.

, If you removed the camera plate for an easier attaching job, make sure to re-attach it so that you can use the tripod. Pull back the quick-release lever, fit the mounted plate onto the tripod head, and release the lever.When in doubt: simply reverse the steps you took when you detached the camera plate from the tripod.

, You should be able to swivel the camera on the tripod for pan shots, but you can always move the rig to a more convenient spot. Before you take any photos, look through the viewfinder to check that the lens is angled exactly how you want it. Make sure that the tripod is level and stable when you shoot./images/thumb/6/66/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-7-Version-3.jpg

, Check that the camera plate you're trying to connect to your camera was designed to go with your tripod. If you’re having difficulty getting the plate to connect with the tripod, it may be because the plate and the tripod don’t go together. Most manufacturers have their own connection system. You won't be able to mount a camera plate to a tripod if they weren't designed to work together./images/thumb/f/fe/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-8-Version-2.jpg

, If you're still having trouble getting a clear picture on unsteady ground, try hanging your camera bag—or any object of comparable mass—from the center column. This should make your tripod more stable, and it should help minimize the shakes./images/thumb/6/66/Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Attach-a-Camera-to-a-Tripod-Step-9-Version-2.jpg

, Most professional-grade tripods are sold with the legs and tripod head packaged separately. This allows photographers to mix and match exactly the gear they're looking for.If there is no way to move the camera around on the top of the tripod, then you'll need to work around it. Consider getting a tripod head.

Desaturate the colors. Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left to turn the picture black and white.
Because there was no masked areas in the Hue/Saturation mask, everything turned black and white. To get color back into the picture, we're going to have to paint a mask in. For this example, we'll colorize just the lips.

With the zoom tool selected, drag across the area you want to zoom in on. This will be necessary for the best control of the brush.

, You can do this by clicking on the brush icon, or by typing B on your keyboard. To bring some color back to her lips, we're going to paint in a mask with the brush.

When we masked the eyes in the first method, the mask was solid black. Because of the vibrant color of the photo, though, her lips would look almost clownish on black and white, so we're going to do something a little different.

,, Set your brush to be big enough to make the job go quickly, but small enough that you don't paint in too large an area. In this case, a little overflow is fine. We'll knock it back and clean it up in a moment.

An alternate method to make the initial selection is to use the Magic Wand tool (press W on your keyboard) and shift-click until you've selected the entire object.
Once it's selected to your satisfaction, make sure the Hue/Saturation layer is the active layer, and press alt-Delete to fill your selection with the foreground color.

, Now that you've painted the lips back in roughly, we'll clean up the edges and make it look good.

It is best to have a wide angle lens. This will provide more depth and photographic options for you. Telephoto or zoom lenses can be used, but the DOF may not be as dramatic.

,


When deciding on your subject--the part of your picture that needs to be in crystal clear focus--make sure you look at the areas in front of and beyond the subject. These are the areas that will be out of focus in your picture. Bokeh is a term used to refer to the blur of the picture.






The background should be a complimentary or contrasting color to your subject for optimal visual impact. A green field behind a red barn is an example of good contrast. The green in the field is going to blur out and give you a green backdrop for your subject.







,


You can use manual or auto-focus.







,


The aperture on a lens refers to the ""eye"" of the camera. The lens aperture is similar to the pupil of an eye. If it is dark outside, your pupil will dilate. The same holds true for your lens aperture. This is also referred to as the f-stop setting. The higher the f-stop number, the smaller the aperture. The smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture.






Try stopping down to a larger aperture, which means a smaller f-number. You can try starting with f/2.8. The lower your f-stop number, the shorter your DOF is going to be. The higher the f-number, such as f/22, the more of the picture will be in focus.







,


Creating bokeh is a matter of personal taste. Decide what you like best. Note the setting for future reference.







,


Being a little closer to your subject or further away can increase the drama of your picture.







, This can also add or reduce your depth of field. Using a zoom lens will increase Bokeh, and using a wide angle lens will reduce it."

The exposure is controlled by the camera's light meter. The light meter determines what the proper exposure is; it all sets the f-stop and shutter speed. The f-stop is a fraction; the f represents the focal length. The f-stop is determined by dividing the focal length by the aperture. f/2.8 would be 1/2.8 versus f/16 which would be 1/16. If you look at it like slices of a pie, you would get a lot more pie with 1/2.8 than you would with 1/16.
This can be very unnerving, but f-stops and shutter speeds on every picture to get the light right or the lightness and darkness and exposure.
A good way to understand it is to ""think of a bucket of water with a hole in the bottom. If you have a large hole in the bottom of the bucket (large aperture), water will drain out quickly (fast shutter speed). Conversely, for the same amount of water, if you have a small hole in the bottom of the bucket (small aperture), the water will drain out slowly (slow shutter speed).""

Exposure or lightness and darkness in the picture is a combination of the f-stop, which is the size of the hole in the lens, and the shutter speed, which is the length of time that the shutter is open. So, if you leave the shutter open longer, you're getting more light to the film or more light to the digital sensor, and the picture gets brighter, or lighter. If you shorten the exposure (give less light to the film or to the digital sensor), the exposure gets darker. Longer shutter speed: more exposure, more light; shorter shutter speed: less exposure, less light.;
, ""F-stop"" (also called ""f-number"") means fraction and the f-number is the fraction of the actual opening in the lens compared to the focal length of the lens. The aperture is the opening light passes through.

, Suppose that you have a lens with a focal length of 50mm and the f-number is f/1.8. The f-number is determined by focal length/aperture. So 50/x=1.8 or x~=28. The actual diameter where the light comes through the lens is 28mm across. If that lens had an f-stop of 1, for example, the aperture would be 50mm, because 50/1=50. That's what the f-stop actually means.

, In the manual mode you can set both the f-stop and shutter speed. If you really want to control the light, the exposure, and how the picture works, you need to learn to know how to use the manual exposure mode; it's not just for the propeller heads and the guys who still shoot film! Manual mode is still viable today even with digital because it's really how you control the look and feel of your picture.

, The aperture is really important to control the picture; it lets in the light, and the light is the most important thing for your picture. Without light, you won't have a picture.


Set the aperture to control both the light and the amount that is in focus, in other words, the depth of field.
Set a wide opening, like f/2 or 2.8, to blur the background and have your subject razor sharp. Also, you'll probably want to use the largest aperture when shooting in low-light, in order to prevent blur.
Shoot a medium aperture, 5.6 or 8 so the subject is sharp and background is slightly out of focus but still recognizable.
Shoot at smaller apertures, like f/11 and possibly smaller, for a landscape picture when you want the flowers in the foreground, the river, and the mountains all in focus. Depending on your format, tiny apertures like f/16 and smaller will cause you to lose sharpness due to diffraction effects.
For many photographers, the aperture is far more important to achieving great pictures than the shutter speed, because it controls the depth of field of the picture, whereas it's more difficult to tell if a picture was shot at 1/250 or 1/1000 of a second.

, You change the ISO on your digital camera to control the camera's sensitivity to light. In bright light, we set the camera to be less sensitive, to give us a picture with less noise since the shutter speed is fast enough at 100 ISO. In low light where there's less ambient light, you need more sensitivity in the camera. Therefore, raise the ISO from 100 to possibly 1600 or even 6400 if you have to, to get enough light in so that the picture isn't blurry. Now, what's the payback? As you raise the ISO, you get more noise (the film equivalent being grain) in the picture and less color, so be sure to set the ISO as low as possible without having the ISO too low that you end up with blurry pictures.

, The ISO on your digital camera is just like it is on film. You used to buy the film by the kind of light you were using. Today, you set the ISO on your camera depending on the light.


How do you set it? On some cameras there's a button right on the top of the camera that says ISO. You press the button, turn the dial, and change it.
Some cameras you have to go into the menu and find the ISO setting. Click on the ISO setting and turn the dial and change it. That's how you set the ISO on your digital camera.

, Change the shutter speed on your camera to affect the action-stopping ability. If you're shooting a picture with your camera hand-held, you will need a shutter speed that as fast as or faster than the reciprocal of your focal length. In other words, if you were shooting on a 100mm lens, a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second would be optimal. Camera blur can be eliminated at these speeds.

,, When you do this, the action is going to blur, so use thirty or fifteen when there's low light or when you want the action to blur.


Medium shutter speed: 125 or 250 for most pictures.
Fast shutter speed: 500 or 1000 for action.
Thirtieth or a fifteenth of a second to blur action or under low light.

, You might have the option of a dial, a button on your camera, or you may have to do it in-camera.

, Of course, it goes without saying that you want fantastic exposure, but if you can't get it quite right, err on the side of underexposure (let your scene be a little dark). When a picture is over-exposed, all of the information is lost and cannot be recovered. With underexposed pictures, you have a greater chance of recovering the picture through post-processing. You can set your camera to underexpose by using EV compensation (exposure value compensation).

, The exposure modes on your camera allows you to control how you adjust the picture. The basic mode is the “P” mode (program mode) and it allows you to manipulate both the shutter speed or aperture settings, and it will adjust the other value accordingly so that the picture is exposed perfectly according to the light meter. The advantage of program mode is that you don't need to know anything. It's just a little bit above the green auto or “idiot proof” mode.

, On your digital camera you have the choice of “A-mode” or aperture priority. In the aperture priority mode (it's a way to determine the exposure); you the photographer picks the aperture or f-stop. The camera will choose the shutter speed for you. Aperture priority could be considered the more useful of the modes. So, you select the f-stop, whether it's f/2.8 to blur the background, f/8 for moderate depth of field, or f/16 to have everything in focus.

, Have at least some familiarity with the shutter speed of your camera. The advantage of shutter speed is you set the number that's most convenient or most comfortable to use. Then the camera will pick the other number, the f-stop. On your camera, shutter priority can either be S or TV mode depending on your camera.


In shutter priority mode, pick the shutter speed and the camera sets the f-stop.
When in shutter priority, the camera will take the picture at the selected shutter speed regardless of whether or not the picture will be exposed correctly.

Avoid camera shake.,
Set your aperture wisely.,
Watch out for focus misses.,
Watch your ISO speed on digital cameras.,
Use the Continuous Shooting mode.,

Use your ""Unsharp Mask"" plugin in Photoshop, GIMP, or your favourite image editor.",How to Take Sharp Photographs," Watch your shutter speed. As a general rule, you should not allow this to fall to a speed slower than the reciprocal of your 35mm equivalent focal length. However, if you're using digital (or are willing to use your film up a bit quicker), you can try taking several shots in succession and hopefully one will have a satisfying level of sharpness.

Turn on vibration reduction (also called ""image stabilization"", depending on the manufacturer), if you have it. When VR/IS is on, the lens element(s) or image sensor move so that the image stays in place when projected onto the sensor. As a result, camera motion is less likely to affect the sharpness of your photographs. Turn it on whenever the lighting conditions makes getting a sharp picture difficult. Keep it off when you're shooting on a tripod; it isn't needed and actually makes your photographs less sharp.
Use a shorter lens (or zoom out) and get closer. Remember that, according to the reciprocal rule of photography, reducing your focal length will give you less camera shake at any given shutter speed. Additionally, when you're using a variable-aperture zoom, you can often use a larger aperture with shorter focal lengths. Furthermore, getting closer might force you to be more creative when framing the picture.




 Sometimes you'll have no choice but to shoot wide-open, like in this shot lit only by sodium haze several miles away.

Use a tripod or a monopod If you're using an SLR and find yourself with so little light that you have no choice but to use long exposures, you might want to invest in a remote release cable. If your camera has a mirror lock-up (also called exposure delay mode), use it; this will stop the vibration from the mirror from affecting your images. Check your camera's manual to see what it's called. Mirror lock-up has two definitions; the other definition refers to when the mirrors and shutters move out of the way after you click the shutter button so that you can clean the image sensor without the sensor being active. If your camera doesn't have mirror lock-up, you can use the self timer.;
, Most lenses are sharpest two or three stops wider than the minimum aperture (usually around f/8 or f/11).





 Among other issues, shooting wide-open can cause your depth of field to be very shallow, especially on telephoto lenses. This shot was on a 135mm lens; notice that the nose of this German Shepherd is very subtly out of focus.

Don't shoot your lens at its widest aperture unless that's the effect you're looking for if you can avoid it. Nearly all camera lenses are noticeably softer wide-open than they are stopped down a little. What's more, on fast lenses (and especially on telephotos, which magnify any defocus there is), your depth of field will be so shallow that even the tiniest movement after the focus is locked will cause the subject to be out of focus.




 Shots like these do not require much depth of field, so don't stop down past f/8 unless you really need to.

Don't shoot at your smallest aperture either. All lenses are inherently softer at smaller apertures due to diffraction effects. If you don't need the depth of field, then don't stop down below f/8 or so on modern digital SLRs.Using smaller apertures will force longer shutter speeds, too, which will increase the risk of camera shake causing your photos to be unsharp.
(With that said, if it's a choice between necessary depth of field and diffraction, then you might choose to err on the side of diffraction over defocus. Diffraction is a relatively simple phenomenon compared to defocus, and it might be easier to correct later on in software. Defocus is not; it'll differ on the same lens depending on aperture and subject distance, and varies again from lens to lens.) If you need to stop down because you want a longer exposure, purchase an ND filter.

, This can be caused by either human error (you) or camera error.





 If you have manual focus aids, use them.

Use your focusing aids, if you're focusing manually. Go through your camera's manual to find out how to focus manually with a focus aid. Some autofocus cameras will give you an audible or visible focus confirmation when the subject is in focus; use it. Otherwise, if you find yourself focusing manually on autofocus cameras, you may want to install a manual focusing screen for it, like the Haoda Screen.
Make sure your autofocus is not missing. Some combinations of lenses and cameras do this, for reasons probably best known to the people who make them. Try it out; if you get consistent focus misses on a known good lens then you should return your camera for servicing.
Use your AF lock. If your subject doesn't fall under an autofocus point, select the AF point nearest to your subject, move the point over the subject, lock autofocus, and reframe. Keep in mind, however, that locking the autofocus also locks the auto-exposure. If so, you may have to use exposure compensation.
Get your rangefinder calibrated, if you're using a rangefinder camera. These often fall out of calibration after a while.

, Most digital cameras apply more noise reduction at higher ISO speeds; sometimes this smears subtle textures and makes pictures look less sharp than they are. Turn off noise reduction if it affects the sharpness of your pictures. Don't shoot at high ISO speeds in daylight. If you have a top-end DSLR (like the Nikon D3 or Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III), you don't have to worry about the ISO speed., The camera will move slightly as your finger overcomes the resistance of pressing the shutter button. Also, if you have a DSLR camera, the movement of the mirrors in the body will add to camera shake. You can avoid some of this by using the Continuous Shooting mode available on your camera. This mode will take images as long as the shutter button is held down. In addition to avoiding camera shake from the initial button press, you will also have a choice of which image is best., This won't make up for poor focus, camera shake or the spherical aberration that often comes with shooting lenses wide open (these are all way too complex phenomena to correct this way), but it will give it a bit of a sharpness ""kick"". Use a small radius (perhaps a pixel or less) and a large amount. If you're clever with layer masks, do this selectively so that only the parts that merit your viewer's attention are extra-sharp (hint: gaussian blur your layer mask with a very large radius)."

Get your basic settings right.,
Pick a focal length.,
Beware of shininess!,
Remove any distractions from the vehicle, just like you'd remove distractions from a photograph of a person.,
Get away from normal eye-level.,
Try shooting at night under artificial lighting.,
Try cropping really tightly and singling out a single instantly-recognisable feature from the car.,

Edit your photographs with your favourite photo editor.",How to Take Photographs of Cars," You can read more over at How to Take Better Photographs, but get these basics right:

Make sure your white balance is matched to the ambient lighting. Or just shoot raw and fix it later on a computer; whatever works for you.


  An example of setting it incorrectly; the shot was taken with the setting from the previous night, which was correcting for tungsten lighting. This turned the whole shot blue. Don't do this! Fixing your white balance will vastly improve any photograph you take.



Keep your ISO at its lowest. If nothing is moving, and you have the option of shooting from a tripod, you don't need it.

Shoot in aperture-priority mode; this way you can shoot for optimal image sharpness and control your depth of field. (Don't worry about this if your camera doesn't have this mode or if you can't be bothered; just shoot in Program.)


 Aperture-priority mode will give you control over your depth of field, and allow you to shoot your lens at the aperture at which it is sharpest.)

;
, Cars have photographic personalities just like people do. Just as some people will look better photographed from a distance with a telephoto and others will by getting up-close and personal, different cars will look better at different zoom settings. Imagine the car was a person: would you want to exaggerate their facial physical features, or de-emphasise them?


Wide angles exaggerate a car's features. Does the car look tough and brutish like a prize-fighter? Then zoom out and get closer to the vehicle. Doing this exaggerates perspective.
Don't go too wide unless you know what you're doing; a 28mm-equivalent focal length (18mm on your digital SLR's kit lens) is more than wide enough for most of the time. Getting much wider than that, and you'll end up with a photo of a headlight attached to a very small car (which might even be what you want; keep reading!).


 If your car is more of a prize-fighter like this Range Rover than a supermodel, you might want to use a wider angle to exaggerate the vehicle's features.



A normal-to-longer focal length will do the opposite: It'll give a flatter, more elegant look to the vehicle. This is often better for plainer cars, just as longer focal lengths are more flattering to people. Experimenting is free on digital, so don't hesitate to try both.


 A longer focal length is sometimes more flattering to a vehicle, just like it's more flattering to most people. This was shot with a 50mm lens, which is effectively a short telephoto on a cropped-sensor digital SLR.



, It can sometimes be difficult to get a consistent exposure across the whole of a car. The paintwork (hopefully shiny!) will reflect the sky in parts and so will the windscreen, which are extremely bright relative to other parts of the vehicle. Other than bringing in lighting, there's a few ways around this:


Use a polarizing filter if you have one. This will cut down the reflections. If you don't have one, consider getting one; they're cheap (and the cheap ones work great) and are one of the two filters most critical for digital photography.

Bracket your exposures. You'll need a tripod for this to ensure your photographs line up. Take one photograph at a normal exposure, then take another under-exposed. You can do this using the exposure compensation settings in your camera, or automatic exposure bracketing if your camera has it. You can then use layer masks in your favourite image editing software to paint in areas from the underexposed photo onto parts of the normally-exposed photo (Optionally, you can take a third over-exposed photograph which you can use to fill in shadows in the same way.)


 Exposure bracketing: a normal, underexposed, and overexposed photo. Parts of the darker photo can easily be digitally painted into the overexposed areas of the normal photo. See, in particular, the headlight, which is lacking detail in the normally-exposed photograph.



, If you're at a car show, wait for people to move out of your shot before taking it. Clear away any litter. Try not to shoot in front of a telephone pole, which will make it look like the pole is poking out of the top of the car. Also, try to avoid pulling too much sky into your photograph; it'll more than likely blow out to a distracting bright cyan or white color if you're not using a gradual neutral-density filter (if you can choose an outdoor location, shooting in front of buildings or other structures that will block out the sky is often a good idea).
, Try kneeling or standing on something to make yourself a couple feet taller, or anything that helps you not to get the same eye-level photos that everyone else will be taking.

Instead, try these:


Kneel down in front of the car. This will give it an aggressive, ""coming at you"" appearance.

Set the camera on the ground. Shooting the car from a very low angle (and tilting it up slightly) will give a unique view that isn't normally seen.

Get close and specific. Find the more interesting or unique features or curves on the car, then get close-up shots of them from different angles.

Take it from the top. Try to get a shot from high up, or even just holding the camera high above your head. This will both serve as a unique and interesting angle, and allow the photo to capture multiple angles of the car (side, front, top).

, You'll want a tripod for this one, too, and to either use a remote shutter release or a short self-timer.

Stop down to f/8 or f/11. This will turn bright points of light into multi-pointed stars.
Make sure your camera's automatic ISO feature is off, and shoot at the lowest ISO setting your camera has.
Look at the lighting on the vehicle. Artificial lighting will cast harsh shadows on parts of the car which will need to be filled with your own lighting. You'll get used to these once you can remember that you can see much deeper into the shadows than your camera can.
Get your flash off the camera. If it has a built-in flash, then use a compact camera, a camera phone, or any old 1980s flash gun, and quickly run around the vehicle firing the flash to fill in any shadows. (A longer exposure gives you plenty of time to do this, which is another reason to stop down to f/8 or f/11.)
You might want to drop your photograph down to black-and-white when you're done. Artificial outdoor lighting (especially sodium-vapour) is monochromatic enough that you will probably find that your image is almost black-and-white already once you remove the colour cast from your photograph (a bonus is that this also means you won't have to worry about putting coloured filters over your flash to match the ambient artificial lighting).

, This could be a taillight, or a curve on the bodywork, or a crop of quarter of the front grille with a headlight.
, If you don't have one, get one; GIMP is free. Some tricks you might want to try are:

Use layer masks on an underexposed version of the photo in order to paint in parts of it onto over-exposed parts of your photo (See the information exposure bracketing above).
Fix the contrast. More than likely you'll want to increase it. One way which often works brilliantly for cars is to duplicate your image as a layer, set the layer mode to ""Soft Light"", de-saturate it, then adjust the opacity of that layer to taste. This also has the side-effect of fixing colour casts.


 The contrast was increased in the GIMP by duplicating the bottom layer, desaturating the new layer and setting the Mode to ""Soft Light"". (Some distractions in the background were removed as well.)


Darken the corners a little to bring attention to the car and de-emphasise the surroundings. Don't go amateur-wedding-photographer-crazy about this; it should be subtle enough that you only notice it if you're looking for it. See How to Add a Vignette to a Photograph with GIMP (these instructions translate almost directly to Photoshop as well).


 Darkening the edges forces attention towards the subjects. This is deliberately over-done; the effect should be very subtle instead.


Remove any other minor distractions you forgot about. This may include litter, for example. The clone brush comes in handy here.

Set your camera to aperture priority mode.,
Memorise some basic terminology.,
Test your lens.,Get out and shoot.,
Control your depth of field.,
Control your shutter speeds.,
Shoot for sharpness.",How to Use Your Camera's Aperture Priority Mode," This differs from maker to maker (read your manual), but here are some hints for a few common types of digital camera:


Most Nikon digital SLRs: You have a mode dial. Turn this to ""A"". Once you've done this, spinning your front control dial (on your right-hand grip, very close to the power button) will adjust your aperture. (If you have a camera without a front control dial, then your rear control dial will adjust your aperture instead.)


 



High-end Nikon digital SLRs: Hold down the ""MODE"" dial while turning the rear control dial until you see ""A"" in your top LCD. Your front control dial will then adjust your aperture.






Nearly all Canon SLRs (and some Canon point-and-shoots): Turn your mode dial to ""Av"". Your main control dial (next to the shutter button) will then adjust your aperture.





Many point-and-shoot digital cameras do have an aperture-priority mode, but you may have to work through menus to activate and adjust it. This is just a simple way to tell the computer and parts already present to work together, which shouldn't cost much extra, but shows the manufacturer has taken care to help you make the most of even an inexpensive camera.;
, You'll need it to make sense of the rest of this article:


f/ numbers are your apertures. This is represented as a fraction of your lens' focal length. A smaller aperture is a larger f/number; f/32 is a much smaller aperture than f/5.6.






Stopping down means to use a smaller aperture than your lens' largest (smallest f/ number).

Wide open is the opposite of being stopped down.

Depth of field is, formally, ""the range of object distances within which objects are imaged with acceptable sharpness"". There is only one distance at which objects will be in perfect focus; the depth of field covers the subject-matter that is outside your intended area of perfect focus, but that are still close enough to being in focus so that to the viewer, all that gets captured within the depth of field appears deliberately within focus.

, All lenses are different and are better shot at different apertures for optimal performance. Get out and shoot something with lots of fine texture at different apertures and compare the shots to figure out how your lens behaves at various apertures. Here are some hints as to what to look for:


Nearly all lenses have lower contrast and are less sharp at their widest aperture, especially towards the corners of your image. This is especially true on 35mm and digital camera lenses. On sharpness, this is a totally separate issue from depth of field; this will happen even with a flat subject. Consequently, if you're going to have detail in the corners of your pictures that you want to keep sharp, then you'll want to use a smaller aperture. For flat subjects, f/8 is typically the sharpest aperture.

Most lenses will have some noticeable amount of light fall-off wide open. Light falloff is where the edges of the picture are slightly darker than the centre of the picture. This can be a good thing for many photographs, especially portraits; it draws attention towards the centre of the photograph, which is why many people add falloff in post production. But it's still good to know what you're getting. Falloff is usually invisible after about f/8.






All lenses will be softer across the frame if you stop down far enough.This is an inherent physical limitation of camera lenses; forcing light through a smaller hole causes light rays to interfere with each other.





Zoom lenses can vary depending on how far in or out they are zoomed. Test for the above things at a few different zoom settings.

,, It's as simple as this: a smaller aperture means more depth of field, a larger aperture means less. A larger aperture also means more background blur (which is a related, but not identical, issue to depth of field). Here are some examples:


Use a small aperture to force more depth of field.






Remember that depth of field becomes shallower the closer you get. If you're doing macro photography, for example, you might want to stop down far more than you would for a landscape. Insect photographers often go way down to f/16 or smaller, and have to nuke their subjects with lots of artificial lighting.









 Large apertures force backgrounds to be thrown out of focus; this is great for portraits, as in this shot made at f/2.

Use a large aperture to force a shallow depth of field. This is great for portraits (much better than the silly automatic portrait scene modes), for example; use the largest aperture you have, lock your focus on the eyes, recompose and you'll find the background is thrown out of focus and is, consequently, made less distracting.
Remember that opening the aperture like this will cause faster shutter speeds to be chosen. In bright daylight, make sure you aren't causing your camera to max out its fastest shutter speed (typically 1/4000 on digital SLRs). Keep your ISO low to avoid this.

Remember that you won't see any of this through your viewfinder (or on your screen as you're composing. Modern cameras meter with the lens at its widest aperture, and only stop down the lens to its selected aperture at the moment of exposure. What's more, viewfinders on modern digital SLRs don't even show the true depth of field even if you're shooting the lens wide-open with faster lenses (meaning ones with a larger maximum aperture).
Many SLRs have a depth-of-field preview button on the front of the camera. If you've ever hit a button on your camera and then wondered why your viewfinder went dark, that's the one. Unfortunately, because it darkens the viewfinder, it's very difficult to gauge your depth of field this way (though it might give you some indication of how far out-of-focus distant backgrounds are, which is not the same thing). A better option on digital cameras is to simply take the picture, then play it back and zoom in on your LCD to see if the background is adequately sharp (or blurred) enough.

, Using a larger aperture means that you can use faster shutter speeds (or a lower ISO with the same shutter speed); conversely, a smaller aperture will force a longer shutter speed, or require you to kick up your ISO to grab the same one. This has several practical applications:


Grab the fastest shutter speed you can. If, for example, you're hand-holding your camera or trying to freeze motion in poor light, set your aperture to the largest one your lens has. Crank up the ISO as far as you dare, too (exactly how high is tolerably noisy is something with which you'll have to experiment for yourself). The camera will then grab the fastest shutter speed you can use.

Grab the slowest shutter speed you can. This is great if, for example, you want to blur motion (think of those dreamy flowing water pictures). Set your ISO to its lowest setting, stop down to f/16 (or smaller, if you're willing to defy the laws of physics, or at least if you're fine with diffraction kicking in). The camera will then grab the longest shutter speed that the situation permits (though typically modern cameras won't time out exposures longer than 30 seconds).

, As mentioned earlier, nearly all lenses are sharpest stopped down a little. If you've made your own tests as suggested, then use this aperture for any shot for which you think it'll give you an adequate depth of field and shutter speeds. For those of you shooting stills from a tripod, then use this aperture all the time.
If you're too lazy to have made your own tests (and really, shooting test subjects like walls is boring), then there's plenty of wisdom embodied in the old saying: f/8 and be there. f/8 typically gives sufficient depth of field for most still subjects and it's where 35mm and digital SLR lenses are typically at their sharpest (or close to it).

Have only one folder that contains all your pictures folders.,
Add a folder for each significant category (i.e.,
Add a folder for each year.,
Create and Name your Folders.,
Be consistent!",How to Organize Digital Pictures Without Any Software," All your pictures folders should be contained in only one folder. Usually it’s My Documents/My Pictures or just My Pictures. You must start here, otherwise you will be lost. In the figure for Step 1 you see the folder at the very top of the structure is called My Pictures-final. This is where all the other folders have been created.;
, Family, Work, Church, Friends) Going along with the example we have been using all along, John and Mary will create the following category folders: Carly (for their daughter), family (for all their family pictures), friends (for all the pictures they get from their friends), church (for all church pictures) and work (for pictures taken at John’s work events). Also, they’re adding a section called misc. to include miscellaneous pictures downloaded from the Internet or scanned from old photos.

, There is one thing still missing. While adding categories certainly helps, the family folder will grow very large very quickly as time passes by. So, “divide and conquer” is called for once more. For this reason we recommend creating a folder for each year in the family folder. You may add folders for years in the other category folders but that may be too much for a folder like work where there might be only one or two events per year. However, if you anticipate that any category will grow very much, then you can add folders for each year.

, This is the most important step. The folder structure you create here is the backbone of this method. In order for us to remember an event we need two pieces of information, namely an approximate date and an approximate description. You must include both of these in your folder names. You must name your folders as follows:


2 digits for the year (i.e. 06 for 2006)
2 digits for the month (i.e. 08 for August)
2 digits for the day - the day is not mandatory, but if you remember it put it in the folder name. If an event spans more than one day, use only the month.
description - you need two things: description of the event and description of the place. Use one or two words to describe the event and one or two words to describe the place.
don’t leave blank spaces in the folder names, instead use the hyphen (or minus) sign between your words. This way your folders will be automatically sorted properly by your operating system.
Examples of good folder names: 06-08-11-dads-b-day-Tony's-restaurant, 05-07-family-trip-California.
Examples of good descriptions: “hiking-kings-cyn”, “church-picnic-Mandalay-beach”, “visit-grandma”, “Christmas-our-house”, “4th-July-at-Petersens”

, Now, use the same techniques every time you transfer more pictures from your camera to your computer. Congratulations! You have just organized your pictures. However, it is very important that you remain consistent every time you transfer new pictures to your computer. If you become lazy again, you will have to go through the same process later on. However, it will take more time because you will not remember what has been organized and what hasn't.

Use the Sharpen filter to help combat semi-blurry or out of focus shots.,
Consider shrinking very blurry or lower-quality images to minimize the problem.",How to Improve Digital Photo Quality in Photoshop1," No matter what picture you're editing, the difference between your darkest areas and your lightest areas (called Contrast) should be distinct. This leads to more compelling photos. Your goal is a well-lit picture with deep, dark blacks and bright, well-defined whites. Use the brightness to make sure the picture is still clear as well.


Click ""Image"" → ""Adjustments"" → ""Brightness/Contrast...""
Make sure ""Preview"" is checked so you can see how the image changes as you move the slider.
Almost all images can benefit from 10-15 points of higher contrast, at the least.;
, Going too far can make the picture look like something out of Willy Wonka, but saturation is a necessary adjustment in almost every shot, especially with a lower-cost camera.


Click ""Image"" → ""Adjustments"" → ""Hue/Saturation.""
Increase saturation by 5-10 points, adding a few points at a time until you hit your desired level.
Slide the saturation bar all the way to the left to put the picture in black and white.

, This can happen under some indoor lights, which can make the whole shot look yellow or green. Hue settings, found along with Saturation, let you change the overall color palate of the picture for strange, artsy effects or to correct these all-over color issues.


Click ""Image"" → ""Adjustments"" → ""Hue/Saturation.""
Even small changes to Hue can make dramatic effects, so work slowly.

, The most common use of this is when the sun forms a big, unsightly bloom of white light in the corner of the picture, washing out part of the actual photo. Alternatively, it helps when a shadow obscures half of someone's face. Shadow/HIghlights targets the lightest and darkest parts of a shot directly while leaving the other areas intact:


Click ""Image"" → ""Adjustments"" → ""Shadows/Highlights.""
Lower the Shadow slider to make the dark areas lighter.
Raise the Highlight slider to darken up any bright areas., This filter is not god, and can't fix seriously blurry photos. But it can make a serious difference for slightly ""soft"" shots, bringing back some clarity and definition in the photo's lines. To use it:

Under ""Smart Sharpen,"" use ""Amount"" to choose how severely you'll sharpen sharpen, ""radius"" to make more precise lines, and ""Reduce Noise"" to smooth out any over-sharpened areas., The bigger the image, the more apparent the blemishes and issues. Shrinking the image will provide some clarity, as the pixels are more compact and our eyes do a better job filling over blurry or grainy areas. To shrink an image:


Click ""Image"" → ""Image Size.""
Choose whether or not to change the size in inches, pixels, or even as a percentage of the original.
Make sure the chain icon is on -- this keeps the proportions of your new image the same instead of shrinking it unevenly.

Play with the spot healing brush to remove small blemishes.,
Use the Content-Fill effect to remove objects and simple imperfections.,
Use the patch tool to replace small sections of a photo with another section of the photo.",How to Improve Digital Photo Quality in Photoshop2," Never assume a photo's original framing is the best option available. The Rule of Thirds is one of photography's oldest and most trusted guides. It states that if you cut the image in thirds horizontally and vertically (making 9 mini squares), the most interesting elements should always be the lines and intersections. In Photoshop, these lines appear automatically when cropping, making it easy to improve.


Even small crops can dramatically improve a photo. Are their any unnecessary elements in the corners of the frame that you can eliminate to focus on more interesting things?
Always put major lines, like the horizon in the example above, on a third line.
To crop a photo, press ""C"" to pull up the crop tool., The Red Eye Tool is found under the Patch tool, which is found underneath the eyedropper icon in your toolbar. You can also press J to bring up the Patch tool, then click and hold on the icon to reveal the red eye tool. Once you have it, simply click and drag over the eyes to remove red eye., Want to get rid of that small pimple on your forehead? The spot healer is here to help. Click and hold the Patch tool (press ""J"") to find it, as it will pop up in the small menu under the Patch tool. This tool simply replaces the spot you click on with pixels surrounding it, blending them in perfectly. This means thin, small issues, like a zit or a power-line in the background, can be quickly erased without ruining the image.


The healing brush works similarly, but you can tell it which pixels to replace from. To select the ""healing area,"" hold the Alt/Opt key, click once, then start healing your blemish area.

, For example, imagine there was some dirt on the lens that you missed, which put a big brown spot in the sky of your beautiful landscape shot. Content-fill can cover it up for you. To do so, use Quick Selection tool (found under the Lasso icon) to select the smudge. From there:


Click ""Select"" → ""Modify"" → ""Expand.""
Expand the selection by 5-10 pixels.
Select ""Edit"" → ""Fill.""
Select ""Content Aware"" in the Fill, dialogue box and select ""okay."", Imagine you've got a great shot of a soccer player in action but there is one fan in the background up against a fence that you want out of there. Of course, you need to remove him while keeping the fence, which may seem impossible when he's covering the fence up! The patch tool will take another section of the fence and duplicate it over your man to replace him.


Use a selection tool (like ""Quick Selection"") to select the thing you want to be removed.
Select the Patch Tool by pressing J. It can also be found underneath the eyedropper icon.
Click on the selected area (the place you're replacing), but don't let go of the mouse.
Drag the selected area to the spot you want to replace it with and let go of the mouse."

Use ""Batch Commands"" to make the same edits on multiple photos automatically.",How to Improve Digital Photo Quality in Photoshop3," It is the best practice, especially if you're new to digital editing, to always save a copy of your image before working on it. This allows you to experiment and edit without worrying about making a mistake. While you can also click ""Undo,"" this gets much harder if you're trying multiple things at once, like cropping, tinting, sharpening, etc.


Click ""File"" → ""Save As,"" or simply press Ctrl+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmmd+Shift+S.
At the bottom of the ""Save As"" menu, click ""Save as a Copy.""

, The last thing you want to do is experiment color, contrast, saturation, etc. and not have the ability to fix it when you go too far. While you should always save a separate copy of an image before editing, Adjustment masks let you keep tinkering with these setting at any point in the future, including turning them on/off, without using ""Undo.""

Understand what a histogram is.,
Find your camera's Histogram Function.,
Once you have found the function turn it on and look at how the graph displays in the viewer.

,
Read the next section for the explanation of how to use the histogram to gauge a proper exposure.

",How to Get the Perfect Exposure Using Your SLR Digital Photography Camera's Histogram," A histogram is essentially a stack of pixels for each tonal value between 0 and 255.


A histogram is a digital representation of the tonal values of your image. As you may or may not know, a digital camera works similar to how a computer screen works. There are 256 values ranging from 0 - 255. Please note when I use the term ""tonal value"", I am not referring to color. Color (or hue) is represented by three values RGB (Red, Green & Blue), while tone is represented in the numbers 0 - 255. To get a hue you actually take the values of each color and add them together. For instance, a color Red: 200, Green: 125, & Blue: 60 would produce a darkish orange-brown. A lot of red, a little more than half of that green and about *half of that blue. So, that hue, which turns out to be a hue of 20º will always be that orange color and can be made more or less saturated and more or less bright but the main hue is the same.
If you were to take a bunch of ceramic tiles and make a motif and you only used gray tiles with values from 0 (Pure Black) up to 255 (Pure White and everything in between (128 being middle gray, etc), you would have a good representation of how a digital camera sees an image. Now, you have a gray scale motif of hundreds of tiles on a wall. If you were to now walk up to that wall and knock all the tiles off and then stack them in their respective colors, you would have a ""histogram"" of that image.;
, If you can't find it, refer to the owner's manual probably under ""Manual Exposure"" On a Canon EOS, there is a button on the back of the camera next to the image review screen that says ""Info"". Press that while reviewing an image you just shot from your shot list.

Check your camera and see if it has a diopter adjustment.It could be a number of different places.,
Try this out with the various modes of your camera.,
Determine how you can make your camera be manually focused.,
Take your time when taking the photographs.,
Know the distance at which you are shooting.,
Think about if you want your background to be blurred or maybe you want to get the whole background in focus.

",How to Improve Your Photography with Manual Focus," You may need to check your manual to find its location. Most of the newer models will have it.;
, This will allow you to see the difference they make. Like, a landscape photo versus a macro photo or a portrait.

, There are a variety of ways to check or find out.


Look at the side of the lens. A lot of the newer lens have a switch on the side where you can turn manual focus off and on.
Try out the lens. If it's an older lens, even just a few years older, and the camera is not very old, your lens may be a manual focus because it doesn't have an autofocus with that particular camera.
Use an old style lens on the camera. Be extremely careful with this option. There are electronics in the lens and the camera that there weren't before. You can easily find yourself ruining one, or both, of them, if you aren't careful.

, Since you are relying on the manual focus, it forces you to do it, but think about what you are doing.

, If it helps, get out a ruler and measure it. Then set your camera accordingly.

Cover your flash with an opaque material.,
Cover your flash with a colored material.,
Shoot your flash through an umbrella.",How to Use an External Flash," If your setting doesn’t have a lot of natural light, you’ll need to use the flash. This applies to both indoor and outdoor photographs. Play around with your settings to ensure the flash doesn’t create unwanted effects, such as red-eye or strange shadows., You should use your flash when you are taking photos in a bright location, both indoors and outdoors, though that may seem counter-intuitive. Using the flash helps illuminate the subject, who can otherwise appear darker than the brighter surroundings or in shadow., You can play around with the flash to create cool effects in your photos.Perhaps you want to highlight a certain part of the photo while the rest is in shadow, or maybe you’re trying to create a harsh or artificial light to highlight your subject., For example, if you are taking photos at a stadium, the flash won’t help when your subject is yards from you. The flash can even be reflected off of other surfaces and create undesirable effects in your photo., A pale or washed-out subject is an indication that the light is too strong or too harsh for your setting. Sometimes, taking a photo without the flash is the wiser choice. Try taking a few photos with the flash and a few without to see which come out better., You can choose “E-TTL” for standard exposure, or “manual” to change the settings yourself. It’s recommended that you use the manual setting in order to manipulate the flash to produce the highest quality photos. You will then need to adjust the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed., Change the power of your flash depending on the ambient light and the subject you are shooting. If you take a photo and the subject looks harshly lit, try turning down the power and taking another shot. Or, if your subject is too dim or shadowy, turn the flash up to get a brighter shot.Higher power is best for darker locations, while a lower power setting can be used in areas with good natural or artificial light., Setting your camera to night mode lets it know that there is minimal ambient light in your setting. The camera will then use a slow sync flash. This will slow down the shutter speed while still shooting the flash. This setting is great when for adding a little more ambient light into your photograph while still freezing the action with the flash., Position the umbrella to face away from your subject. Aim your flash at the umbrella and away from the subject. The reflection of the flash off the umbrella will diffuse the light so your subject looks lit in a more natural way., Reflecting your flash can reduce the harshness of the light. Use the built-in white card that extends from your flash, if you have one, to reflect the light. If your flash doesn’t have one, make one by rubber-banding a blank index card to the back your flash so that it extends above the flash., Bouncing the flash off the ceiling creates a larger light source than shooting your subject with the flash pointed at them. This creates a much softer, natural-looking photograph., You can angle the flash toward a wall on either side of the subject, toward a corner, or directly behind the subject. This creates a directional light source, which allows you to play with shadows and definition in your photographs. Test different angles to find out what works best for your shot., Many flashes come with a diffuser, which is a milky, translucent piece of plastic that you put over the flash. This helps soften the flash when you need to aim it at the subject but don’t want a harsh light., You can use opaque tape, a piece of white paper, or even a piece of a milk jug to diffuse your flash. Simply affix the material over the flash and take your photograph., Using a opaque but colored material, such as fabric, tape, or paper, to diffuse your flash will add color to the photo. You can create interesting color effects by playing around with different colored materials as a flash diffuser. Keep in mind that using a colored material may make your photo look unnatural, so this is best for when you want a unique photograph, rather than for standard portraits or landscapes., Placing an umbrella in front of your flash, so that your flash shoots through the umbrella, creates a more even light for your subject. This also softens the light and tones down the shadows and definition in your photograph."

Choose your timing.,
Watch the sky.,
Photograph people against the bright sky.,
Include the shadow of an object out of frame.,
Add interest to a uniform area with dappled shade.,
Turn the camera upside down.",How to Use Shadows to Enhance Photos1," Most landscape photographers prefer the early morning and the late afternoon. At these times, the shadows are soft enough that you can still see the detail and texture behind them. These shadows complement the subject of the photo. The short, harsh shadows near noon flatten out details and demand all the attention for themselves.


Get a feel for this effect by photographing the same landscape at different times of day. Even a brick wall will look completely different in full sunlight than it does at sunset.;
, The movement of clouds and sun can rapidly change the shape, size, and intensity of shadows. If you're trying to perfect one shot, take your time watching the changing shadows and how they affect your subject.

Walk around the subject with one eye closed for a closer imitation of how your camera sees the image.

, When taking portraits outdoors, position your subject in front of a bright overcast sky. This lights the rim of the subject and creates a three-dimensional effect, especially in front of dark portions of the background.

If hard shadows form over the subject's face, use a white reflector or fill flash to illuminate it.
Shooting in direct sun is usually too harsh unless you're going for a silhouette. Consider shading the subject.

, For example, capture the shadow of an airplane or tree without photographing the object itself. This can complement the main subject of the photo, as long as the shadow does not fall directly over it. If the shadow is particularly striking, it can serve as the main subject itself.

, Resurrect the flat look of grass or pavement by find a spot with dappled patterns of light and shadow.

, Take a whimsical shot of a shadow as though it were the real object, and that object were the shadow.

Make sure your camera has either a hot-shoe for an external flash, or a socket for plugging one in.,
Invest in an external flash unit with a 90 degree swivel (bounce) head.,
When taking a flash picture indoors, turn off the camera's built-in flash.,
For even better results, buy a cable which connects your camera to the flash unit.,
While Professor Kobre's Lightscoop is not advertised to replace external flash units, some photographers may be interested in its low-tech but effective approach to bouncing the built-in flash itself.,
As is the case when bouncing an external flash (see ""Warnings""), the Lightscoop works best with light-colored ceilings approximately 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) tall or walls (when camera is in vertical orientation).,
If you do own a hotshoe flash with a head that can tilt upwards consider getting a diffuser such as a Sto-fen Omnibounce or a Lightsphere these allow for a bounce-like effect when there is no handy surface to bounce flash from.",How to Use Bounce Flash to Improve Your Photography," Most cameras have at least one of the two.;
, All major camera makers sell reasonably-priced units with this feature. Some models also rotate, adding even more functionality.

, Point the bounce flash head at the ceiling (rather than at the subject) and take the picture. This will provide a soft, diffused light and it will cut down on red-eye.

, You can then remove the flash from the camera and bounce the light off walls, a reflector, or whatever you want.

, To bounce the built-in flash with the Lightscoop (no external flash necessary):



Slide the Lightscoop onto the camera's hot shoe.
Set the camera to work in Manual mode.
Set the camera's exposure mode to Spot meter.
Set the ISO to 800.
Set the shutter speed to 1/200.
Set the aperture to the lens's maximum.

, It will NOT work in rooms with cathedral ceilings, paneled wood ceilings, in gymnasiums or churches, or in places like nightclubs with dark ceilings. When ceilings are too high or too dark, not enough light can bounce back to reach the scene below.

, A budget alternative is creating one yourself."

Set up reflectors to brighten an area.,
Minimize toplight in portraits.,
Take a dramatic portrait with Rembrandt lighting.,
Create the illusion of a larger shape.",How to Use Shadows to Enhance Photos2," Blank white paper positioned to the side of the photograph can ""paint"" the light onto an area of the subject. This emphasis will increase the contrast between well-lit and shadowed areas, resulting in a more dramatic photograph.

In portraiture, the most common goals of reflecting light are to emphasize cheek bones, soften lips, sharpen the eyes, and wash out potentially sensitive areas (wrinkles and acne).

, Too much light from above may cast shadows over the eyes, or under the nose where it can cause the subject's nose to appear larger. If you notice these signs, adjust the lighting until you have a more flattering shadow placement., Position a single, hard light source to one side of the subject, a bit higher than eye level.The goal is to brightly illuminate one half of his face, as well as a triangle on the opposite cheekbone. The shadow of the nose then obscures the rest of that cheek., Careful positioning of objects and light sources can create shadows that meet to form patterns or shapes. Two screws standing upright can form a triangle when their shadows meet. A ring balanced on a book's inner spine casts a heart-shaped shadow on the curved pages beneath.


It's often easier to start with a mental image and work towards that goal. That said, sometimes experimenting with object placement leads to serendipitous shots.

Work out your budget.,
Hunt around.,
Look through each photographer's entire galleries.,
Bargain.,
Lock down your package with a contract.,
Provide a shot list.",How to Hire a Budget Wedding Photographer," It is important to know your maximum wedding photography budget prior to contacting any photographers. You are a lot more likely to get a better deal if you let a photographer know what your budget is when first requesting a quote.;
, In order to ensure that you will get a great deal, you will need to look at hundreds of photographers. Some photographers will not be able to work within your budget, and others won't be available, but you will be left with a list of potential photographers.

, Every photographer can produce some great shots for their portfolio, but to really understand the quality of images you are likely to receive, ask to look through a few complete wedding photography galleries, as this will give you an idea of what previous couples have received, and what you are likely to receive.

, Why not try to ask for a free set of prints, or perhaps an extra 5% discount? It may not always work, but it doesn't hurt to try. You may be surprised by the results.

, Once you agree to proceed with a budget wedding photographer, they should have a contract for you to sign. Ensure that the contract includes all of the details promised. A contract is great way of protecting you if something goes wrong.

, A great way of letting your photographer know what you want from your wedding photos is to provide them with a shot list. You can also let them know which of their photos you like, and hopefully these can be reproduced at your wedding.

Select the appropriate settings on the camera.",How to Use a Light Meter," Go into the settings of your camera and set it to manual mode, if it isn't in that mode already. Set your camera to your preferred ISO and aperture settings. You'll need to do some experimenting with both of these settings to find the ideal settings for the photo you're trying to get.The ISO setting determines your camera's sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO, the more sensitivity to light. Generally, lower ISO settings produce clearer pictures while a higher ISO will cause graininess, but there are some scenarios where you'll need a higher ISO, such as when shooting a subject in motion.The aperture setting changes the size of the lens, and therefore how much light the camera lets in. This setting is describes using the unit f/stops. A larger aperture number, like f/11, means a smaller lens size, and a smaller number, like f/1.4, means a larger lens size. Aperture affects your photos' depth of field and shutter speed.;
, For whatever ISO your camera is set at, input that number into the allocated spot on the light meter. Do the same with the aperture that your camera is set at., Depending on what light meter you are using, you may need to twist the knob around the white dome on your light meter to prepare it. This is the sensor of the light meter., Most light meters have two modes, one for ambient light and one for flash. If you're going to be using the flash of your camera, set it to that mode, and if not, use ambient., Look through the viewfinder and focus on your intended subject.

, If you are taking a photo of a person, have the person hold the meter up to his or her chin. This pulls the light reading from the exact spot you want in correct exposure., The sensor is the white dome-shaped area of the meter. It is often on a swiveling or rotating head. Point it straight at the lens of the camera for the best results.

, This will measure the amount of light falling on the subject.

, If you're using your flash to capture your subject, and you've set your light meter to flash mode, you'll need to hit the measure button while the camera is flashing. The meter will evaluate the degree of light from the flash and determine the correct aperture and shutter speed for the subject., After hitting the measure button, most light meters will allow you to then scroll through the combinations of shutter speeds and apertures that are appropriate for the amount of light measured.

, The meter supplied you with aperture and shutter speed readings for correct exposure of the photograph based on the light at the location of the subject. Go to the settings in your camera and input the numbers provided by your light meter into your camera.Adjust the numbers from the light meter to achieve alternative image results. Input a higher aperture (a lower f-stop number) for an image that reveals more light. A lower aperture (a higher f number) will darken the image. You can also alter the shutter speed, which allows more light in with a slower speed and increases potential blurring of any moving things in the scene.

Be aware of light color.",How to Use Light in Photography," Look around you and find where the light is coming from. Light can come from almost anywhere — above you, behind you, around you. Where the light is coming from will make a difference in how your subject looks. For example, light coming from above your subject might cause sharp shadows, while light coming from in front of your subject can flatten the image.Move around your subject and note how changing the direction of the light changes the image. Move your subject to an area where the direction of the light creates the look you want. Certain lights will flatter your subjects, while others can create drama.;
, Light can be bright, soft, harsh or low. It can take on a variety of colors depending on its source. Some lights are cool while others are warm. The quality of the light will affect how your subject looks, and can cause pictures to be too harsh, too soft, too dark, or just right., Your eyes see more details than a camera can pick up. This is why your photos often don’t match what you see. But being aware of the exposure, which is the overall brightness or darkness of a scene, will help you capture the details you want to include.If you are using a camera that has an exposure setting, a neutral or normal exposure will create the most natural-looking image., The direction of the light creates highlights and shadows. Highlights are the brightest part of an image. Conversely, a shadow is the darkest part of an image. The contrast between shadows and highlights is what makes an image interesting. Knowing how changing your light will change the contrast is the difference between taking a sub-par photo and taking one that your friends will rave about.Side-lit photos will have a lot of contrast. Front-lit photos will typically have very little contrast. Images shot on a cloudy day usually are also low in contrast, while images shot in the bright sun are generally high in contrast., Positioning your subjects so the light shines them straight on is the most common way to work with light. Changing the brightness of the light, however, can turn this common set-up into uncommon photos. Soft front lighting, for example, can be very flattering. Bright front lighting, such as a flash, can be too harsh.Flash is the most common form of front lighting. Most built-in flashes are set to flash automatically in low light. For more control, you can disable this feature and use the flash only when you want to. Sometimes, you’ll want to use it to fill in shadows when the light is bright. Other times, you might want the image to remain in shadows for a special effect, so you would not want your camera to use a flash at all.
Camera flashes sometimes cause “red eye.” The best way to prevent this is to have your subject looking away from the camera. You can often remove red eye from existing photos with free photo-editing software available online.

, Back-lit photos are so interesting because they are the opposite of a standard photo. In a back-lit photo, the background is illuminated while the foreground is in the dark. A solar eclipse is a good example of a back-lit photo. These can be tricky, but experimenting with different lights and different camera settings will help you learn to achieve the result you want.Silhouettes are the prime example of back-lit photos. You can create a simple one by putting the light directly behind your subject. When you shoot from the front, the subject will remain dark., To produce an eye-catching effect on your photos, use lighting from the side, which will put part of your subject in light and part in shadow. It is great for showing depth in landscape photography, as well as portraits.Side lighting will create depth, but you need to be careful not to go overboard. Too much contrast can be unflattering. Many professional photographers use a reflector or a flash to fill in the shadows and reduce the sharp edges.One of the most popular poses for portraits is to position your subject in front of a window, with one shoulder facing the camera. Different effects can be achieved by having your subjects change the direction of their heads. For one photo, ask them to look out the window. For another, have them look at you.

, Diffused lighting is a soft light that can be produced by the sun shining through clouds, by the shade of trees or by light bouncing off a wall or ceiling. This soft light produces a pleasing image that captures the natural colors and details of the subject., The Golden Hour is the hour around sunrise and sunset, where the sun is near the horizon, and the light is softer. This soft light is perfect for nearly any type of photo., The weather and time of day have a major effect on the type of light you will be shooting in. It might seem counterintuitive, but overcast is good. Clouds will diffuse the light, making shadows lighter or non-existent. The shadows cast by large buildings and trees can also create the same type of diffused light found on overcast days.Many photographers think that overhead sun is the best light because everything is so bright. Unfortunately, this is often the worst time to take pictures. Colors will be washed out. If you are taking photos of people, shadows will be too dark under facial features. In addition, you are likely to see squinting eyes looking back at you through your viewfinder., During the Golden Hour, the sunlight casts off red and yellow rays. This is a great light for warm and appealing photos. If you are taking pictures of people, they will particularly like this light because warm colors flatter the skin. These colors will also make scenes appear more cheerful.Blue hours consist of the hour before sunrise and the hour after sunset, when the sun is just below the horizon. This early and late indirect light results in a light with a cool blue cast. It can create photos with a more somber mood."

Examine a color wheel.,
Mix the primary colors together.,
Mix complimentary colors together.,
Change the lightness or darkness of your brown paint.,
Increase or decrease the saturation.,
Change the hue.",How to Mix Paint Colors to Make Brown1," A color wheel is a disk divided into colored sections in the order of the rainbow. It contains primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Primary colors include red, blue, and yellow, while secondary colors are orange, green, and purple. The tertiary colors are those found between the primary and secondary on the color wheel.;
, The first and most basic way to create brown is to mix all the primary colors together. That means you use a palette knife to blend blue, yellow, and red together until you reach the muddy color you desire. You don’t need to use equal amounts of each; add differing amounts of each color to slightly change the hue of your brown paint.

, When you look at the color wheel, the complimentary colors are the ones directly opposite one another on the wheel. The complementary colors are blue and orange, red and green, and yellow and purple. Mixing any of these pairs will create shades of brown that differ slightly from one another.

, Add black or white to lighten or darken the paint. You can choose to add more of the darkest color you used to create the brown, but this will also slightly change the hue as well as darken it. If you want a very light brown, it will be easiest to take a lot of light paint and a small amount of the brown you have mixed. Adding dark to light is easier than adding light to dark.

, To make your brown brighter, add more of the colors you originally mixed to create it. Making it more dull can be accomplished by adding a medium gray paint to the mixture.

, If you created your shade of brown by mixing blue and orange, you can change the hue slightly by adding other colors. For example, to create a warmer brown, add red to the mixture. To create a dark, murky brown you could add purple or green. Keep in mind that the complementary pairs of color you start with can be altered by adding as many other colors as you would like. Add tertiary colors for a more subtle color change."

Learn the difference between additive and subtractive color situations.,
Some cameras are only additive (RGB) or subtractive(CYMK) in capturing images.,
Try experimenting with viewing colors under different filters, colors of light, with and without the camera.",How to Take Photographs That Are the Correct Color1," Like in any form of visual arts photography requires some knowledge about how colors react to light. There are two color properties that can be helpful when trying to get photographed objects to turn out correctly. Once you learn how to correctly identify the color situation you're dealing with and how these situations affect different hues of color you can photograph colors more accurately.



Additive colors are the result of adding white light to a color against a black background. In this situation if you add equal parts of red, green and blue you'll get white.Whenever you use a lighted screen such as the computer screen you use this system. This color system is called RGB or Red, Green, Blue system.
Whenever your using high exposure or a flash you are adding a white light thus this is a additive color situation.

Subtractive colors are the results of what you if illuminate a colored filter from behind with the white light. If you mix all of these colors together in equal parts you get black. It's the opposite of the additive.This property is most commonly used in mixing colors with any art mediums not involving light. This systems as also called the CYMK or Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Black.
If your object is an art project on a sheet of white paper or is surrounded with a lot of white without flash you are in a subtractive setting.;
, Others may have a way you can opt in or out between modes or systems. Check out the manual or ask questions on discussion forums on photography for more information on this feature.

, Search for art sites, camera stores and shops that sell these filters or you can make your one using any color plastic or glass transparent item like a plastic cap, sunglass lens, 3-D glasses lens and take any colored item and experiment with how the color of that filter affects that color being viewed. Many cameras with large millimeter lens have special filters and lens available for purchase but the smaller lens ones are hard to find. If they are too expensive or not available you can always make your own.


You can use these filters as well as other equipment in many different applications when using the camera. Place them over the flash to color or diffuse the light that comes out of the flash. Put clear filters over the lens it self to see how it affects the colors.
There are now new small camera accessory kits and zoom lens that are actually made to fit over the camera lens of an Android smartphone or iPhone. However these can easily fit over the lens of smaller digital camera. Consider experimenting with these as they are very inexpensive.

Set your camera to ""Aperture Priority"" and open the lens aperture up wide.,
Compose your picture.,
If you're slower than 1/45, increase the ISO if possible.,
You can now shoot using only the ISO dial to set the exposure.",How to Take Hand Held Pictures Indoors Without Flash," Why ""A""? Because indoors hand-held your main enemy is camera shake, and to defeat it you'll need as much light as possible. Depth of field will have to take a back seat.;
, Look at the shutter speed. The slowest shutter speed at which camera shake is not a factor is any speed higher than the focal length of your lens (should be marked on the lens) ex. 45mm. If you're at or faster than that, take the pic.

, If you're faster, you may be able to reduce the ISO to get a less noisy picture.

, In a dark room, boost the ISO. In a lighter room, knock it down a bit. The aperture setting will always be locked at wide-open and the shutter speed will always be the best available for controlling shake.

Be aware that the color of the barrier will affect the color and white balance of the photograph.,
Finished.

",How to Soften Harsh Camera Flash," This can work with your on or off camera flash. Some useful items are:


White post it notes
Note cards with no lines
Printer paper
Card paper

For an on camera flash, fold the paper so that it comes between the flash and the subject. If you have a 3 * 5 notecard, those work great, but use the side without the lines.
For your off camera flash, you can use a band or scrunchy, or something like that, to fasten the paper to the flash.

;
, Some ideas are:


Paper towel
Tissue

,
Put your subject where you think you want them.,
If using shadows, be sure the shadows are pretty consistent.,
If outside, don't have your subject facing the sun (effectively behind the photographer's back).,
Use a reflector.,
Be sure there is a light-colored flat surface near them.,
Move the reflectors around.,
Be sure that the main light is at an angle to your subject.",How to Set up for Natural Light Photography," You will want to modify your shutter speed, ISO, and aperture. If your speed is set for more than 1/60th of a second, be sure to use a tripod.;
,, Take a test shot to see what you are looking at for results. If your subject is washed out, then they are too close to too much light. Move them away from the light or into the shadows, somewhat.

, Otherwise, your exposure will be off.

, That is a holdover from the Kodak does and mostly accomplishes squinted eyes and washed out images.

, This creates a nice fill light if used properly. You can buy them from many sources, or you can go to your local store and buy a large poster card and use it as a reflector. Your main choices are a silver reflector or white. However, many vendors have a third option, a gold reflector.

, You are using it for its reflective qualities. If you don't have one, don't worry about it., You will be amazed at the difference that moving its angle or location will make.

, For outside photography, that is the best option. It adds texture and definition to your image.

Obtain a Pantone Formula Guide.,
Find the brown that you want.,
Mix your colors.",How to Mix Paint Colors to Make Brown2," While primarily used in the printing industry, Pantone provides a precise color reference to help you find exactly the brown you are looking for. You can purchase one new or used online.


It's important to be aware, though, that Pantone defines its colors in the CMYK color space, not RGY. CMYK is the acronym for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. White is not included, as that is generally the color of the paper that is being printed on, so you will have to do some interpretation.

, There are a large number of cards to flip through, so be patient. You can also take advantage of Photoshop or other graphics applications, which often include Pantone colors in various formats.


Look for the exact percentages of magenta, yellow, cyan and black needed for that color, and mix accordingly. Note that in this example, the percentages are C:33%, M:51%, and Y:50%
Note that magenta, yellow and cyan are more accurate primary colors, but they are not the standard for mixing paints at this time. For more information, see this article.

, Using the proportions provided on the Pantone guide, mix your your paints to create an exact shade of brown. Although this Pantone guide is typically used for mixing ink for prints, you can use magenta, cyan, black, and yellow paint to create the perfect hue of brown."

Learn how to identify white balance settings in different situations.,
Become familiar with how different degrees of color temperature affects the colors of subjects in photographs.,
Use a neutral colored accessories and charts to help you find the correct white balance and color temperature.,
Use the color temperature and white balance to create atmosphere.,
When confronted in a setting with a dominating warm or cool color hue or light use an opposite temperature color setting.",How to Take Photographs That Are the Correct Color2," White balance refers to the cast or glow that white areas and subjects appear in photography. Unless you what to do a special color effect like Sepia (brownish cast) you need to set the White Balance on the camera settings to match the light temperature of the light source. You know this when you see the pure white, pure blacks or pure gray on the viewfinder(if there is any item in these colors).


The main white balance settings on most cameras are

Daylight (on a sunny day),

Cloudy (spread out light softening colors,

Incandescent (warm yellowish light )

Fluorescent ( cool bluish white).

Halogen (pure white without any colors)

Candlelight (warmest light that can appear orange)
If your camera doesn't have some the settings listed on the options screen already it may be hidden in the ""shooting mode"" or ""scene"" options under different names like""romantic"", ""dusk or dawn"", ""snow"". Some cameras the color temperature setting chart is a series of colored squares or temperatures. Some cameras have smart portrait settings that let you adjust the color temps by skin, eye, make-up or foundation color. Check your product's manual.

, Color temperatures refers to how cool (blue) or how warm (red) in the light of the photograph's setting. Under neutral color temperature green grass is green as you see it with your own eyes. Move the color temperature to the setting into the reds and the grass turns to brownish color (olive or lime). Move it towards the blue and the green turns bluish (teal or aquamarine). Be careful when selecting the color temperature to make sure the subjects stay their natural colors.

, The actual color accessories are available in many camera stores and websites but may get too expensive. You always make your own by finding non reflective white, gray or black colored boards, papers in the stores or using paint swatch boards in the hardware store.

, Use the cool ones in waterfall setting to enhance the relaxing feeling of the sound of running water. Use the warm settings in romantic or Christmas settings.

, Adding more the dominating color will in most cases cause everything in the picture to be that specific hue or very similar to it. Choosing a opposite color temperature setting can help balance out that strong hue and give other colors some oomph.

Reduce the glare or blur of very highly saturated colors by reducing how saturated or how vivid they are using the color settings.",How to Take Photographs That Are the Correct Color3," Ever tune the color settings on your TV to maximum? The colors start flaring out and running together making details, highlights and shadows hard to pick out. The same happens when too much saturation is in photographs and videos. Lower the saturation or vivid settings on your camera to correct this.


Lowering the saturation can also bring out other next door neighbor colors that the dominating color were canceling out. A red leaf shot under lower saturation will likely reveal nuances of brown, pink and purple.
Don't use high saturation in food pictures. This will result in an unappetizing ""glow in the dark"" food appearance you wouldn't on an dinner invitation.
However there are times when high saturation can help a picture out. If you photograph a cloudy grey sky with peeks of blue increasing the saturation helps the blue stand out more.
Use different degrees of vividness to help enhance the atmosphere and feeling of a photograph. Many fun and happy events like very fun and festive with higher situation. The opposite can be used with scary cold or moody pictures.

Beware how flash and exposure affects colors in the picture.",How to Take Photographs That Are the Correct Color4," Too much brightness can wash out a picture as too much flash. Just like adding white paint to any color on a painting the same thing can happen to pictures when using flash and changing the exposure higher. At their worst the whole picture will be a white square.


However lowering of the exposure can be used to reduce the washing out of colors in pictures when the flash is used. You can also experiment with different flash speeds on your camera depending on your model and type your using. Also experiment with varying amounts of exposure and make note which ones work the best.
Too low exposure can be just as bad as too much. Many underexposed photographs are dull grayed out and lifeless.
When dealing with items with light, whether it's a firework video or a light up skyscraper, keep your exposure low to avoid the ""light flare blur"". Also when dealing with sunsets and sky photos lowering the exposure keeps the details of clouds and the landscape clear and pushes the sky nicely into the background. The same goes for any reflective or metallic surfaces. Adjust shooting scenes with lowest exposure first and adjust the exposure higher to figure out.
Flash can also do amazingly strange things for some pictures. Try it in a dark landscape picture and the little minute details of the clouds in the sky become very clear as well as the gradients of brightness in the sky. Low exposure flash pictures with lots of adjusting or experimenting can lead to amazing pictures with sharp detail.
Flash can also cause the very common culprits in photography as well. In portraits using the wrong flash or using it incorrectly can cause the dreaded red eye. Flash can also kill critical details in textural, macro photography as well.

"

Watch out for colors that shift in from one color to another.,
Get your object sharp and in focus and in detail before taking the shot.,
Don't be afraid to experiment in using different preset scenes on the camera other than their proposed purposes.",How to Take Photographs That Are the Correct Color5," Too avoid this, it's best to use lower exposure, lowering the saturation one point off the center or two and even changing the white balance and color temperature settings. Even consider changing the outdoor sunny white balance setting to cloudy or indoor lighting like fluorescent.


Be careful with extremely bright and neon colors. Other terms for these kinds of colors is highly saturated and pure. These colors easily transform themselves into other colors different of which they are viewed naturally in the viewfinder or on the actual photograph. Yellow lemons can turn to green. Bright red poppies turn out orange or pink.
Red produces very strong wavelengths that can easy take over a photograph and cause blobs, spots, other strange phenomenon in photography. Bright saturated reds are very tricky even for professionals to photograph accurately.
The color of the walls in a room indoors or the surrounding buildings or other things outside can be reflected onto your subject affecting the color.
Some other darker colors can do this too. Dark burgundy can become bright reddish purple and not deep and rich.
Many items are not just one color. What appears to be bluish green to a naked eye under the magnification of a camera in macro zoom can have extra spots of yellowish green. Almost every leaf is or flower petal is not that pure color but has veins of many different tones, tints,shades and even other colors. These colors blend with each other and cause different colors. Same goes for trying to photograph a child's art project. The different stokes of crayon even if it's the same color can appear more or less intense due to the color of the background paper.

, It can be difficult to tell rather or not the subject is the correct color when it's out of focus and colors are blurred together.

, Also experiment with various different degrees of white balance, saturation, and color temperatures in different settings. Don't be intimidated and take risk to see what the results are. You'll be surprised. Have a notepad and pencil handy with you to be able to copy down the settings of the exposure, white balance, aperture, shutter speed, flash settings etc. in the mode so you use different parts of these settings in a custom or manual mode if one is available to create your own perfect mode or setting.

The snow setting can be useful when photographing a landscape loaded white flowers and rocks.
The snow setting as well as the beach setting is good for when you are in a situation where there is a lot of reflection like a portrait behind a glass building.
The sunny white balance setting used indoors can make colors appear natural and very pleasing instead of using the cloudy or indoor settings.

There's some great software to help you out. Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom can be a bit costly. However you can just download and install freeware and then find plugins from Adobe that can really help to bring your pictures to their best light.



Photoscape is a freeware editor that has a lot of color correction features including color temperature and remove color cast. Very lightweight and fast. Also comes with a built in .RAW to JPG converter.

Gimp the popular ""Photoshop replacement"" also has features that include color correction and enhancement features and can use most Photoshop Plugin ""8bf"" files. It however comes in a new updated version that may or may not work well on many Windows computers and uses lot of memory space on the hard drive. It's best to use the portable version. Do not use the clone GimpShop because of bugs and risk of virus.

Deep Paint by Right Hemisphere has a freeware version called 2.0 downloadable from the site named Chip.eu now loadion.com can easily use many Adobe Plugins by just moving the files to the plugin folder.

, Photoshop's Cast Removal Tool doesn't work on .JPG and this format doesn't store color information in precision like in .RAW. Updated versions might not have this problem but you can always convert JPG to RAW format using another software.

, Some are free and some are expensive. Some are good and others not so good. Some are the exact same features already on the main software only under a different name. Gimp and some other programs can use Photoshop plugins with some extra steps or just by moving the files to the plugin folder. Action files do not work in such applications.

Choose a red.,
Select a white.,
Add red to the white.,
Add a complementary color to tone down your pink.",How to Mix Paint to Make the Colour Pink1," Most standard reds can be used to make a pink. Each red will produce a different shade of pink, so you can experiment until you find one that you especially like. Common reds have general characteristics, so select one accordingly.Cadmium reds ( light, medium, and deep) will produce a slightly orangey pink.
Pinks made from Scarlet Lake will be very bright.
Alizarin Crimson produces brilliant pinks that tend to have hints of blue and purple.
Rose Madder is a transparent hue that can be used to make thinner pinks.
Napthal Red will also produce transparent pinks that are very bright.
Quinacridone is a good hue for mixing with blues or gray to make tones of pink. When mixed with white alone, it will produce a very bright pink.
Earth reds (including Indian Red and Venetian Red) can also be used to make pinks that will seem natural.;
, To make pinks from acrylics, oils, and other generally opaque paints, you will mix your selected red with a white. However, not all whites are the same. For the best results when mixing colors to make pink, choose an opaque white (such as Titanium White). Transparent whites (like Zinc White) may only lighten the red without creating a true pink., Place some white and red paint on your palette. Start by adding just a bit of red to the white, and mix well. Keep adding a bit of red at a time until you reach the pink you want to use for your work.








Don’t try to create pink by adding white to red, since this will take more time and use up lots of paint.

, Shades of colors are technically created by adding black to a hue. However, many painters find that using a complementary color instead of black creates better-looking colors. You can try adding a direct complementary (a green), but using a neighboring color like blue can also create nice results.








Whichever color you choose to tone down your pink, start by adding just a little at a time to the pink, and mixing well until you get the hue you like.

Mix the two colors together.,
Use the paint.",How to Mix Green Paint1," Mixing paint seems like it might be simple. Most people will reach directly for a paintbrush when mixing the paint, but this is actually not a good idea. Not only will you risk ruining your paintbrush, but you won't get a very smooth color. Here is a complete list of what you will need:


Blue paint
Yellow paint
Paint palette, paper plate, or cup
Something to mix with (palette knife, spoon, popsicle stick, etc);
, This will count as ""one part yellow."" When mixing paints, you will be working with ""parts"" as a form of measurement.

, To begin with, make the blue drop the same size as the yellow drop. This will give you a basic shade of green. If you want to make a different shade, click here.

, Keep mixing the paint until the color is uniform and you don't see any streaks. If you are using a thin paint, like tempra, poster, or craft-grade acrylic paint, try using a spoon or popsicle stick. If you are using a thicker, paste-like paint, such as oil or acrylic, use a palette knife to smoosh and move the paint around until it you get an even color.

, You could create a green landscape or use green to mix realistic skin tones. The possibilities are endless!

Choose your red paint.,
Spread red paint.,
Add white paint.,
Mix the paints.",How to Mix Colors to Make Pink1," Different shades of red produce different shades of pink when mixed with white paint. Experiment with different reds as you go. In order to achieve the brightest, most lasting shade of pink, try Permanent Alizarin Crimson or Quinacridone red acrylics and mix them with Titanium White.Vermilion will produce a nice shade of pure pink.
Use of a brick red will produce a muddier pink, closer to a peach.
Darker reds such as Alizarin Crimson Hue make a pink color tinged with blue or purple, so they are good for shades such as magenta.;
, Take your canvas, paper, or mixing board. Squeeze out your red paint on top of it. This red will be turned into pink, so keep it in a separate area until you are able to judge what pink you’ll get and how much you need.








, Near the red, place white paint. Start with a dab to save paint. When you mix it in with the red, you can always add more later if you need more to dilute the pure red color.








, Using painting tools such as a brush or knife, mix your white into your red. Start out with a little bit to determine what tint of pink begins to form. You can add more white to get a brighter and brighter tint, but every red has its own tint strength, so you'll eventually reach the limit to how pink you can make that particular red.








The darker the red you used, the more white paint you will need to lighten it to pink.
Try softening your pink with yellow to bring it closer to a peach or a salmon color.
Add blue or violet to bring the pink closer to fuchsia or magenta.

Mix the black into the blue paint a little at a time.,
Add more black paint and mix as necessary until you reach your desired shade of blue.",How to Mix Colors to Make Dark Blue1," Make sure that you have enough paint to complete the coverage needed with this shade of dark blue. Once you have mixed the perfect hue, it could be difficult to match this shade a second time. It’s always better to make more dark blue than you need rather than run out.If you do not complete your project in one sitting, you can store your excess paint in an airtight container like a plastic container you would use to store leftover food.
Consider wetting a paper towel or sponge and placing it in the bottom of your container, or using a Sta-Wet Palette to keep your paint from drying out.;
, Avoid putting the black paint directly on top of the blue paint. Placing it next to the blue will allow you to add a little black at a time and give you more control over the shade.

, Be sure not to take much black paint on your first attempt. Black is a very strong color and a small amount will have a large effect.

, Fold the colors together using a mixing tool or cross-hatch strokes with your paint brush. You don't need to mix too thoroughly, which could dull the color. Just combine the paint enough to assess the shade., This could take several repetitions of adding black to the blue paint, but continue to use small amounts so you don't exceed the level of darkness you wish to create.


If you accidentally mix too much black into the blue, have some extra blue paint on hand to even out the ratio.

Purchase your materials.,
Set up your workspace.,
Make colors in separate cups.,

Add paint when the first layer is dry.,
Add dimension to your design.,
Add details using a small brush.,
Refine your piece.,
Frame your piece.",How to Paint with Coffee," Before you sit down to paint, make sure you have all the materials necessary to successfully complete a coffee painting. You will need instant coffee, a pencil, some newspapers, tissue paper for blotting up excess coffee, and have available at least 3 small cups or whatever you have on hand. Buy paint brushes of varying sizes, as well as watercolor paper on which to paint on.
, After you purchase all your materials, it is a good idea to set up your space for painting. Start by spreading out some newspapers on a table a place the watercolor paper on top. Fill up a cup with water and place it at the workspace.

, Drop a small amount of instant coffee powder into the separate cups. Use a brush to moisten the coffee powder. Wait for the coffee to dissolve and mix well with the brush., Before you start your painting, it is a good idea to get used to working with coffee. To make a dark hue, mix the coffee powder with as little water as possible. The amount of powder should not be more than that of water. This will give a very dark brown color. For the medium hue, add in some more water. For an even lighter hue add even more water. Varying the amount of water can bring out the different shades of brown.


When mixing water with coffee in the cups, always start with the powder, then add water with your brush.
Dilute the paint gradually. It’s better to add too little water than too much, because you can always add more.

, Using a wet surface technique we will create the background. First wet the paper with a very light hue of coffee paint. While the paint is still wet, drop in more blobs of coffee paint. Do this randomly until you get a non-tactile texture that forms your background. Wait for the paint to dry.

, Think about what you are planning to paint. It is very useful to lightly sketch your design onto the surface that you are going to paint on. Use a graphite pencil to lightly draw what you are going to paint., Paint using the darkest color for the outline of your design., It is important to let your layers dry completely before painting on top of them. If you start to paint on top of a wet layer, the colors will swirl and mix in a way that is very hard to control.

If your colors do begin to bleed, stop painting and let them dry, then paint over the blended area with the desired color.

, Take some clean water on a detail brush. Paint above the outer edges to continue adding color and dimension., Go in with a small brush and add details to your piece. Water easily dilutes the coffee paint leaving it lighter wherever applied. So lighten some small areas., After you add details to your design, go back and refine your design, correcting any mistakes and adding any finishing touches. Make sure that the paint is dry before you go in to finish your piece., If your final work is something you are really proud of, consider framing the painting behind glass to protect it from weathering and aging."

Assemble the colors of paint shown above.,
Mix red and blue together.,
Mix magenta with a small amount of cyan, and you’ll see the difference.,
Know your primaries and secondaries.,
See below.",How to Mix Colors1," Any paint will do—even house paint—but a few small tubes of oils or perhaps acrylics will be the most effective (and least messy) for these exercises. Let's start by seeing what happens when we mix a just 2 colors together—red and blue.

Note: you can make dark neutral black by mixing it from the available colors. Black pigment is too recognizable wherever it is used. Instead mix the transparent primaries together to make darks and add color to your shadows depending on the time of the day. Black is used in the light color wheel, by subtracting light.
See our 'More Tips' section, below, for help in choosing the best magenta and cyan paints.;
, Everybody knows red and blue mixed make purple, right? While it’s true that they do, it’s not a bright, vibrant purple. Instead, they create something more like this:





It doesn't exactly rock your world, right? That's because red and blue are secondary colors—mixtures of primary colors themselves, each one subtracting more and reflecting less from the spectrum, giving you a purple that’s dark and muddy instead of vibrant and bright.

, Now you get something more like this:





You can see how using the true primary colors—magenta and cyan—results in a much brighter and more vibrant hue. If you want a richer purple, add more blue. A darker purple, add black. For more on this, see How To Determine Correct Primary Colors.

, There are three primary pigment colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow. There are also three secondary colors, made by mixing two transparent primary colors together:

Cyan + yellow = green
Cyan + magenta = blue
Magenta + yellow = red.
Cyan + magenta + yellow = neutral dark black.
With subtractive pigment color mixing, the presence of all colors results in black.

, Our Mixing Paint Colors section gives more detailed help for mixing all the various hues as well as light, dark, and grayish colors. In our Tips section, we offer you a comprehensive list of colors and the blends you can use to create those colors on your palette."

Decide which shade of turquoise you want.,
Buy blue and green paint.,
Buy white and/or yellow paint for paler hues.,
Use blue paint with a color bias toward green.",How to Mix Colors to Get Turquoise1," ""Turquoise"" generally describes a bright, predominantly blue mixture between blue and green. You can, however, mix various shades within the turquoise spectrum: add a glob of white or light-grey paint for a pale and subtle turquoise, or stick to bright blues, greens and yellows to mix a turquoise that pops. Consider whether you want a brighter or a more subdued hue., The paint medium does not matter much—acrylic, oil, watercolor, etc.—but it will be easier to smoothly mix two paints of the same type. Look for paint online or at an art supply store. Keep your eyes peeled: you may be able to find a pre-mixed turquoise paint that serves your purposes. If you start with turquoise, you can use tiny dollops of blue, green, white, or yellow to minutely tweak the pigment.If you are new to painting, consider starting with acrylics. Acrylics are a forgiving and easy-to-mix medium, and you can usually buy them in small, cheap squeeze-bottles.
If you buy your paint at an art supply store, ask the staff which products will blend well into turquoise. They might be able to suggest specific green and blue hues that are ideal for mixing the shade you want, but do not rely on this. Know which shades you're looking for going in.

, If you want a paler and more subdued shade of turquoise, you can mix blue and green with white or yellow. The specific hue of white or yellow is largely a matter of preference, so choose something that fits with the mood or style of your vision. For instance, you might choose a warm off-white as a base for turquoise water when painting a tropical beach scene; you might choose a starker, more ""artificial"" white as the base for painting a cold and distant turquoise planet., Try cyan, cobalt, cerulean, ultramarine – any blue hue that is more greenish than purplish.There are small amounts of other colors hidden within each pigment, which means that each paint shade is predisposed to mix well with a certain other shade. Turquoise is basically a mix of blue and green, so make sure to use a blue that already contains green pigments. You should be able to guess at the pigment bias just by looking at a color: a greenish-blue suggests a green bias, while a purplish-blue hints at a red bias.Phthalo blue and phthalo green pigments are some of the most commonly-used in turquoise paints.Phthalo blue (short for the pigment phthalocyanine) contains a strong green bias, so it is optimally suited for mixing turquoise. Many commercial paint brands feature a ""phthalo blue"" product.Blue paint contains either red pigments or green pigments. If a given blue pigment has a green bias, it contains more green pigment than red pigment. Other (typically purplish) blue pigments have a red bias, and these will be less suited to making turquoise.
You can’t find a ""pure"" blue paint pigment – that is to say, a blue paint hue that will make both a good green (when mixed with yellow) and a good purple (when mixed with red). This is because the blue will always have a bias towards either red or green due to the chemical impurities within each pigment.

Select a base color.,
Dilute your base color to lighten it.,
Use an alternate color to shade the pink.,
Use a warm color to brighten the pink.,
Mix the pink with red to deepen the color.",How to Mix Paint to Make the Colour Pink2," There are a number of readily available watercolor hues that can be used to create beautiful pinks. You may like to use these colors more or less as-is, just thinned with just a bit of water. Choose a base color such as:Permanent Rose
Quinacridone Rose
Ruby Red

, Watercolors work by allowing the white of the paper to reflect light through the transparent layers of paint applied to them. To create a lighter pink, all you need to do is dilute your base color with enough water so that the layer becomes very transparent.









Experiment by diluting your paint with various amounts of water on your tray before applying it to your paper. This will give you a feel for the kinds of pink you can make.
You can also thoroughly wet your paper first and then apply a small amount of your red to create a pink wash.

, The tube colors will work great for areas of pink local color when diluted. To add shading, however, use a wash of a color like cobalt blue over a layer of pink.








Using an alternate color to create shading, rather than black, will result in richer, more vibrant colors.

, Applying an underwash of a warm color before applying a layer of pink will make the hue appear warmer and brighter. A yellow underwash can be especially effective.







, If your base color isn’t as rich as you would like it to be, select a deeper red. Mix it with some of your pink

Add more yellow if you want a lighter, brighter green.,
Add some white if you want a lighter, pastel green.,
Darken your paint with some more blue.,
Add black if you want a darker, duller shade of green.,
Add red to dull the green down.",How to Mix Green Paint2," Start with one part yellow and one part blue and mix the two colors together with a pallet knife. Once you have your green, add one extra part yellow and mix again. Keep adding yellow until you get the shade you want.


Two to three parts yellow and one part blue will give you a bright, lime green.

, Adding white will also give you more of a minty green. Keep in mind that some whites can be very vibrant. Start with less white than you think you might need.

, Start with a basic green color, then mix in one extra part blue. Keep adding blue paint until you get the color you want.


Two parts blue and one part yellow will give you turquoise.

, Keep adding the black paint, drop by drop, and mixing, until you get the color you want.

, If you want more of an olive green or an army green, add a drop of red. The more red you add, the more earthy your shade of green.

Know what shades to use when mixing a muted green.,
Use red to tone down green.,
Lighten or darken your green with some yellow or blue paint.,
Know when to add black or white paint to your green.",How to Mix Green Paint3," When buying artist-grade acrylic, oil, or watercolor paint, look at the colors carefully. You may notice that some of the blues have more of a greenish tint, while others have more of a purple tint. You may also notice that some of the yellows have more of a green tint, while others have more of an orange tint. Choosing the wrong shade of blue or yellow will result in a murky, muddy yellow.

, To get a bright, vibrant green, you will need to buy blue and yellow paint that both have a greenish tint to them. Here are some combinations to get you started:Phthalo blue (Green Shade) and Cadmium yellow light
Phthalo blue (Green) & Hansa yellow (also called Lemon yellow)

, If you don't want a bright green, then you can use other shades of blue and yellow. You can also use some other colors as well. Here are some combinations to get you started:Ultramarine blue & Cadmium yellow light
Ultramarine blue & Yellow ochre
Ivory black & Cadmium yellow light
Prussian blue & Yellow ochre
Burnt umber & Cadmium yellow light

, If your green turned out too bright, don't add black or grey to make it duller. Add a little bit of red paint instead. Red is opposite of green on the color wheel, so it will help tone down the green. The more red you add, the more brown/grey your green will be., Do not use white or black paint; these colors will dull your green. Instead, use a little bit of the yellow that you were using the lighten the green. To darken the green, use a little bit of the blue that you were using. Using yellow and blue will help keep the green bright and vibrant without dulling it down.


Blue can be a very intense color. Start with a pinhead-sized drop first.

, If you want to lighten your green into a pastel shade, add some white. If you want to darken your green into a more dull shade, add a little bit of black. Start with a pinhead-sized drop.

Wet your brush.,
Place red and white paint on a mixing surface.,
Add red to your water container.,
Add white to your water container.,
Mix in other colors.",How to Mix Colors to Make Pink2," Dip your clean brush in your water container. Press it against the bottom of the container to open up the bristles, then run it against the rim to release excess water.








, If you’re using wet watercolor from a tube, squeeze out as much red and white paint as you need. If you’re using dry watercolors, you can use your brush to paint red onto the surface of your project and mix there.







, If you are using wet watercolor paint, stroke your moist brush over your red paint. Mix it into your water container. Don’t dry the brush when done. Slide the brush across the rim of the container once to clean the brush.








Repeat the process to add more red until you get the value you want.

, Stroke your moist brush over your white paint. Mix it in the water container the same way you did with the red paint. Your paint will begin to take on a pink tint.









Continue to add more white until you achieve pink.

, Whether you’re using wet or dry watercolors, you can also make different types of pink such as by adding a dab of purple and then yellow or by diluting red with water and not using white. Experiment to find the pink that’s right for you.








When you don’t mix in white, you can get a standard pink. This depends on how much you dilute the red with water before it dries.
To get softer shades of pink, add yellow. This will eventually give you a peach color.
A little bit of violet or blue will give you a hot pink. Add more to get a shade such as magenta."

Set out a portion of white substance.,
Add red food coloring.,
Stir well.,
Mix in other colors.",How to Mix Colors to Make Pink3," You can do this with materials such as frosting, glue, or hair conditioner. The amount you set out should be the total amount of pink coloring you wish to make. Put it in a mixing bowl so you’ll have adequate space to work in the dye.








, Red is a common coloring and can be mixed in to turn the white substance pink. The problem with red food coloring is that it is very strong, so start with a drop first and add more later if you need to make the shade deeper. Larger amounts of frosting or other material require more drops.








You can also use alternative colors such as rose. These lighter food colorings can give a better pink color to your frosting.

, Use a wooden spoon or substitute kitchen implement to mix in the food coloring. Turn over the frosting or other material until you’re sure that the coloring has been absorbed and spread, then add more red coloring as needed.








, To tame your mixture into the tint of pink you desire, try adding drops of food coloring other than red. Experiment with it. Work slowly, a drop at a time.








Using a food coloring such as blue, violet, green, or even brown will darken your pink, making it into a hot pink and then a fuchsia or magenta.
Add a lighter color such as yellow to make your pink into peach.

Add a small amount of the orange paint next to the blue paint on your palette.,
Drag your brush or palette knife tool through the edge of the orange paint and into the blue paint.,
Mix the orange paint into the blue.,
Add more orange a little at a time until you reach the desired shade of blue.",How to Mix Colors to Make Dark Blue2," A color wheel presents the primary colors of red, yellow and blue, as well as all of the colors created by combining these primary colors to create others. There are basic color wheels which use only the primary and secondary colors. Consider using an advanced wheel which includes various tints, hues and shades., In order to identify the complimentary color, you need to start with the exact placement of your blue paint on the color wheel. Don’t judge the hue based on the title of the paint. Rather, apply the paint to a small bit of white paper and allow it to dry. Compare this color to the color wheel and match the hue to the most accurate section of the wheel., A complimentary color is the color directly across the wheel from the blue you have identified. This should be some version of orange and is the color you will mix with your blue to darken it.A good place to start would be mixing Burnt Sienna with Ultramarine Blue.
Another possible color combination is Cadmium Orange and Cobalt Blue.

, It is better to have too much paint than too little in order to avoid having to mix more and attempt to match your shade a second time.


It is a good idea to save some of your blue paint in case you add too much orange and need to adjust the shade by adding blue back into your mixture.

, It is best to keep the orange near the blue and mix a little at a time. You will want enough to work with, but you do not need as much orange paint as blue paint., Be sure not to take much orange paint on your first attempt. Adding only a little orange at a time will give you the chance to see how it changes the shade of blue.

, Fold the orange paint into the blue paint using a mixing tool like a palette knife or make cross-hatches with your paint brush. Using complimentary colors can create a vibrant dark blue, so it is best to avoid too much mixing. Allow just enough to asses the shade and keep from dulling the color., Avoid the urge to move on to adding larger amounts of orange. If the orange exceeds blue, you will be moving away from dark blue and blend into a shade of orange. Continue adding small amounts of orange and assessing the outcome until you create your perfect shade of dark blue.


If you accidentally mix too much orange into the blue, have some extra blue paint on hand to even out the ratio.

Pour some blue and purple paint on your palette.,
Mix a small amount of purple paint into the original blue.,
Test your paint color.",How to Mix Colors to Make Dark Blue3," Purple, or violet, is an analogous color to blue, found next to it on the color wheel. Make sure that you have enough paint to work with. You will want more blue paint as your base color, than your purple mixing color., You can use your brush or a palette knife to mix your paint.Add a small amount of purple at a time in order to control the color combination and create a violet-blue.

, Many paints, including acrylics, will darken when they dry. Acrylics dry quickly, so you can easily test your paint color by painting a small amount on your canvas and allowing it to dry. This should take no longer than 15 minutes, and will allow you to see the ultimate color before you use this shade for your project.If you are unhappy with the dried color, go back to your palette and adjust it by adding more blue or purple accordingly.

Take a look at your monitor.,
Combine light to make secondary colors.",How to Mix Colors2," Look at the white areas on this page, and get really close. If you have a magnifying glass, the better it becomes. What you see when you get up close and personal with your screen is not white, but red, green and blue dots. Unlike pigments, which work by absorbing color, light is additive, and works by combining light. Movies and display screens, whether they’re your 60-inch plasma television or your 3.5-inch retina display on your iPhone, all work using additive color mixing., Like subtractive color, there are three primary colors, and three secondary colors, made by mixing the primary colors together. The additive light results may surprise you:

Mixing red + blue = magenta
Mixing blue + green = cyan
Mixing green + red = yellow
With additive color mixing, the presence of all colors results in white.
Notice the primary light additive colors are the same as the secondary pigment subtractive colors, and vice versa. How can this be? Consider that subtractive color works by a combined process: it absorbs some colors, and what we perceive is what’s left: reflected light. The reflected color is the color of light that is left after all the other colors are absorbed by pigment.

Prepare your green and blue paint.,
Use a 2:1 ratio of blue to green.,
Mix the paints.,
Keep tweaking the mixture until you're completely satisfied.,
Paint.",How to Mix Colors to Get Turquoise2," Glop a small amount of turquoise-blue (cyan) paint on one side of your palette, and squeeze a bit of green paint on the other side. Alternately, squeeze the blue and green paint directly into the same glob.


If you don't already have green paint, you'll need to make it. Mix equal increments of blue and yellow to create green.
If you don't have a dedicated painting palette, feel free to mix your paints on any clean, dry surface. Try mixing paint on a plate, a sheet of paper, a strip of cardboard, or a piece of tile. Make sure that you aren't painting over something important.

, Turquoise contains more blue pigment than green, so try using twice as much blue paint as green paint. Feel free to experiment with different ratios, but use 2:1 as a basic reference.


Slightly more green paint—say, a 2:1.5 ratio of blue to green—will give you a deep sea-green turquoise. Slightly less green paint (than the 2:1 ratio) will mix a subtle turquoise that is nearly true-blue.
Consider adding a dash of yellow paint for a brighter shade. Try a 1:5 or 1:6 ratio of yellow to blue. Mix the yellow in with the blue and the green.
Add a bit of white paint if the shade is too bright. White will pale and subdue the turquoise hue so that it isn't so visceral.

, To start, glob one paintbrush-scoop of green onto your palette, then mix that glob with two scoops of blue. Continue to mix the paints together until the paint is evenly distributed throughout your color sample. As you mix, the blue should blend with the green until the glob takes on a distinctly turquoise hue.


Make sure that you use as much paint as you need – or even slightly more. If you try to add more blue and green midway through the painting process, you may confound the ratio and wind up with an uneven shade of turquoise.

, Once the vortex of turquoise paint is uniformly mixed, look it over to make sure that you're happy with the color. Try painting the sample onto a piece of scrap material – paint often changes its qualities somewhat when it's spread. If you aren't satisfied, continue to add small, intentional increments of blue, green, yellow, or white paint until you have exactly the shade of turquoise that you need.

, Once you've mixed your turquoise, you're ready to apply it. Make sure that the hue of turquoise is exactly what you want. Feel free to paint with the same brush that you used to make the turquoise, but consider cleaning the brush first for the sake of precision. If you need to replenish your turquoise supply, make sure to add blue and green in the exact same increments that you used at first.


If you mix in more blue/green paint midway through, but you can't get the ratio quite as it was: consider mixing a large amount of the new hue, then painting over all of the original turquoise to even things out.

Use white as the base color.,
Mix the paint.,
Paint.",How to Mix Colors to Get Turquoise3," If you want to mix an especially pale shade of turquoise, start with white or a very light blue. White paint will make up the bulk of the mixture, so use about as much white paint as you think you'll need – perhaps a bit more. Consider using a near-white grey for a slightly darker shade of turquoise.

, Try a 2:1:4 ratio of blue:green:white. There is no single correct way to mix a pale turquoise, so you will need to feel out the ratio for yourself. Start small, with just a few drops of blue and green in the midst of the white paint, and mix the parts together until you have a uniform hue. Gauge whether you want a brighter turquoise, or an even paler turquoise, and add more blue or white paint accordingly. If you ever want to replicate this color, make sure to record the precise ratio.


Remember – until you start painting, you can always adjust the pigment ratio in your turquoise. Make sure that you're satisfied before you settle down to paint.
Make sure to use at least as much paint as you'll need to complete your project. It can be a complex process to try to replicate paint-mixture ratios once you've already painted half of the piece.

, Once you're satisfied with the pale turquoise, you're ready to use it. Splash your color onto your chosen surface and enjoy the pleasure of mixing your own paint!

Know that you cannot make red.,
Change the hue by adding other colors.,
Alter the value by adding black or white.",How to Make Red1," Red is a primary color, so you cannot create it by mixing any other colors.


Primary colors are colors that exist on their own and do not contain traces of any other color. Aside from red, the other primary colors are blue and yellow.
Even though you cannot make pure red, you can still make other hues of red by mixing pure red with other colors. You can change the value of any red hue in a similar manner.;
, Mixing pure red with other colors will change the hue. You can combine it with most primary and secondary colors, and each combination will have different results.


When combining red with the other primary colors, you should only add a small amount of the other color to prevent the red from changing color completely. A little yellow can create an orange-red hue, but too much will create orange. Small amounts of blue can create a violet-red hue, but too much makes violet.
Mixing red with the secondary color orange will make orange-red, but you should limit the amount of orange to an equal part or less to prevent the hue from becoming more orange than red. Similarly, mixing red with the secondary color violet will make violet-red, but you should limit the violet to an equal part or less.
You can also mix red with small amounts of the final secondary color, green. Since the two are complements (two colors lying on opposite sides of the color wheel), adding green to red will give the red a hint of brown. Adding too much will change the red to brown or muddy gray, though.

, If you want to change the value of red without changing the hue, you would need to mix pure red with white or black.


Adding white will lighten the tint. Too much white creates pink, though.
Adding black will darken the shade. Too much black can make it difficult to distinguish the original red hue, however.

Become familiar with the subjective nature of color perception.,
Consider hue, saturation, and lightness, the three dimensions of color.",How to Mix Colors3," How humans perceive color, and how we define it. While science can define and measure light down to the nanometer, what our eyes perceive is a complex mix of not just the hue, but the saturation and the lightness of the color as well. This is further complicated by how we perceive the same color against different backgrounds

Consider this simple example to illustrate color perception:





Do you see a bluish-green, a blue, a creamy yellow, a bright yellow, and a bright green?
Now look at the actual colors. There are only 3:





What we see is about where we see it influencing the actual values. To make things even more interesting, some people’s color perception is so different that we term this as“color blindness,” though it’s simply an imbalance in color perception.

, Any given color can be said to have three dimensions: hue, saturation, and lightness.


Hue refers to a color's position on the color wheel, yellow, orange, red, etc., plus all the intermediate colors such as red-orange and orange-yellow. Some examples: Pink's hue is magenta or red (or something between). Brown's hue is orange, because brown is dark orange.

Saturation is what gives you rich, bright colors, like those in the rainbow or on the color wheel. Pale colors (tints), dark colors (shades), and muted colors (tones) are less saturated.

Lightness indicates how close a color is to white or black, regardless of the color. If you took a B&W photo of your colors, this tells us which ones would be lighter or darker.

For example, bright yellow is a relatively light color. It’s lightness can be increased even more by adding white to make pale yellow.
Bright blue is naturally dark, low on the lightness scale, but dark blue is even lower.



"
"
Follow these guidelines to mix any and every color.,

Make bright clean colors.,

Make low saturation colors.,
Add white to any color to lighten it (tints).,
Add black to any color to darken it (shades).,
Add both white and black (or white and the color's complement) to any color to make your color muted, grayish, or dull (tones).,
Make black.,
Don't try to make white.,
Plan your strategy.,
Mix your colors, and get going on that masterpiece!",How to Mix Colors4," Magenta, yellow, and cyan are the “subtractive” primary colors, which means they can be combined to make any other color but cannot themselves be mixed from other colors. Subtractive primaries are used when mixing pigments such as inks, dyes, and paints.

Magenta and yellow mixed make reds and oranges.
Yellow and cyan mixed make greens.
Cyan and magenta mixed make blues and purples.

, If you arrange your color wheel as a triangle, with yellow, magenta and cyan at the three corners, then to make bright colors, just mix any of the colors on only one side of the triangle.

For example, you can mix magenta with orange or yellow to make red, mix red with transparent yellow to make orange, or mix orange with red to make orange-red. There's no need to limit yourself to using only the primaries, and if you want bright colors, you'll find that mixing colors nearer each other on the color wheel will give you better results.




 This disappointing ""purple"" was made by mixing red and blue.

If you mix colors from two different sides of the triangle, for example blue and red, you will not get a bright color. Blue and red together make a dark dirty purple.

, Low saturation colors (colors that aren't bright) come in three basic varieties: tints (light colors), shades (dark colors), and tones (muted, dull colors)., For a light color it may be better to add your main color to the white a little at a time so you don't waste paint., Some artists prefer to add the color's complement, which is its opposite color on an accurate CMY/RGB color wheel. For example, green can be used to darken magenta, and magenta to darken green, because they are across from each other on the color wheel. Add black, or a complement, a little at a time so you don't overdo it., By varying the relative amounts of black and white, you add to your mix, you can obtain whatever lightness and saturation you are looking for. Example: add both white and black to yellow to make light olive green. The black will darken yellow, turning it into olive green, and the white will lighten that olive green. Different light olive greens can be mixed by controlling how much of each is added.

For an unsaturated color like brown (dark orange), you can adjust the hue the same way as you would for bright orange, by adding small amounts of nearby colors on the color wheel: magenta, yellow, red, or orange. These will brighten your brown as well as changing the hue. But since brown is not a bright color, you can also use colors from other sides of the triangle like green or blue, which will darken brown while also changing the hue.

, Black can be made by mixing any two complements, but it can also be mixed from three or more colors evenly spaced around the color wheel. Just make sure you do not add any white or any color that has white in it, like opaque yellow or opaque yellow-green, unless you want a shade of gray. If the black you are making is leaning too much toward some color, neutralize it by adding a little of the color opposite it., White can't be mixed from other paints. Like the three primaries—magenta, yellow, and cyan—it will have to be purchased, unless you are working in a medium like watercolor in which your paper provides the white you need., Think about the hue, lightness, and saturation of the color you have and of the color you want, and make the necessary adjustments.

For example, green's hue can be changed toward cyan or toward yellow, its neighbors on the color wheel. It can be made lighter by adding white. Or it can be made darker by adding black or green's complement, which will be purple, magenta, or red, depending on the hue of the green. You can make it duller by adding both black and white, or you can make an unsaturated green a little brighter by adding pure (bright) green.
Here's another example. You've mixed red and white to make pink, but your pink is too bright and too warm (yellowish). To correct the warm hue, you will have to add some magenta. To dull your bright pink, you will have to add either white, its complement (or black), or both. You need to decide whether you want a darker pink (add only the complement), a grayish pink (add both white and the complement), or just a lighter pink (add white only). If you plan to adjust the hue with magenta and dull your pink with green or cyan (complements of magenta and red), you can try to combine those steps by using a color that is between magenta and cyan, like blue.

, If all this sounds overwhelming, you may just need some practice. Making a color reference booklet can be a good way to practice using the principles of color theory. Even printing one on your computer can provide you with a helpful reference until you have gotten more practice and are starting to find the process more intuitive.

Prepare several paints.,
Examine the pure red.,
Practice mixing red with other primary colors.,
Mix red with orange and violet.,
Combine the red with green.,
Change the tint.",How to Make Red2," When painting, you'll likely need several hues of red. You can create most hues by combining pure red with other colors.


At minimum, you should have red, yellow, blue, orange, violet, green, black, and white paints. Try to choose paints that are as close to the pure hue as possible for each color.

, Squeeze a small dot of red paint onto your painting palette. Use a paintbrush to transfer a stroke of this paint onto the middle of some scrap paper.


Take a good look at the red streak. This will be your original sample, and you should compare it to the other reds you mix throughout the rest of the process.

, Squeeze two more spots of red paint onto the palette. Add a small amount of yellow to one spot and a small amount of blue to the other.


For either addition, work in vary small amounts and mix them in until no streaks remain. Adding too much of either color can alter the red too drastically and change it into another hue.
Paint a line of orange-red (made with the yellow) to one side of your original red streak. Paint a line of violet-red (made with blue) to the other side of the original red streak. Compare the different hues.

, Start with two fresh spots of red paint. Add orange paint to one and violet paint to the other.


You should be able to mix the two colors in equal parts and still make a red hue, but the red element will be stronger if you use a little less of the secondary color (orange or violet).
Paint a line of your new orange-red next to the previous orange-red. Paint a line of your new violet-red next to the previous violet-red. Compare these new hues to their counterparts and to the original red sample.

, Squeeze fresh red onto the palette and mix in a very small amount of green. The red should change into a reddish-brown.It's best to start with small dots of green. If desired, you can gradually add more green in small increments to further alter the hue. Adding too much will create brown or gray-brown paint, however.Paint a streak of your new color onto the paper, somewhere near the original red sample. Compare the colors.

, Add a little white to fresh red paint and a little black to another dab of fresh red. Mix thoroughly.


Paint a streak of the darkened red near the red-brown sample and compare them; both colors should be dark, but the red-brown sample should have a notable brown element, while the darkened red should not.
Paint a streak of the lightened red onto the paper, too. Compare the tint with the other samples.

Make the frosting early.,
Periodically taste the icing.,
Add plenty of red dye to the white icing.,
Try mixing red with brown.,
Experiment with other variations.",How to Make Red3," Making bright or deep red frosting can be difficult, but the color of the icing will deepen as time passes. It's best to prepare the frosting 24 to 72 hours before you'll need it so the color can set.


This is especially important if you want pure red frosting made with only red food coloring, but the same trick can also apply to red variations if they aren't as deep in color as you'd like.

, When you need to create dark or bright shades of red, the amount of dye used can cause the icing to become bitter.


Taste-testing the icing as you work will allow you to monitor the change in flavor and prevent too much bitterness from developing.
If the icing does become bitter, however, you can usually fix it by adding more flavoring. Stick with clear extracts, and use roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) per 1 cup (250 ml) of icing.

, Place white icing into a non-reactive bowl. Add red food coloring in small increments, mixing well after each addition, and continue until you make a bright red shade.


It's best to work with gel or paste food coloring specifically formulated for use with icings. Standard liquid coloring isn't concentrated enough; the amount needed to make red frosting would ruin the taste and texture of the icing.
As a general guideline, you'll need roughly 1/2 tsp (1.25 ml) of red icing color per 1 cup (250 ml) of white icing. If using ""No Taste"" red icing formulas, you may need 1 tsp (5 ml) of dye per 1 cup (250 ml) of icing., If you want to make deep red frosting but only have bright red dye, the best way to achieve the desired color is by adding a little brown.Add red food coloring to a dish of white icing, following the same procedure used before. Continue until you achieve a very dark pink or light red.
Add brown food coloring to the red icing and mix. The amount of brown dye should be roughly one-quarter the amount of red dye, if not a little less. Once mixed, you should have deep red icing with a hint of brown.

Similarly, you could mix brown cocoa powder into the red icing to deepen the color. Doing so will usually improve the flavor, too.



, As with other mediums, you can alter the hue of the frosting by mixing pure red or ""red-red"" food coloring with other dye colors. Experiment several different combinations, starting with fresh white icing in a clean bowl each time.


Make burgundy frosting using five parts ""rose pink"" dye and one part violet dye.
Mix maroon frosting by combining two parts red-red and one part burgundy dye.
Create raspberry red by combining red-red and pink.Make rust-red by mixing relatively equal amounts of two to three parts red-red, five to eight parts orange, and one part brown.
Prepare a dark ruby red by adding a small dip of black to prepared red icing."
"
Create warmer reds.,
Make cooler reds.,
Deepen the color.,
Lighten the red.",How to Make Red4," If you need a warm tone of red but only have pure red clay, mix the red with a pinch of orange or yellow.


Use golden yellows and avoid greenish yellows since those may give the red a brown tint. Most orange clays should work well.
To avoid altering the hue too drastically, only mix a small pinch of the added color into the red sample. Roll, knead, and mash the clays together until no streaks remain. If you need to alter the hue further, add more of the extra color and repeat.

, If you need a cool tone of red, mix pure red clay with a pinch of blue or violet.


Warmer blues that contain some traces of violet are better than cooler tones that contain some green. Greenish blues can tint the final hue with brown. Most violet clays should work well, however.
As with warm red tones, you should mix cool red tones by working the cooler additive into the red clay in small increments.

, You can deepen the color of red clay using pinches of brown or black clay. Regardless of which color you use, you should only add small amounts to avoid changing the red too dramatically.


Adding brown clay will deepen the color gradually, but it will also change the hue to one with a brown tint.
Adding black clay will darken the shade of red more drastically, but it will not change the actual hue.

, You can lighten the color of red clay using pinches of white or translucent clay.


Work small pinches of either clay into the red sample. If the red still isn't light enough, gradually work toward the desired result in small increments.Adding white clay will change the value, and adding too much can change the red to pink.
Adding translucent clay will make the color less bright without altering the value. Up to one-third of the total mixed sample can consist of translucent clay, but using more than that can change the red into a semi-transparent wash of color instead of an opaque hue.

If you’re concerned about the paint sticking to your spoons, you can use chopsticks, popsicle sticks, or even straws to mix the glue and shaving cream together.;
, Once the glue and shaving cream are completely mixed, set out a plastic cup for each shade of paint that you plan to make. Add a little of the glue and shaving cream mixture to each cup.








It can be difficult to wash the paint out of containers, so it’s best to use disposable plastic cups that you can toss away when you’re done with the paint.

, To color the paint, add some food coloring to each cup in your chosen shade. The amount that you’ll need depends on how much of the paint mixture is in each cup and how dark you want the shade to be. Stir the coloring into the paint mixture until it’s completely blended.








The more food coloring that you add, the darker the paint will be. However, it’s best to start with a small amount, such as 5 to 10 drops, and see if you’re happy with the color before adding more.
When you’re adding the food coloring, keep in mind that the paint will dry darker that it appears when it’s wet.

, When you have all the paint shades that you want, use a brush to paint it on a paper item in whatever design you like. Be sure to use a good amount of the paint to ensure that it has a puffy texture.








Some designs that you may want to create with your puffy paints include a rainbow and fluffy white clouds, a bouquet of flowers, a moon and stars, or a bunch of balloons.
The puffy paints are also ideal for holiday designs. For example, create a Christmas tree or menorah, hearts for Valentine's Day, or a jack o'lantern for Halloween.

Apply the paint to heavy paper.",How to Make Puffy Paint2," Add 1 cup (125 g) of self-raising flour and 1 cup (300 g) table salt to a bowl. Use a spoon or fork to blend the two together completely.








To get the puffy texture, you must use self-raising flour in the paint.
Use regular table salt for the paint. Sea and kosher salts are coarser, and may alter the texture of the paint.

, Once the flour and salt are fully mixed, slowly stir water into the bowl. You can add up to 1 cup (237), but only mix in enough to create a smooth thin paste that has a similar texture to yogurt.








If the paint thickens up at any point when you’re using it, you can simply mix a few drops of water into it to thin it out again.

, When the flour mixture has the proper consistency, separate it between several bowls. Add a different color food coloring to each bowl and mix well to create several different shades of paint.








Start by adding a small amount of food coloring and seeing how you like the color. If you want a deeper color, add more food coloring.

, When you’re happy with the color of the paints, use a paintbrush or cotton swabs to paint it in a design that you like. Use heavy paper or thin cardboard because the paint may soak through thin paper.








Allow the painting to dry for several hours to overnight to ensure that the paint is set.

Create your design on heavy paper.",How to Make Puffy Paint3," Add 3 cups (180 g) of shaving cream, 1 cup (125 g) of flour, and 1 cup (225 ml) of white glue to a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they’re just combined.








Avoid overmixing the paint so the air bubbles stay in the shaving cream and give it a puffy texture.

, When the ingredients are combined, set out several smaller bowls. You’ll need one for each color of paint that you plan to make. Use a spatula to add a little of the paint mixture to each bowl.








It's a good idea to use disposal plastic bowls because the paint can stain your dishes.

, When the paint mixture is divided into the bowls, add the food coloring of your choice to each one. Stir the paint until the color is fully incorporated.








You can also mix tempera paint with the flour mixture to color the puffy paint.

, When you’re happy with the color of the paint, use a spatula to add each shade to a separate squeeze bottle. You can use a brush to apply it, but it’s usually easier to squeeze it out than paint it on.








If you don’t have squeeze bottles, you can put the paint in sealable plastic bags and snip off a corner to squeeze the paint out of. Instead of having to wash the squeeze bottles when you’re done, you can just throw away the bags.

, When you’re ready to use the paint, squeeze it on in a design of your choice. Be sure to use heavy paper, such as poster board, tag board, or cardboard, because the paint is heavy and can soak through thin paper.








Allow your paintings to dry for 24 hours to ensure that the paint is fully set.

Mix a tertiary color with a primary color to create brown.,
Mix complementary colors to achieve black.,
Mix a primary, analogous, and complement for gray.,
Use the color wheel.",How to Make Paint Colors," You'll need a palette and a paint knife or brush in order to get started. Mixing paint with a paint knife results in a more even, uniform color compared to a brush.If you're using brushes to mix paint, make sure to clean them in between mixing. You don’t want paint of a previous color mixing with the two you are currently mixing. Use soap and water for acrylic, or odorless mineral spirits or turpentine for oil.You can mix your paints in a jar instead of a palette if you intend on preparing paint for later work.
Color mixing is skill that takes hard work and experience. Practice with different amounts of paint, as well as different kinds of combinations, in order to get more acquainted with how your paints will interact.;
, All other colors stem from the three primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be made from other colors. It's useful to think of them as the base “parent” colors.


You might consider purchasing larger quantities of the primary colors compared to other types of paint. Larger tubes of paint are often available in 200ml quantities.
Paints come in two qualities: student grade and professional. Student grades are cheaper, but inferior than professional paints when it comes to longevity, intensity, and other factors. Student grade paints can also alter the mixing ratios required for certain colors, so be cognizant of your purchases., Use an equal amount of yellow and blue paint. Mix them together using either a paint brush or painting knife to create green. Using an unequal amount of either paint will skew the color of the green toward whichever color was dominant – blue or yellow.








, Use an equal amount of yellow and red paint. Mix them together using either a paint brush or painting knife to create orange. Using an unequal amount of either paint will skew the color of the orange toward whichever color was dominant – yellow or red.








, Use an equal amount of blue and red paint. Mix them together using either a paint brush or painting knife to create purple. Using an unequal amount of either paint will skew the color of the purple toward whichever color was dominant – blue or red.








, Saturation is how ""intense"" or grey a color appears.Experiment with mixing in small amounts of white or black paint to create variations on the basic colors.









Whether white and black count as primary colors is debated. For paint-making purposes, it's important to know that a variety of black shades can be created with existing paints, whereas no paints mix to create white., Place the paint in an air tight container, such as a jar, if you are not going to immediately use the colors. You will use these colors either to paint, or to create tertiary colors. A Tupperware container is also a great option if you don’t have jars available.









If you don’t have containers to store your paint, cover your palette with a saran wrap and store it in the fridge (or freezer for oil paints).
You can also place a wet towel over your paints to help keep them moist until you are ready to use them., These include the colors that are made from the primaries: purple, green, and orange. You may use the paints you have already mixed, or purchase tubes of the secondary colors from any art store. Make sure you have plenty of primary color paint left over as well.

, Use equal parts primary and secondary paint. Mix them together using your brush or a painting knife. Using unequal parts paint will skew the resulting color toward whichever color was dominant – the primary or secondary.









Note that tertiary colors are always named so that their primary colors are listed first, as in ""yellow-green.""
Different colors will have different names depending on the manufacturer and the ingredients used in the paint. For example, one brand of paint may call yellow-orange ""Cadmium Yellow Light."" Keep this in mind when purchasing paints from the store., Each tertiary color is created via the same method, an equal parts mixing of colors. Different brands of paints often have slightly different pigment mixtures, so don't worry if they color doesn't turn out exactly as you expected. There are six tertiary colors in total:









Yellow-green.
Blue-green.
Blue-violet.
Red-violet.
Red-orange.
Yellow-orange., Specifically, mix the tertiary color with the primary color that is not already a part of the tertiary color’s mix. In the case of browns, the ratio of each paint will affect the type of resulting brown.









Adding a greater portion of warmer color, such as red, will result in a warmer brown.
Using greater quantities of colder colors, such as blue and green, will result in a brown that is very dark, nearing black in color., Complementary colors are those that are considered opposite one another on the color wheel. Examples include red and green, or blue and orange. Mixing these colors together will create a black mixture that leans toward one of the colors used in the mix. This is referred to as chromatic black.









A dark blue and brown can also provide a deep black that may be keyed cooler or warmer depending on the ratio of paints.
Note that purchasing a pure black paint from the tube will limit your mixing opportunities with that particular black., An analogous color is one located next to a particular color on the color wheel. For example, analogous colors of green are yellow and blue. Adding an analogous color to a color plus compliment mixture will neutralize the intensity of the color, creating a more grey color. Add white to lighten the value of this mixture until you are satisfied with the grey.









Dark colors mix more easily into light than vice versa. Mix a small amount of the grey mixture into white to start, and add more as necessary.

, With the three main color groups at your disposal, you have every color you need to create any color you can think of. When in doubt about what is needed to create a particular color, look at the color wheel. Look at where the color falls on the wheel, and mix the two parent colors that the color falls between.Use white (or yellow) to lighten a color.
Use a complement of a particular color to key the color toward grey.
Darkening a color requires an addition of one of its parent colors, depending on which color you wish to lean toward."

Mix red and yellow.Orange is a secondary color, which means that you can make it by combining two primary colors.,
Change the hue by altering proportions.,
Add black or white to change the value.",How to Make Orange1," The two primary colors needed for orange are red and yellow.

""Primary"" colors exist naturally and cannot be created by combining other colors. Red, yellow, and blue are the three primary colors, but you'll only need red and yellow to create orange.
""Secondary"" colors are made by combining two primary colors. Since you need to combine red and yellow to make orange, orange is considered a secondary color. The other two secondary colors are violet and green.;
, Combining equal parts of pure yellow and pure red will create pure orange, but if you'd like a slightly different hue, you can add either more yellow or more red to change it.

Yellow-orange and red-orange are the two simplest variations. These colors are also known as ""tertiary"" colors. Tertiary colors fall evenly between secondary and primary colors on the color wheel.

Yellow-orange consists of two parts yellow and one part red, or one part orange and one part yellow.
Red-orange consists of two parts red and one part yellow, or one part orange and one part red.



, You can lighten or darken orange without changing the hue by adding white or black, respectively.

The amount of white or black you add will determine how much lighter or darker the orange hue becomes.
Note that lighter values are typically referred to as ""tints,"" while darker values are commonly referred to as ""shades.""

",How to Take A Good Picture On Your Camera Phone2," The small sensors in camera phones cannot run at high ISO speeds (i.e. high sensitivity to light, permitting indoor photos without a flash) without introducing large amounts of noise. In most circumstances, this precludes indoor photos other than in the best-lit places.


If you have to shoot indoors, consider what artificial lighting sources you have. Avoid fluorescent light, as it can cast a green tint on your subjects. Make sure you camera is stable in low light. Camera phones slow the shutter speed in low light, and this can capture any movement you make and blur your photo.

, This will either force the camera to under-expose the rest of the shot, or cause the camera to blow out the highlights on the brightest parts of the shot. The latter is worse, since it is sometimes possible to extract details from parts of the image that are too dark, but impossible to recover blown highlights (since there is no detail therein to extract). On the other hand, this can be used to artistic ends, such as with bright light streaming through a window. People pictures will look best in diffuse lighting such as open shade, under a cloudy sky, or in bright artificial light. Try to include bright colors, which will show up well, rather than a range of light and dark areas (which will both lose detail).

, Due to their very short focal lengths (the distance between a camera's optical elements and the sensor, again, owing to their small sensors), camera phones excel at shots where nearly all of a scene is in focus. However, this (and their typically weak auto-focus mechanisms) usually precludes focusing on objects very close to the phone, or having a very shallow depth of field to get a blurred background effect (which can, with varying degrees of authenticity, be faked in software later anyway).

, Mirrors also often end up confusing auto-focus mechanisms. Get outside and get someone to take the photo for you. If you'd rather take the picture yourself, most camera phones have an auto-timer feature so you can set the phone somewhere and get into frame.

, Fine details, such as leaves on trees at a distance, will be smeared out.


It is best to shoot things as close to the subject as possible. If you can get up close to your subject and frame it tightly, you will get the best results.
Most smartphone cameras have a digital zoom, but using this won't help you get detailed pictures from far away. Using this is just essentially cropping your picture on the screen rather than during editing.

, Camera phones won't automatically focus on the foreground and do not have settings to do so., If you find yourself using a flash because your whole scene is insufficiently lit, you're probably taking photographs indoors in poor light. Don't do this, and go back to the first step; a scene lit entirely by your flash will look un-natural, since on a camera phone it is not typically possible to aim the flash anything but directly ahead (i.e. you can't bounce it off ceilings or walls, as with dedicated flash guns for SLR cameras). On the other hand, a flash is a good option for filling in shadows in harsh sunlight.

, Make sure that everything you want in the shot is in the picture, and ready to be captured. Some phones show the entire viewfinder, meaning that what is on the screen is exactly what will be captured in the image. Other phones, however, only show what is in the middle of the image, but will capture more than the viewfinder shows. Err on the side of putting too much empty space into your picture; you can always crop it later.


Use the rule of thirds. When composing a picture, imagine two horizontal lines and two vertical lines crossing like a tic-tac-toe grid on top of it.Place strong lines and divisions like the horizon on the gridlines. Let elements of interest fall on the intersections.

, A black background is a good start, as it can make objects and colors pop in your photo.Black velvet material is a good choice because it absorbs all light that hits it. It will help diminish shadows and reflections.
Make sure the fabric is taught, as wrinkles will show up in the photo and distract from the subject.

, Keep your hand steady as you press the shutter button. After you take the picture, keep the phone in position to allow the picture to be recorded. If you move immediately after pressing the shutter button, often times you will just get a blur!

Blend red and yellow paint together.,
Try altering the proportions of either color.,
Use different hues of red and yellow.Starting with different yellows and red will produce different hues of orange.,
Experiment by mixing orange hues.,
Mix in a little black or white to change the value.",How to Make Orange2," Pour small but equal amounts of red and yellow craft paint onto a paint palette, then use a palette knife to completely blend the two together. This should result in orange paint.

For this step, try to choose a vibrant red and a vibrant yellow without any obvious cool or warm undertones. In other words, stay away from hues previously altered by other colors.
If you don't have a paint palette, you can use a small plastic paint dish or other bowl dedicated for use with arts and crafts.
After mixing the paints, use a paint brush to apply a small streak of the orange color to scrap paper. This should give you a more accurate idea of how the orange looks.

, Now that you know how to create a basic orange paint, practice creating other orange hues by either mixing in more yellow or more red.

Adding more red will create a richer hue, similar to what you might need when paining a sunset. Adding more yellow will create a brighter hue, like the color you might need when paining an apricot.
It's best to gradually blend in small additions instead of adding a lot at once. Adding too much will mean that you'll need to add more of the opposite color to even things out, which can create significant amounts of waste.

, Choose a few different variations and mix them together in a clean part of your palette.

Combine equal parts of one red and one yellow for each sample. Work through each possible combination in the same manner, and test the results on scrap paper.
Experimentation is the best way to determine which starting colors will produce which hues of orange, but there are some guidelines to keep in mind. Golden yellows and warm reds will usually produce more vibrant oranges. On the other hand, using violet-tinted reds or green-tinted yellows will create duller oranges.

, If you have two hues of orange that bookend the hue you need, try mixing both of these oranges together. Doing so should bring you closer to the desired hue.

Start by mixing equal portions of each orange. You can add more of either paint later if you need to.
Note that you can also add red or yellow paint to an orange paint to change the hue. These changes will usually be more pronounced than those created by combining multiple oranges, however.

, If you like the hue you have but wish to lighten it, add white paint. If you wish to darken the hue instead, add black paint.

Also note that black paint tend to make orange look brown and white paint can make orange look peach.
Add the white or black paint gradually, working in small amounts, to avoid creating values that are much too light or much too dark.

Set up a few samples.,
Mix orange food coloring into one sample.,
Combine red and yellow food coloring in another sample.,
Create a darker shade of orange.,
Try other combinations as desired.",How to Make Orange3," Prepare at least four custard dishes or small bowls. Spoon about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of prepared white frosting into each dish.

There are multiple ways to create orange frosting, but each one requires a base of white frosting. You'll need at least four samples of white frosting, but setting up six to twelve will allow you to experiment with more options.
You should obtain at least four different food dyes: one orange, one red, one yellow, and one black. Consider getting additional hues of red and yellow for additional experiments.
Ideally, you should use paste, powder, or gel food dyes that are designed for use with frosting. Avoid liquid food dyes since these tend to have a negative effect on frosting consistency., Dunk a clean toothpick into the container of orange food coloring. Transfer the coloring by dunking the newly-coated end into one sample dish of frosting. Stir until the food color is evenly distributed, leaving behind no visible streaks of color.

Since you're mixing the food coloring with white icing, the final result won't be as dark as the hue of the dye. You'll always end up with a lighter shade, regardless of how much orange dye you use.
Note, however, that adding very small amounts will create a very light orange while adding greater amounts will produce a stronger, brighter value.

, Dunk separate, clean toothpicks into one container of red food coloring and one container of yellow food coloring. Mix both dyes into another sample of white frosting, continuing until no streaks remain.

The combination should result in an orange frosting. This second sample may not look exactly the same as your first, of course, since the red and yellow you use may result in a slightly different hue.

, Create another sample of orange frosting using the orange food dye or the combined red and yellow dyes. Mix a very small dot of black food coloring into the sample, as well.

The black should darken the shade of the orange without changing the hue. Only use small amounts of black food coloring at a time, though, since even small amounts can have a dramatic impact on the color of the frosting.

, If you prepared any additional samples of white icing, you can use them to experiment with different combinations or food colorings. Take notes so you'll be able to duplicate the same orange hues and values later.

Most food coloring manufacturers have recommendations for you to follow, but you can easily experiment on your own.
Several ideas include:

Combine nine parts red with ten parts yellow to create a rosy peach color.Mix two parts orange with one part golden yellow to make an apricot color.Create a rusty orange by mixing eight parts orange, two parts red, and one part brown."
"
Aim for contrast.,
Start emphasizing the shapes and forms in your frame.,
Learn to play with textures and patterns.,
Think in black and white.,
Shoot in RAW and JPEG.,
Use the histogram.,
Distinguish what photos should be black and white.,
Use low ISO.,
Use the weather to your advantage.,
Try long exposures.,
Play with lights and shadows.,
Experiment with filters.",How to Take Black and White Photographs," If you're used to colored photography, you'll be used to the idea that contrast isn't essential; however, in black in white photography contrast is highly preferable. When a photo is taken in black and white, all colors are turned into black, white and various shades of gray. For a photograph to stand out you want a mix of solid blacks and whites and a variation of grays. These sold blacks and whites will create an overall dramatic feel to your photograph.


Attaching a red filter to your DSLR camera improves overall contrast automatically.
Use Lightroom, or another editing program of your choosing in order to manually adjust the contrast of photos.
In black and white photography, complementary colors turn the same shade of gray and do not work with one another like they do in color photography, instead they blend into one another.
Turning up the contrast overall creates a much stronger image.;
, Since color has been removed from the image, shape and form become more distinct. Photography is a two-dimensional form of art and it is often a struggle for photographers to take photos that really emphasize the three-dimensional forms of their objects.


Arrange the photo so it displays fascinating shapes and lines to make these parts of the image stand out over others.
Shadows and leading lines create form and help the subject of the photograph appear more three-dimensional.
Get the right composition by shooting in different than usual positions in order to change the form of an object (In the photo below, the photographer takes the photograph from the side of the flower, instead of the usual photo taken from above).

, These elements of design go hand-in-hand when it comes to black and white photography because they are both often lost in colored photographs.


Reoccurring patterns are seen easier in black and white photography because the viewer’s attention can be focused exclusively on the reoccurring pattern created by shapes, rather than color where shapes are seen more individually.
Texture is greatly affected by lighting conditions, in order to receive the best texture use soft lighting or shoot pictures during the golden hours of the day (early morning, and dusk).
The worst time to shoot texture under harsh lighting conditions, or during midday where the sun is at its peak.

, Seeing in color is the way typical people view the world on a daily basis. When going out and taking black and white photography, though, one must view the world entirely in black and white.


Look for solid black and solid white, in order to make your photos not appear too gray and washed out.
Black makes whites whiter. By making your photo appear darker, either manually of in Lightroom, it can really make your photo appear more dramatic.
Use the dodge and burn tool offered in Lightroom in order to emphasize dark areas, and or lighten them in order to show more detail in the shadows.

, Shooting in RAW lets one have unlimited access to the photograph when editing in Lightroom or Photoshop. Additionally, shooting in RAW and JPEG lets you change the picture style displayed on the LCD screen, to be black and white.

, When taking photography use a histogram to assure the scene has the right amount of lights darks and mid-tones. A lot of photographers are unaware of how histograms work, but honestly, it is quite simple to understand.


The left side of the histogram displays how many shades of black are in the photo.
The right side of the histogram displays how many shades of white are in the photo.
The middle of the histogram shows how many mid-tones or shades of grey are in the photo.
If the histogram reads high on whichever designated side, then there is a lot of that shade in the photo. If it reads low, then there is little to none.
The ideal histogram for black and white photography should be evenly distributed.

, Shooting in black and white is not suitable for all photographs. If color is the main emphasis of a photo it would be best to keep the picture in color, while on the other hand color can often be a distraction to the crucial elements of design in a photo and draw away the attention from the main subject.


Portraits, long exposures and landscapes look exceptional in black in white.

, Use the lowest ISO when taking black and white photographs. When shooting with low ISO, it reduces the noise in a photograph. Noise in a digital image is like the grain in film photography. Once the photo has been taken the editor can always go back and add the grainy look if one desires post-production.


100-400 ISO range is recommended to avoid noise.

, Rain, fog, mist and haze shouldn’t be a reason to not go out and shoot. These conditions can give a real emotional appeal in a photograph. Grey days can even be taken advantage of, the soft light can create smooth scenes and contrast can always be added later in post processing. Puddles from rain add reflections to the image and can draw a viewer in. These elements can come across as mysterious, romantic, eerie and more. Use the weather as an advantage next time Mother Nature shows up unplanned

, In order to take long exposures, a tripod is necessary and a neutral density filter is optional (for daytime long exposures). Most long exposures are taken of, but not limited to, seascapes, landscapes, and people. Long exposures are good for seascapes to soften the water for an overall smooth look and in landscapes to blur the clouds moving in the sky. These look exceptionally pleasing in black in white because it adds to the overall dramatic look created by the softened movement.

, The use of light in black and white photography can make or break a photo. Since color is not available to draw attention to the subject, light needs to be used correctly in order to make the subject of the photo really stand out.


Flat light can even help add a dramatic feel in a photograph when approached correctly. Look for flat light with deep blacks. The blacks will stand out among the low contrast created by the flat light and create a great emotional appeal.
Use light to highlight the main subject of the photograph.
Getting away with bad lighting can be easier with black and white photography, unlike colored photography. This is not recommended but can be used.

, Using colored filters can have a great affect on the overall quality of a photo. A problem faced in black and white photography is that when colors get converted into black and white they often blend together in similar shades of gray.


The colors red, blue and green often show up the same shade of gray. This can easily be fixed by applying a correct colored filter.
Red filters are usually too harsh for other forms of photography but is the most commonly used filter for black and white photography. A red filter greatly increased contrast and darkens blues, making them a key asset to landscape photography.
Orange filters are good to use in black and white photography, especially portraits because if softens skin blemishes and gives similar effects as a red filter, but is a little subtle.
Blue filters are rarely used in black and white photography because they typically darken, and add too much contrast to a photo.

Place the coin on an illuminated flat panel.,
Decide on the angle.,
Secure your camera to a tripod or other stabilizing device.,
Adjust your external lighting sources.,
Adjust the camera's settings.,
Take your picture.",How to Photograph Coins," An illuminated flat panel is simply a small platform used by numismatist photographers that lights the base of the coin. This helps to prevent any shadowing that occurs with external lighting sources such as camera flashes.;
, The angle you use will depend on the coin you're photographing.


An older coin, which may be worn down from years of use, would be photographed either flat or standing straight up perpendicular to the flat panel.
Conversely, a coin that has very little wear to the surface would probably be better photographed at a slight angle, to give it dimension.

, Since you want to capture the features of your coin in detail, you will be using a technique known as macro photography. This involves placing the lens of the camera within inches (centimeters) of the object to be photographed. The slightest movement of the camera will be exaggerated on the photograph, because of the close proximity of the camera to the object. A tripod or brace will help eliminate this.

, While looking through the viewfinder of your camera, adjust the lighting until you have the proper angle for all the lighting.


You already have the lighted flat panel distributing light around your coin, now you need some external lighting that will be directed onto your coin. Your external lighting can come from windows with a bright light––this is called natural lighting––or artificial lighting, such as ring flashes. The ring flash attaches to the lens of the camera and is used in close, detailed macro photography.

, Make sure you have your camera in crystal clear focus on the coin.


White balance is the next most critical factor in getting the perfect picture. White balance helps your camera detect the ambient light you're using and will give you a true and accurate representation of the colors for the picture. Without proper white balance adjustment, you are going to end up with strangely colored photographs––especially against a white background. The best way to test the white balance setting is by trial and error, taking a picture or two and adjusting as needed. Repeat this process until you have the ideal white balance.

, Taking the picture will be a matter of experimentation. Evaluate each picture and adjust the settings, lighting and focus as needed. In time, you will learn what settings work best for you.

Obtain several hues of clay.,
Mix together one red clay with one yellow clay.,
Work through the other red and yellow combinations.,
Lighten the orange.,
Darken the orange.",How to Make Orange4," Ideally, you should have at least two red clays, two yellow clays, one white clay, one translucent clay, and one black clay.

Try to include both one warm red clay (with a hint of orange) and one cool red clay (with a hint of violet).
Likewise, grab one warm yellow clay (with a hint of orange) and one cool yellow clay (with a hint of green).
Note that you can use more than two hues each of red and yellow, if desired, but using at least two should still allow you to observe the principle and understand how it works.

, Using your fingers, pinch off equal portions of warm red and warm yellow. Press the two pieces together and knead them between your fingers until evenly blended.When finished, you should see a solid orange color without streaks.
This combination of red and yellow should produce a fairly vibrant orange since both starting clays leaned toward the orange portion of the color wheel.

, Make three more samples by combining equal parts of one red and one yellow clay. Follow the same procedure used to make the first orange sample.

Warm red and cool yellow should create a medium-tone apricot color.
Cool red and warm yellow should create a medium-tone melon color.
Cool red and cool yellow should create a dull orange with hints of brown in it.

, Pick your favorite created hue of orange and duplicate the color twice more. You can lighten orange clay in two ways, and using two samples of the same hue will make it easier to compare results.

Add a small pinch of white clay to one orange sample, blending until no streaks remain. The color should have a lighter tint while also looking less bright.
Add a small pinch of translucent clay to the other orange sample, blending until no streaks remain. The color should look less bright but should not change value or tint.

Note that adding too much translucent clay will create a semi-transparent wash instead of an opaque orange.



, Create another sample of your favorite orange clay color. Pinch off a small piece of black clay and mix it into the sample, blending until no streaks remain.

The resulting orange will have the same hue, but the black should give it a darker shade. As a result, the orange may look slightly brown.
Black clay can have a dramatic effect on other clay colors, including orange, so you should work in very small amounts to avoid darkening the shade too much.

Give yourself plenty of space to work with. Pour out some denatured (preferred) or rubbing alcohol or other similar fluid into a small glass.
,, Grip the focusing barrel, grip the front cover and twist the latter counter-clockwise. You may find this needs more force than you think.

, This unscrews counter-clockwise. Use a special tool for this purpose if you have one; otherwise, grip the lens firmly and use a screwdriver to push it. This can be extremely stiff. Be very careful; slipping and gouging your front element with a screwdriver would lead to a very sub-optimal state of affairs., With the retaining ring above gone, this will simply lift out Place it on a soft cloth the right way up.

, This is threaded into place; you can remove it the same way you did the front element retaining ring above.

, You can see this when you look down into the front lens barrel; it's held in place with three screws. Undo these and keep them safe.

, You might want to use a magnetic screwdriver to lift this out.

, This will lift out easily. Now turn this upside down, and we're going to go to the rear of this.

, This is another of those ""jam a screwdriver in and pray"" notched rings. As before, be careful., This will drop out quite easily. Put it somewhere safe, and remember which way it came out!, This is the black part of the body in which the last group you removed sat. Now, turn what's left of your lens rear-upwards. You will notice that there are three, very small grub screws near the top. Remove one of these -- you only need to do one to free the housing, and undoing all of them may or may not make this part tricky to re-align. If you don't need to undo it all the way, don't. These screws are extremely fiddly to re-fit. Otherwise, put the screw somewhere safe -- these are extremely easy to lose., This is held into place along with a retainer with two holes in it. You might get lucky and be able to jam a nail into one of these holes and turn it, but the farm should not be bet on such. If you have a pair of circlip pliers, these will work much better. Unscrew it counter-clockwise and drop it out.

, Immediately underneath the small grub screws holding the second group's housing in place (one of which you unscrewed earlier), you will see one more, even smaller grub screw. Loosen this. Again, don't remove this all the way if you can possibly avoid it. This is even smaller and fiddlier to re-fit than the last one you removed, and even easier to lose., This should simply screw out counter-clockwise; removing this will expose your aperture blades.

, You'll need to refer to this later., Be very very careful about how you do this. Aperture blades are, as you will notice, extremely thin and very easy to bend. You may find it useful to lift out the rear aperture guide, complete with blades, and simply drop them into your glass of alcohol. But if you lift them out individually, do so very carefully with tweezers or a magnetic screwdriver. If you're using the latter method, then remove the rear aperture guide too.

, If they're not too bad at all, then blow any large particles away with a blower brush, and use a soft, lint-free lens cloth to polish them. Otherwise, contact lens cleaning fluid might do the trick. Place them somewhere safe and clean.

, Wiping them with some alcohol and a dust-free cloth should do the trick., This was the one you removed earlier, which was held in place with three screws. Don't do these screws up tight yet.

, The holes in the latter should roughly line up with the slots in the former.

, Allow them to dry naturally; placing them directly under a lamp should help to evaporate the alcohol., Get a cup of tea or coffee and a snack, some fresh air, and a smoke if you're that way inclined. Seriously, you'll need it., This is the most difficult, time-consuming part of the rebuild. Refer to the diagram/scribble you made earlier and take your time. Use tweezers to put them back into place. When you find yourself having to slide one aperture blade under another, you may find that lifting the latter with a magnetic screwdriver helps, too. Remember that bending or breaking one of these could make your lens a write-off, so be careful. Take breaks as often as you need to.

,, Fasten the grub screw you undid earlier when you're done. Open and close the aperture again to make sure everything is okay.

, This is exactly the opposite of undoing them; there should be no surprises. Use a lens cloth to clean them both before and after fitting., You'll notice that the aperture lever should, on auto lenses at least, line up with a prong inside the lens body. Push your stop-down button (or aperture pin on M42 lenses) to ensure that the aperture is opening and closing properly., Stop the lens all the way down to f/22 with the aperture ring on the body, and hit the stop-down button. You'll pretty much have to guess what looks right and what does not; wide-open, the aperture should not obscure the rear elements too much (if at all), and stopped down, it should not be a tiny pinhole. Adjust the front aperture guide ring until it looks right. When it does, tighten the three screws that hold it in place., Again, there should be no surprises doing this; it's the opposite of removing them. And again, clean your groups twice, once before fitting and once right after doing so. Re-fit your front cover, too.

, Make sure that your lens focuses and stops down properly. If it doesn't focus properly, you may have gotten one of the groups fitted the wrong way around; if it's sticky stopping down, you may have contaminated your aperture blades with dust, hair or something else.

Be sure that it is appropriate for you to go ahead and act as photographer at a funeral.,
Clarify the purpose of your funeral photography mission.,
Dress appropriately.,
Never forget why you are at the funeral.,
Keep your distance and stay invisible.,
Capture parts of the funeral that are not focused wholly or even partially on the mourners themselves.,
Be patient about the return of the photos to the family.",How to Photograph a Funeral," Simply assuming that it's okay to photograph a funeral is not appropriate. You either need to be asked to do so, or to ask for permission to do so. Realize that photographing funerals is still not very typical, so it may be considered odd by many people attending the funeral. Some reasons as to why you might be photographing the funeral include:


You may have been asked to capture memories for the sake of interstate or overseas relatives unable to attend the funeral. In this case, get thorough instructions from the family as to the exact parameters of your assignment and which parts of the funeral they wish to have captured.
Perhaps it's someone you were close to and since photography is your hobby or passion, you might feel that it's a personal way to honor the end of this person's life. In this case, since the decision is unilateral, you will need to discuss your wish with other family members in order to make it clear what you're doing and how to ensure that what you do doesn't upset anyone else.
Another reason might be as part of an art project if you're an artist-photographer. In this case, you will need to get very special permission and to clearly set the boundaries with the family. If you don't get permission and proceed to make a public event of your artwork, you may truly offend some of those attending funeral––you're not paparazzi, so don't act that way and be sure to get all permissions sorted out in advance.;
, Realize that it can be very hard for family members to discuss the issue of photographing the funeral with you. Don't pressure anyone and always go through the person who is in charge of the funeral arrangements (your point of contact). The photographic arrangements you make must conform to the family's wishes completely. Find out what specific photographs the family wants. For example, while some won't want an image of their loved one in the casket, others might.


Ask the family to contact the person officiating at the funeral to let him or her know of the photography intention. Alternatively, offer to do this on the family's behalf. It's polite to let this person know of the intention. It may also be helpful to have the family explain your role to other mourners; discuss this possibility in advance.
Be certain about any special rituals that the family might want photographically recorded.
Find out what can be photographed both before and after the mourners attend. This will allow you to get really excellent shots of the casket, the deceased in the casket and other elements without mourners seeing that photographs are being taken. This is a win-win for everyone involved.
If the family wishes to have a photo together at the funeral, suggest that this be taken before other mourners arrive.
If taking a photo of pallbearers, get their permission in advance, preferably through your contact person well before the funeral.

, Find out in advance what the dress code is and dress accordingly. To do otherwise is disrespectful. Moreover, dressing as others do will help you to blend in and stay unobtrusive.

, People are paying their respects to someone they loved, so it's important to remain respectful at all times. This includes acknowledging immediately any person's distress and moving away discreetly to avoid inclusion of them in any specific or perhaps even general photo, and also letting people know what you're doing, both when asked and when it seems appropriate to do so without prompting. People may also ask what you intend to do with the photos––be ready with a succinct explanation that focuses on honoring the deceased person's memory.


Be considerate and mindful if attempting to photograph people crying or displaying distress close-up. This is a very personal, challenging time and people in sorrow can find any focus being placed on them adds to their distress or may even make them angry. Whether or not close-ups are appropriate will depend on the context, your relationship, prior permission and the intended purpose for the photos. Try to capture moments of strength, smiles and wistful looks rather than focusing only on the sorrow––these moments can be priceless, so keep alert for them.
Distance/long shots and wide angles that capture groups or the pew rows of people may be acceptable when you're worried about upsetting people by being too intrusive.
Also, consider not exposing faces well––use fading out, motion blur and similar techniques to keep faces more anonymous.

, Be sensitive of the emotions that people are feeling and their heartbreak. Blending in is essential both at the funeral parlor and the cemetery.


Be mindful at all times of where you are standing––as much as possible, aim to fade right into the background. Do not get in front of the casket at any time during the service, blocking the view of the people attending the funeral. Equally, never stand behind the person officiating at the funeral or any speakers; people do not want to see a photographer clicking away; it's inappropriate, rude and distracting.
Try to avoid the use of flash photography inside the church or funeral parlor. This is a time of mourning and camera flashes are associated with occasions where people don't mind being highlighted. With a funeral, people may simply want to fade into the background and let this be all about the deceased. Moreover, many people may simply react to flash photography as a disrespectful intrusion to the event.
Be quick when taking photos; this is not the time for those lingering, long held positions to ""get the perfect shot""! Instead, do the framing in your mind first, rather than when holding up the camera; then take the shot fast.
Keep all noise to a minimum. Turn off any sounds that your camera makes where possible. You need to be as unnoticeable as possible.

, If you're hoping to capture the theme of the funeral generally (for a memory book, digital photo essay, etc.), then include inanimate elements of the funeral as well. In general, shooting these items shouldn't disturb those attending the funeral but will definitely add to the overall ambiance on the final presentation. Some things to consider photographing include:


The tributes that have been sent to the funeral, such as flowers, wreaths and notes. Do close-ups of notes––it can be poignant to have mementos of the things people have said.
The funeral parlor itself; look for special architectural features.
The grave site both during and after the funeral.
The hearses and the funeral cortege.
The moment a flower is placed on the casket, or dirt thrown onto it, may be a good moment to take a photograph.
Consider taking a photo of the grave site some time after the funeral; sometimes people leave mementos well after the funeral and how the grave site looks a few weeks later may be a good inclusion into the photo story you're creating.

, They may not wish to see the photos immediately; take your cue from what the family says. Another possible approach is to upload the photos to a family-only, password protected website that they can download from at their convenience.

Set out to take photos.",How to Get Up and Start Taking Photos," It might help to look at photographs from time to time to get inspiration; even talking to other photographers on Internet forums can be helpful from time to time if you need help on specific points (but be warned; those talking about taking photographs are, by definition, not the ones who are out there doing it, and any artistic advice should be taken with a grain of salt the size of a continent). But, turning your computer off as soon as you can is the most important step on the way to getting out there. If it means you don't read the rest of this, then so be it.;
, Your camera doesn't matter. Avoid the tendency to think ""I just need a digital SLR"" or ""just one more lens and then I'll be ready to get out and take pictures"". Nearly every camera and every lens ever made (or even a modern camera phone) is capable of taking good photographs in the right conditions. Learn your camera's limitations and adjust your photography to suit.

, Find a theme you're comfortable with. Any theme will do, for example, architecture - sky scrapers; animals - ducks; every day life - people on the street. However, don't restrict yourself to any theme; take as many photographs as your memory card or your film stocks will permit. Often, you may find that the photos you set out to take are poor, but that you inadvertently took great photographs of something else in the process. This is fine. If you can't think of a theme, then that's okay as well.

, If you're using a small point-and-shoot camera, then you're all set; stick it in your pocket and go. If you're using SLR gear, then it's very easy to carry far too much with you. Think about it: do you really need a huge selection of lenses, or can you get away with taking a single, versatile zoom? If you're not doing low-light, HDR, or panorama photography, do you really need a tripod? And your flash? The more you have to pack, the less incentive you will have to do so. And the more you carry around, the more incentive you will have to jump in the car and go home earlier. Be brutal about it; if you find yourself taking nothing but your camera and a single lens, you've probably done a good job.

, Nothing will make you want to come home quicker than being either too cold, or weighed down by the coats and sweater you had to take off when it got too hot. Check the weather forecast. And always take a spare pair of socks; sore feet from damp (or even sweaty) socks are a horrible disincentive to walking anywhere.

, Take food which is lightweight, has lots of energy, and doesn't take much (if any) time to prepare. Easy, potentially unhealthy food like chocolate and energy bars are a good bet. This is, again, in order to avoid any disincentives to preparing it (which would stop you getting out at all) and carrying it around.

, Some emphasis should go on ""as you can""; the insistence that you spend more time than you actually have is as good an excuse as any not to get out there. On the other hand, think about setting some time away from less important things, like television. If after that you can still only spare half an hour to take photographs, then so be it; this is precisely half an hour better than nothing, after all. If you find yourself with many hours free, then spend all of them.

, Better yet, if you're not planning on going anywhere particularly isolated, don't take it with you at all. If you're using your camera phone to take photographs, then find some way of silencing it.

, Grab your bag and get out there and take some pictures.

If you don't have a camera, borrow one until you can buy one. Nearly any digital camera from the last decade, and nearly any film camera ever made, will be good enough to get you great shots. Having your own camera will be an immense help.;
, Basics of photography include composition, which is essentially the placing of a subject within the frame of a photograph, lighting, and the basic workings of your camera. See How to Take Better Photographs for some introductory material.

, At least half of the time, the difference between a great photograph and a mediocre one is being in the right place at the right time, with a camera in your hand. Carry your camera with you as often as you can. Make sure to use your camera often, too. Just carrying it around does no good.

, Being ""ready"" is not enough. As Ken Rockwell says of his early experience, Did you catch the spoiler word in my logic, ""anything that presented itself?"" I was a spectator. I thought that photography involved taking pictures of things that came along. NO! You have to get out there and find things. Finding and seeing are the hard part...taking a picture of what you find is the trivial part.get up, get out there and take photographs. Go out at every time of day, every day, and look for things. Don't wait for the right opportunity to come along (but be prepared if it does!); go out and find them. Look for opportunities everywhere you go (whether you're at the mall or on the other side of the world), and go to places to look for opportunities. If you can see something in your mind, chances are you can set it up and shoot it!

,


Look for colours. Or do the opposite: look for a total absence of colour, or shoot in black-and-white.
Look for repetition and rhythm. Or do the opposite, and look for something completely isolated from the things around it.
Look for lighting, and the lack of such. Take photographs of shadows, or of reflections, or of light streaming through something, or of things in total darkness. Many people find 'golden hour' (last two hours of daylight) to be the ideal light conditions for photographs. This is due to the directional light it creates, which can create depth in a photo when utilized properly. However, that doesn't mean one can't photograph during mid day and still find good light. Sun directly over head can be viewed as harsh, look for foggy conditions or open shade to find nice soft light. But, rules are made to be broken, don't take these guidelines too literally!
Look for emotion and gesture if you're photographing people. Do they show happiness? Mischievousness? Sadness? Do they look thoughtful? Or do they just look like another person mildly annoyed to have a camera pointed at them?
Look for texture, forms, and patterns. Great black-and-white photographs are stunning because black-and-white forces the photographer to look for these things.
Look for contrasts. Look for something that stands out from the rest of the shot. In your composition, use the wide end of your zoom (or a wide-angle lens) and get closer and make it so. Look for contrasts of all the things above: colour amid dullness, light among darkness, and so on. If you're photographing people, try putting (or finding) your subject in a context in which they stand out. Look for happiness in unexpected places. Look for a person in a surrounding in which they appear out-of-place. Or ignore this and take them completely away from their context by opening your lens all the way to blur the background. In short...
Look for anything that will hold a viewer's interest which isn't a traditional ""subject"". As you find your niche, you'll probably find that you end up going back to taking photographs of subjects again. This is fine. Looking for things which aren't subjects will improve your photography no end—you'll soon see a different world altogether.

, Get as close to your subject as you can. Use your feet, and use your zoom lens (if you have one) to fine-tune your composition. Get rid of anything that doesn't give some important context to understand your photo fully.

, If you already shoot film, then shoot digital as well. Both film and digital cameras have their place in the learning photographer's arsenal. They both have their advantages and disadvantages, and both will teach you a different set of habits. The worst habits of digital, are balanced out by the better habits of film, and vice versa.


Digital cameras give you immediate feedback on what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong. They also reduce the cost of experimentation to zero. Both of these things are invaluable to the new photographer. However, the zero cost of digital makes it far too easy to fall into the habit of ""spraying-and-praying"" and hoping a good photo comes out at the end of it.
Film cameras force you to be more careful about what you are taking. Even a millionaire would be reluctant to sit around on his yacht taking thirty-six photographs of his bathing towel on film.The economic incentive to make more of the shots you take might lead to less experimentation (which is bad), but it does make you think harder before taking photographs (which can be good, if you have a good idea of what you should do before taking the picture). What's more, film still has a look all its own, and you can pick up professional-quality film gear ludicrously cheap as well.

, Which is to say, find the best of your work and show only that to other people. Even the greatest photographers don't take superb shots every single time; they're just very selective about what they show to others.


Be brutal about it. If they're not great shots to you, then never show them. Your standards will increase over time, and even the ones you might have once thought were passable will probably look pretty lame to you a few months down the line. If this means that all you had for a day's worth of shooting was one or two photos, then that's okay. In fact, it probably means you're being just harsh enough.
Don't look at images full size. Ken points out that the most important parts of an image are those that can be seen when the picture is seen at thumbnail size. There are people out there who will pick at flaws they can only see in 100% crops of your photos. That's okay, because they aren't really worth listening to. Feel free to pass over anything that doesn't look great when it takes up a quarter of your screen (or less).

, Don't fall into the trap of posting in ""critique my photos""-type threads on the Internet; these are usually full of the pixel-peepers mentioned above. Still, it's good to seek out constructive criticism, as long as you're careful about who you listen to.


Listen to artists. If someone has some great artistic work to show— photos, paintings, music or anything else—then this is reason to take them seriously, since other artists instinctively understand visceral impact, whether it's in their field or not (and if your photo doesn't make an impact, it's probably better deleted). Most non-artists do, as well, although they aren't as well positioned to tell you what you're doing right (and they're more likely to be nice to you to avoid hurting your feelings).
Ignore anyone who critiques your photos harshly and has no stunning photography to show. Their opinions are simply not worth listening to.
Figure out what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong. If someone liked a photograph, what made them like it? If they didn't, what did you do wrong? As said above, other artists will probably be able to tell you these things.
Don't be modest if someone likes your work. It's okay, photographers love being complimented on their masterpieces as much as anyone else does. Try not to be cocky, though.

, This doesn't mean merely technically impeccable; any (very rich) clown can stick a 400mm f/2.8 lens onto a $3000 digital SLR, get a well-exposed, super-sharp photograph of a bird, and that still won't make them Steve Cirone. Rather, look for work that makes you smile, laugh, cry, or feel anything, and not work that makes you think ""well exposed and focused"". If you're into people photos, look at the work of Steve McCurry (photographer of the Afghan Girl), or the studio work of Annie Leibowitz.
If you're on Flickr or any other photo-sharing website, then keep an eye on the people who inspire you (though don't end up spending so much time at your computer that you're not out taking photos).

, No, this is not the most important part about taking photographs. In fact, it's one of the least important, which is why it's all the way down here; a great photo taken by a point-and-shooter ignorant of these things, is far more interesting than a boring photo perfectly focused and exposed. It's also infinitely better than the one that wasn't taken at all because someone was too busy worrying about this sort of trivia.


Still, it's handy to have a working knowledge of shutter speed, aperture, focal length, etc., and what effects they will have on your picture. None of this will make a bad photo into a good one, but it can sometimes keep you from losing a good photo to a technical problem and can make great photos even better.

, You may find that you're a good enough communicator to photograph people. You may find that you enjoy being out in all weathers enough that you can do landscape photography. You might have huge telephoto lenses and enjoy motor racing enough that you find yourself having fun photographing them. Try all these things! Find something that you enjoy, and that you're good at, but don't limit yourself to it.

Photograph outdoor Christmas lights while it's still daylight but not too sunny.,
Fill your frame.,
Include the sky.,
Prevent movement as much as possible.,
Set the camera settings to get the best photos.,
Use a reflective foreground where possible.,
Be careful on photos of lights that are indoors.,
Try playing with foreground/background contrasts.",How to Photograph Christmas Lights," It's much harder to get good photos when the lights are in the darkness. At least for outdoor Christmas lights, use late-afternoon light to provide some depth behind already switched-on lights. It can make for a highly desirable effect in your photos. Photograph in the late afternoon, in the ""magic hour"" just before it begins to get dark (dusk).


Taking pictures during dusk will often get you a lovely atmosphere shimmering with vibrant background colors — from grays and blues to pinks and reds.
Plus, the background will still be slightly visible, adding textural contrast instead of that swarming sea of black beside the Christmas lights.
Photos taken during the brighter part of the day won't show the Christmas lights very well unless the day is very dark. Experiment a little with when you take the pictures.;
, Make sure your picture includes everything interesting and noteworthy that you can possibly fit in. Don't take a picture of a single, lit home far away and leave most of your picture wanting a subject. Fill your frame and your photos will instantly look more professional.

, This is an important part of getting in more light and making the whole composition appear more interesting. Be especially alert to moody skies with layers of expressive clouds. Skies can provide truly effective backgrounds that set off the lights in a magical way.



Be patient; you may need to take quite a few photos before the sky and lights appear ""just right"" together.As a rule of thumb, take a lot of pictures. In the digital age, it's probably best to take too many pictures than not enough.
At the same time, don't let the sky steal the show. You're setting off to photograph Christmas lights, right? Make them the main attraction. Don't get so caught up in the sky that you forget what you were trying to take a picture of in the first place.
Other objects such as trees, lampposts, buildings, and landmarks may also improve the composition of your pictures. Check around for the best overall appearance.

, Use a tripod or lean on something solid such as a wall or fence to stabilize the camera. This will give you the best photo result.


Time shutter release can also work effectively to prevent blurring, as can using shutter release cables. Couple these two techniques with a tripod for best results.

, Your camera's settings have a profound effect on the style of your pictures. Don't just take pictures without thinking about what your camera is doing.


Take pictures without the flash. You won't be able to get a very good image with flash in near- or total darkness.
Have the ISO at 800 or over (this is because you can't use flash). If you want a lower ISO, try 200 ISO with an aperture of f/4 and an exposure of a 1/4 second. For this setting, you may not even need a tripod.
Set the white balance for ""tungsten."" This will make the lights look their clearest, as tungsten is a manual setting used for shots where the main light source is household light bulbs.
If you're more experienced using white balance, play around with it a little (experimenting with it will improve your experience anyway). Some people prefer incandescent while others are happy to rely on the automatic white balance (AWB).

, Think snow, ice or water here. This will increase the light and improve the look of the lights in the photo. Just be aware that it is possible to have too much reflection.

, For indoor Christmas lights on a tree, for example, be aware that the camera meter is forced to choose between the dark tree and the lights. This can end up overexposing the lights.


Ways around this include using supplemental strobes and a light box or simply using your flash to provide a fill light.If the flash is too much, reduce it to lower power settings for each shot until it looks right; you may need to use the lowest setting.
As with outdoor lights, use a tripod or a sturdy platform to rest the camera on to minimize movement.
Keep adjusting the shutter speed and/or the f-stop to get the right shot of the lights.

, Focus on an object in the foreground and capture the Christmas lights out of focus in the background. This looks really neat when you get it done just right. Try taking a picture of a snowman or an ornament, with your Christmas lights blurry and bulbous in the background.

Clean off your bed.,
Make your bed.,
Smooth out the bed clothes neatly.,
Assemble together some type of tacks or pushpins and a fairly plain, single color (or pastel colored) sheet, quilt or other fabric object.

,
Fasten the sheet or quilt above your bed, against the wall or other object behind the bed.,
Find your pet.",How to Make a Pet Photography Studio Using Your Bed," If you're the sort to allow clothes, books and electronic gizmos to pile up on the bed, remove them before the shoot. A messy bed will be very distracting to anyone looking at the images.;
, This part is pretty important––as with a messy bed, rumpled and multi-layered bed linen will distract viewers from the subject of your photo.

, While your pet will possibly wrinkle it, do your best to start out as smooth as possible; you can always pull at the edges again while the pet is seated or lying in place.

,, Drape the remaining section of it over the bed a good ways. This forms the seating or lying area for your pet, so take care that it's not so taut that the pet's weight will pull the pins from the wall. Simple is better. Make sure the sheet or quilt doesn't have to many complicated patterns.

, Encourage him or her to sit or lie in place. This might take some time, so be patient and be prepared to stroke your pet or use treats. When the pet is finally comfortable, start taking pictures and practicing with lighting, reflectors, and diffusers.

Choose the model carefully.,
Ask for references.,
Exchange mobile phone numbers beforehand, as then your model can contact you if something urgent comes up.,
Help your model with travel.,
Discuss expectations with the model.,
Tell the model that if all goes well, that they can list you as a reference.,
Stay in touch with the model in the run up to the shoot.,
Get confirmation about 24-72 hours before the shoot begins.,
Ask the model to confirm when she actually heads out to the shoot.","How to Limit Your Chances of a ""No Show"" at a Photoshoot"," Don't go solely by appearance--What is their reputation for reliability? What are the consequences to them if they don't show up?


Consider using an agency rather than going freelance. When an agency model no-shows, they are, at best, given a serious telling off and, at worst, dropped from the agency's books entirely. There is a bigger consequence to them than a freelancer if they don't show up. Use the Yellow Pages or an Internet search engine to find your local agencies and ask them who is suitable.
If you don't want to go via the agency route, then using a modeling hub to find a model. Remember to ask the people whom they've worked with what the model was like - did they turn up late? Did they cancel before the final shoot?
You may consider doing an in-person casting beforehand. These can be good because if your model shows up for this, they're likely to show up at the real shoot.;
, If the model has enough experience, they might be happy to give you the contact information for photographers they have worked with who can attest to the model's reliability. Make sure that the reference is really a photographer; there is always a possibility that it is the model's friend pretending to be a photographer. Check the photographer's website and call the business number listed there.

, There are many tales of photographers who thought they'd had a no-show, only to receive an e-mail from the model later that day explaining that they got lost or missed their train. Don't let this be you!

, One reason behind a lot of no-shows and late cancellations is models not sorting out travel in advance. Give your model as clear directions as possible to your locations, including, where possible, an accurate post or zip code.


If you will be working in a very remote location and/or you know your model cannot drive, it's a nice idea to offer a lift or have taxi details prepared for them.
Encourage your model to have alternative travel plans, in case their train gets delayed or the person who was offering a lift falls ill.
If you work out of the same location on a regular basis, consider having a map and directions on your website.

, Let them know that they can cancel up to 24 hours before the shoot (or whatever you feel is reasonable). Also let them know that if they cannot make it to the shoot and it is less than 24 hours away, they should still call or e-mail you just to let you know so that you can reschedule. At least the model will then feel comfortable letting you know if they can't make it, rather than avoiding you completely and leaving you waiting.


One problem photographers regularly run into is a model simply not replying to e-mail communication. This problem can be eased by inserting a ""time condition"" - something like ""If I have not heard back from you by noon on Monday, I will assume you are not interested in the shoot"". That way, if your model does not reply by your time limit, you can happily get on with casting a new model.

, If they are starting out and want to improve their reputation, this may be a good incentive to show up and work hard.

, If they stop hearing from you, they may jump to the conclusion that you have canceled the shoot.

, Do this by giving the model a quick call to make sure they are still able to come. This can also be a good idea to ask them to bring an additional item that your shoot may need. Also, if you find out they are not planning to show up with 72 hours to spare, this can be enough time to run an emergency casting for a replacement or cancel your studio without cost.

, If you need to leave ahead of the model, call the model to find out how they are doing on the schedule first. Make sure this is known to the model in advance, so that no confirmations means no shoot.

Get a camera, preferably an SLR or another high-performance camera.,
Wear simple, neutral clothes and/or makeup.,
Use a simple, solid background.,
Ensure you are evenly lit, taking extra attention to avoid shadows on your face.,
Set your camera up on a tripod or hand it off to a friend.",How to Take Your Own Headshot1," That said, even cell-phone cameras pushing the bar in terms of photo quality, and an iPhone 6 or newer model Galaxy has enough power to work in a pinch. As a good benchmark, the camera should be no less than 8 megapixels.


It is always best to have a second person ""on-set"" to help out. Ask your friends with nice cameras if they'll be willing to lend it to you, or shoot the photos while you focus on posing.
If you can't get someone to help you, make sure you have a timer or remote shutter on your camera. There are apps for most phones that cover this if you need.;
, Headshots are a bit like blank canvasses, letting casting directors, photographers, or advertisers to image you in their shots and sets. Don't try to impress them with a wild look or striking outfit -- you just want your naturally beautiful self. That said, you should remember to show off your best assets. If you've got killer arms -- make sure you wear something that shows them! Try out:



Men: A simple, form-fitting v-neck (crisp and clean) will work, but a button-down is usually your best bet. Aim for solid colors or basic, clean patterns.

Women: A nice cardigan or even a form-fitting, clean v-neck might work, as will simple dresses and tops. Remember that a proper fit is the most important thing.
Don't match your skin tone -- look for something that makes you pop. Black people should stay away, generally, from dark colors, while pale people should avoid white. Freckled or rosy-complexioned people might want to avoid reds and oranges., Striped backgrounds are a very bad example, and so are bright colors. Solid colors won't distract your viewers, allowing them to focus on you. Step a few feet away from the background so that it blurs behind you. This helps you really pop off the page or screen.


Light or cream colored background, as well as black or navy, are good colors to shoot for.
The most complicated you want to get might be an outdoor wall, like some nice red brick or wood paneling on the side of the house. This is about as complicated a background as you should go, however.

, Never have your strongest light source behind you. You want lights that lead to a nice, even glow, with very few shadows and soft angles. A big place to focus is underneath the eyes -- since most lights are overhead, this area shades in and makes you seem tired. Use a light bounce, lamp, or even a large flashlight to add a little light from below the face.Cloudy, overcast days provide gorgeous, even lighting in most circumstances. Avoid the hours around noon.
The hour right before sunset and the hour right after sunrise are called ""golden hours."" If you have plenty of access to light, these shots often look incredible.
Use clamp lights or lamps when shooting indoors. You don't need professional lights, but you may need to take a lamp or two from other rooms to create enough light., Do no try and hold the picture and take your own headshots. There is a very specific type of shot most people want in a headshot -- and your hand reaching out of frame is not a part of it."
"
Make sure your entire head and upper shoulders fit in the frame.,
Take both serious and smiling shots, taking far more than you think you need.,
Ignore the camera as much as possible, even as you look right at it.,
Think about camera angle to help determine the ""mood"" of the shot.,
Review the photos periodically to find looks you like or shots you might re-take.",How to Take Your Own Headshot2," You can be serious or silly, dramatic or loose, but no matter what you need to fit your entire head in the shot. Getting the upper halves of your shoulders provides nice framing and puts everything in perspective -- floating heads come off as a little unsettling.


If your friend is taking photos, check them every so often to make sure they're capturing the right things.

, Digital cameras have made head-shots far more affordable and easy for the budding thespian. There is rarely a limit on the number of photos you can take, but you'll need to variety to choose from. This is the one photo that is supposed to represent you, and you'll want a large collection of subtly different shots to choose from.


Hold each pose for at least 2-3 photos. That way, if you happen to blink in one, you'll always have a few extras.
If a pose doesn't feel comfortable, or ""like you,"" then skip it. Genuine smiles and emotion will always translate better in the camera., For your headshot, you want to look right in the camera. But you also want to act natural, trying your best to act like there is no camera at all. While everyone has a different way of ""warming up"" to the camera, you can try to:


Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and then open them with your big smile. Often this moment, right when you break out in a smile, is the most natural.
Have a trusty, funny friend helping out. If they're yelling out jokes, poses, or ideas, it takes pressure off of you to think of something and perform at the same time.
Move through emotions slowly. Don't try and force them. Instead, let your face change slowly. Subtly change your smile (which lip is higher, open or closed lips, etc.) and head angle, tilting it slightly up and down to see what looks best for you., Where you position the camera will subtly change your look. In all cases, the camera is shooting you almost entirely head-on, as if lined up with your nose. How you carefully deviate from ""dead-center,"" can change the shot. For example:



Putting the camera below your face and pointing up makes you seem bigger, stronger, and more masculine.

Putting the camera slightly above your face and angling down makes you seem softer, more tender, and ""quieter."" It is often more feminine, but guys showing their softer side use it too.

Putting the camera to either side gives you a slightly dramatic, theatrical look. Don't overdo it, however -- you should still be able to see at least 95% of your face., Don't just assume they all look good (or worse, assume they look terrible) without looking. The easiest time to retake photos is right now, so run through them with a trusty friend to see if you have enough strong material.If you're really dedicated, change your outfit and take another set. You'll already be ""warmed up"" to the camera, and everything is set up.

"
Have another set of eyes (or two) help you pick your best 4-5 shots.,
Use a photo editor, like Photoshop, to dial in the brightness and contrast.,
Add a little sharpness to the shot.,
Very lightly up the saturation to get a slight ""tan."",
Print it in an 8x10 size if heading to modeling or acting gigs.",How to Take Your Own Headshot3," There is no denying that we are our own worst critics. More often than not, you simply can't create enough distance between yourself and your own picture to be a great judge of the shots. Prune away any obviously bad shots (out of focus, blinking, etc.), then have some friends or family members point out their favorites.


Don't ask for advice if you're not going to take it. Even if you think a shot isn't your best, if multiple people pick it out then it clearly resonates in some way.

, You could spend hours talking about photo editing, but the basics will handle 95% of your shots. Brightness and Contrast are the most important features. Use it to create a nice range of blacks, whites, and grays. Lower the brightness to remove any bright white spots, then up the contrast so that any black pixels in the image are deep and dark.


Avoid any bright ""pure white"" patches. Lowering the brightness usually takes care of this, but you could also start to experiment with Luma Curves. To do so, pull the far right slider to the left to lower the total white output.

, Sharpness, when added subtly, can take great pictures and make them even stronger. Note, however, that too much sharpness makes an image grainy and unattractive. Each photo editor has different settings, but even adding 4-5% sharpness will separate amateur editors from pros.

, Saturation is a measure of the color intensity, so higher saturation means more vibrant colors. This is a nice subtle way to make your skin, eyes, and hair really pop, but you can overdo it. For real Photoshop pros, try upping the Saturation in just the reds and oranges to give yourself a natural looking ""tan glow.""


You can use saturation to help fix some small shooting errors. If, for example, the light makes you look a little sickly, lower the saturation in the greens and up some reds and oranges.

, In general, you'll want to find, edit, and print 4-5 images. Many modeling gigs require upwards of 10. Whatever you do, make sure you only send your very best pictures. If a shot is good, but not great, toss it and take another one."

Chose a place to take your photo's.,
Consider whether the employer requires the employee to be standing or seated when they have their photo taken.

,
Look for a sturdy chair without casters.

,
Use a plain backdrop if you have one.,
Place the chair about 1 foot away from the wall.,
Set up simple lighting using a key light and soft box if you have one.

,
If you do not have a lighting kit, then use an external flash with a diffuser attached and the flash pointing towards the ceiling or the wall behind you.,
Avoid using the internal camera flash because you have very little control over the lighting and color cast it will produce.,
Take a couple of practice shots using your preferred method of set up prior to taking the shots of employees.,
Put your subject at ease, tell them how to sit or stand and take the images quickly, this way they will not begin to feel uncomfortable.

,
Take 2 or 3 images and check that the subject is looking at you with their eyes open and the shot is in focus.

,
Load your images onto your computer as soon as possible to ensure they are safe.

,
Set up a folder for the images and consider backing up the images on an external hard drive.

,
Make any required editing adjustments.

",How to Take the Best Photos for Your ID Cards," You do not need a huge room, look for a room that is not used very often and has enough space for you and the subject.;
,,, A light blue color works well for corporate images. The backdrop can be pinned to the wall using small tacks or tape if you do not have a proper backdrop support. If you do not have any suitable backdrops you should have a plain colored wall behind the subject.

, Always use the same distance from the wall so that the images have a uniform feel to them.

,, This will evenly distribute the light.

, Use your tripod and manual settings instead.

, This way you will not be taking up their time whilst you get the area set up.

",How to Get Started in Digital Photography," Whether you just want to learn something new, take better pictures of your kids, get more interesting photographs, or get a new hobby, you must have a desire to learn.;
, Anything that can take a digital picture can be used for digital photography: a cell phone camera, a $20 mini camera from Walmart, a simple point and shoot, or an advanced DSLR. It doesn't matter what you use to get the shot, you can get good pictures with anything.

, Know how to use most, if not all, of the features on your camera. Most cameras offer a ""full automatic"" mode, which is great for those beginning into digital photography. Just compose the shot and take the picture. As you become more advanced, you can start to try out the other various modes on your camera.

, There is a plethora of information about photography on the internet. Search for articles on the basics of photography, such as exposure, rule of thirds, and light. The more you learn, the better at photography you will become. Never stop searching for new information.

, You won't get better at anything without practice. Take your camera with you wherever you go, and always be ready to take a picture. While you are out, try out new techniques or ideas that you have come up with. Try to get the picture that you can visualize in your head beforehand.

, The two major programs are Adobe Photoshop and GIMP. These can be extremely complicated, technical, and hard to use, but once you master the basics you will be very happy that you took the time to learn. For beginning photographers, GIMP is perfect because it is completely free. It is similar to Photoshop, but a little bit less daunting and much less expensive. Start by reading a few articles on how to use GIMP, then spend time experimenting with your own images. There is an excellent video podcast on how to use GIMP called Meet the Gimp.

, Join an online community, like Flickr, and post some of your best images. Join groups pertaining to you and your photos and submit your images to them. Join a beginning photographers group and ask any questions that you have. Look at other people's photographs, analyze them, try to duplicate them, and then apply what you have learned to your own photography.

, These will help you learn new techniques, see professional work, etc. Some good ones include: Chase Jarvis Photography, D-Town TV, Photography 101, The Art of Adventure Photography, and The Art of Photography.

",How to Get the Most from Your Point and Shoot Camera," Although many technophiles pride themselves on not having to read their manual, it will certainly improve your chances of getting a decent picture in every situation. You also might be surprised at what your camera actually can do.;
, Flip through your various options on your camera and look at the manual (again!?). Having to stop to figure out how to do something when you need to do it is not fun - not to mention an opportunity may be lost.

, Photograph the same subject with different camera settings (vary ISO, ""scene"" selections, etc.) and then again under different conditions (light source types and intensities, etc.). The results allow you learn what you can expect from your camera under various conditions and help minimize incorrectly exposed images.

, Many cameras offer a selection of ""WB"" or white balance presets. If set incorrectly, it can result in photos that have a blue tint (or other strange color) that wasn't present when the photo was taken. Typical WB settings include auto, daylight, cloudy, fluorescent, etc. The ""auto"" setting (if offered) is great place to start from; or whenever two or more different types of light is illuminating the subject., RAW formats are native to your camera (""NEF"" - Nikon, ""CR2"" - Canon, etc.). They are lossless and offer some great flexibility for correcting over / under exposure - and much more - than JPEG (.JPG). Those benefits are present only if you edit the photos (in an image editor such as Lightroom, PhotoShop, Paintshop, Gimp, etc.) before saving as JPG. Try shooting RAW if you're willing to / or already editing photos before publishing / posting - then you do not even need to worry about WB settings as these settings can be changed ""on the fly"" in your image editor. Also, all edits can be undone easily. The benefits of RAW do not come without a cost however. RAW files will be significantly larger than the JPG counterparts and will fill your memory card much quicker. JPG files can be edited - but there are limitations on just how much you can change and undoing edits can be a problem. Experiment with both and decide for yourself., You need to learn the rules before you can stretch/break them. As well as the rule of thirds also consider including close, medium and long distance elements to add interest - single distance images can appear flat.

, No, they don't want a picture of them in a long hall. They want a picture of them while using the hall as a backdrop. The difference here is taking a picture of everything and focusing your camera on your 'target'.

, Shoot from down low, up high, etc.. Get on the floor with your camera...crawl around on the ground, etc. Unusual perspectives generate interest.

, Learn how to get around using the flash.

, If you must use the flash, try to come up with a way of diffusing it.

, Of course, even cameras with impressive optics will suffer if the lens is smudged, dirty or covered with dust particles (see smudge on lens in image above). Inspect - and clean - optics with cleaners and non-abrasive tools and cloths that are designed for camera lenses. The use of common household ""glass cleaner and paper towels"" can quickly remove special coatings on quality optics.

, A sensor in ""point & shoot"" camera with 6 megapixels really won't provide a noticeably better picture than one with ~3 megapixels. The tiny sensors in ""P&S"" cameras do not benefit much when they have more than 3 ~ 4 megapixels of resolution. Money spent on quality optics will be noticed in photos, not when it is spent on increased megapixels., It will always result in reduced quality of your photograph.

, It’s normally held in place by a circlip. Push this screw through the hole in the ends of the steel slat, opposite the first hole and keep it in place with the circlip. The end of the slat that has no holes in it must go over the platform of the tripod.

, Turn its nut finger tight. Do not turn it fully tight, as the slat must be able to move freely from left to right.

, You might have to insert washers to take up slack between the slat and the camera base. Your camera should now be connected to the tripod by the slat in a cantilever fashion.

, Swing your camera through 180 degrees around the centre pivot, focus on the same object and take another shot.
Always focus on a definite object when you take both photographs, as this is what your eyes do automatically.
This position works for objects that are from 20 metres away to infinity. For closer pictures, your camera must be nearer to the centre pivot. Just unscrew the nut of the roofing bolt and shorten the projecting arm of your slat. For a normal lens, the swing will move your camera through a short arc, so that the picture is not distorted.

",How to Expose Photo Emulsion for Silk Screen Printing," Things will flow smoothly in this process if everything is properly set up. A garage or small room with blinds, with an easy bathroom access is ideal. Setting up a ""dark room"" in a closet with as little access to light is essential. The area needs to have electricity for the light table and fan in the dark room.;
, Your supplies are listed under ""Things You'll Need."" These materials can be purchased at any craft store such as Dick Blick, Michaels, Joann’s, and Walmart.

, Using a drop cloth or old newspaper, set up a workspace on the ground against a stable surface such as a wall. Place the screen topside facing out; this is where the emulsion needs to coat the screen. The top of the screen is the outer, flat side.

, Coating the screen with the emulsion chemical does not have to be done in complete darkness, just in little light. A dark room can be simply created by having closed blinds, a closed door, and shut off lights.


To create an exposure closet, use a drop cloth or old newspaper to create a resting spot for the screen. Place a small fan inside the closet but don’t turn it on yet. Use old fabric or blankets, dark in color, or black garbage bags and tape to the walls to resist as much light as possible. The lights can be on while setting up but need to be off for the next step.

, Make sure the lights are off and blinds are closed. Put rubber gloves on and open the container of emulsion and use the spatula to stir the chemical. Measure ½ cup of chemical for a large screen and pour into the emulsion trough. Disperse evenly so the chemical is stretching the entire width of the trough.

,


Make sure the screen is propped up against the wall with the flat surface facing you.Use one hand to hold the screen steady and the other to hold the trough. Using the rounded edge of the trough, squeegee up the back of screen, holding the trough at a 45° angle, and applying even pressure throughout. The entire screen should be covered in emulsion. Then use the sharp edge of the trough, not to apply more emulsion, but to scrape off any excess using the trough the same way.

, You can fill these in with a small paintbrush.

, When the screen is fully covered and the excess emulsion has been removed, place the screen with the bottom side propped against the wall. Turn the fan on so it will help dry the emulsion faster. Take note of the time and wait one hour before checking the screen.

, Empty the remaining emulsion from the trough back into the container and refrigerate if necessary. Wash the trough, spatula, and measuring cup. Throw away old newspaper or drop cloth.

, If a light table has been purchased, you simply can plug it in when ready. If constructing one yourself, keep in mind the light needs to evenly be dispersed so plan the lighting according to screen size. Place the lights underneath the table so that no area is more bright than another. Playing around with the lighting in this step is fine as long as the exposure closet is sealed.

, Using a black marker or paint pen, draw or trace whatever image is to be printed. Use the light table to make sure the black areas are not passing light. Tape the image down to the table securing it in place.

, After the screen has been in the closet for one hour and is completely dry it can be exposed. When you place the dried screen over the drawing and expose the whole thing to strong light, the emulsion will harden where the light hits it, but the drawn areas will block the light. Quickly place the screen over the image where it most evenly fits. Weight the inside of the screen all over with magazines or bricks etc., evenly and firmly. Turn on the light and expose 7 minutes.

, Turn off light and wash out the soft emulsion. These first few moments are crucial to the entire process. The screen needs to be thoroughly washed out and each moment it dry’s, the more permanent it becomes. When you can completely see through your image on the screen, then it is completely washed out and has been properly exposed.

, Allow the screen to thoroughly dry out by placing it in front of the fan, if in a hurry or propped up somewhere to air dry. Clean remaining materials to avoid a mess or clutter.

Try to ""crop"" your photo as much as possible during the shot.,
Remember the Rule of Thirds when you compose your shot.,
Save the initial image so that you can crop it in more than one way.,
Get rid of the dead space.,
Know when not to crop.,
Consider what you are going to do with the image.,
Always ask yourself what the image is about.",How to Crop Your Images2," If you are taking a shot of your friend, make it of your friend, not of your friend at the end of the hallway. Then you won't have to cut a lot out of the picture when you come back and edit the photo after it's been uploaded.

, This is not quite the same as the 'golden mean' which is more applicable to painting and not photography.Basically, the rule of thirds is ""Mentally divide your viewfinder or LCD screen into thirds, using two vertical and two horizontal lines to create nine smaller rectangles and four points where the lines intersect.""Try to frame pictures so that the focal point of your subject is right in between or close by one of the four intersection points caused by the lines. Our eyes naturally gravitate to these four intersection points, not to the center of the photograph.

, Always work on a copy, so that you can always go back to your image and do something else to it, if you happen to have new/more inspiration.

Determine what type of camera you own.,
Determine what you will be using the camera to capture.,
Find a read/write speed that works for you.,
Estimate the memory capacity needed.",How to Choose the Right Sandisk SD Card for Your Camera," Typically, it will be very easy to identify what type of camera you own or wish to purchase. Most cameras fall into 2 distinct categories, ""Point and Shoot cameras"" and ""DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) cameras"". Point and Shoot cameras (pictured on the left) are the prototypical digital cameras. Often small, rectangular, and very easy to use, P&S cameras are great for the photos on the go. DSLR cameras (pictured on the right) are very distinct in nature. They typically cost upwards of $500, have removable lenses, manual focus features, and other benefits that make them worth the extra money.


If you own a Point and Shoot variety of camera, there are 2 types of SanDisk memory cards to consider. Consider choosing the SanDisk Standard blue line of memory card, or the SanDisk Ultra line of memory card. More details will be given later in the article to make the decision easier.
If you own a DSLR camera, consider choosing the SanDisk Ultra card, the SanDisk Extreme card, or the SanDisk Extreme Pro card for your camera. More details will be given later on each line of card.;
,


If you have a Point and Shoot camera, you must ask yourself what types of things you will be capturing on your camera. If you intend to simply take still frame photos with little movement and little video, consider choosing the SanDisk Standard blue line memory card.
If you have a Point and Shoot camera and intend to do more action shots and videos, first determine what quality of video your camera is capable of. Class (Video Quality) is a tricky subject, but it can be broken down simply. Class 4 and 6 for HD ~ Full HD video recording, Class 10 for Full HD video recording and HD still consecutive recording UHS Speed Class 1 for real-time broadcasts and large-size HD videos. If your Point and Shoot camera is capable of Class 6, or Class 10 video; consider choosing the SanDisk Ultra memory card, as it will allow you to capture videos in full HD. Higher capacity Ultra cards are Class 10, as well as select lower capacities (specially marked). If your camera is not capable of Class 6 or Class 10, the Standard line of memory card will provide with excellent HD video.
If you own a DSLR camera, you must decide how high of a performance quality you might need. For the serious photo enthusiast, we recommend the SanDisk Extreme Pro memory card, which records in Ultra High Speed - 1, the highest video quality available in SD/SDHC/SDXC cards. The Extreme Pro is the fastest SD memory card on the market, reading pictures at up to 95 MB/s.For the photo lover that doesn't quite need that level of performance but still needs top notch speeds, we recommend the SanDisk Extreme memory card line. Reading pictures at up to 45 MB/s, this card has high performance at a more affordable price tag. The Extremes also record Class 10 video, which is Full HD.For the photo hobbyist who is simply looking to enjoy their DSLR, consider the SanDisk Ultra memory cards. After you choose what type of card you wish to obtain, you must then decide what capacity you need.

, Read and Write speeds can be confusing at first glance. Essentially, The read speed is how long it takes to read something from the memory card. The write speed is how long it takes to save something on to the memory card, or how long it takes the camera to save the picture to the card. Read and Write speeds are important because it determines how fast pictures are taken from and put on the memory card, which affects how quickly you can take the next photo.


For example, when taking burst photos (such as action shots), after the burst sequence ends, the camera must then catch up by writing all of the information onto the card. Think of it like your brain and your hands. You can think of what you want to write down on a sheet of paper faster than your hands can write, so your hand has to catch up to your brain's information by writing it all down. The same is true for memory cards. For Point and Shoot users, read and write speed is more of a matter of HD Video. Again, if you intend to do action shots and HD video, consider choosing the SanDisk Ultra line of memory cards. The read and write speed of this card is sufficient enough for anything you could hope to put on your P&S camera. For still shots and little video, the Standard blue line of memory card has sufficient read and write speed for your pictures.
For DSLR users, read and write speeds are more about how quickly photos can be taken. Depending on the model of camera, the SanDisk Extreme Pro memory card can take up to 38 photos in a 20 second burst photo stream, while the SanDisk Extreme memory card can take up to 28 photos. The Extreme Pro memory cards read up to 95 MB/s, while the Extreme memory cards read up to 45 MB/s. If you plan to take a large amount of burst shot photos and would like to capture as much as possible out of them, consider using the Extreme Pro memory card. For performance in burst shooting and top quality video at a more affordable price, consider using the Extreme memory card.

,


This can be the most important step when deciding what card to choose.
For Point and shoot users, consider whether or not you will be using the video function on your camera. If you plan to use video, a higher capacity of memory card will be required. In Full HD, 2 GB of memory is only 10 minutes of video! For video shooters, at least 8 GB of memory is suggested, but 16 GB or 32 GB is best to capture the optimal amount of videos and photos.If you have chosen the SanDisk Standard blue line of memory card, use the chart to determine how many photos you would like to store optimally on your card. Even without HD video, video files can be large and take up a considerable amount of space on your memory card. Choose the size that works best for what you are looking for in a card.If you have chosen the SanDisk Ultra SDHC line of memory card, use the chart to find the optimal storage space of photos and HD video for you. For more video heavy users, consider the 16 GB and 32 GB options. For more photo heavy users, consider the 8GB and 16 GB options.
For DSLR users, find the optimal size as with P&S users, but consider read and write speeds in the previous section of the article.By this point, you should have a good idea of what memory card line and capacity you are looking to purchase. Check the compatibility with your camera and ensure that the memory card is a good fit for you and your camera. Remember, all SanDisk SD and microSD cards are water-proof, temperature-proof, shock-proof, and X-Ray proof. Now go to your local retailer and purchase that card!

Open your device’s photo manager app.,
Select the photo you want to delete.,
Locate and tap the “trash can” icon.,
Select multiple photos to delete.,
Permanently delete photos from your device.",How to Delete Photos1," Go to the home screen on your phone or tablet and look for the icon of your device’s photo app. On iPhones, this app will simply be called “Photos,” though on other operating systems it might be labelled “Pictures” or “Gallery.” Tap the icon once to launch the app.On iPhones, the “Photos” app is normally on the first page of the home screen. For non-iPhone users, your photo manager app may appear among your other app icons or in a scrolling bar at the bottom of the screen.
Inside your photo app, you’ll find all of the photos you’ve taken or saved, along with the various subfolders they’ve been grouped into—selfies, Panoramas, Instagram photos, etc.;
, Sort through your stored photos to find the ones you want to remove from your device. You can either browse your entire gallery (known as the “Camera Roll” on iPhones) to see them all laid out in one place or explore different subfolders if you have them separated. Tap a photo to select and enlarge it.Selecting a photo will also allow you to find out more about it, such as the file size and type and the date it was taken or saved.

, Once the photo is displayed on the screen, look for the delete option in the upper or lower righthand corner. On most devices, this appears as an icon in the form of a trash can. Tap this icon to select the photo for deletion.Most devices will ask you to confirm whether or not you want to delete the photo. Simply choose “delete” to move forward with the process, or “cancel” if you’ve changed your mind.
Choosing to delete a photo doesn’t actually remove it from your phone. Instead, it sends it to a “recently deleted” folder, where it can be either be recovered or permanently erased.

, If you’re trying to delete several pictures at once, you can save time by batching them together. Pull up your photo manager app so that you’re looking at an overview of all your pictures. Hit the trash icon or “select” option on your screen, then tap each photo you want to remove individually. After you’ve finished selecting the photos, your phone will erase all of them at the same time.This function is useful if you want to hand pick which photos stay or go, or you’re trying to destroy all evidence of a bad selfie session.
Be careful not to accidentally select a photo you want to keep.

, Deleting a picture only removes it from your photo gallery. To erase it from your device once and for all, go back to the main screen of your photo app and look for the “recently deleted” folder. All the photos you’ve deleted will remain here for a certain amount of time before they’re erased automatically. To speed up this process, tap the “select” option and either choose which photos you want to delete permanently or hit “delete all” to clear the photos out of your storage.It’s impossible to recover a photo after it’s been erased from the deleted files folder, so be certain you can live without it.
Photos will usually stay in the “recently deleted” folder for 30 days before they’re automatically deleted."

Access the photo(s) you wish to delete.,
Right click the photo and hit “delete.” Hover your pointer over the unwanted photo.,

Empty your trash can to free up storage space.",How to Delete Photos2," Open the folder where you have your pictures stored. From here you’ll have the option to view, move, edit and delete your saved photos. Search your files until you find one or more you want to eliminate.


If you don’t remember where you put a photo or aren’t sure which folder your PC saves to automatically, you can use your PC’s file search option to locate it. Simply type in the name or keyword from the photo and the file and its location should appear.
For the sake of convenience, save all your photos in one location (i.e. a folder labelled “Photos” in your “Documents” folder). Creating different folders to categorize photos can help keep them organized.

, Right click to bring up a drop-down menu of options. Look for the “delete” option near the bottom of the list. Left click this option once to delete the photo.Deleting a file relocates it to the trash folder on your desktop.
You can pinpoint specific files you want to delete by holding the “Ctrl” key and then clicking the files individually. This is a much faster and more efficient way to get rid of multiple photos than deleting them one at a time., Rather than clicking the photo to delete it, you can also drag it straight to your computer’s trash. Left click and hold the photo in question. Then, move your pointer to the trash can icon on your desktop and release the photo to drop it in.


On computers that run Microsoft Windows, the trash folder is known as the “Recycle Bin.”Drag multiple photos to the trash simultaneously by clicking and dragging your pointer around a group of files to select them all., The trash folder holds files that have been deleted but not erased entirely from the hard drive, so they’ll still take up memory. To permanently remove these files, you’ll need to empty the trash can. Right click the trash can icon and select “empty trash can” from the drop-down menu. After you empty your trash can, the files you’ve deleted will no longer be on your computer.Make sure you’re okay with losing the photos you’ve deleted before emptying your trash can. Once they’re gone, the only way to recover the deleted files is to run a system restore, which reverts your computer to the way it was at an earlier date.
Emptying your trash can regularly can help free up storage space on your PC.

Sync your photos to the Cloud.,
Email the photos to yourself.,
Upload the photos to a flash drive.",How to Delete Photos3," If you’re running out of storage on your phone or computer but you have photos you don’t want to lose, upload them to the Cloud. The Cloud is an non-local form of mass storage, which means it saves files separately from your device. Most new smartphones and PCs provide users the option of uploading files to the Cloud so that they can free up space on the device itself without losing things they want to keep.On iPhones and iPads, the default cloud-storage service is called iCloud; devices that run Android and Other operating systems typically come equipped with Dropbox or Google Drive.Read up on how to sync your files to the Cloud.

, This is an old-school and more private form of alternative file storage. Place the photos you want off of your device into an email attachment and make yourself the recipient of the email. Your photos will then remain there safe and sound in your email so that you can re-download them whenever you choose. Just make sure you have enough available storage in your email to house the attachment.Most email programs offer storage of up to a few gigabytes, more than enough for the average person that doesn’t often exchange large files.
Group lots of photos into a folder in order to send them as a single large attachment rather than numerous smaller ones., Purchase an inexpensive flash drive (also known as a “thumb drive”) and connect it to a USB port on your PC. This will give you the option of opening a folder displaying the contents of the flash drive. Drag-and-drop the photos you want to save into the flash drive folder, then disconnect it from your computer. Your photos will be saved physically on the drive, which you can reconnect to download, modify or remove.Check to make sure the flash drive you’re using has enough memory to hold the pictures you want to hang on to.
Keep up with your flash drives and other external storage devices. If they happen to get lost, so do your pictures.

Use black and white for pictures with a strong subject.,
Capture landscape photos or those with a weak subject in color.,
Utilize high contrast for black and white development.,
Highlight leading lines with black and white.,
Display the shades of various hues in the sky with color.,
Intensify contrast in cloud shots with black and white.,
Accentuate the darkness of shadows with black and white.",How to Decide if a Photo Should Be Color or Black and White1," The subject of any photo is the main object or the focus of interest.When the subject is clearly defined in a shot or isolated, black and white coloring can make it stand out. Images with simple backgrounds are ideal candidates for black and white shots.


Subjects that are in the foreground can also benefit from black and white coloring, especially when the subject has sharp contrast.
Backgrounds that appear miniature in scale due to distance will be minimized by black and white coloring, which naturally draws the eye to more dominant aspects of the composition.
An empty sky surrounding a subject usually results in sharp contrast between the two. This can be ideal for black and white photography.;
, Color creates more gradient in photos, allowing you to distinguish subjects and points of interest in a shot more clearly. With landscape photos, photos with multiple points of interest, and photos with a weak or unclearly defined subject, color photography will add nuance and depth.Landscape shots often use a natural feature, like a tree or forest, a rock, a mountain, and so on, as the subject. These can lose clarity in black and white.

, Contrast is the difference between light and dark colors in a photo. Pictures that have colors that are thick and bold, with bright highlighted areas and dark shadows, are a good example of high contrast. High contrast photos usually work great in black and white.Pictures that include bright sunlight oftentimes also have high contrast. Consider pictures with strong, clear lighting for black and white development.
Portraits with a face that is distinct from clothing also tend to have high contrast. Try these in black and white as well.
Low contrast images can become flat when developed in black and white. These photos generally work best in color., Leading lines naturally direct your eyes to a point in a photograph. This might be a person, object, or the vanishing point in the distance.When distinct and crisp, leading lines can take on a geometric appearance in black and white.


Black and white images sometimes turn out flat. Leading lines add a sense of motion to the viewing of a shot, effectively combating flatness.
Some common leading lines include: sidewalk crossing lines, lines formed by architecture (like the those formed by an archway), roads/paths, rows in crops, and more., Differences in the shades of blue of an open sky shot will be lost in black and white. The rich interplay of light on clouds or the portrayal of similar shades of the same color, common in sky shots, is most suited to color photography.


Clouds that are poorly defined are also good candidates for color shots. The hazy quality of these can be too indistinct for black and white coloring., The pure white of clouds, especially those with a clearly defined shape, can look stunning in black and white. The contrast between the white of the clouds and surrounding features can add an element of drama.


Shots that include different kinds of clouds, like tall, fluffy ones alongside flat, feathery ones, can add texture to black and white sky shots, creating a sense of depth., Although not always the case, shadows can sometimes be an obstacle for color photography. These same shadows, however, are an asset in black and white. Photos taken early or late in the day will yield long shadows, which can be used to frame a subject, adding interest to the shot.


Too many shadows can overload color photography, distracting attention from the subject. In these kinds of shots, try black and white.
The interplay of light on dust in a shadowed scene can have a dramatic or whimsical effect on your shots."
"
Convey character through black and white.,
Reduce confusion in the composition.,
Create a dramatic, antique, or dark atmosphere.",How to Decide if a Photo Should Be Color or Black and White2," If the goal of your photography is to candidly catch character or essence, black and white can help bring out these features. Because of this, many travel and street photographers choose to develop their shots in black and white.The crisp effect black and white coloring has on lines is great for highlighting striking facial features., Shots that are cluttered with distractions can lack focus. Color can make this even worse. Color can distract just as much as it can accentuate, so in busy pictures, black and white often simplifies the composition of a shot, clarifying the subject.


With distractions minimized by black and white color, the eyes of those viewing your picture will be more readily drawn to the subject.
Some items that might steal attention from the subject of your shot include things like colorful containers, draperies, art, articles of clothing, and so on. Remove these distractions with black and white coloring., The stark nature of black and white coloring can evoke an emotional, moving quality to shots. Black and white photos also often remind people of bygone days. These can be powerful influences on the atmosphere of your shot.Because of its association with antique photos, even ordinary items can take on an antique cast when shot in black and white.
In some cases, black and white shots can evoke a brooding, moody, or dramatic quality. This works well for shots of old buildings."
"
Maintain color when it is part of the character of the photo.,
Depict beautiful light.,
Preserve color when taking dusk shots.",How to Decide if a Photo Should Be Color or Black and White3," The color of a shot, in many cases, can define it. The sparkling blue of the Caribbean or the vibrant tones of a tropical locale would likely be lost in black and white. When the color scheme is part of the essence of a place, use color.Some cities are characterized by certain colors. Red, for example, is a lucky color in Chinese culture and is frequently used in cities. Without color, this aspect would be lost., Color photography really shines when there is striking light.Oftentimes the most stunning lighting can be found an hour before sunset or soon after sunrise. The warm, golden rays shed by the sun at these times of day will enrich color shots.Scenes that seem cold and impersonal might benefit from better lighting. Visit a photo location shortly after sunrise or before sunset to make the most of this lighting.
Storms or partly cloudy days can block or reveal the sun in interesting and evocative ways. You might want to keep your camera handy in these weather conditions.

, During dusk and early evening there will be a lot of natural color contrast between various light sources. The silver light of the moon and stars will interact with blue ambient lights and orange tungsten lights. These nuances will be lost in black and white.Shadows cast by ambient light can create interesting changes in natural color. For example, a shaded white uniform in the foreground of a shot might appear blue. The same white uniform under tungsten lights in the background would be warmer and have orange tones.
Capturing the differences or alternations in lighting temperature can create interesting “hot and cold” compositions. Generally, warm light has an orange or red quality to it. Cool light is comprised of blue and cyan tones."

Shoot from above.,
Find the shadowed side of your face.,
Use artistic approaches.,
Do not center yourself in the shot.,
Keep the camera away from your face.,
Use your phone’s main camera.,
Place a mirror in front of your camera.,
Have someone take the picture for you.",How to Take Flattering Photos of Yourself1," Shooting the photo from above will provide a more flattering angle. It will likely emphasize your eyes and make your face and neck seem smaller.Shooting from below can make some people seem powerful, but it usually makes the chin and nose look prominent, which is not a flattering look for most people.It’s best not to go too high so the photo doesn’t get distorted.
Hold the camera out and a little above eye level. Then take the picture.;
, Look at your face in a mirror or the camera (or take a practice photo), and find which side of your face looks darker due to being further from the light source. Take the photo from the shadowed side for an artistic and slimming effect. This approach may not work in direct sunlight., Instead of a traditional, head-on self portrait, try taking the picture in a different way. Here are a few alternative shots you may consider:


A profile shot from the side
Half of your face—either the right or the left
Zoom in on your eye, mouth, or cheek

, The best photographs follow what’s known as the rule of thirds. This means that your eyes should be one third of the way down from the top of the photo and off to one side. This provides a more interesting photograph and probably a more flattering angle.

, The lens of the camera will distort anything that it is physically close to. A selfie, because it’s generally made by holding a camera within arm’s length of your face, often makes the nose appear larger than it is, which is not a look that many people care for.


If you want a close-up shot, zoom the camera in slightly, then hold it far away from you or take it further away and then crop the photo to make it seem as though it was taken close-up.
If your camera has a timer, prop it up against something, set the timer and back away. The resulting photo will likely be much improved.

, Though the rear-facing camera is more convenient for taking pictures of yourself, your smart phone’s main camera is likely a much higher quality, and will take better pictures., It is easier to see how you look a mirror, so if you place a mirror behind your camera or phone, you will be able to preview the picture you’re about to take more effectively. Be sure you’re not showing a fake smile!

, While this isn’t always possible, having someone take a picture for you is usually preferable. You’re more likely to be able to focus on what you’re doing and how you’re posing when you’re not worrying about holding the camera and pressing the shutter button too.


Ask a friend to take a photo for you. She may tease you about it, but she may also want you to take one of her.
If you are at an event or doing an activity, ask someone else there to take a picture of you (and your friends if you’re there with other people). Just be sure that the person is trustworthy so you don’t have your phone or camera stolen.

Pick the right background.,
Practice holding the camera at arm's length.,
Get in a fun mood.",How to Take Really Nice Photos of Yourself1," If your hair is sticking up in the wrong places or covering part of your face in an unflattering way, it will take away from any of the positive aspects of the picture. Make sure your hair is combed to get out any of the kinks, and that you have used product or hairspray to get rid of any static.


Your hair doesn't have to look perfect, but you do have to make sure it does not attract attention away from your face.;
, When you are taking photos of yourself, you can try wearing slightly more makeup so your features are not washed out under the lights. Just don't apply 'too' much makeup or you won't look like yourself and may look like you're wearing a makeup mask. If you don't normally wear a lot of makeup, you can just put on some nice mascara and lip gloss to draw attention to your features.


If your face is naturally a bit oily, make sure to put some powder on your face, or to remove the oil with a natural oil-blotter. An oily face can look even more oily in a photo.

, Natural lighting is always best, but play around with the lights in different rooms. Always do your best to take your picture in a room that has sufficient lighting to see your features.


If you are indoors, stand near a window.
If you are outside, take the photo early in the morning or late in the afternoon so the sunlight does not overwhelm the photo.

, The background you choose should make you stand out instead of making you look washed-out or plain in comparison. If you are indoors, just a plain white or brightly-colored wall will do; don't stand in front of a wall with a lot of posters or designs on it, or you won't stand out as much.


If you are outdoors, pick a uniform background, like a row of trees or a lake, and try not to stand in front of other people or moving objects, like buses.

, This is one common way to take a ""selfie,"" so you should be comfortable doing it before you take dozens of pictures that don't come out right. This will help you avoid that awkward photo where your forearm is blocking half your face and looks incredibly muscular.


Remember that your arms will get tired, so take a break from practicing to adjust the light or pick out a new outfit.

, Your pictures will look much better if you're feeling silly, loose, and just in a great mood. This will make you more comfortable in front of the camera, and more likely to experiment and relax. Try indulging in some of your favorite things while you're taking the picture, like listening to music that makes you want to dance, or humming your favorite tune to yourself.

Retouch the photos (optional).",How to Take Erotic Photos of Yourself," Before you settle in to take photos, do a little primping. You'll feel more relaxed in front of the camera knowing that you already look stunning, and you won't have to do as many (if any) photo touch-ups afterwards.


Do bold makeup. Use a slightly heavier hand than usual to make sure your features stand out in a two-dimensional image. For classically sexy, pinup-style makeup, try false eyelashes, black eyeliner, and a bright red lipstick.
Tousle your hair. Add some volume and messiness to your hair for a suggestive bed-head look that implies a recent roll in the hay. You can tease already-dry hair with back-combing and hairspray, or you can wash and blow dry your hair, applying a root-lifter or mousse around your scalp.
Remove stray hairs. Hop in the shower and get shaving, plucking or trimming! Smooth legs, a well-maintained bikini area, and tweezed brows are all good ideas for an erotic photo shoot. Remove any other noticeable strays while you're at it.;
, How much you choose to show in your photos is up to you, and depends on how comfortable you feel. Keep in mind, though, that more skin isn't always sexier — if you look over boudoir shoots, old pinups, or even Playboy pictorials, you'll notice that it's more about teasing and intrigue than straight-up nudity. Arouse the imagination with clothing items like these:


Basic underwear: You don't have to go all-out and buy new lingerie to take sexy photos — what you already have will probably work great, if you present it in the right way. For bras, try push-up, balconette or plunge styles for maximum effect. On panties, steer clear of the baggy granny briefs and go for thongs, tangas, boyshorts or a bikini-cut style.
Lingerie: If you have pretty lingerie on-hand, now's the time to use it! Corsets, bustiers, negligees, slips, stockings and garters are all great options.
Other items: High heels, oversized button-up shirts, men's ties, ruffled miniskirts, or a simple bed sheet are all popular erotic wear, as well. Or, if you'd prefer to be mostly naked with a few accessories for visual interest, try sexy shoes, long necklaces, thick cuff bracelets, hats, scarves, glasses, or whatever else strikes your fancy.

, Make sure you're the star of the photo by removing any distractions from the area where you plan to take your shots. Remove clutter, get rid of any loud wall hangings, and clear out anything else that doesn't fit the look you want. One common place to take photos is on a bed, so clear off your nightstand and anything else in the immediate area. Or, if you're taking them in front of the bathroom mirror, take everything off the counter. Consider these factors as well:


Framing: Pay attention to what's in the photo and what isn't. For instance, you probably don't want to cut off the top of your head, but you might not want half of the bedpost in the shot, either.
Lighting: You can use lighting to accentuate or hide, depending on where you put the light source. If it's behind you, you'll appear as a silhouette; if it's to the front or side, you'll end up with shadows, which you can use for dramatic effect. If this is your first time, though, it's probably best to go with soft, diffuse lighting. Turn on a few different lamps around the area, and throw a sheer scarf, shirt, or other fabric over them to soften the glare.
Using a tripod: Take photos of yourself without actually holding the camera! This isn't an option if you're using a camera phone, but it might be if you're using a traditional camera with a timer. Set up the tripod that came with the camera, or put the camera on a completely level and stable surface.

, Try to relax and let go of your nervousness. If you feel confident and alluring, it'll show in your photos. Likewise, tense muscles and a forced smile will show up equally well. Here's some tips to get into the mood:


Put on some sensual music. Make up a playlist that helps you feel sensual and comfortable, and play it softly in the background as you take photos.
Set the mood with a long bubble bath, candles, a glass of wine, or whatever else signifies a romantic evening to you.
Try to get some privacy. You'll be a lot more comfortable doing this, especially the first time, if you know you're alone. Don't worry about how you might look to another person, just focus on feeling sexy and getting a good photo.

, If you're not a professional photographer, it might seem like models use witchcraft to look amazingly proportioned in every photo. But actually, a lot of it is just clever posturing. Use these positions to look your best:


Make the S-curve. Arch your back as much as possible, so that your breasts are pushed forward and your butt is pushed back. This will help accentuate your curves and imitate an hourglass shape even though you're working on the two-dimensional surface of the photo.
Keep your chin up. Raise your chin even a little bit more than you think you need to. It'll help your neck look longer and slimmer, and avoid creating weird shadows over your collarbones.
Throw your shoulders back. As with arching your back, this posture helps to push your breasts forward.

, As you're taking images, consider doing a mini-striptease to add a playful, sensual aspect to the photo. Lower a bra strap, remove a piece of clothing, or otherwise show a bit more skin.

, After you've taken your photos, you can retouch them or add different effects to enhance their appeal. Crop out mistakes, cover imperfections with a blemish tool, add different filters, or try black and white for an old-world feel.

Avoid a double-chin.,
Pull your shoulders back.,
Adjust your attitude.,
Angle your face or body.,
Look away from the camera.,
Show emotion.,
Dress for the occasion.,
Avoid the duckface.",How to Take Flattering Photos of Yourself2," One of the least flattering features in a photograph is a double-chin. Usually, the double-chin look can be avoided if you lengthen your neck and move your chin out away from your body slightly.This will feel strange and awkward, but will be much more flattering in photos.

, Slouching shoulders and bad posture are never flattering, so be sure that you pull your shoulders down and back. This will make you look more alert, elongate your neck, and improve your photo. You may also try tilting your shoulders from one side or the other for the photograph instead of having them square with the camera.

, Taking and sharing too many self-portraits that are all serious will make you seem serious or stuffy. Try taking a silly picture instead. Often when you relax and have a little fun, you will inadvertently take a more flattering picture.

, Instead of taking a photo square on yourself, try angling your face or body slightly. Experiment with both sides to determine whether you have a “good side.”Angling your body in a full-length photo will make you appear slimmer and emphasize your curves., Even if your eyes are your best feature, try looking away from the camera for a more interesting photograph.


You can still emphasize your eyes by ensuring that they are wide open and looking above or to the side of the camera.
Be sure to exaggerate looking away. If you look very slightly away from the lens, it will seem like you didn’t know where the camera was. If you look at least a foot from the camera, it will come across as a deliberate choice.

, True emotion usually comes through in your face.A fake smile is not usually a flattering smile, so if you want a smiling photo, think of something that makes you genuinely happy or something that is funny before snapping the shot.


If you want to look happy, be sure you are smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. The way to do this is to actually feel happy.It’s okay to show other emotions, too, if you would prefer a self photo that is somber, flirty, sad, pensive, frustrated, or matter-of-fact. Just try being genuine.

, If you are taking a self photo for a specific purpose, think about how you should dress for the picture.For a business photograph or for a profile for a business networking website, select modest, professional clothing and a neat hairstyle.
For dating websites, you may want to wear something colorful or fun, but try not to look overly sexy (because you will likely look like you’re trying too hard to be sexy). Style your hair in a casual way that shows that you have paid some attention to your look.
For social media websites, think about how you want the world to perceive you. Your clothing choice is pretty wide-open, but unless you are showing off that you have just completed a 20-mile hike, it’s unlikely that a dirty t-shirt is the best choice for a selfie.

, The duckface—pursed lips that are slightly widened—has become a cliché and somewhat hated choice for self photos.Try another, more flattering, facial expression instead.

Find natural light.,
Check your background.,
Think about framing.",How to Take Flattering Photos of Yourself3," Natural light is always better for photography. However, direct sunlight, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is straight overhead, is often not flattering.If you are able, take photos on an overcast day.
If you are inside, try taking photos near a window with natural light (but not direct sunlight) coming in.
If you must use light that isn’t natural, avoid fluorescent lighting and overhead lighting. Indoors, you may be able to turn off overhead lights and turn on lamps for a better light effect.
If direct overhead lighting (either natural or artificial) can’t be avoided, use the flash on your camera to fill in light so that there are no shadows under your nose or eyes.

, Don’t become an embarrassed internet celebrity by taking and sharing photos of yourself with embarrassing things in the background.


Bathrooms and messy bedrooms are often not the best choice for selfies, but they frequently occur there. A picture is never flattering if there is a toilet in the background.If you are indoors, find a neutral background such as a blank wall or a window.
If you are outdoors or at an event, be sure to include yourself and your environment so that your picture tells a story.

, You may add some visual interest to your photograph by providing a visual frame.Here are a few suggestions for framing your photo:


Pose in a doorway.
Use both arms outstretched to hold the camera instead of one.
Stand between two things, such as trees or bushes outdoors.
Use your hand under or on your chin to frame the bottom of your photo.

"
"
Zoom in on an area.,
Crop out unflattering items.,
Use a filter.,
Touch-up your picture.,
Blur your photo.",How to Take Flattering Photos of Yourself4," If there is a part of your face or body that you particularly want to emphasize, use a photo editing application to zoom in on it, then save the edit. Most smart phones and computers have photo editing software available, most of which is very user-friendly.

, Any parts of the photograph that are not flattering can be cropped out. If you took the photo with one arm, it’s usually best to crop the arm out of the picture, as it will look enlarged. If you think your hair looks crazy, crop it out. No one has to see the photos as you take them: don’t be afraid to edit before you share.

, Many photo-sharing websites have built-in filtering options.These will alter the appearance of your photo, bring out different colors and changing brightness and contrast. Experiment with different filters until you find one that makes your photo look the best.

, In addition to general photo editing software and applications, there are also applications that are made specifically for touching-up portraits.With these editing software programs, you can remove blemishes, eliminate red eye, and perform other touch-ups to even your skin tone and perfect your photo.

, While most people hope that their photos are ‘not’ blurry, sometimes a little selective blurring can improve your photo. By leaving part of the picture in focus and blurring other parts, you can direct the viewer to focus on what you’d like to emphasize and you can reduce the emphasis on other things, like awkward backgrounds or unflattering traits.

Set up your camera.,
Experiment with different angles.,
Take as many pictures as possible.,
Ask a friend for an opinion.",How to Take Really Nice Photos of Yourself2," You may want to try several poses to find the most flattering one. If you have a timer, and a series option, you can set your camera to take several pictures at a time, which gives you time to pose or smile. You may look more together if you're not worried about operating the camera and posing.


Give yourself more than enough time with the timer so you don't have to run back and forth too quickly.
If you love the timer method, invest in a remote.

, You should try as many angles as possible to see which one is the most flattering and makes you look your best. Avoid taking photos from below because you'll look shorter or like you have a double-chin. If the camera is slightly above you, you'll look taller and slimmer.


Avoid taking photos head-on. This will make you look boxy. Take the photo from the left or right to make your photo more dynamic.
Try ten or twenty different angles. Have fun until you find your most flattering angle. Remember that one hairstyle can look great in one angle, while another would not look as nice in the same set-up.
Try taking pictures in front of the mirror. This will add a new and fun perspective to your photo shoot. The camera will show up in the photo for a fun effect.

, Keep going until you get the perfect shot. Unless you have a Polaroid or film camera, you have nothing to lose. Try as many outfits or hairstyles as you want until you look just right. You can try a variety of backgrounds that make you stand out, whether you're at home or outside.


If you found the perfect location, try taking pictures in the same place during different times of the day to see how the lighting affects your look.

, Show a friend or family member your picture before uploading it to the Internet to get a second opinion. You may think you look perfect, but an honest opinion could help you improve your next photo.

Put on good-looking clothes and clean your face.,
Pick an interesting background.,
Be aware of your lighting.,
Choose an interesting pose.,
Get excited!",How to Take a Good Picture of Yourself1," Taking just a few moments to ""put yourself together"" can take your selfie from ""good"" to ""great."" Pick an outfit that you think makes you look good. It can be something that goes well with your surroundings (like a flannel lumberjack shirt if you're in the woods) or just a set of clothes you love. Find a mirror and make sure your hair looks good, your teeth are brushed, and your eyes are clear and ""awake."" Wash or brush yourself as needed.


You may want to consider wearing light makeup, but don't feel obligated to use it. You don't necessarily have to wear makeup to take a good photo. Sometimes the most best photos come from a person's natural beauty.
If you are taking a profile picture Facebook, a dating website, or something similar, you may want to put more effort into your selfie than normal.;
, You can take a closeup of your face, but having something else in the photo to look at gives the photo depth and variety. It's also nice for making your selfies look different from each other. There are no ""right"" answers here, but below are just a few ideas:


Try shooting both outside and inside.
Try shooting against different textures of wall (wood, brick, paint, glass, wallpaper, etc.).
Try capturing eye-catching objects like flowers, bodies of water, animals, or statues in the frame.

, The light sources around you when you take your picture can seriously affect how it turns out. Not enough light can make the photo pixelated and dark, whereas too much light can block out all your features (and even make your nose disappear). Try to strike a good balance: you want just enough lighting to show all the amazing aspects of your face, but not so much that they vanish and leave you looking like a shining mirror.


If you're indoors, try not to stand in front of a window with your back facing it, as the light from outside can make you look dark and shadowy.Instead, try standing facing the window instead so any light coming from outside will hit your face and make your features look sharper.

, Now that you have your lighting situated, it's time to decide what you want your pose to be. There are many options here: you can do the duck face, make a peace sign, or even just show a simple smile! You can face away from the camera or look into the lens. The possibilities are endless. Choose something that feels right and go with it!


If you're posting pictures to social media, make sure to vary your poses. You don't want to seem like you only know how to do one thing.
If you're using a phone to take your picture and you want to look into the camera, don't forget to point your eyes at the small lens and not at the screen itself.

, Having a happy, positive attitude will show through in your picture. Taking selfies isn't a big deal, so instead of worrying, have fun with it and don't be afraid to experiment. You can always get rid of bad pictures later.


If you're having a hard time getting jazzed up for your photo, get physical! Try taking a few photos while jumping, balancing on one foot, or doing something athletic. Moving around will get your blood flowing and raise your energy levels.

, You can also take the picture with the back camera, but its more difficult as you can’t see yourself on the screen to adjust your position.

, When taking the proper selfie you should always be conscious of the lighting as it can really affect picture quality. Natural lighting is always the best, position yourself so that the light hits your face.


Be aware that too much light exposure can hinder the picture quality, as well as hide features on your face.

, When taking an individual selfie, there many aspects you have to take under consideration. Do you want a full body picture? Do you want medium close up (chest to the top of head)? Decide which before proceeding.

, If you're taking a full body picture, make sure that the area is clutter free.

, Make sure the mirror you're taking the picture in is clean. This is the only selfie you don't have to point the camera at a specific angle.

, If you're taking a close up selfie, you should know what is your ""good side"". Adjust the phone a little to the right or left, depending on which side is more appealing to you.


It also helps to show other facial expressions to add character to your photo such as smiling, serious, off guard, etc.

, Also, if you're showing off a new hair style, earrings, make-up, you should position the camera where the viewer can see those things.

, When taking a selfie with a friend, it is even more complicated than taking one by yourself. The procedure is the same as an individual selfie but taking a selfie with a friend gets tricky.

, Positioning gets irritating. Angles that are flattering for you might not be as complimentary for the other person. Overall, it may take a little practice.


While taking a selfie at an angle, the individual holding the camera will have the dominant presence.
If you want to work with angles take turns holding the camera so one person is not assigned the “selfie sidekick.”

, This is a lot easier for close ups. It gives you the chance to work on the focus of the face.

, That is the best part of taking a selfie with a friend, it is the perfect opportunity to get weird with your face.

, Keep in mind that you may have to take the picture a few times from different angles to get the best shot.

, You can position yourself anywhere in the selfie. The position is right in the middle of the picture to draw viewers of the picture right to you.

, Before you click the button to snap the picture, be sure you've included everyone in the photo; this is a difficult task, so take your time.


Most group selfies are only able to include the head to shoulder span of every member in the photo.

, When posing for this picture, make sure you are all smiling, making a silly face, or even in the midst of just having a good time.


Caution: Beware of photo bombers! Though, they do add some amusement to the picture, especially if they're famous or hilarious.

, You are able to crop your selfies with the Instagram apps, and even use their filters and tools in varying degrees to finalize them before uploading them.


Sometimes Instagram can’t fit your entire picture into its square layout. If you want to keep your photos wide, you can download free apps like Photo Squarer to shrink the original photo, to upload a “wide-screen” picture on Instagram.
Sometimes you can’t choose among all your different selfies and might want to upload them all at once. You can download free apps such as Photo Grid or Pic Stitch to put together collages that you can upload on Instagram.
You might also want to check out the filter and editing options on your phone's camera before using Instagram or other apps.

, For example, Snapchat or VSCO Cam. This will help you to stay up-to-date on the latest trends.

Consider upgrading your camera.,
Experiment with unique angles.,
If necessary, adjust the camera settings.,
Take many different pictures and pick your favorites.,
Consider cropping or editing your photo.,
Consider using filters.,
Get outside opinions.",How to Take a Good Picture of Yourself2," The most important thing for getting high-quality photos is a high-quality camera. Cheaper, lower-quality cameras can leave you with photos that look blurry and indistinct rather than crisp and lifelike. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to spend lots of money on a new phone or camera — just be aware that the better the camera, the better the photo. If you are interested in taking lots of photos, you may want to invest in a professional camera (or borrow a friend's).


If you're stuck using a phone, you can judge the strength of its camera with its megapixel rating. As a general rule, the higher megapixel number the camera has, the better the quality. If you aren't sure what your exact megapixel amount is on your camera(s), you can usually find it by Googling the specs for your specific phone. In some cases, it can be found under Phone Info in the Settings menu.
Phones aren't always a bad choice. Smartphones are also best because filters and lighting can always be edited or changed later on for aesthetic purposes.

, When it comes to selfies, there are many different angles you can try. Try shooting from close to your face and farther away, from up high and down low, and from either side. If you have a friend (or a tripod) with you, you can even shoot from a distance.


If you have a phone with a forward-facing camera, you can just turn it on and try moving your phone around to see which angle you like best without having to take pictures.
One good policy for selfies is to take the photo from eye level or above. Shooting from below that can make your face look rounder and make certain features (like the underside of your chin) look bigger.

, If you're not liking your results, the problem may stem from your camera's settings. Things such as brightness, contrast, focus settings, and different shooting modes (e.g., portrait, action, etc.) can all affect your picture quality. Try looking in your camera's ""options"" menu or using the appropriate buttons to change the settings.


If you're shooting in dim lighting, you may want to turn your camera's flash off. The flash can make reflective surfaces look distractingly bright. Keep in mind, however, that many professional cameras will automatically have a slow shutter speed in low light conditions, which means you'll need a tripod to keep the camera steady.
Some digital cameras and phones have a ""save as flipped"" option. This prevents the picture from being reversed once it's taken.

, Getting a good photo is much easier if you have many to choose from. Try taking multiple snapshots from each angle — when you're done, you can go through and pick the ones that look best.


Be a relentless editor. Don't be afraid to delete photos that are unflattering. You have no reason to share anything but the best.

, Once you've found a picture you like, you may want to do some light ""touch up"" work (though this isn't necessary at all). If you're using a digital camera, editing software like Photoshop (or GIMP, a free alternative) is a good choice.If you're working on a phone, there are a variety of free apps that are available for download that offer basic editing and cropping options.


A good policy is to keep your editing subtle — people are good at telling when something isn't quite right. For instance, if you use computer editing tools to bend the edges of your figure make yourself thinner, this can be easily detected if you are next to a straight edge (like a door frame) because the edge of the object will curve as well.

, Today, this is common for pictures taken on phones. The most famous app for putting filters on photos is Instagram, but there are other apps and computer programs that can do this as well. Examples include Retrica, Filterloop or Vintago. Be sure that the filter gives the picture the look you want. For example, if you're at the beach, try something light and sunny to give your photo a ""washed-out"" look.


Black and white filters are great for hiding facial imperfections.

, Not sure whether your picture looks good? Ask a friend or family member. Other people may be able to spot imperfections that you've missed or suggest ideas you haven't thought of. They can also be a valuable ""deciding vote"" when it's time to pick between two different photos.


You can even post your picture on line and ask your peers' opinions on it. Be careful not to do this too often — it can seem a little attention-seeking.

Acne can be a huge selfie killer. If you have acne, try to treat it, and make sure to wash your face twice a day to prevent future breakouts.

, If your selfie mainly displays your clothing, the viewers will pay attention to your clothes and not your facial features.

, Is it your white teeth? Your golden hair? Whatever it is, make sure your selfie boasts your best feature and not your worst.

, If you have acne, using a filter can help the acne match your skin tone and look completely gone.

, If your insecurity is on one side of your face, turn that side of your head away from your phone, or make sure the lighting is on the other side.

, Photoshopped selfies seem to scream to the viewers, ""This person is insecure!"". Instead of using Photoshop, use the techniques above and the confidence boosters below.

Choose a proper-sized, extendable flagpole.,
Screw a tripod in with a flagpole.,
Tape a mini tripod and flagpole together.If you don't want to take the effort of making a ""permanent"" selfie stick using a drill and screws, you can get much of the same effect by thoroughly wrapping the tripod to a flagpole using tape.,
Mount phone to the tripod.,
Explore flagpole alternatives.",How to Make a Selfie Stick1," A flagpole is a perfect choice for a selfie stick because the pole's length is often adjustable. The flagpole should be intended for handheld use. A smaller sized pole will allow you to handle it properly, all the while giving you a healthy range of space to take your pictures from.


As a rule of thumb, it is good to place the camera at roughly your arms' length. This will keep your face in proximity without unnecessarily crowding the image.If you cannot find a flagpole at a department store, they are also available to order online.;
, If you are looking for a more permanent brand of selfie stick, you can drill a hole through both ends of the top inch of the flagpole. Screw in a nut on either side to secure it in. Some tripods will also have a fastening function to secure them to a stick or other device. The bottom end of a tripod should be able to fit inside a hollow flagpole. If this is the case, drilling through the flagpole and tripod and pushing a screw through should help secure it.

Afterwards, scotch taping the tripod's legs to the pole should help increase stability.

, Take a roll of scotch tape and loop around a miniature tripod and an extending flagpole. Tape in loops on both the bottom and the top of the tripod to ensure the best stability. Although your tripod will only need to carry the weight of the phone, the potential distance it will be swung from means it could risk coming loose without the appropriate amount of tape.


Loop the tape around like a coil. This will allow you to create a few layers to further secure the tripod. The legs of the tripod should be placed to wrap around the flagpole and should be taped around each individual leg.
Although this is more expensive than other DIY selfie stick methods, it's easily the most reliable version you can make from home.

, A tripod will already be designed specifically to hold a phone in place. With this in mind, secure the phone to it and fasten it as necessary. When you aim to take your shot, you can manually adjust the tripod angle to suit your selfie taking.


Although certain tripods may work differently based on the specific type and phone you're using, so long as the phone is secured to the tripod, your selfie stick should be relatively safe to use.

, A flagpole is considered the standard option because it's adjustable and meant to hold something on the other side. However, you can tape a tripod to a number of objects, provided they have the length needed to make a selfie with. For instances, you can remove the parasol from an umbrella and replace it with the tripod.Plexiglass poles are good, as you can drill directly into the top and secure a screw to the opening at the bottom of the tripod."

If you turn your head a few degrees to the right or left, your features will appear less flat. Holding the camera slightly higher than your head so that it's pointing down on you will make your eyes look bigger and help you avoid ""pig nose."" Here are a few other ideas for finding a good angle:


Know your ""good side"" and take the photo from that side of your face. It's the side of your face that looks the most balanced and symmetrical.
Angling the camera slightly above yourself and taking a snapshot of your face and chest will highlight your cleavage. Since this position is fairly unnatural, odds are, you already know what the camera will focus on when you take a selfie like this.;
, If you decide to take a selfie to show off a new haircut or a new pair of earrings, make sure that you frame the photo in a way that highlights the new feature that has you so excited.

, A sad face or a frown will not help.


A selfie showing off your new hairstyle, for example, should show your hair from the most flattering angle. On a similar note, a selfie showing off a mustache should show the mustache straight-on, and the same goes for a selfie showing off a new pair of glasses.
You could also take a selfie holding a new item you just bought, or even a food item you're about to eat.

, If you're planning on doing a closeup of your face, consider glamming up one feature while downplaying the others. This works especially well if there is one feature that you are especially pleased with.


For instance, if you love your eyes, play them up with mascara and complementary eye shadow while keeping your complexion and lips fairly natural.
Likewise, if your smile is your most charming feature, keep your cheeks and eyes looking natural while donning a stunningly beautiful lipstick.

, You can't go wrong with smiling! Maybe smiling for the camera—or camera phone, as the case might be—makes you feel a little silly, but taking a random photo of yourself with your phone is a silly enough action in itself. If you're on the serious side, a cool, collected expression could also go over well.


You can play around with different smiles, of course. A closed-mouth coy smile can be just as appropriate and just as flattering as a wide, laughing grin. No matter what, a smile is one of the most appreciated and charming expressions you can wear.
It can be hard to make sure your expression looks authentic. One way to make it look more real is to try to capture yourself when you're feeling an emotion. Try taking a selfie while you're watching a movie that's making you genuinely laugh, or right after you find out some shocking news.

, If you want to show off a great new outfit or a fabulous figure after a diet, you will need to stand in front of a full-length mirror to capture your body from head to toe. In this instance, your face is no longer the focus of the photo.


Take full body shots in a clutter-free space. The photo should focus completely on your figure, not on random objects in the background.
You can appear more slender by slightly cocking your hip to the same side you are holding your camera in. Your opposite shoulder should come forward a bit, and your free arm should either dangle to your side or your free hand can rest on your hip. The chest should lean forward naturally, and the legs should be crossed at the ankle., Do not add too many filters at a time. You can take a picture of yourself as the outside world always sees you, but taking a snapshot of yourself with bedhead or minimal makeup can give the illusion that you're giving your social media followers a glimpse at the “real you.” This can be both interesting and sexy.


If your just-out-of-bed look is more of a nightmare than a dream, however, you can straighten up a little. Even light makeup can give the impression that you are showing your “natural” face, especially if you tend to wear much more makeup than what you put on for your selfie.

, If you decide to take a selfie of your feet after you slip on a great new pair of shoes, angle the camera so that your leg appears slender as it leads up to your foot.


Aim the camera straight down. The edge of the frame should land somewhere on your thighs, fairly close to your hips. This angle makes your legs look as long as possible.

, There are certain selfie poses that became wildly popular and are now well past their prime. You can still contribute your own examples to the mix, but do it with a little self-awareness so people know you're in on the joke. Notable choices include the infamous ""duck face,"" muscle flexing, pretending to be asleep, or pretending to be caught off guard by someone else.


The duck face is a combination of puckered lips and wide eyes, originally made famous by Snookie and friends. Do it at your own risk!
Taking a selfie and pretending that someone else took it is hard to pull off. There will be some clue in your posture or actions that will give you away and open you up to criticism. If you do it with a slight smile or a wink, people will realize it's an intentional setup.

, Having a solid light source is an essential part of taking any kind of photograph, and selfies are no different. If you try to take a selfie in a dimly-lit room or one with harsh fluorescent lighting, it won't turn out the way you want it to. Natural light is the most flattering kind, so try to take your selfie near a window or outdoors. Keep these factors in mind when you shoot:


Keep the sun or other light source in front of you, a bit above eye level, for the most flattering shot. The light will brighten and soften your features, rather than casting harsh shadows across your face. If it's off to the side or behind you, your features could appear shadowy or distorted.
Consider using a thin curtain to diffuse sunlight or a single light source. It makes the light softer and more flattering. It will give the impression of smoother, softer facial lines so that your smile appears more attractive.
Natural light renders colors more faithfully than artificial light, but you can use artificial light to fill shadows. If you don't have the best lighting, most modern digital cameras have some automatic color correction to make up for it.
Don't use your flash if you can help it. It'll create a forehead glare, distort your appearance and possibly give your selfie the redeye effect.

, Many cell phones have two cameras: one in the back, and one in the front. Instead of using the camera in the front to take selfies, use the one in the back. The back camera takes higher-resolution pictures than the front camera, which will end up taking a blurrier selfie. You'll have to turn the phone around, and you won't be able to see your face as you take the picture, but it's worth the trouble to use the back camera.

, The picture will appear in reverse, your camera will be visible, and you're likely to end up with a strange glare. Plus, your selfie could appear distorted, since mirror glass doesn't always reflect back a perfectly accurate image. Stretch out your arm, use your wrist to point the camera toward your face, and snap away. It might take some practice to get it right, but eventually you'll know exactly where to position the camera to make sure it captures your whole face (and never cuts off the top of your head).


The exception would be if you want to take a full-body selfie, since it can be hard to capture more than your head and shoulders without using a mirror.
Practice using both your right and left hand to take selfies. See which one allows you to get the angles you want.

, The best selfies have more than just a face. There's something interesting to look at in the background, too. Whether you take your selfie inside or outdoors, check around you first to see what's going on in the background. Position yourself so that you're in front of the background you want people to see.


Nature always makes a great background. In the spring and summer, you can pose in a small wooded area or near a blossoming bush of flowers if you need a quick and easy backdrop. For fall, capture the color of the changing leaves in the background, and in winter, capture the majesty of ice and snow.
If nature is not your thing, you could stay indoors and take a selfie in your room. Tidy things up first, though. You could also display something interesting in the background as long as it is not distracting. For instance, if you love to read, then a bookcase or stack of books would be a good backdrop. A movie poster with a lot of different people on it could be distracting, however.

, The standard culprits include younger siblings, crying children, and dogs taking a bathroom break on the lawn behind you. Before you snap your selfie, take a quick look around to make sure that no one and nothing is lurking in the shadows, waiting to ruin your moment.


Of course, if a photo-bomber still manages to sneak into your selfie, you can always retake the photo after the intrusion leaves. Just make sure to check the background thoroughly before you upload your newest selfie.
Sometimes photo-bombers actually add to the selfie! Don't discount a picture just because it has your little sister in it. Her goofy face juxtaposed with your serious one could make it that much more interesting a picture.
If you do not want to re-take your selfie, you can always remove the photo-bomber using an image manipulation program, or just crop your image using your smartphone's built-in image editing features.

, The first requirement of a selfie is that you have be in it, but there's no rule that says you have to be alone! Grab some friends, siblings, your dog, and other people to take a picture with you. The picture won't be as controlled, but it'll be visually interesting and fun for other people to look at and share.This is a good way to take a selfie in public if you're self-conscious about taking a picture of just yourself.
The more people in the picture, the better when it comes to sharing! If you have a group of friends instead of just one or two, the picture is likely to get passed around and liked by more people.

, Most people who take selfies also happen to have an app on their phones that can add interesting dimension through the use of color and light filters. Not every filter is right for every selfie, so play around with different options before settling on the best one.









The simplest filters are “black and white” and “sepia."" Even if you don't have an app installed on your phone, you probably have these features.
Other popular filters include those that make the photo look vintage, creepy, romantic, or darker. Feel free to test them all out and see which ones go best with your photo.

, If you have photo editing software, you can also touch up any blemishes or flaws on the selfie before uploading it to a social media account. You can cut out parts of the background, resize the photo so it frames your face differently, change the way the light looks, and so on. Many of these edits can be made on your phone without using an app, but you might want to look into the dozens of apps available for this purpose.


That said, you should use photo editing sparingly. If you cannot make your edits look completely natural, err on the side of caution and delete the changes rather than posting an obvious fake.

, Share your selfie on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram for all your friends to see. In most cases you can add a caption to describe what's happening in the picture, but you might want to just let it speak for itself.


When you upload a selfie, own it! Pretending that you were taking a picture of something else and your face just happened to be there, won't fool anyone, so be proud to show off your lovely face.
Be aware that some people find selfies annoying, and you might draw some negative comments. If your online albums end up full of selfies, you might want to consider diversifying.
Be sure to leave the types of comments you want to see on other people's selfies. The more ""likes"" and shares you give others, the more you'll get.

, Selfies have really taken off in the past few years, and it's fun to participate in selfie-related trends. What selfie trends are filling up your feed? Don't be shy about uploading some pictures of your own, too. Here are a few popular ones:


Throwback Thursdays: Every Thursday, people post pictures of themselves from an earlier time. See if you can dig up a selfie from childhood, or simply post one from last week!
From Where I Stand: This hashtag was created by people who wanted to share poignant shots from their own perspectives. Take a picture of your feet as you stand in a country you're visiting for the first time, on the beach, on a cracked city sidewalk or anywhere else you want to share.Feminist Selfie: This hashtag started trending on Twitter and really took off. It's about being proud to post your picture even if you aren't stereotypically gorgeous. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.
Hair Smile: This one's all about showing off your hair. If you consider it to be your greatest asset, take a selfie featuring your hair instead of your smile.

, There are some places that should be completely off-limits to selfies, like funerals or the scene of an accident. Most situations like this are pretty common sense, but as a general rule, ask yourself if taking a selfie in a given situation could upset or offend people who see it. If the answer is “yes,"" save your selfie for another time.Funerals, weddings, and other major occasions are off limits. If you are at an event meant to focus on or celebrate another human being, put down your smart phone and step out of the limelight.
Similarly, if you are at a memorial site, keep the phone in your pocket. Don't take selfies at a memorial or statue, especially if a tragic event took place there once before.

Tape a cassette case onto a flagpole.,
Measure out the width of your cellphone.,
Glue dish sponges on either side of the cassette case.,
Add popsicle sticks beneath the sponges for a phone support.,
Put your phone between the sponges.,
Secure your phone with tape.",How to Make a Selfie Stick2," If you want something truly DIY, scotch tape a flagpole to an empty cassette case. you don't use anymore. Loop two coils of tape around the top and bottom of the case respectively, and wrap them around a flagpole. To create a wedged angle to better aim your camera with, place a length of sponge behind the top of the case and the pole. This will aim the selfie stick downwards, making it easier to catch yourself in the photo.


Alternatively, you can buy a specifically made cellphone holder. They are adjustable and will offer you a greater degree of security if you're worried about your phone being damaged.Although cassette cases may be harder to find now than they used to be, you can usually scrounge them up at used music shops or yard sales. Some electronics stores may have them in stock as well.

, In order to know how far you should space sponges apart to secure your phone, you'll need to know how wide your phone is. Measure your phone, and measure the space between sponges to be approximately 9/10ths of that width. This will give the phone some squeeze factor to help further secure it., Glue two dish sponges face up on the case on either end of it. Leave an area in the middle of the case front to squeeze in your phone. While you're making this, it's recommended you have your phone at hand to fit test it as you go. The sponges should fit snugly enough to keep the phone in place.

, Gluing some popsicle sticks across the bottoms of the sponges will give your phone a foundation to rest upon. This is recommended if you don't think the sponges are holding your phone in snugly enough.


Placing an extra popsicle stick's width from under the phone as support is a good idea, as it helps keep the phone in place if it somehow becomes dislodged from the sponges.

, If you have given a snug mount of space to squeeze your phone into, your phone should can be secured simply between the sponges. Push apart the sponge foam slightly with your fingers, and slide the phone down in a steady motion.

, When you're finished the basic steps, scotch tape around the sponge and pole until you think the stick is suitable for outside use. This will maximize the security and help keep the phone from falling out unexpectedly.


To be safe, cover the top and bottom ends with tape. Because scotch tape is clear, it won't have a significant impact if the tape covers the camera, so long as the tape itself is relatively clear of lint and dust.

Tape your phone to a stick.,
Add a wedge to the top for an angle.,
Make sure the grip doesn't cover the camera.Whichever type of selfie stick you decide to make, you should make sure the stick doesn't obscure the camera in any way.,
Look up new ideas online.Like anything DIY, there is a vibrant community online dedicated to inventing new types of selfie stick.",How to Make a Selfie Stick3," For a very quick selfie stick, you can tape your phone directly to a pole or stick. Run tape around the phone and secure it to the stick. Make sure the tape doesn't cross over the camera itself or the phone button. When you're done taking your selfie, carefully undo the tape from the phone and wipe away the adhesive. If you want to improvise selfie sticks, it's helpful to keep a roll of tape on you.


It should be noted that a quick selfie stick is not a good idea if your phone is expensive and you're worried about possibly damaging it.

, Placing a length of sponge behind the top half of your phone and taping it to the stick as such will give you a slight angle to better take a picture from.

, This includes making sure the phone is placed with the camera toward you.

, If none of the ideas here interest you, rest assured you can find dozens more elsewhere.


If you find a version you really like, you might message the person who made it and ask him for tips on how to make it. Chances are the creator will have made some improvements to the published design i the time since and will be able to throw you a few pointers.

Store your selfie stick.",How to Make a Selfie Stick4," Downloading an app will help stabilize the camera and automate some of a photographer's tasks, such as timing and framing.


Camera 360 is a good app to download if you're in the habit of taking selfies.

, Because the perceived weight will increase the farther out your extend the pole, it's a good idea to limit the reach at a few feet in front of you.


Most impromptu DIY selfie sticks (such as those made from actual sticks) aren't adjustable per se, but you can draw the camera closer by holding the stick further up its length.
Adjust the angle of the selfie stick to your liking while you're at it. Make sure the camera is level when you take a picture.

, Because you'll still need to press the button to make it work, it is preferable that your phone have a timer function. If this is the case, you should set it for 5-10 seconds. This will give you enough time to get into a natural position after pressing the button.


Alternatively, you can use a secondary stick (such as a conductor's wand) to press the button.
Make sure the phone camera is evenly levelled before you take a picture.

, For some DIY selfie sticks, you may want to disassemble it as soon as you've achieved your perfect shot. With others, like a flagpole setup, you should place them somewhere where excess pressure won't be placed on any part of it. Remove the phone when you're done taking a photo and retract the pole as much as you can.


Putting a selfie stick in a closet is a good call, as closets tend to have a lot of vertical space available.

This helps both mountain peaks and foregrounds to stay in focus.Aim for an aperture setting between f/11 and f/16.
Every camera is different. Consult your instructions manual to figure out how to change the settings on your camera.;
, Many people's instinct is to use the widest lens possible when shooting mountains. However, this is not necessary. A very wide lens avoids focusing on one mountain, which can fail to capture a mountain's size. This can also magnify the foreground over the mountain itself. Go for narrower lenses when shooting mountains.You can always experiment. If you're curious to see what a wide shot would look like, use a wider lens and then take a few shots with a narrower lens.

, Adjust your camera's polarizer between shots. Play around and experiment a little, opting to shoot the same scene through different lenses. This way, at the end of the day, you will have multiple pictures to choose from.If you know photoshop, it's easy to blend two exposures together to get the image you want.

, A small, lightweight tripod is necessary for the best mountain shots. You do not have to use it for every shot you take, but it can help steady the camera. Bring a tripod with you on a hike if you're going to be shooting mountains.Make sure the tripod is adjustable so you can shoot mountains from different angles.

, Before setting out to shoot mountains, do some basic planning. Check the weather forecast for that day to anticipate any conditions, like overcast skies, that can affect lighting. You should also look up how long a certain hike takes. If you want to shoot a particular mountain at sunset, for example, see how long it will take you to reach that mountain. This way, you can time your hike accordingly., Just before sunrise and sunset are known as the golden hours for mountain photography. They tend to provide the best light, as well as interesting colors and textures. Try to hit one of the golden hours when going out to photograph mountains.You can check online to see when the sun rises and sets in a given area. Try to be around the mountains during these times.
Keep in mind, tall mountain peaks sometimes block out sunrises and sunsets. Try talking to other photographers about the ranges you're photography and ask them about the best peaks to shoot during golden hour.

, Cloudy days do not mean you have to quit and go home. Clouds can add an interesting background. They can also provide a foreground when reflected through water. Experiment when you see clouds by taking some photographs that include them. You may find you like what you see., The one weather condition to avoid is wind. Very windy days will affect your ability to shoot lakes, often found in front of mountains. You will not be able to get any reflection unless the water is still. In general, opt out of shooting on windy days., If you're able to hit a mountain during a sunrise or sunset, you can get an array of colors this way. Sunrises and sunsets provides colors in the sky, which may be reflected in bodies of water or the mountains themselves. For the most colorful imagery, seek out light provide just before morning and just before nightfall., When hiking during the day, stop and notice the sun. Turn 90 degrees from wherever the sun is in the sky. The scene you see will be lighted by what is called side lighting. Shoot whatever scene is here. Side lighting generally solid and crisp lighting for mountain photographs.Experiment with different filters and lenses when shooting scenes using side lighting.
You may not get the exact shot you wanted relying on side lighting, but you may be surprised by some of the stunning images you find.

, If you're looking to convey the shape and form of mountains, opt for back lighting. Back lighting is provided when the sun is directly behind the mountains. This generally emphasizes the mountains themselves rather than the color of the scene. Often, you end up with a silhouette when leaning on backlighting.If you want to shoot with backlighting, aim to be in the mountains just before morning or just before sunset.

, Midday photographs provide overwhelming light as the mountains will be front lit. The color is generally neutral and the texture is not as intricate. Spend the midday hiking to the peaks you want to shoot around nightfall rather than taking pictures., Do not take the same pictures everyone takes. Lots of people shoot big landscapes or popular peaks in a particular range. Try to look for unique imagery. For example, focus your photo on something interesting in the foreground, like a plant, and use that to demonstrate the size of the mountain.Before going to a mountain range, look for amateur photos taken of the range online. You can find these on places like Flickr and Instagram. These will allow you to see what peaks, ranges, and angles have already been extensively photographed.

, A lower angle can make for an interesting perspective. Lower yourself and your tripod to the ground and angle the camera upward to capture a mountain. This can also help you find interesting foregrounds or frames for your photo.For example, you can shoot a mountain range through blades of grass.

, If you're hiking with others, include them in your photographs. This can show those viewing your photos how big the mountains are. Try, for example, photographing a few hikers as they approach a large mountain."

, Do you want the person to hold a snowball, or have a rainbow scarf on? Inside, get all the props you need. If the prop is made out of snow, make it outside instead. Also, you may need to have more than one of an object in case one breaks or doesn't work out.

, In the snow, light blues, whites, and grays look very cool and stand for winter. if you are going for a more dramatic look, use a bold color such as black, red, or green. Wear the color you chose in a shirt or jacket. Layer up your clothes for warmth in the chilly air and for a more capturing look. Jeans work best for pants, mostly dark denim will be eye-catching in the photo. Fashion boots or warm moccasins give the outfit a bold look also, if you're planning on taking a picture that is including the feet.

, For a girl, have her wear her hair in loose curls, as curls give off the impression of mystery and cuteness. For guys, have them wet their hair and let it air dry, as this style give soft the impression of being relaxed and happy. Take a snowball and crush it gently over the hairstyle to get the snow caught in the hair for a sweet but dramatic look and feel.

, Use light silvers and blues to create a smokey winter look. To finish off the eyes, add light glitter. Use a dark pink to swirl around on the cheekbones to make them look flushed. Add a light pink glittery lip gloss.

, Make sure that the camera can zoom in and out, and capture the person face. Clean the lens though thoroughly with lens cleaner. Take some test photos and make sure the battery is fully charged.

Resist the temptation to change the lens on the beach.",How to Use a Camera at a Beach," Since heat, humidity and dirt are notoriously dangerous for precision electro-mechanical devices like cameras, a hot, sandy beach is its natural enemy. If there are two or more cameras available from which to choose, leave the expensive one at home.;
, If it has been a while since last use, review the camera manual and reacquaint yourself with it by taking some test photos in conditions expected for the beach day, if possible. When done, carefully pack the camera for the day.

, ASA) setting, if offered. A low speed or ISO number (50 - 200) is usually provides the best results for portraits, bright light and direct sunlight photography; while indoor and sports (fast motion) photography often have better results with faster speeds offered by 200 to 400 ISO range and up. Many ""point and shoot"" digital cameras however, render unsatisfactory graininess or muddied color results when the ISO is set for values approaching 400 and greater. A film camera's ISO is usually set to match (or approximate) the ISO rating of the film purchased. This can be done manually; or in some cases automatically, depending on the camera's ability to detect a film that has its ISO value encoded on the canister. Typically, the film buyer specifies the ISO of the film desired at the time of purchase - as dictated by its intended use. Film is available in ISO ranges from as low as 50 to over 1000.

, Simply stated, white balance has to do with the tint or ""warmth"" or temperature of the light in the photo. Many cameras have selectable settings that consist of an icon for Sun, Clouds, Fluorescent, Incandescent and other light source types. Do not confuse these icons with those that represent portrait (often a bust), close up (often a flower), distant (often a mountain), night (often stars), etc. Select the setting that best matches the shooting conditions. A mismatch will result in images that have either a slightly blue or pink tint to them. If unsure, ""AWB"" (or automatic white balance) is a good choice. While this is not the ""end of the world"" an outdoor image on a hot sunny day can suggest a colder day if a ""blue"" tint is present. Experimentation with both the ISO and white balance settings is suggested for your particular camera before setting out.

, While sand is a danger, the dust created by disturbing it blows everywhere and is difficult to see and control. Sand particles can lodge between moving parts, preventing operation. It is important to keep any protective lens cover on the lens until ready to shoot. Interchangeable lenses should have covers on both ends when not mounted on the camera. The build up of dust however, is insidious. It is very difficult to remove, and often results in scratching surfaces, including glass optics (lens). Once an optic is scratched, it cannot be repaired. Scratches nearly invisible to the naked eye capture light and can show up prominently in (all) pictures. If using a camera that supports the use of filters, installing such a filter is highly recommended. An inexpensive ""sunlight"" or ""UV"" filter will impact the image the least, but provide relatively cheap protection to the expensive lens optics. These filters should be the outer-most if other filters are used at the same time.

, Many camera bodies are black or dark in color. Wrapping the camera in a white or light colored cloth or towel will reflect the sun's light and resulting heat away from the camera. If packed in a thick, light colored towel, the packing will provide protection from thermal shock. This results in a more desirable slow warming of the camera and lens. A camera will be at or near ""room"" temperature (or less if the car's air conditioner is directed at it) during the trip to the beach. Upon getting out of the car, the temperature could be 30 degrees or more warmer. A rapid temperature and humidity change can cause condensation to form in the camera and lens, if left unwrapped. This condensation can have undesirable effects on (all) pictures. Furthermore, this moisture can cause oxidation and bacteria growth wherever it accumulates, and can only be removed professionally.

, Bring a strobe light or flash unit if not built-in. Use the flash outdoors; doing so will help bring out details that become hidden in the dark shadows that often accompany photos taken in direct sunlight. The flash also allows photos to be taken with the sun behind the subject, instead of trying to keep it behind the photographer, illuminating the subject.

, Enable the flash only if there is not enough light to capture the image successfully. Doing this prevents a list of problems including ""red eye"" in people (and bright eyes in pets), large dark shadows cast behind the object or person, overly bright areas and unnatural colors.

, With the lens off the camera body, sand, dust and humidity have a huge, gaping entryway into the camera. Don't do it, as it's not worth the risk. Particles that find their way on to the surface of the sensor will show up as dark spots in the same place on every picture. Removing the particles could result in permanent damage to the sensor. It is far better to select a single lens before leaving home and install on the camera. Otherwise, change lenses only when protected inside a building or under suitable cover.

Relax.,
Connect with the camera.,
Put your best face forward.,
Smile with your eyes.,
Elongate your torso and angle body: The classic model s pose is to arrange your body at a 45 degree angle to the camera with one foot in front of the other and one shoulder closer to the camera than the other.,
Create space with arms and legs.,
Keep your chin down.,
Find your light: If you are outdoors, always make sure you're facing the sun.,
Keep your eyes open!,
Always keep your mouth slightly open.,
Remember to practice, practice, practice!",How to Take a Self Portrait2," This may sound very simple but the number one way a great photo opportunity is ruined is with unnatural body mechanics or facial expressions. It may be difficult to be at ease when your body feels awkward and out of place, but for now your first step is to take a deep breath and notice any areas of your body where there may be tension and let go!

, It is very important to start becoming aware of the camera and the placement of your body in front of it. Most people who are photogenic like being photographed and this comes across in their pictures. Don't be scared of the camera's lens. Pretend it's a friend, lover, parent, or anything else that will help you get the desired look you want! Be sure to have plenty of photographs taken of you so that you can practice connecting and being in front of the camera.

, Determine the most flattering angles in your face and memorize them. To do this, stand in front of a mirror, and find the most symmetrical side of your face. Full frontal face pictures can be harsh, so when taking a photo, present three-quarters of your face to the camera. This brings out the angles in your face and softens the overall look.

, This is a commonly used term in the modeling world. Your eyes speak volumes in photos. A simple smile with a dead eye can have bad results. You never want to look tired or uninterested in your pictures. To smile with the eyes, tighten the muscles in your upper cheek and lower eyelid. Imagine your eye is actually making a smiley face! It may be difficult at first but practice in front of a mirror with a piece of paper covering your mouth. Your eyes should turn up a bit at the outer corners and a twinkling effect will result.

, With hips squared, turn your upper body straight toward the camera, creating a slight twist in the torso. Pretend there is a string connected to the top of your head, and it is pulling you upward and taller. Suck in your belly without drawing air into your torso and position your arms on your hips or down to your sides with a little space between your body. These movements together will give the illusion of a much thinner waist.

, Look at fashion magazines and notice how the models are posed. When it comes to posing your body, symmetry is out. Asymmetrical poses are much more interesting. By bending your arms and legs you can create interesting lines that draw the viewer of a photograph directly into you. If your background is busy the focus will be on you, and if it is simple, lines will create complexity. Practice with many poses; bend your arm and place a hand on your hip while your other arm hangs naturally by your side; bend one arm upwards so that your hand is holding your shoulder; place both hands on your hip with one shoulder raised and the other lowered; place both arms behind your back, elbows out, with one shoulder raised; or pull your elbows in, place your hands on the lower back, arch your back with one leg bent and the other elongated in front of the other (this pose is great for a silhouette shot!).

, Pull your head forward a bit, which will lengthen your neck. Then tilt your head down slightly and try to position yourself so that the camera is a little above your eye level. This not only hides a double chin fairly well, but also opens up the eyes to the camera

, If the sun is behind you, your face will be in shadow and can turn flat in pictures. If you have a wider face make sure the sun or light is shining brightest on the cheek opposite the camera. If you have a fairly thin face, make sure the sun or light is shining on the cheek closest to the camera lens.

, This is not always easy to do. If it is very bright outside or you are in a group shot and there are a lot of distractions, one trick is to keep your eyes closed while the photographer is preparing to take the shot. If there is a count down keep them shut until you hear the number 2. At 3, open your eyes but not too wide. Remember to either smile with your eyes (which can be hard to do with just one second preparation) or keep them fairly relaxed but engaged for the shot.

, You can bring your teeth together in a gentle bite, or your lips can slightly touch but never purse your lips shut, as this will cause them to flatten. Keeping your mouth slightly open will relax the jaw for a natural look.

, Taking a good photo is not an accident. If you learn the basics of posing you will take great shots. It is possible to learn to be photogenic!

Similarly, large and small buildings can both provide dramatic material for architectural photography. You may want to take pictures of the most photographed buildings in the world, such as the Louvre or the Empire State Building. But there are many other kinds of buildings that will also make excellent subjects. Take a picture of the smallest house in your city, or a building with daring and unusual architectural design.;
, Be aware of any restrictions that there might be in photographing your chosen building. Taking pictures in a public place (from a sidewalk, for example) typically does not have any restrictions. Going into someone’s home or walking onto private property, however, can potentially have limitations. You may need to obtain permission to take photographs if you are on private property, although if a private space is open to the public, it can technically be counted as public and therefore open to photographs. Keep in mind that these rights may not hold for locations outside of the United States, so you will want to be aware of legalities when taking pictures elsewhere.When taking pictures of federal buildings in the U.S., you may rouse the attention of security guards who may tell you not to take pictures. You do, in fact, have every right to take pictures of federal buildings from public spaces, including sidewalks, plazas, parks and streets.If you are taking pictures in a building of worship, such as a church, synagogue or mosque, respect the customs and procedures that are observed here.

, If the building is a historical or cultural landmark, there should be a staff person who can tell you more about the building. They may also be able to point out fascinating features of the building that are meaningful to the building’s significance. If the building is abandoned, use photography to capture the spirit of the building and to help the viewer understand the building’s previous glory.In the case of an abandoned building, be sensitive to conservation efforts as well as your own safety. There may be groups trying to save part or all of the building, so leaving loose boards, materials and other elements in their original places is important. Similarly, with peeling paint, exposed wiring or rotting floors, abandoned buildings can be dangerous places. Be attentive to these safety concerns.

,



Use a point-and-shoot camera or phone camera. Using a point-and-shoot or phone camera can be convenient but can also be limiting in terms of the versatility of your photography. Point-and-shoots are certainly cheaper (although prices for DSLRs are becoming more reasonable). They are lighter and easier to carry. They have a fixed lens, so you do not need to worry about deciding which lens to use or carry around extra lenses. Everything in a picture taken with this camera will be in focus. It can also be difficult to capture light, especially if you are taking nighttime photos.Use a higher-end DSLR camera. A DSLR (digital single lens reflex) camera will give you more flexibility and adaptability in taking photos of buildings. You can manipulate focal and lighting settings. They have interchangeable lenses and have faster shutter speeds. They are also more durable, intended to withstand variable weather conditions (shooting in cold, heat, dusty conditions, etc.), and they should last longer than a point-and-shoot camera. These cameras range widely in terms of price, with cheaper DSLRs costing $200-$500 and high-end ones costing $10,000 or more.Try a 35mm film camera. While traditional 35mm film cameras are less common today, passionate photographers may still choose to go with this medium. Film cameras have better control over lighting, and color and light work better together. There can also be a grainy feel to 35mm photographs, which can add a more natural, textural feel to the pictures.One of the downsides to 35mm film is the added expense of working with 35mm film: you need to buy film, typically with 24 or 36 exposures per roll, and you need to develop this film.

,



Use a wide angle lens. A wide angle lens has a short focal length and has a wider field of view that is more akin to how the human eye sees. A wide angle lens can capture immense landscapes and buildings within one photograph. They often, however, often result in distorted photos, with vertical lines bending somewhat so that the full image is accommodated within the frame.Use a fisheye lens. A fisheye lens provides a broad view, from 180 to 220 degrees. The result is extreme distortion of the image. This type of lens does not represent a building accurately but instead provides a dramatic, artistic effect, particularly in pictures of buildings with symmetrical lines (one half of the picture mirrored in the other half of the picture).Use a telephoto lens. Telephoto lenses allow you to take pictures from far away. These can be useful when taking pictures of buildings because you can be far enough away to see the entire building in the picture, but then you can zoom in to frame up the photo. This type of lens can also help minimize distortion and bending of straight lines.Telephoto lenses are highly sensitive to movement, so using a tripod or somehow stabilizing the camera is necessary. Try a tilt-shift lens. Tilt-shift lenses allow the photographer to manipulate depth of field and perspective. These lenses move the lens’ center of perspective away from the actual center. These can allow for wider photos, such as panoramas, and straighten vertical lines that often can get distorted in pictures of tall subjects like buildings. Tilt-shift lenses can also create interesting miniaturizing effects. These lenses can be very expensive ($2,000-$3,000), and similar effects can be reproduced in some photo editing software programs., This will ensure that your picture does not turn out shaky or blurry. This is particularly helpful when taking a photo in low light or at night. If you don’t have a tripod available, you can steady yourself against a tree or lamppost, or prop your camera on a ledge to keep it still.

, Be prepared with other equipment you might need. Depending on the location, you may find you’ll need other things to help you take good pictures. If you are taking pictures of an abandoned building, for example, bring a flashlight. A good backpack or camera case can keep your equipment organized and easily accessible while keeping your hands free to handle your camera.

, The direction of the sunlight will impact the quality of your photo. For example, glaring midday sun does little to highlight the nooks and crannies that will make for an interesting picture. It is much better to take shots in the early morning where natural light is crisp and clear, or in the early evening, when it's warm and filling. In both instances, the light is also coming in from the side, which highlights the building to its greatest advantage. Early morning may also be ideal because there tend to be fewer people walking around.Consult an aerial map of the building to determine when the sun might be hitting the building. Will the sun cast a shadow of another building on your building?, Quite often, impressive-looking buildings are lit up like Christmas trees at night, and look like they'll make for an amazing photo. Beware of leaving your camera's settings on automatic as the low light and high levels of contrast can sometimes ruin your shot. Bright lights will become halos, while dark sections will be black as night. Instead, adjust your ISO settings to a night-time mode. Set a nice long exposure time to allow more light into the camera (you can use the camera’s self-timer or a cable release to ensure minimal shakiness or blurring). Any lights will look bolder and brighter with a longer exposure time, so practice getting this right.

, Photographing during different times of year can produce different portraits of the building. The building may be snow-covered in winter or be surrounded by leafy trees in the summer. Likewise, it may be hard to see the top of a building on a foggy or really rainy day. But that might also be an effect you’d like to capture.

, Is it under construction or renovation? Is there a major event being held there on the same day you’ll be there? These can be disruptive moments for your photograph, but they can also potentially lend special dimensions to your photograph; they allow you to capture some of the unique history of the building that may not be conveyed in a typical photo of that building.

, Take some time to find unique angles and details before settling on the precise focus of your photograph.

, When taking pictures of tall buildings, you may find yourself tilting your camera upwards in order to fit the entire building in the frame. This can create a distorted image in which the building looks like it is falling away. You can correct this by taking the picture from further away, using a different camera lens like a wide angle lens, or fixing the distortion with digital editing software. Alternatively, focus your picture on a different element of the building; a dramatic and creative photograph of a building does not always mean that you need the entire building in the picture., Take a look at what surrounds the building: this may be the sky, other buildings, trees, or water. There may also be parked cars, garbage cans, trash, birds or pedestrians surrounding your building. Determine if these elements add to or detract from the overall sense you want to convey. Be patient and wait until pedestrians pass by to snap the photo if you don’t want them in your photo.

, Use surrounding elements to create frames that draw attention to the main subject of your photo: the building itself. Framing can add depth and add context to your photograph. Some of the elements you can use to create a frame include windows, doorways, fences, the center of a staircase, tree branches, or people., The depth of field is the area in your picture that will be in focus. A shallow depth of field means that objects in the foreground will be in focus and the background will be blurry. A deep depth of field will have both foreground and background in focus. Depth of field is controlled by your camera’s aperture. Set your camera to AV (aperture priority) mode. AV mode will allow you to control the aperture (how much light is let into the lens) while the camera automatically adjusts other controls. Having a larger depth of field – or having a longer range of what is in focus in your photograph – can improve a photograph of architectural structures. Set a small aperture (f/16 or above) to ensure the foreground and background are all in sharp focus., Take close-ups of details such as gargoyles, interesting patterns on the building’s wall, or other unique features of the building. These can convey the building’s character in a way that wider shots cannot.

, Highlighting corners or lines that mirror each other can emphasize a building’s architectural uniqueness and design.

, If you’re taking a picture near water, you might consider taking a picture of the building reflected in the water. Calm water will make a sharper reflection.

, Use natural sunlight to light your building. Taking pictures in the early morning or late afternoon removes the harshness of midday sun and provides softer lighting to illuminate a building’s details.

, Checking the white balance is a way to prevent color contrasts that are off. Cameras often reproduce whites with tinges of green, blue or orange. DSLRs usually have a white balance function in the controls; check your manual to locate and use the white balance function. White balance can also often be corrected with photo editing software., Adjusting the lighting can correct problems of overexposure (too much light in a photo, resulting in a washed-out look) or underexposure (not enough light, resulting in a photo that is too dark). DSLRs typically have light meter functionality that will help correct the exposure. Point your camera at the main subject of your picture and make sure your light meter reading is at 0. If the meter is reading to the left of 0, it will be underexposed. If the meter is reading to the right of 0, it will be overexposed.

, A histogram is a feature on DSLR cameras that displays a mathematical graph of a photograph’s exposure. It depicts every pixel’s luminosity (brightness) and is useful in determining if areas of a photograph are too bright or too dark. This is especially helpful when taking pictures of a white building., Wait until birds or pedestrians have left the frame before snapping the photo. Check to see you have the correct aperture, focus, and exposure. Take a deep breath and press the shutter.

, Take a look on the camera’s LCD screen to review your photo. Make minor adjustments to settings, lighting, and framing, and take several more photos, adjusting each one.

, Write down the camera settings and lighting conditions in a small notebook so you can see how different settings produce different effects.

, Some of the most amazing photos are more happenstance than anything.

, Be ruthless about choosing your top photos and put the remaining photos in another folder on your computer. Pick the photos that tell the most interesting stories, have the best lighting and composition, and convey something important about the building.

, Using photo editing software can correct minor imperfections in the photograph, such as eliminating a pedestrian who sneaked into the shot or a construction crane in the background that was unavoidable. Unwanted distortion can be fixed – to a certain degree – with photo editing software. This can help straighten some lines that are bent, pulling the picture straight to create truer vertical or horizontal lines. While PhotoShop is the standard and most well-known image editing software, it can be prohibitively expensive. There are cheaper – and even free – options to digitally alter images. Searching the internet for “free photo editing software” brings up a number of options and recommendations.

, Ask other photographers to critique your photos. Even asking the average person can give you insightful feedback about the elements that are the most noticeable or most moving about a photograph.

Watch for the sun or the light reflections.,
Give your subject some time to move away from the fence.,
Incorporate the fence into the photograph.",How to Take Photographs Through a Fence," This will help you with ensuring that you focus on the right piece of the frame.;
, For the most part, you will be shooting outdoors and you will be shooting with a longer lens anyway. Use that to help get rid of the fence.

, Real close. If you can get a quarter inch away without scratching your lens, that's great. Be sure that your lens hood is off. What this does is, since the fence is so very close to the camera, for all intents and purposes, it is ignored.

, This will give your camera even less to try to focus on (even though it should be on manual focus).

, This will throw the fence even further out of focus. This is also where the manual focus helps a lot because your depth of field is greatly reduced.

, No matter how much you minimize the fence, if there is a reflection it will make it more visible.

, If you are fighting the fence and your camera, and the subject is only a few feet away, the fence may very well win. Give him some space.

, Forget about getting rid of it, use it.

Get a window seat near the front of the plane.,

Don't take your photos at an angle to the window.,
Keep your lens close but not touching the window; vibration from the airplane will blur your shots.

,
Take your photos quickly, the plane is moving quickly, if you see something that you find interesting, it may be out of view the time you raise your camera.

,
Don't use flash photography.,
Use a standard lens or a zoom lens, like a 35mm to 105mm.,
Don't use a polarization filter.",How to Take Good Photos from an Airplane Window Seat," Go online and book your seat in advance. Some web-pages will show you were the seats are located. Try to get a window seat in front of the wing. This works well on larger planes, most smaller commercial planes reserve first-class and business class near the front. This area creates a smoother ride and you don't have the airplane wing to block your view. Another reason to have a seat before the wing section, is that the heat shimmer from the engines will affect the quality of the photo.;
, Take your camera on the plane. Don't put it in the overhead area, this makes it difficult to get the camera since you are at a window seat and will have to ask two people to move. Tell the person next to you take you will be taking some photos as the plane is taking off. This will let the person know that you may be blocking his view for a few seconds. Set the speed of the camera at a high shutter speed, around 500 hundreds of a second. This will stop blurring of the photo. Set the ASA to around 250 to 400.

, This will increase optical distortion from the windows. Stop reflection coming back into your pictures as noted below. It helps if you have a digital camera, so you can see your results and make adjustments during the beginning or landing part of the trip.

,,, This will just reflect your flash back into your photo and it may scare your fellow passengers who may be first-time passengers on a plane flight.

, This will allow you to get photos of planes on the tarmac and other photos as the plane takes off.

, Plastic airplane windows will show odd patterns. When plastic is under strain it causes polarization of the material which will interfere with your polarizing filter. Without causing alarm, try shielding cabin lights and other window lights with a dark coat or cloth.

Show people, and show them doing something.,
Get close.,
Take scenery pictures.,
Remember to take photos of the people you are traveling with.,
Take advantage of the time of day.,
Use flash to fill in in bright light and to reduce blur if the subject matter is moving.,
Do not use digital zoom.",How to Take Better Travel Photographs," Pack as little as possible. Don't carry a camera bag that looks like one. If you're in a crime-ridden area, put the camera strap over your right shoulder, under your jacket, with the lens facing toward your body. It's a quick flip of your wrist to bring the camera to your eye with your right hand.;
, If the Taj Mahal is underwhelming but the street vendors are fascinating to you, shoot the street vendors. You can always get clichéd tourist shots at the postcard shop, so don't bother with those. Be adventurous. Approach locals and ask to photograph them as they go about their business If you are told not to take photos then acknowledge their request and looks elsewhere, however most people will agree, and you'll end up with better photos and maybe a good story.

, Carrying bricks, playing stickball in the street, selling fish, having dinner... anything that lets a viewer in on how they live their lives. Don't ask people to pose! Let your subjects go about doing their thing rather than stopping them to pose. Occasional portraits in front of spectacular views are great, but more than a few of them are tedious for the subject and your audience.

, If your pictures are not turning out very well, you may want to get closer to the subject. Use your zoom, or better yet your feet, to fill the frame with your subject and eliminate anything in the background that is distracting. But don't get too close either, as this may lead to distortion.

, Taking vacation photos is all about making memories. You will definitely want to remember how beautiful the area was that you visited. If you see something that you consider remarkable, such as a sunset, flowers, mountains, etc., take a photo.

, Include them in photos with scenery; such as near the ocean, or near places you went; such as a restaurant or museum. That way, you not only remember where you went, but who went with you.

, The light is most interesting in the hours just after sunrise and just before sunset, and at those times even mundane scenes can look magical. Plan some of your landscape and street-scene photography for those hours. Also, bad weather and the shadows or mist it creates can lead to good photos, so put on the raincoat and go explore.

, The use of a flash will freeze movement so if a picture repeatedly turns out blurry, try using the flash. Even if it's not necessarily needed, it usually helps decrease the blur. Similarly, if it is a sunny day, the faces of your subjects may even so be in shadow. Using the flash will get the light where you need it and keep the faces from being overwhelmed by the sun in the background.

, On digital cameras, you have both 'Optical Zoom' and 'Digital Zoom.' It is common when you take photos with digital zoom that the result is a blurry picture. Optical Zoom makes a clearer photo. Look at the settings of your camera and turn off Digital Zoom.

Look for cloud formations, birds on a wire, bugs and bees, wet smooth pebbles in shallow water, pine cones, and sea shells. Develop your eye for finding these snippets of nature, and viewing them as photography subjects. As a beginner, it's easier to focus on the technical details of photography when you're not awed by a beautiful landscape.


With the advent of good cell phone cameras, you don't need to wait until you've grabbed all your equipment. Get in the habit of taking nature photos while on a walk, in the grocery store produce aisle, or watching rain or snow fall from inside your house.;
, Crouch down to get a new perspective on these little living things. Photographs from above tend only to capture the details that we see in everyday encounters.

, The default approach is to photograph an object head-on. There's nothing wrong with this perspective, but any subject has many more to offer. Here are a few examples of ways to photograph a stand of trees:


Lying on the ground beneath them, looking up.
From the hill above it, looking down.
Sitting on an opposite tree branch, level with the canopy.
Close up on the bark, a leaf, a stem, or any of the hundreds of parts that make up a tree.
Focused on one of these objects, but capturing a soft background behind it.

, From water to blowing grass to brambles, nature has an infinite variety of visual textures. Contrast a sharp flower with a splashing raindrop, or the fluffiness of a cumulus cloud with a flat sheet of ice.

, The same location can look radically different at different times of day. The best time for nature photography is usually just after sunrise or just after sunset. The natural atmospheric lighting at these times provide warmth and shadows, for a varied and balanced composition. Closer to mid-day, the light tends to be too flat and bright.


Flowers are best photographed on days with no wind and a slightly overcast sky, to avoid shadows of the petals obscuring the colorful blooms.
Low levels of light generally make natural scenes appear more authentic. They enhance contrast as well, which leads to great photographs. Picture the crisp difference between dark water and a light sky.

, When you're composing an image with a clear horizon line or another dividing horizontal line, never place it at the center of the photograph. Position it either ⅓ of the distance from the top of the photo, or ⅓ from the bottom.

, Hone your composition skills to find that perspective that draws the viewer in. There are many ways to accomplish this goal:

Tree branches or bushes as foreground objects, framing the subject.
A curving path or road drawing the viewer in.
Diagonal lines from anything at all — a rock formation, a bent tree.
A gradation of color.

, Nature scenes that contain a clamor of color are easy to find, and can certainly be beautiful. But challenge yourself to find moments of a single, vivid color on a plain backdrop. A bare, Burnt Umber bush over snow; the Early Spring Green of just-open leaves on white birch; the simple Forest Green of a canopy framed by sky.

, Take your time to locate the right shot, especially when photographing animals. Roam your surroundings with your feet and your eyes, and wait patiently and quietly for opportunity and inspiration to strike.

, A macro lens is invaluable for extreme close-up subjects, such as insects, worms, and snails. If you want to take distance shots, such as when you're trying to capture elusive animal subjects, find a zoom lens with at least an 80–100mm focal length.

, If you have a camera with adjustable controls, learn what a change in aperture does to the focus point of the photo. Do you want a picture from here to infinity? A smaller aperture with a higher f/stop (f8 to f22) will result in a deep depth of field (DOF). For a shallow depth of field, with a single focal point on a blurred background, set the camera to a larger opening with a lower f/stop (f2 to f5.6).


The depth of field is defined as the depth of the zone in which the image is razor sharp.

, If you can slow down the shutter, you can capture wonderful cascading waterfalls, or waves crashing against rocks. Place your camera on a sturdy tripod or flat surface before shooting, or the moving subject will blur.

, To photograph birds and other speedy subjects without blurring, increase the shutter speed. Because the shutter only has a moment to let in light, you'll also need a fast lens, meaning a lens that opens extra wide to let in enough light in that moment.


The flash feature will also help ""freeze"" a single moment, though it may startle your subject.

You’ll fully capture the ambience of the atmosphere and stage lights paint your frame with great colors.;
, If you’re using Canon’s Speedlite 580EX II, zoom it to between 70 and 105mm. Zooming the flash will concentrate the light towards the center of your frame. It will allow ambient light to vignette your frame while still freezing the motion at the center. Power setting will vary depending on zoom, so try a few different manual power settings and see what works best for you, each time.

, Go wide. Wide-angle lenses work the best for this type of shot. It will allow you to capture more of the room and more of the mood. Canon’s EF 17-40mm f4.0 L lens is a safe bet every time. If you don’t have anything wider than the 24-70mm, use it at 24mm and you can compensate by zooming your flash a bit further (105mm, probably.) A 17-40 will let you grab some really awesome overhead shots that almost look aerial.

, The Canon 5d has a native ISO of 200. Whatever your body’s native ISO, leave your camera at this ISO. It will significantly reduce grain. It’s pretty likely that you are shooting in low light. You are probably thinking that a lower ISO will make your pictures underexposed. It won’t, for two reasons. First, you are dragging the shutter already. If it’s too dark and not capturing ambiance, mood, and movement, then drag it s’more. You’re flash frozen subject should be appropriately lit by your on-camera flash. If they’re too dark, add power, duh. If for some reason you can’t make sense out of the low ISO, then bump it up. Most of your event photographs will only ever be digitally reproduced, so ISO isn’t as crucial.

, If it’s a party or music you’re shooting, the stage lights will often create a very different ambient light levels on your crowd and your artist. Most of the time, you can adjust your aperture to compensate for the difference. Usually, this translates into a higher aperture when shooting your artists. Remember, you have total control over exposure here. It's recommended to use a starting aperture of about 6.3-8.0, adjusting a couple of stops up for brighter areas.

, The effect can be created with either rear-curtain or front-curtain sync. Essentially, your exposure will be the same. For beginners, the difference between the two is pretty simple: Rear curtain sync fires the flash the moment before the curtain closes, at the end of the exposure. Front curtain sync fires the flash the moment the curtain opens, at the beginning of the exposure. Unless you’re shooting sports and panning all the time, you probably won’t notice much of a difference in the photos, either way. Basically it breaks down like this, front-curtain sync shows where the subject is going, and rear curtain sync shows where the subject came from. Sometimes, you get a clearer freeze with rear-curtain since no ambient light is recorded after the flash.

, Not only will it keep the picture steady. Don’t use a tripod; shoot handheld. Everything you’ve been told says to use a tripod for slow shutter speeds to reduce movement. Ignore it: we want the movement. Shake things up a bit, literally, by moving your camera during exposures. This works best with front curtain sync.

, If there is too much blur and movement, speed up the shutter. If you’re event is huge and depth of field is too short, increase aperture, slow down the shutter, increase flash power, and back flash zoom to 70mm. If the ambience is right, but the subject is too dark or light, adjust flash power.

, Work the photos. Use a batch edit or Light room to figure out a nice baseline edit that you can streamline. Most of the time, you can ignore dirt on your sensors picked up at higher apertures. It will only add to the “grit” of these images. Experiment to find a unique style of editing these images that sets you apart from everyone else that read this tutorial.

, Consider a tighter frame. Using a wide-angle lens often leaves a lot of dead space creeping around the edges of your frame. Try cropping in different aspect ratios to see if they enhance the images. Don’t be afraid to crop some and leave others. An image will look best one way or the other; exploit that.

Understand photometers that measure lux and foot-candles.,
Know how to interpret illuminance units.,
Understand lumens and luminance.,
Measure beam and field angle.",How to Measure Light Intensity1," These are units that describe the intensity of light on a surface, or illuminance. Photometers that measure this are usually what people are looking for when they want to set up a photo shoot, or test whether a room is too bright or too dim.Some light meters are specialized for different types of lighting. For instance, one may produce more accurate results when used to measure sodium lighting.You can even purchase a ""light meter"" in some mobile device's app stores. Check the reviews first, as some of these apps are inaccurate.
Lux is the modern accepted standard, but some devices still measure in foot-candles. Use this online calculator to convert between them.;
, Here are a few examples of typical illuminance measurements, to help you determine whether your lighting needs to change:Most office work is comfortably done at 250 – 500 lux (23–46 foot-candles).
Supermarkets or work areas that involve drawing or other detail work are typically illuminated to 750 – 1,000 lux (70–93 foot-candles). The upper end of this range is equivalent to an indoor area next to a window on a clear, sunny day.

, If a light bulb or lamp label or advertisement mentions ""lumens,"" it is describing how much total energy is emitted as visible light, a concept called luminance. Here's what you need to know:


The ""initial lumens"" describes how much light will be given off once the light is stabilized. This takes about 100 hours of use for fluorescent and HID lights.The ""mean lumens"" or ""rated lumens"" tells you the estimated average luminance over the life span of the device. The actual luminance will be brighter than this early on, and become dimmer than this near the end of the light source's recommended lifespan.
To figure out how many lumens you need, use the steps above to determine how many foot candles of illuminance you want in a room, and multiply by the square footage of the room.Aim higher than the result for rooms with dark walls, and aim lower for rooms with other major light sources.

, Flashlights and other devices that emit light in a certain direction can be described using these two additional terms.You can find these yourself using a photometer that measures lux or foot-candles, and with a straightedge and protractor:


Hold the photometer directly in the path of the brightest beam. Move it around until you find the spot with the maximum intensity (illuminance).
Staying the same distance from the light source, move the photometer in one direction, until the light intensity drops to 50% of the maximum level. Use a taut string or other straightedge to mark the line from the light source to this point.
Walk in the other direction until you find the spot on the opposite side of the beam with 50% maximum illumination. Mark a new line from this spot.
Use a protractor to measure the angle between your two lines. This is the ""beam angle,"" and describes the angle illuminated brightly by the light source.
To find the field angle, repeat these steps, but mark the two spots where the beam intensity reaches 10% of the maximum level.

Calculate the efficiency.",How to Measure Light Intensity2," This device is easy to construct at home, after a little shopping trip. Called a ""Joly photometer"" after its inventory, it can be used to measure the relative intensity of two light sources. With a little knowledge of physics, supplied below, you'll be able to discover which of your light bulbs gives off more light, as well as which are most efficient for the amount of power they use.



Relative' measurements won't give you a result in terms of units. You'll know exactly how two light intensities compare, but won't be able to relate them to a third intensity without repeating the experiment.

, Purchase a package of paraffin wax from a hardware store or grocery store, and pull out one ¼ pound (0.55 kilogram) slab. Using a sharp knife, cut the slab into two equal pieces.


Cut through the slab slowly to avoid breaking off pieces., Tear off a sheet of aluminum foil and lay it on top of one of the two paraffin pieces, completely covering the top surface. Lay the second piece of paraffin on top of the aluminum.

, For this device to work, we'll need to stand it on its end, so the foil sheet in the middle is vertical. If your wax doesn't stand up on its own, you can keep it horizontal for now. Just remember that the box you'll be constructing should be designed to hold the wax in position vertically.


You can use two rubber bands to hold the block together.Put one near the top of the sandwich and the other near the bottom.

, Choose a box just large enough to hold your wax block. The packaging that the wax was sold in often works well. Use a ruler and pair of scissors to cut three windows into the box:


Cut two windows on opposite sides, exactly the same size. Each window will view a different half of the paraffin, once the block is placed inside.
Cut a third window of any size in the front of the box. This should be centered, so you can view both halves of the paraffin block, on either side of the aluminum foil.

, Keep the aluminum foil between the two paraffin wax blocks, in a vertical position. You may need to use tape, small pieces of cardboard, or both to keep the wax blocks upright and parallel with the opposing windowed sides, and touching the foil between them.If the box is open at the top, cover it with another piece of cardboard or other light-blocking barrier.

, Choose one of the light sources you'll be comparing as a ""standard candle,"" which you'll use as a baseline for intensity. If you're comparing more than two light sources, you'll use this light source during every comparison.

, Place two light bulbs, LEDs, or other light sources on a flat surface in a straight line. The distance between them should be significantly larger than the width of the box you made.

, The photometer should be at the exact same height as the light sources, so that the lights completely illuminate the wax blocks through the side windows. Remember, the light sources should be a fair distance away, to allow even illumination.

, Close any window, shades, or blinds so that only light from the test light sources is hitting the blocks.

, Move the photometer toward the side with the dimmer wax. Watch through the front window as you adjust the position of the box, and stop when both wax blocks appear equally bright.

, Use measuring tape to measure the distance from the aluminum foil to your chosen ""reference point"" light source. We'll call this d1. Write this down, then measure the distance from the aluminum foil to the light source on the opposite side, d2.


You can measure the distance using any unit, but make sure not to mix them. For example, if your measurement is in feet and inches, convert the result to use inches only.

, The brightness of the blocks decreases with the square of the distance, because we're measuring the amount of light that falls onto a two dimensional area, but the light is radiating through three dimensional volume.In other words, when a light source moves twice as far away (x2), the light it produces is spread out across four times the area (x22). We can write the brightness as ""I / d2

I is the intensity and d is the distance, just like we used them in previous steps,
Technically, what we described as brightness is referred to as illuminance in this context., When both blocks appear equally bright, their ""illuminance"" is equal. We can write this as a formula, then rearrange it to solve for I2, or the relative intensity of the second light source:I1/d12 = I2/d22

I2 = I1(d22/d12)
Since we're only measuring the relative intensity, or how they compare, we can just say I1 = 1. This will make our formula simple: I2 = d22/d12

For example, let's say the distance d1 to our reference point light source is 2 feet (0.6 meters), and that the distance d2 to our second light source is 5 feet (1.5 meters):
I2 = 52/22 = 25/4 = 6.25
The second light source has an intensity 6.25 times greater than the first light source.

, If you are using light bulbs with a wattage marked on them, such as ""60W"" for ""60 watts,"" that's how much electrical power the light bulb uses. Divide the relative intensity of the bulb by this power to find out how efficient the bulb is, relative to your other light sources. For example:


A 60 watt bulb with a relative intensity of 6 has a relative efficiency of 6/60 = 0.1.
A 40 watt bulb with a relative intensity of 1 has a relative efficiency of 1/40 = 0.025.
Since 0.1 / 0.025 = 4, the 60W bulb is four times as efficient at turning electrical power into light. Note that it will still use more power than the 40W bulb, and thus cost you more money; efficiency just tells you how much ""bang for your buck"" you get.

"
"
Remember that the amount of light that hits the film (or digital chip) depends on 3 variables:


Shutter speed (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 meaning one fifth, one tenth...one thousandth of a second)
Aperture.,
Know that those listed numbers roughly correspond to doubling or halving the amount of light.,
Understand that the aperture stops change by a factor of square root of 2 (1.4) because they indicate the diameter of the lens opening, and increasing the diameter by 1.4 actually doubles the opening area, thus doubling the amount of light that goes in.,
Now to figure out the lighting conditions:


Set the shutter speed roughly equal to the ISO

for example, if your film is ISO 400, set the shutter to ~400 (300-500 is fine)


The aperture can then be set based on the following rule:

Bright sunny day - f 16
Heavy overcast - f 8
Sunset/thick shade - f 4
Brightly lit indoors with some window light - f 2 (e.g.,
Photograph.,
Extrapolate.,
Study and remember.",How to Photograph  Without a Light Meter," (F1, f1.4, f2, f2.8, f4, f5.6, f8, f11, f16, f22)
Film (chip) sensitivity, aka ISO setting (50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200);
,


Each time you double or half the light, it's called 'one stop' down or up.
Note that the ISO and speed numbers correspondingly change by a factor of 2.

, That's probably the only difficult part to remember.


Try to remember the basic setting, which, incidentally, on antique cameras, are usually the only ones that are marked: 32, 22, 16, 11, 8, 5.6, 4, 2.8, 2, 1.4 (...1, 0.7, 0.5...). A step to the right in the list means double the light (one stop down).

, on the bus)
Brightly lit indoors, no windows (or nighttime) - f 1




You can guess all other conditions by filling in between. For example,

, Say you want to shoot on a sunny day with some clouds. When a cloud hits the sun, bring down one 'stop' - from f16 to f11. Or you want to photograph a back-lit face on a a bright day, you treat it like it's light shadow - we said thick shadow is f4, bring it one stop up - to f 5.6. Dimly lit indoors at night? Two stops down from f1 to f 0.5.

, One more thing - from the above rules, you can conjure other combinations of speed and aperture that will give the same amount of light.


For example, ISO 400, shutter 400, f 16 (sunny 16) = ISO 400, shutter 800, f 11.
Also equal to ISO 400, shutter 200, f 22. What you're doing is bring shutter one stop up (halve the speed, i.e. double the exposure duration from one 400th to one 200th of a second) and the aperture one stop down (halve the area of the opening)
Most lenses do not have f 0.5. And only expensive lenses even have 1.4 and f 2. In a way, those values can be considered hypothetical.
So, for example you have film with ISO 400, and you are shooting a not very brightly lit room. According to the above, f=0.5. say your widest aperture (lowest stop) is f4. there are 6 stops from f4 to f 0.5 (2.8, 2, 1.4, 1, 0.7, 0.5). Therefore, you need to reduce the speed 6 stops from 400 to 6 : 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6. You probably need a tripod, because this is 1/6th of a second and the picture will be blurry due to handshake.

, It takes a while to get used to these calculations but remember that film is very forgiving - you can mess it up by 3 stops and chances are it'll still be a usable photo, especially with black and white film. And over time you will develop an intuitive feel for the required settings, just like you know to put a sweater on a fall day.

Obtain a container in which to thin the paint.,
Add the paint to the container.,
Add the paint thinner to the paint.,
Mix and evaluate the paint.",How to Make Paint Thinner1,"


When thinning paint, you must have a small bowl or other object in which you can place it to combine with the thinning agent. As oil-based paints can be difficult to remove, this object ideally should not be something that you still need for other purposes. Once it's been used to thin paint, the object will remain in your arsenal of painting supplies.;
,


Place the amount of paint which you wish to be thinned in the container. For best results, remove any large chunks of dried paint and discard them in an old paint can or trash bag.

,


Turpentine or mineral spirits are the primary agents to use when it comes to thinning oil-based paints. Evaluate how much paint was placed in the container, and add the turpentine in a ratio of approximately 3 parts paint to 1 part thinner.

,


Once you have added the turpentine, carefully combine the two products. A stir-stick of just about any kind works effectively to mix the paint and turpentine together. As with the container, don't use anything to stir the paint that you will need to use for any other purpose after this job is finished.
Use a paintbrush to apply a small amount of the paint to the surface onto which it will be applied. If the paint still appears too thick, continue adding small amounts of turpentine until the paint reaches the desired consistency.

"
Find a container in which you can thin the paint.,
Add the paint to the container.,
Add the paint thinner.,
Mix and evaluate the paint.",How to Make Paint Thinner2,"


Like oil-based paints, you must first find a container where the water-based paint and thinner can be combined. While water-based paints can be removed with slightly less difficulty than oil-based paints, this container should still be one that you will not miss in the event that it is ruined.

,


Remove any dried pieces of paint from the liquid you pour into the mixing container.

,


As suggested by the name, you will use water to thin water based paints. Add clean, cool water in a ratio of approximately 3 parts paint to 1 part water for best results.

,


Use a stir stick to mix the paint and water. You can then use a paintbrush to apply to it a wall or canvas. As described previously, if the paint is still too thick, continue adding water is small amounts, testing the paint after each addition.

,, Take the cloth, put it over the lens, and tie a rubber band around it to keep it in place. Make sure it looks good by checking what it looks like through your viewfinder before you take the picture.

, Liquid laundry detergent will usually glow blue; in black and white photography it looks interesting too. Glow-in-the-dark markers or makeup would be neat. Try toothpaste, anything that you can think of that might look neat, pour it on an object or even try stuff out on a willing model.

, You've probably seen them, the whole picture's black and white but certain things like a dress, or a rose or whatever. Take a picture that would be interesting to hand tint, get it printed on matte photo paper in black and white, then buy a cheap watercolor set (from dollar tree or somewhere) and pick parts out to paint. The more water you use the more see through the paint on the pictures will be, the less water the more the paint will be darker. You can even get a dual tone effect by picking one color to paint over the whole pick, but make sure its watery.

, Pick a scene to photograph, get up close, and make sure you don't get the edges of the TV. You can mess with the settings on the TV for more interesting effects. You might want to try this one on digital, because of weird lighting. You don't want an over exposed image.

, Use mirrors for reflections.

, Then take sharpies to it and have fun! It's even better when you over-expose the picture.

Save empty bottles.,
Combine 1 cup of salt, 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water in a large bowl.Mix 1 cup each of salt, flour and water into a bowl and mix them together thoroughly.,
Drizzle food colouring into the bowl.,
Stir the mix thoroughly.,
Funnel mix into empty bottle.,
Wash tools before making another colour.",How to Make Non Toxic Paint for Kids1," Before creating paint, it's wise to have bottles already set aside to store it with. Ketchup bottles are a perfect choice in this regard, as they're designed to be easily squirtable. When you've used up the original contents, clean it out thoroughly with water and dish soap. Dry out the insides with a wash cloth and set it aside while you get your paint prepared.;
, This should result in a fluid, colourless paste.


You can do this by placing the cups in a large Ziploc bag and shaking thoroughly, although stirring in a bowl will yield the most control., Once your flour paste has been stirred sufficiently, add a food colouring that matches the colour of paint you want. Continue adding food colouring and mixing it in until the paste is as colourful as you want the paint to be.


Alternatively, you can do this by pouring the mixture into different bags filled with food colouring. This way, you can make your essential mixture in one go, and create several different types of paint in the process., Once everything has been added to your satisfaction, mix it all together thoroughly with a spatula until the homemade paint is consistent throughout. Paint that hasn't been stirred properly will clump and be harder to properly use.

, Take a funnel and insert the nozzle inside one of your empty ketchup bottles. Next, take the bowl with your flour paste turned paint and pour it in slowly. Rake in the remnants into the funnel with a spatula if there's a slowdown effect with the trickle.

, When you've finished making a particular colour of paint, wash out the funnel and other supplies thoroughly before moving onto the next colour. That way, you will minimize the risk of the leftover traces affecting the current paint you're making.

Collect chalk pieces.Pastel chalk is another cheap way of making paint at home.,
Soak chalk in a muffin tray.A muffin tray will give you a secure place to make and extract your egg chalk paint from.,
Grind chalk into powder.With a hammer, you can gently crush the soggy chalk sticks into a powder.,
Flash pasteurize eggs.Raw eggs will make someone sick if they're ingested.,
Separate egg yolk from egg whites.Because the egg whites will do nothing for your paint's consistency, you should physically remove the yolks from the rest of the egg before adding them to the paint.

,
Add an egg yolk to each chalked space on the muffin tray.Place yolk in each of the tray slots you're making paint in.,
Let it sit for a few minutes.,
Use the paint.",How to Make Non Toxic Paint for Kids2," Although you'll need to add egg yolks to get the paint-like texture, the chalk sticks you choose will determine the paint's colour. Because you'll be grinding them up, aim to use older and broken pieces of chalk. Getting multiple colours in your collection will give you a variety of colour to paint with.


Cheaper chalk will result in a smoother texture, but you won't get the same vibrant colours as you would with higher-end chalk material.

, Fill up a muffin slot with water for each colour of paint you're going to be using. Place a stick of chalk in each of these slots and let them sit for 15 minutes.


You can add extra sticks of chalk into the same tray slots if you want a richer colour, just so long as they're of the same colour.

, After they've soaked, they will be much easier to break apart and shouldn't put up much of a fight. Stir the mix when you're done to disperse the colour throughout each tray slot.


You can also mush the chalk together with your bare hands if the chalk sticks have grown soggy enough.

, In order for the egg paint to be truly non-toxic, you'll need to pasteurize them first. Crack the eggs you're making paint with and cook on high temperature for a couple of minutes. The yolk needs to reach a temperature of 138 degrees Fahrenheit.


Don't overcook them to the point of scrambling. If your eggs scramble, you won't be able to use them in your paint.
You can skip out on pasteurizing the eggs, but raw eggs will make children very sick if they're ingested. You can skip this if the children are old enough to know not to eat it.

,, This will give the mix a thicker texture. Continue to add bits of yolk to the mix until there's a paint-like consistency to the mix.


The egg will provide a glossy finish once the paint dries.

, Once you've added your proper proportions to your mix, it's a good idea to give it a few minutes to properly settle. This will allow the mix time for the colours and yolky consistency to disperse properly.

, Once you've allowed the paint to sit, it should be ready to use. Leave the yolk in, but make sure that solid chunks of yolk aren't caught by your brush. You can paint directly out of the muffin tray.

Add glow powder or paint.Because you're making the paint yourself, you can add whatever you'd like.,
Use old candies for food colouring.If candies are old and stale, they can still be used as a food colouring agent in your paint.,
Make a natural watercolour paint with fresh flowers.Fresh, brightly coloured flowers will colour water if they're submerged.",How to Make Non Toxic Paint for Kids3," Glow powder is a great way to add zest to your concoction. Add some glow powder to the flour paste and stir it consistently. You won't need a lot of glow paint in order to get the ""glow in the dark"" effect it's supposed to create.


Keep in mind that certain types of glow powder are toxic if ingested. It may be best to avoid this if the paint is going to be used by young children.

, Put the soft candies you want to melt in the microwave for a few seconds, take them out and add them to your flour paste. Keep candies categorized according to their colour, as mixing random candies together will result in a murky or unpredictable colour.


By making the food colouring from actual foods, you'll get some of the original food's scent as well. This is especially true in the case of Starbursts.

, If there's a colourful garden nearby, go out and pick some bright flowers. Place each colour of flower in a Ziploc bag, and add enough water to cover the flower. Once the flowers and water are in the bag, roll them over slowly with a rolling pin. This will squeeze the colour out of the flower and into the water. From there, you'll have a functional watercolour paint to work with.


Make sure that the bags aren't too full. Half a cup of water per Ziploc bag should be enough. Having too much water will both dilute the paint and risk your bag popping when you roll it over with a pin.

Mix yellow and blue.,
Vary the proportions to change the hue.,
Change the value with black or white.",How to Make Green1," Green is a secondary color. To create it, you'll need to combine equal parts of blue and yellow, both of which are primary colors.""Primary"" colors exist on their own and cannot be created by mixing other colors. The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, but you only need blue and yellow to create green.
""Secondary"" colors are colors obtained through the mixture of two primary colors. Green is a secondary color because it's made from blue and yellow. The other two secondary colors are orange and violet.;
, Pure green is a mixture of pure yellow and pure blue, but if you add more blue or more yellow, you'll create a different slightly different hue of green.


The two most basic variations are ""blue green"" and ""yellow green,"" which are also referred to as ""tertiary"" colors since they fall between secondary and primary colors on the color wheel.

Blue green is made with two parts blue and one part yellow. You could also create it by mixing equal parts of green and blue.
Yellow green is made with two parts yellow and one part blue. You could also create it by mixing equal parts of green and yellow.



, If you want to lighten green without changing its hue, you'll need to add white. If you want to darken green, you need to add black.


Light shades are referred to as ""tints"" and dark shades are called ""shades.""

Expect realistic results.",How to Make Non Toxic Paint for Kids4," Once your paint is prepared, you should squirt a dab of paint onto a piece of cardboard next to the piece of paper that's being painted on. This will offer the painter easy access to the paint without having to dip into the bottle each time.


Alternatively, you can unscrew the cap of the ketchup bottle and dip in the paintbrush directly. You should only dip in the tip. This will offer the painter the best-possible control when using the paint.

, Your homemade paint may be used in much the same way as a watercolour paint. Take the brush and paint in strokes. Because the paint is coloured only by food colouring, you should apply lots of paint in order to get a decent colour.


Learning how to paint is a process that can take years by certain definitions. However, for the sake of simple homemade kid's paint, fun should be emphasized over technique.

, Give the paint at least a couple of hours to dry entirely.

, Put the artwork in the microwave for 3-5 seconds. Make sure not to put it in for much longer than that, as you may risk damaging or even burning the artwork.

, Homemade products can sometimes be as good as the real thing. In the case of non-toxic kid's paint, however, you won't get the same vibrant colours you could expect from store bought paint. Nonetheless, this won't stop the homemade concoction from being a lot of fun.

Blend together yellow and blue paint.,
Vary the proportions.,
Experiment with different yellows and blues.,
Try mixing different greens.,
Change the value using black or white.",How to Make Green2," Pour equal amounts of pure blue and pure yellow into a paint dish or onto a paint palette. Use a palette knife to thoroughly mix the colors together.


When mixed, the original colors should produce a pure green.
To get a more accurate idea of how this green looks, use a paint brush to apply a small amount to some scrap practice paper.

, Depending on what you want to paint, pure green may not be the best green for your purposes. The simplest way to change the hue will be to add more yellow or more blue.


Adding more yellow will create a warmer green, and adding more blue will produce a cooler green.
When attempting to change the hue, make small changes until you find the hue you want. Gradually building the correct hue is easier and less wasteful than overcompensating and needing to work back toward the center from the extreme.

, Clear room on your palette and try mixing together several different hues of yellow and blue. Doing so should produce different hues of green.Pure yellow and pure blue will create pure green, but if these starting colors have been altered prior to being mixed, the resulting color will also change. For instance, combining golden yellow with a standard blue may result in a more muted, brownish green. On the other hand, mixing standard yellow with a light blue could produce a light green.
The best way learn which blues and yellows produce which greens is through experimentation. Pick a few different hues of yellow and blue. Combine equal parts of one yellow and one blue hue, working through each possible combination. Mark down your results for future reference., If you have two hues of green that are close to the color you need but don't quite match it, you can try mixing the two hues together to achieve the desired color.


Since all greens contain elements of blue and yellow, mixing them should result in new hues of green.
You can also mix green together with different yellows or different blues to change the hue more dramatically.

, Once you find the right hue, you can alter the value without changing the hue itself using black or white paint.


Add white paint to create a lighter tint or black paint to create a darker shade.
Regardless of which value you desire, you should add the white or black paint in small amounts. If you add too much, you can easily create a value that is far too light or far too dark.

Set up several sample dishes.,
Add green food dye to one dish.,
Mix equal parts of blue and yellow in another dish.,
Combine green and black in another dish.,
Experiment with other combinations.",How to Make Green3," There's more than one way to create green icing, and there's also more than one hue of green you can create. Experimenting with several options at once will allow you to learn more about the process.


You need at least four sample dishes, but the experiment will be more effective if you set up six to twelve dishes.
Place 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of white icing in each dish. Keep track of how much icing you use since it has an impact on the amount of food coloring you'll need.
Obtain at least four food dye colors: one green, one yellow, one blue, and one black. You can also get other hues of green, yellow, or blue to experiment with.
Paste, powder, and gel food dyes are designed for coloring frosting, so work with these types of dyes when possible since they should not alter the consistency of the frosting. Liquid dyes only work when you need very light tints; otherwise, the amount of liquid food coloring you'll need to create a vibrant hue will change the consistency of the frosting., Dip a toothpick into the green food coloring, then dunk the same toothpick into one dish of white frosting to transfer the dye. Mix until evenly blended.


To get an accurate idea of the color you've created, you'll need to continue mixing until you can no longer see any remaining green streaks in the frosting.
The type of green dye you use will affect the color of the icing. For instance, using ""moss green"" dye will create a warmer color than ""kelly green"" dye or ""leaf green"" dye.
The amount of food coloring will affect the shade. Since the icing is white, using small amounts of green dye will produce very light, pastel greens. More dye will create more vibrant values.

, Use separate, clean toothpicks to transfer equal parts of blue food dye and yellow food dye to the second dish of white icing. Mix until evenly combined.


After mixing the blue and yellow food coloring, you should produce green frosting.
The exact hue will vary based on the hues of yellow and blue you start with. Similarly, the value will vary based on how much food coloring you use.

, Create a third dish of green icing by mixing in green dye or equal amounts of blue and yellow dyes, following the same procedure used for the other samples. Add a very small amount of black to this third sample.


After thoroughly mixing in the black food coloring, you should see a darker shade of the original green. The actual hue should remain the same, though.
Since black can have a dramatic impact on the appearance of the color, you should only work with very small amounts of it.

, Use the remaining samples of white icing to experiment with different combinations. Record the dye hues and amounts used in each sample for later reference.


Use guidelines from the dye manufacturer to create different hues or experiment on your own.
Some ideas include:Mix equal parts sky blue and leaf green to create an aqua color.
Create chartreuse using nine parts lemon yellow and one part leaf green.
Combine equal parts leaf green and royal blue, then add a touch of black. This should create a deep jade color.
Mix various amounts of lemon yellow and sky blue to produce a teal or turquoise color.

Gather several samples of clay.,
Combine one blue clay with one yellow clay.,
Work through the remaining combinations.,
Add white to one sample.,
Add translucent clay to another sample.,
Add black to a final sample.",How to Make Green4," At minimum, you should have two blue clays, two yellow clays, one white clay, one transparent clay, and one black clay.


One blue should be slightly warm (with a hint of green) while the other should be slightly cool (with a hint of purple). Similarly, one yellow should be slightly warm (with a hint of orange) and the other should be slightly cool (with a hint of green).
You can use more variations of blue and yellow clay, but starting with two each should provide you with a fairly accurate understanding of how to make your desired hue of green.

, Pinch off equal amounts of the warm blue and the cool yellow. Smash the two pieces together and knead the resulting ball until evenly blended.


Roll, stretch, and knead the ball continuously to blend the colors. When finished, you should no longer see any streaks of blue or yellow in the sample.
The finished color should be a relatively bright green since both the blue and yellow already leaned toward the color green., Combine equal portions of the blue and yellow clays, following the same procedure used to create the first sample of green. Continue until you've worked through all possible combinations.


The warm yellow and cool blue should create a dull green with hints of brown in it.
The warm yellow and warm blue should create a medium-tone, warm green with strong yellow undertones.
The cool yellow and cool blue should create a medium-tone, cool green with strong blue undertones.

, Pick your favorite green hue and duplicate the sample as before. After mixing the green, mix in a small pinch of white.


Blend the white into the green until no streaks remain. The color should look less bright and should also gain a lighter tint. The more white you add, the lighter the tint will be.

, Duplicate the same green used in the previous sample, but do not add any white to it. Instead, mix in a small amount of translucent clay.


Once blended, the translucent clay should make the green appear much less bright without changing the value or hue of the resulting sample.
If you use more translucent clay than green, however, you'll end up with a semi-transparent wash of green instead of an opaque color.

, Create the same green used as the base in your white and translucent experiments. This time, thoroughly mix a very small pinch of black into the green.


After blending the black into the green, the sample should develop a darker shade while remaining the same hue.
In most cases, it won't take much black to dramatically darken the green, so you should only work in very small amounts.

Choose a glow in the dark powder.,
Choose a paint medium.,
Place your phosphorescent powder in a bowl.,
Pour paint into the bowl.,
Use your paint.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Paint1," You can find glow in the dark, or phosphorescent, powders online or at some craft and art supply stores.









The powders come in a variety of colors and particle sizes. Larger particles are brighter, but also make a rougher paint which can create a speckled look. Smaller particles create a smoother paint, but don't glow as brightly.;
, This will be the actual paint that you mix into the phosphorescent powder. If you want your paint to be invisible in light, choose a clear paint, such as an acrylic gel. If you want to see the paint in the light, choose an acrylic or tempera paint in a color you like.









Make sure that your paint medium works with your phosphorescent powder. For example, if you are planning to use a water-based medium, then you will need ""coated glow powder"" also known as ""coated phosphorescent pigment"". For solvent or oil-based mediums, you can use standard or uncollated glow powder.

, You'll want to place 1 part powder to 5 parts paint (or 20% by volume of glow powder to paint medium).








, Gradually pour your paint medium over the powder in your bowl. Carefully stir the mixture. You can add more paint to achieve a thinner consistency.









The powder will not dissolve in the paint, so just stir until the mixture is combined and no lumps remain.

, Most glow in the dark paints should be used immediately. Depending on your powder/medium combination, your new mix may or may not have shelf life. Therefore only mix what you can use within an hour.









If you do want to store your paint, pour it into a sealable container and be sure to stir it well before using it again.

Watch it glow.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Paint2," Using a pair of pliers, break open the end of a non-toxic highlighter. Remove the felt strip from the center and discard the plastic highlighter casing.









Make sure that your highlighter glows under black lights. Test this by writing something on a piece of paper using your highlighter. Then, turn off the lights and hold the black light over it. You should see your test scribbles.

, Place a cup or jar in your sink. Slowly run water through the felt strip so that the yellow highlighter liquid runs into your cup. Turn off the water and stop when the felt is white.









You may need to do this for several highlighters in order to create enough highlighter water.

, Use 1/2 cup of white cornstarch. This will be the basis for your homemade glow in the dark paint.









This mixture will be pretty thin. The ratio should be equal parts cornstarch and highlighter water.

, Carefully pour in 1/2 cup of highlighter water and stir until the cornstarch completely dissolves.








, If you want to change the color of your paint, add a few drops of food coloring and stir. Add more food coloring till you achieve the desired color.









Consider pouring your paint into a few smaller containers. That way, you can create different colors using different food colors.

, This paint is pretty runny, so you may want to let it dry and paint on several layers. Extra layers will make the paint glow seem brighter and last longer.








, Turn off all the lights and make sure to close any blinds or shades. Turn on your UV-A blacklight in order to see your paint glow.

;
, Add just a little blue paint to the mix -- no more than 5-10 % of the total color at first. Mix it in until the color begins to turn a rich, chocolatey brown. If it still looks too orange, mix in just a bit more blue.








, If you would like to darken the color a bit more, add a bit more blue. If it looks too dark, add orange. If you are mixing paints, just use some of the orange paints. If you're drawing, then lightly draw orange over the paint using red and yellow again.

"
Obtain magenta paint.,
Mix the magenta paint with whatever bright blue or turquoise you already own.",How to Make Purple Paint1," The reason mixing red and blue paint doesn't give you the bright purple you would like is that red paint absorbs both green and blue light. Since blue paint absorbs both red and green light, and your eye only senses color in terms of red, green, and blue (the reason we have three primary colors in the first place), that leaves very little red or blue light for your eye to sense, and your brain, which interprets the combinations of colors your eye senses, sees a so-called-purple that is almost black.
Magenta paint on the other hand, since it only absorbs green light, allows plenty of both blue and red light to reach your eye. Combine it with a small amount of blue paint (absorbs both green and red light), or cyan paint (absorbs only red light), and your brain will receive a strong signal from the blue-sensing nerves, a weaker signal from the red-sensing nerves, and will see . . . bright purple!









Magenta is one of the ""subtractive"" primary colors used by graphic designers and printers; the others are yellow and cyan. Look for paint that has the pigment PR122 or PV19 in it, but no PB (blue) or PW (white).
If you're buying craft or poster paint, you can compare the color to the magenta in your computer's printer ink. Just print a sample to take shopping with you.
Because magenta is a primary color, it cannot be made by mixing other colors. Mixing magenta and yellow in various proportions makes a whole range of reds and oranges. Mixing magenta and cyan in different proportions makes a whole range of blues and purples.;
, Any cyan or blue should work fine, as long as it isn't dull or greenish. Start with a very small amount of blue, then add more till you obtain the hue you want.

If you want, you can also use powdered black tempura.
Don't breathe in the powder when crushing the chalk. It is a good idea to wear a mask when crushing the chalk.;
, You do not need much water just enough to get it to the consistency of paint., You can use any color of glitter that you would like, but silver and black looks best because it will look more like moon dust than if you used a colored glitter like gold., Once the glitter is mixed in you have you moon dust paint.

Acrylic retarder;
, You can use the flat side of a painting spatula to apply pressure until you do not feel any “grittiness. Paint pigments sold in arts supply stores usually come in powdered form. Many artists also choose to find alternative pigments based on crushed dried plants or other substances.


Grind the pigment until you do not feel any ""grittiness"" as you apply pressure. Most pigments will break down fairly easily, so just make sure that there are no irregular lumps remaining.If the pigment has come in powdered form, you may not need to grind it unless it is lumpy.

, Before you begin mixing the components together, you should measure and record the quantity of pigment and base used. You may need to make more of a color before you finish a painting or to retouch a painting. You can only do so with consistency if you know how much pigment and acrylic base you used.Acrylic base is essentially paint without pigment. It will usually come in a squeezable tube and the substance itself will appear white. There are several different sorts, such as glossy or matte, and you must determine which type you need for your painting.

, Use the wooden chopstick to mix them thoroughly together, until the pigment is evenly dispersed throughout the acrylic base.

, Read the instructions that came with your acrylic binder because the preferred ratio of base to solution varies from brand to brand.


Some pigments (especially organic ones) have a tendency to float on water. In this case you would substitute alcohol. Make sure you are using a solution appropriate for the pigment.It’s not ideal to mix alcohol into acrylic paints because alcohol dries quickly, causing the paint to also dry quickly. If you are using a pigment that mixes best with alcohol but want the paint to dry more slowly, you can add water after you have mixed the pigment with alcohol.
Too much water or alcohol will dilute the acrylic binder, so be careful.

, Acrylic retarder helps to slow how quickly acrylic paint dries. It’s important to follow the instructions that came with your acrylic retarder. However, a general rule of thumb is that more retarder used, the slower the acrylic paint will dry. You can figure out ratios of your own liking as you become accustomed to its use.


Acrylic retarders are especially necessary if you are attempting to create photorealistic paintings or portraits of a human subject. Colors must be blended together on the canvas to create the contours of complex shapes, but fast-drying acrylics will set before a second color can be added."

, The secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors. The colors that are created when you mix two colors together appear between the primary colors on the color wheel. Therefore, red and blue make purple, yellow and red make orange, and yellow and blue make green.

, The complimentary colors are simply colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. This means that they are of opposite hues in the color model, and should mix to produce a neutral color of white, gray, or black if they are mixed in the proper proportion.

, To create brown, you'll simply have to mix the following complimentary colors:


Mix orange (from yellow and red) with its complimentary color, blue (Method one, steps 1-3)
Mix green (from yellow and blue) with its complimentary color, red (Method two, steps 1-3)
Mix purple (from red and blue) with its complimentary color, yellow (Method three, steps 1-3)

Determine whether your red and blue paint is ""true."",
Mix true blue and red.",How to Make Purple Paint2," The reason that mixing red and blue paints doesn't always end up giving you the purple paint you desire is that every paint is composed of many different colors, not just one. A tube of red paint might have oranges and yellows as well, and a tube of blue paint could have red and yellow pigments. When you mix reds and blues that aren't ""true,"" you end up with a brownish, off-purple result.









Look for red paint that doesn't have yellow or orange undertones, since when these colors are mixed with blue they create the color brown.
Look for blue paint without any yellow or green undertones.
If you aren't sure whether your paint is true, test it out. Pour a little onto a palette and mix it with some white. What undertones do you see? The white helps bring out the true nature of the paint's pigments. The red should come out looking pink, not peach; the blue should look sky-blue rather than sea green.

, Pour equal amounts of red and blue paint onto a palette and use a brush to mix them together to create a rich purple hue.









For a purple color that leans more toward violet, add extra blue paint.

, Adding black paint to purple will deepen the color to a rich, dark purple. Add a little at a time to prevent accidentally going too dark; it's hard to pull back with black paint.

Step one is to define our term.,
Get together a good selection of bright colors, and put them in rainbow order.,
Draw a circle on a piece of paper.,
Try to mix each color using only its two neighboring colors.,
Decide which three colors are the ""dirtiest"" mis-matches.,
Assemble these colors, blue, cyan, yellow, red, and magenta.,
Try to make red by mixing transparent magenta and transparent yellow, changing the proportions as necessary to get as close as you can to a true red.,
Try to make magenta by mixing red and blue.,
Try to make blue by mixing magenta and cyan (aka phthalo), changing the proportions as necessary to get as close as you can to a true blue.,
Try to make cyan by mixing blue and yellow.,
Think about it.,
Consider whether the ""Split Primary"" idea is valid in light of what you have discovered.,
Keep a well-rounded palette.,
Consider your needs.,
Buy several cyans and mix each one with yellow, making various greens; then mix each one with magenta, making blues and purples.,
Buy several magentas and mix each one with yellow, making reds and oranges; then mix each one with cyan, making blues and purples.,
If buying all that paint sound too expensive, try checking online artist forums.",How to Determine Correct Primary Colors," A primary color is a bright color that is useful for mixing other bright colors but cannot itself be made by mixing other colors. Yellow is the perfect example. Try mixing yellow from orange and green, and the result is very ""dirty,"" not yellow at all. And yet we can use yellow with red to mix orange or with turquoise to mix green. This definition provides the rationale for the steps that follow.

, For example, if you have a set of poster paints, arrange them like this: red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, cyan, blue, purple, magenta. Don't include any light, dark, or dull colors. No black, white, gray, brown, light pink, light blue, wine red, hunter green, navy blue, etc. Make sure your colors include all the candidates: yellow, orange, red, magenta, purple, blue, cyan, and green.

, Now paint a sample of each color, arranging them around your circle in rainbow order as determined in step 1. Make sure they go all the way around so that your first and last colors wind up next to each other.

, For example, try to make yellow by mixing orange and green. Try to make green by mixing yellow and turquoise. Continue around the entire circle, painting a sample of each mixture next to the color it's supposed to be.

, The human eye has three types of color-sensing cone cells, which means that for those of us with normal color vision there are three primary colors. Yellow made from mixing orange and green is an obvious ""dirty"" result. The other primary colors may not be as obvious as yellow. In the photo above, which are the two other mixtures that look ""dirtiest"" in comparison to what they are trying to be? Those will be the other two primaries.

, In the exercise above, you should have discovered that magenta, cyan, and yellow are the colors that cannot be mixed and therefore are primary. These are the colors used in photographic and computer printing. Here we will test this trio against the traditional red, yellow, and blue. If you are using artist colors, try transparent quinacridone magenta (PR122) and transparent phthalocyanine blue (PB 15:3 or 15) for magenta and cyan. If you are not using artist colors, that's fine too. Just look for colors that are a good match for the magenta and cyan inks used in printers. You can find color swatches on end flaps of many food boxes, and look for paints to match them.;
, Compare your result to your red paint, and see how well you can match it. Remember, if red is a primary color, you should not be able to make it by mixing other colors. If you can make red, then maybe magenta is the real primary color, not red. And, if magenta is a real primary color, it should work to make both reds and oranges when mixed with yellow, and to make blues and purples when mixed with transparent cyan. Try it!

, Remember, if magenta is primary, you should not be able to mix it from other colors. Compare your result to your magenta paint, and see how well you can match it. Is your mixture dark and dirty looking? That would indicate that magenta is a primary color.

, Compare your result to your blue paint, and see how well you can match it. Remember, if blue is a primary color, you should not be able to make it by mixing other colors. If you can make blue, then maybe cyan is the real primary color, not blue. And, if cyan is a real primary color, it should work to make lots of different greens when mixed with yellow, and to make blues and, yes, even purple, when mixed with magenta. Try it!

, Remember, if cyan is primary, you should not be able to mix it from other colors. Compare your result to your transparent cyan paint, and see how well you can match it. Is your mixture dark and dirty looking? That would indicate that cyan is a primary color.

, If red and blue can be mixed from other colors, and magenta and cyan cannot (or in any case your results are very ""dirty""), the latter two must be the correct primary colors, not the former two, despite what we all were taught in third grade.

, After following the above steps, it should be obvious that if magenta, not red, is the primary color, then it does not make sense to ""split"" our primary by calling magenta ""red with a blue bias"" and keeping red as our ""red with a yellow bias."" Red as a primary color is simply an outdated and invalid idea, since red can be made by mixing magenta and yellow. If we cannot find an ideal magenta, a valid split primary would be two magenta's, one tending toward purple, the other toward red, PV19 and PR122 for example. Similarly, if cyan is the primary color, and not blue, then we should stop calling cyan ""blue with a green bias,"" since blue has nothing to do with it. True blue can be made from cyan and magenta, and is not a primary at all.

, Just because red and blue can be mixed from other colors does not mean you need to throw them away. For example, you may be able to make a brighter orange with red than with magenta, since mixing paints closer to each other in hue gives generally brighter results. Plus, why go to the trouble to mix primaries when you have other colors that are ready to go?

, Having correct primary colors is mainly important for when you need bright colors such as purple, pink, and turquoise. Often bright colors are not needed in fine art paintings, but are more necessary when making craft projects or for children's art projects. In either case, colors you can mix from cyan, magenta, and yellow are most likely going to be bright enough. Because primary colors allow you to paint with only three colors, plus white, they can save you money when it comes to buying paints. On the other hand, keeping red, blue, purple, orange, brown, and black paint around can mean less mixing, which saves you time (and possibly frustration).

, This way you can discover which one is best for mixing the various colors. Try paints with pigments PB15, PB 15.3, etc. Steer clear of paints that include white pigments (PW).

, This way you can discover which one is best for mixing the various colors. You can try paints with pigments PR122 and PV19, for example. Steer clear of paints that include white or blue pigments (PW, PB). This information can be found on the back of most artist colors.

, The best cyan and magenta pigments is a hot topic these days. Using transparent colors will keep your mixtures from looking chalky or muddy.

Sketch your design on scrap paper.,
Shade the areas of your design that you will cut out.,
Make bridges as necessary in your design.,
Simplify complex parts of your design.,
Copy the final design onto cardstock.,
Create multiple boards if doing a design with more than one color.",How to Make a Graffiti Stencil1," If you are particularly artistic, you may decide to use your own design as a basis for your stencil rather than referring to a photograph. Before you outline your design on cardstock, it’s a good idea to flesh out your design and make sure that it would work as a stencil. Draw your design on scrap paper using a pencil so that you will be able to adjust it.

Be aware that if you are just beginning, you may find it easier to use a photograph as the basis for your stencil rather than trying to make a compelling stencil from a freehand drawing.;
, Use a pencil to lightly shade the areas of the design you will be cutting out and spraying. If you are using multiple colors, color your design accordingly using different colored markersWhen you are done, the shaded or colored areas will be the parts of the design that you will cut out and spray paint through. The other areas of your design won't be painted, and will be the color of the wall or canvas that you are working on.

, There are several important factors to consider when fleshing out your design, the most important being the concept of bridges. You may need to make bridges in certain areas of your design to ensure that it will look correct and hold up when you cut out the stencil.The easiest way to understand bridges is to think of the letter O. If you are creating a stencil containing a shape like an O, you may try to cut a black loop out of the paper.
However, if you cut out a loop that goes all the way around, the white middle section of the O will fall away as well as the loop you cut out, leaving you with a large black circle instead of the letter O.
To stop the white middle section from falling away, you have to create bridges in your design, which are vertical sections that connect the space surrounding the O with the white middle part of the O. This will make the black part of the O that you will cut away look like a pair of parenthesis, rather than a black loop.
Look at your design with a critical eye. If you see any sections that need bridges to keep the elements inside the cut out areas intact, erase parts of the shaded in sections to make bridges in the design.

, When you are just beginning making stencils, it can be hard to tell what makes for a good design. Many times, unifying sections of your design looks better than having complex areas that don’t translate as well.

For instance, if you are making a design of a face, you may first make a black outline of the face, then outline each facial feature. A more compelling way to create a face is to shade and cut out a shadow, which extends from the jaw, up the cheeks and over to the mouth, then goes up the side of the face until it reaches the eye.
This shadow that you made not only unites the features and makes a more interesting design, it also adds dimension to the face.

, When you are finished with your design, copy the design onto a piece of cardstock, poster paper or acetate. Shade in the areas of the design you are cutting out, and leave a border of at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) to give the stencil stability., If you are using multiple colors in your design, use as many sheets of cardstock as you have colors in the design.

Create the outline of your design on the exact same spot on each sheet of cardstock, then assign one color to each sheet of cardstock. Use a marker to add the color where it should be on each sheet, so that if you were to overlap them, you would have the full color image.
For instance, say you were making a cherry design with three colors: black, red and green. You would draw the thin outline of the cherry on the same spot on each page of cardstock. On one sheet of cardstock you would use black marker to thicken the outline of the cherry, making bridges as necessary. On another, you would color in the red fruit of the cherry. On the last sheet, you would color in the green stem and leaves.

Choose a high-resolution, high contrast photograph.,
Import the image into a picture-editing program.,
Eliminate the background.,
Adjust the contrast of your image.,
Turn up the brightness on the image.,
Make multiple layers if you are making a design with multiple colors.,
Print your image.",How to Make a Graffiti Stencil2," Another way to make a stencil is to use a pre-existing photograph, which you will edit in a program like Adobe Photoshop, then print and cut to make the stencil. Choose a photograph that has high contrast between lights and darks, and is relatively high quality when blown up.


Try to pick an image that is relatively simple, such as a high-contrast portrait or a piece of fruit. If this is one of the first stencils you are making, avoid highly-detailed images like a cheetah with spots.
Don’t use a copyrighted image. Use either stock photography or a photograph that you took.
Also try to pick an image that is self-contained. For example, instead of choosing a picture of a sprawling landscape, pick out a tree or a flower instead of the whole scene.

, After you choose your image, import it into Photoshop, Gimp, or another editing program that has a setting where you can adjust brightness and contrast. There also are a number of websites designed solely to converting images into graffiti stencils.Photoshop and Gimp require some knowledge of the software, but they give you more control over how the image turns out.
The websites made to convert images into stencil designs are instantaneous, and only require you to drop in the image, which they then make into color separations. However, you end up having less control over how the image turns out than if you hand-tweaked it using a software like Photoshop.

, If you are using an image with a background that you don’t want as part of your stencil, you need to eliminate the background before adjusting your image.


If you are using Photoshop, make the original picture your first layer, then create a copy of it in the second layer by dragging the bar of the first layer into the Create New Layer icon, shaped like a page, at the bottom of the Layers panel. Lock and turn off the visibility of the first layer.
Then outline the image in the second layer you made using the Magic Wand or the Pen tool. Click Select > Inverse, then press delete to eliminate the background.

, Still working on the second layer of your document rather than the original image, convert it to grayscale by clicking Image > Mode > Grayscale, and turn up the contrast settings to 100%.To adjust the contrast in Photoshop, click on Image > Adjustments > Brightness and Contrast, then enter 100% into the contrast box.
If you want to use multiple colors in your design, skip the step of turning your image into grayscale.

, Increase the brightness of the image using the settings until you are happy with the way that the image looks. It should be a two-tone black and white image that looks like a graffiti stencil because of its high contrast.If you are using Photoshop, adjust the brightness by clicking Image > Adjustments > Brightness and Contrast, then turning up the brightness.

, If you are making a design with multiple colors, create as many layers as colors in your design, and assign a color to each layer.After you print your image, use markers to color the place on the design where you want the color to be. Use one color per board, so if they were to be combined together, they would create the multi-color image.

, After you finish adjusting your image, print it out. Then glue the paper using spray adhesive onto a piece of cardstock, poster paper or acetate. Once the paper is glued down, you will be ready to cut out the stencil!Print your image so that there is at least a 2 inch (5.08 cm) border around the design. This will make your stencil more stable when the design is cut out.
To use the spray adhesive, hold the can about a foot from the paper, then spray, moving the can to spray the entire back of the paper. After the back of the paper is coated with spray adhesive, pick it up, flip it over, and lay it flat on the cardstock or poster paper, then use your hand to smooth the paper down.

Cut on top of a cutting board or a piece of cardboard using an X-Acto knife, carefully carving away the more detailed sections of your stencil where you want the paint to be applied.If you are using a photograph that you altered as the base of your stencil, cut away the black areas or the areas you colored, in the case of multi-color designs.
If you are cutting a stencil that is based on a design you made, cut away the areas that you shaded. The shaded areas indicate the places where the paint will be applied.
It’s best to cut away the smaller shapes first rather than the bigger sections because as you cut more material away, the less stiff and more flimsy the material gets, giving you less control over your cuts.
Cut slowly and carefully while holding the stencil down, keeping your fingers away from the blade of the knife.

, After you have cut out the more detailed parts of your stencil, go back in with the X-Acto knife and focus on the larger sections of your design. Remember that it’s always better to shape sections gradually than to accidentally remove too much of an area and mess up your design., By this time, you should be nearly finished cutting your stencil. Place your stencil against a black piece of paper and stand back. The black cut outs should give you an accurate idea of what your design will look like once you spray your stencil.

If notice that your design needs alterations, refine it until you are happy with how it looks.

, After you finish cutting out your stencil, it’s time to create your artwork! Stick your stencil to the walls of a graffiti park, a large canvas, or wherever you are planning on painting.


If you have a basic stencil without a lot of intricate details, you can simply place your stencil on the surface, then tape it on all four sides using duct tape.
If your stencil has a lot of intricate details, it’s better to use spray adhesive, which will ensure that all the areas of the stencil lie flat.
To use spray adhesive, place the stencil on the ground with the side you will be pasting to the wall facing up. Hold a can of spray adhesive about a foot from the stencil, then spray evenly over the entire surface of the stencil. Lift up the stencil by the corners, then place it against the wall and use your hand to smooth over the stencil so it sticks to the wall.
Make sure that the stencil is flush against the wall. Gaps between the stencil and the wall may let paint cover areas of the design that are meant to be blank.Keep in mind that you should always paint in a well-ventilated area.

, Spray paint is toxic, and can cause brain damage if inhaled excessively. To protect yourself and keep your hands clean, put on a face mask, such as a doctor’s mask or ideally a respirator. Also wear disposable gloves.

You can also wear a bandana across your face, though a mask or respirator is more effective.

, Give your bottle of spray paint a good shake so that you can hear it rattle. Then hold it about nine inches (22.8 cm) from the wall at a 90-degree angle and spray. Move your hand in a controlled, constant movement to avoid dripping.


It’s better to spray in thin layers rather than to heavily paint section by section. Keep your hand moving constantly in left to right lines, and don’t worry if you haven’t completely covered a section, because you can add more layers.
Try to use spray paint bought from an art store that is meant for making art. Brands of spray paint meant for painting furniture are lower quality, and they have a tendency to drip and apply patchily.
When you are spraying, try your best to only spray inside the stencil. If you spray around the stencil, it will create blurry lines around your design that will detract from your art.

, After you have sprayed over the entire stencil, look carefully at the painted sections. Spray over any sections where the paint looks translucent. Also look at the edges of your design and spray over any places where the edges look blurry to help make them crisp and defined., If you have created multiple stencils, paint one color at a time. Begin with the dominant color, usually black, which you may have used to outline the image. Trace around the corners of the stencil so you know exactly where it lies on the wall.After you finish the stencil in one color, pick up the next stencil and place it on the wall, referring to the crop marks you made. Then paint the second color. Continue until you have filled in all the colors.

, Wait around thirty seconds, then carefully remove the stencil from the wall, either by removing the tape and pulling the stencil slowly from the wall, or by peeling it gently away from the wall if you used spray adhesive. With your stencil removed, you can admire your newly completed piece of art!"

Learn about its evolution over the years so you can spot the difference between modern, classic, and outdated trends. There are plenty of books and other materials on the subject, but popular titles include:Subway Art, written by Martha Cooper

Style Wars, directed by Henry Chalfant;
, Before you attempt your own tag, check out other people’s styles. Photograph local artwork or save online images that impress you. Use these as reference as you start to develop your own style. Find these by:Searching online for uploaded images of tags.
Taking a walking tour highlighting areas with active graffiti artists.
Going on your own hunt for tags in your area.

, Keep in mind that a lot of graffiti is against the law, which means many artists have to work with only half their mind on the job at hand. Since the other half is distracted by having to keep an eye out for the cops, expect illegal tags to often be rushed and less than stellar. Because of this, focus your attention on legal artwork, since those artists were able to devote their full attention on what they were doing.Visit https://legal-walls.net/ to locate nearby artwork that was done by permission.

, Expect tagging to develop just like any other artform. This means that certain cities and regions may develop their own nuances, so pay attention to what’s being done around you. Bring yourself up-to-date on local styles and trends. Reach out to local artists to find out their personal take on both the medium at large and their own contributions to it.This isn’t to say that you should limit yourself to just your area. In fact, comparing and contrasting what local artists are doing versus what’s being done in, say, Los Angeles or Berlin could be just as enlightening.

, Remember that designing your own tag and actually tagging a physical space are two different things. Don’t rush out and try doing both at once. Before you pick up a spray can, sit down with some paper and a pen, pencil, or marker. Sketch your ideas and gradually perfect them before committing them to a (near) permanent canvas., If you’re anxious to dive right into actual tagging, decide which letters you need to focus on instead of practicing the whole alphabet. Before you settle on one, check online to see if anyone else already goes by that tag. If so, come up with another. However, if you feel more patient, hold off on a name for right now. Keep in mind that:Your tag needs to be visually appealing, so a name that sounds cool might be less impressive visually than one that sounds blah but looks pretty awesome.
You’re free to change your name at any time, both before and after you start tagging.
If you plan on doing any illegal artwork, make sure that your alias can’t be traced back to you in any way.

, Understand that tagging incorporates your whole body’s movement as you paint, with the end result ideally conveying a sense of that movement and energy to the viewer. However, realize that you need to take baby-steps to do that with any level of mastery. For now, practice drawing simple forms of typography freehanded, like Arial or Sans-Serif. As you do, pay particular attention to:Angles
Spacing
Symmetry
Thickness

, As you grow more confident in drawing simple fonts freehanded, experiment by altering them slightly. Aim to suggest movement with each line to a letter. Play with angles, spacing, symmetry, and thickness to transform a whole letter into a more dynamic shape. For example, with the letter “P,” you could:


Tilt the angle of the whole letter so that its top is pointing slightly to the right, and its bottom to the left, or vice versa.
Curve its vertical line so it resembles the letter “J” for a more languid, swooping effect.
Reduce the size of the loop at its top to suggest a sharper, tighter, swifter line.

, Feel free to simply copy what others have already done when you start tinkering. Virtually all artists (whether they’re graffiti artists or another kind) start out by doing this, so don’t feel bad about it. If anything, feel confident, because this way you’ll be more conscious about what aspects you end up borrowing and which you can credit as your own original ideas. However:Don’t be content with just copying. Blatant mimicry in finished tags (or “biting,” as it’s called in graffiti circles) is frowned upon.
This is another reason why it’s important to start out with a sketchbook. This way you can learn by others’ examples without being accused of trying to pass off borrowed styles as your own.

, As you grow more satisfied with each letter on its own, start grouping them together to see how they look as a whole. You don’t have to literally paint the whole tag in one unbroken move, but aim to suggest a fluid, graceful motion from one letter to the next. Continue tinkering with each letter as needed with an eye toward how it gels with the rest until you’re satisfied with the full effect. For example:If you’re using the letters “U” and “V,” you may be pleased at first with how they each look individually. However, you may then realize that they’re too similar and confusing when paired together. In this case, you’ll have to alter one or both to make them more distinct so your tag is easily legible.

, Remember: practice makes perfect. Before you debut your tag for the world to see, start off with something that’s for your eyes only. Grow accustomed to using spray-paint where you won’t be embarrassed by any mistakes or mishaps. Use a canvas that you can practice on and repaint as needed without being arrested, such as:An actual large canvas
A sheet of plywood
A wall that belongs to you

, Keep in mind that you want your tag to appear fluid and dynamic, regardless of how small or large it is. At the same time, realize that you will often need to move quickly to keep your lines nice and neat. Avoid mistakes that could be caused by a stiff body, aches, and cramps. Limber up beforehand. Also keep in mind:


This goes for your whole body, not just your arms. Expect your waist, hips, legs, and feet to have an impact on the quality of your work.
The larger the surface area to be covered, the wider your range of motion will need to be. A larger canvas means you have to reach, lean, and bend to a greater degree, and more often., Expect the paint’s ingredients to separate over time. Always give it a vigorous shake before you use it, even if you only set it aside for a few minutes. Check the directions on the can to see how long you should shake, both before its first use and (if mentioned) again after a short pause.If you don’t shake it up, the consistency will be uneven. This means that it will be extremely thin at times (which makes for a weak coat), and thicker at others (which could cause clogs).

, If you need to attach a separate spray cap to your can, expect this to release some paint as you do so. Stay away from your canvas so it doesn’t get any spray-back. Place your finger (or better yet, a loose strip of tape) over the cap’s nozzle to catch what comes out.Remember that many paints have toxic ingredients. Even those that don’t should never be inhaled or ingested. Wear protective gloves and mask to reduce this risk.

, Before you try your hand at spraying your tag, start with simple lines sprayed from various distances. Judge the effect of how near or far you stand from your canvas. Expect a wider dispersal the farther back your stand.For neat, crisp lines, you need to work up close.
For fades and shadows, you need more distance.

, Remember that the paint is going to dry immediately upon contact. Expect prolonged spraying over one area to result in a wet buildup. Avoid drips and runs by keeping the can in motion constantly, especially if you’re aiming for very thin lines.Again, some experimentation may be needed here. Constant motion is always key, but do some practice lines at various speeds to see what effect each has on your lines.
Another reason not to dawdle is if you decide to tag some place without permission.

, Once you’re confident in your spray-painting skills, decide where to apply them. Avoid the temptation to simply tag a surface on impulse. Think before you act. Things to consider include:Whether the area has already been tagged, in which case you should choose another.
How visible it is, since you may be better off improving your skills on less visible areas.
If it’s legal to tag this space, and if so, whose permission you need to obtain, if any.
If it’s illegal to do so, and if so, if you’ll be easily noticed or caught.

First you should think of a name.,
Once you have the name and blackbook (optional), you start your drawing.,
Practice Both of these in your black book, move on to a piece of wood or if you really want, your own walls, and eventually other walls in your town and city.,
As you do this Try to experiment with color combinations.",How to Get up (Graffiti)," Your name is very important and can sometimes go hand in hand with the type of graffiti you are doing, such as poster child as a wheatpaste artist (that name is taken).


Many traditional artists use what is called a ""Blackbook"", which is a sketchbook for graffiti artists, usually black hence the name.;
, First you should develop a ""Tag"" which is a signature used by writers, often dressed up with arrows, quotations, halos, etc. Then you should make a ""Throw Up"" which is a basic spray painted bubble letter version of your name or phrase. Throw ups are two colors: an outline and fill, most commonly black and white, but any two colors will do.

, As you do this you should mind other peoples work that is better than or equal to our skill level. Try to meet other artist and research in books and internet to gain inspiration.

, Choose what colors match and look good with each other. Also Try to distort your letters and try to develop ""Wildstyle"". Wildstyle is the very complicated use of letters, the most famous of graffiti. Try to add arrows, layers, backgrounds, create a 3D illusion, and use lighting effects such as shine and shadow.

",How to Do a Throwie,"


Remember to have an extra piece of paper on the bottom ONLY if you are using a permanent marker or something that will bleed through the paper.





;
,,


A good advice to follow would be to take the letter, take it apart and shape it in your mind. Add dents bend the letter a bit, twist them up, do whatever your imagination takes you. By doing this not only will you have a unique style, you will have YOUR own style.

,,, be creative with your letters. if your letters look like other taggers then you will be referred to as a ""toy"" which means an inexperienced graffiti tagger.


Once you have your letters done, it's time to add in 3-D effects. just like in this photo , the 3-D effects are the thick black lines. Also known as shadowing.
A shield is basically an extra outline on the outside of the letters.A shield is also optional. Most taggers use shields to add detail to the throwie and some just leave it plain.
After everything is done, you have your throwie.

Select a sand blaster.,
Choose the right type of sand.,
Set up your equipment.,
Carefully test your equipment.,
Start cleaning the graffiti.,
Keep going until it is clear.,
Evaluate your work.,
Wrap up.",How to Clean Graffiti1," Sand blasters are powerful pressure washers that project a blend of water and sand to clean a surface. There are different types of sand blasters, so you will make sure that you select one suited to removing graffiti. Beware, sand blasters can remove underlying paint as well, so you will usually only want to use a sandblaster on a plain surface.


Sand blasters can be used to clean a wide variety of surfaces including concrete, metal, brick, masonry, and wood.Sand blasters can be erosive! Be careful on old stone, brick, and wood, as a sandblaster can speed the deterioration of porous surfaces.
Sand blasters can remove paint, rust, and grease as well.;
, For most sand blasters, you'll want to be choosing round silica to clean graffiti from surfaces. It is effective and inexpensive.Of course, make sure that the sand type you choose is suitable for both your blaster and the surface in question.

, Place your sandblast probe into the sand you will be using and attach the dispensing end to your power washer nozzle. Make sure that your sand source stays dry and moisture free.


Your sand must be completely dry. Moisture could cause the sand to clump which would compromise functionality.Be sure to use safety goggles! Sand and debris can easily damage your eyes. , Before you begin to work on cleaning the graffiti you may wish to familiarize yourself with the sand blaster by doing a trial run on a similar piece of material.Once you are confident that you have the hang of things you'll be able to get started.

, When you first start, you'll want to sandblast the graffiti at an angle. Firing directly at the graffiti at a 90 degree angle is extremely powerful and can also cause damage to the underlying surface.Begin at an indirect angle and move from there.


You're looking for an angle that removes the graffiti without harming the underlying surface.
Once you find that angle, move back and forth methodically. Generally cleaning a square foot at a time is a good way to start.

, Now that you are set up and know how to use your equipment properly, blast away! Continue to use even, methodical sweeps with the sandblaster and you will have the offending graffiti gone in no time.

, Once you are done, take a step back and assess your work. Sometimes you'll spot areas where the graffiti is faded but still visible. Get back to work and repeat your prior sandblasting until the surface is clean.

, Once you are done, carefully pack up your equipment. If you are storing extra sand make sure that it is completely dry and clump-free. You'll also want to inspect the surface for damage. Re-caulk or re-seal any porous corners or seams that may have been compromised by the sandblasting.

Store milk paint in the fridge for up to three days.",How to Make Milk Paint," To create milk paint, the milk must be at room temperature before you begin the process of curdling. If your milk is refrigerated, take it out of the fridge and wait for it to reach room temperature.Make sure that you use fresh skim milk. Powdered milk or milk that is full or partial fat does not work to make milk paint.
Don’t warm the milk, just let it sit out. Warming the milk past 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius) breaks down the proteins of milk.;
, When the milk has reached room temperature, pour it into a large mixing bowl. Then add in the two cups of white vinegar and stir to incorporate.Stop stirring once you have incorporated the vinegar.

, After you mix the vinegar in with the milk, you should see that the milk solids have started separating at the top. This means that the milk is curdling. Once you see this, place the container with the curdling milk in a warm place and let it sit overnight or for up to two days.Make sure not to stir or to shake the container of milk. This will disturb the formation of the curds.

, Place the pigment powder into a small mixing bowl, then add ¼ cup of water. Let the pigment soak in the water for around five minutes without stirring., After the pigment has soaked for around five minutes, use a spoon to mix the pigment and water until it achieves the consistency of a paste., Place four ounces of hydrated lime type 5 into a plastic or glass bowl, being sure not to inhale the powder. Slowly pour in 1 ½ cups of water.Try not to get the powder on your hands or eyes. Consider wearing a mask so that you don’t inhale it.

, Use a spoon to stir and mix the powder and water. Stir until all the powder is wetted and the mixture becomes a wet paste., Place a sheet of cheesecloth or another kind of thin cloth inside a colander to line it. Then place the colander in the sink., After you set up your colander, pour the container of milk over the colander. You should see that the chunks, or curds, of milk are caught in the cheesecloth while the liquid whey of the milk passes through.








The curds that you separate from the whey are also called quark

, After you have separated the quark, dump the quark into a gallon paint bucket. If you see large chunks in the quark, break them up with a large spoon., After you break up the big chunks in the quark, pour in the lime paste to the bucket of quark. Stir using a large spoon for a couple of minutes. The lime paste will work to break down the quark and make it smooth.After a few minutes of stirring, the curds should have broken down. If they are still lumpy, let the mixture sit for 15-30 minutes.

, After the mixture in the paint bucket has reached a smooth consistency, add the pigment paste. Stir to incorporate the pigment paste until the entire mixture is the same color.








The mixture should have the consistency of a light cream. If it is thick or sludgy, add water by the tablespoon and stir until it has a lighter consistency.

, Place a piece of cheesecloth over another gallon bucket of paint. Then pour the milk paint over the cheesecloth into the other paint bucket.

The cheesecloth will catch any remaining chunks of curd. Dispose of these chunks.

, Before you apply the milk paint, you need to make sure that the surface you are painting is smooth and ready to receive paint. If you are painting a wall, remove any nails or fixtures sticking out of the wall. If you are painting a piece of furniture, sand it so that the surface is smooth.







, Milk paint can be used as soon as it is finished being made. Before you use your milk paint, stir it well with a large spoon to make sure that all the ingredients are blended.Stirring is especially important if you have let the paint sit.
If you are worried that the paint won’t stick to the surface, add a measure of acrylic binder to the milk paint. Follow the instructions on the container to determine how much to add.

, Use a bristle brush or a foam roller to apply the first layer of paint all over the surface you are painting. Don’t run the brush over the same area of paint too much, or it will leave large streaks.








Use a bristle brush if you like the look of antiqued finishes where you can see the faint lines of the brush. If you want a more uniform finish, use a foam roller.

, Wait from an hour and a half to two hours to let the first layer of paint dry. If you begin to paint before the first layer is finished, the paint job won’t look clean., Before you paint the second layer, give the milk paint a stir to make sure that the ingredients haven’t settled or separated. Then apply the second layer of paint.Two layers of paint is often enough to coat a surface. If the paint job looks thin or you can still see the surface underneath, wait for the second layer to dry, then apply a third layer.

, Depending on what you are painting, you may wish to apply a topcoat. You can use any kind of topcoat you wish over milk paint, whether it be natural or acrylic/urethane. A topcoat helps to protect the paint job and can add a finish like a varnish, shellac or gloss., Put any leftover paint you may have in the fridge. You can keep milk paint for up to three days if you store it in the fridge. However, because the paint separates, it’s best used while fresh.

Assess your surface.,
Match your paint.,
Clean and prime the surface.,
Get ready to paint.,
Paint over the graffiti.,
Evaluate the finished product.",How to Clean Graffiti2," If you are resigned to handling the job yourself and don't have a sand blaster, painting is another option. For the most part, you'll only want to be painting over graffiti on surfaces that were painted in the first place.


Painting is a good option for smooth surfaces like fences and some walls.
If the wall is a smooth and fairly non-porous surface, painting over the offending graffiti is much easier.

, Ideally you'll know exactly what paint was originally used.If you don't, you may want to test your potential match against a small section of the surface. You wouldn't want to paint over graffiti on an ivory white fence with eggshell white - you'd end up needing to paint the rest of the fence eggshell white as well.

, Even though you are simply painting over an eyesore, you'll want your job to last. You will want to clean the surface, let it dry, and then apply a paint primer. If you need to be careful not to get primer or paint on other surfaces, be sure to line the edges of those surfaces with painter's tape.Some paints do not require a primer. Primers are also more often used on porous and non-uniform surfaces., As the primer dries, pour your paint into a paint tray. Once the primer is dry, it is time to get your brush or roller ready.

, For small jobs a brush will suffice, but for larger jobs you'll want to use a paint roller. You'll want your tool covered in a heavy coat of paint that isn't so thick that it drips. Using slow and even strokes, paint over the offending graffiti. Depending on the colors involved you may need to use several coats - perhaps even allowing your first coats to dry and then re-applying.


Don't squeeze the paint out while brushing or rolling. Just roll or brush it out! Pushing too hard and squeezing the roller cause lines in the paint and damage to your roller. , After the paint dries you'll want to step back and get perspective on your work. Often (and particularly with white surfaces) you may see an outline of the graffiti under your paint. If so, apply another coat. Store your tools in case you need them again in the future.

Find out about Graffiti Abatement Programs (often known as GAPs).,
Contact your local Graffiti Abatement Program.,
Contact your HOA, property management, or landlord.,
Call the police.",How to Clean Graffiti3," Almost all major cities and municipalities have some type of GAP. GAPs are usually a joint effort between communities, the police, parks and recreation, community associations, local companies, and public works to combat graffiti and vandalism.

, Many GAPs (or whatever your local anti-graffiti group is called) provide assistance for graffiti removal and coverup, even if the graffiti is on private property. While services vary between GAPs, you'll want to contact them and see how they can help you.


Some graffiti abatement programs will either clean or paint over graffiti for you outright, especially if you are disabled or elderly.Some GAPs will either provide you will free cleaning and painting supplies or come and help you in your cleaning efforts.

, If you live in an area that does not have a GAP, or in which the GAP provides limited assistance, you may want to consider other avenues of assistance. Depending on the terms of various contracts, your HOA, property management, or landlord may be responsible for the cleanup.

, You will also want to report the matter to local authorities. If you are reporting a vandalism in progress, dial 911.To simply report vandalism or graffiti that has already occurred many cities and municipalities will designate a different number - often 311.Provide police with details about the location of the graffiti and when you observed it.


Reporting to the police will enable them to better target their enforcement efforts and catch the perpetrator before he or she vandalizes again.
Police are also a valuable source of information for local anti-graffiti efforts.

Find a graffiti signature you can use.,
Go and buy spray cans from a brand that is made for the purpose of making graffiti, in a store or online.,
Put on clothes and shoes that are old or cheap, that you do not care if you ruin.,
Take the paint and equipment, bring a digital camera in a plastic bag and go to a legal wall.,
Start spraying with a light color how you want the letters to look.,
Fill in the letters with the colors you want.,
Make the background.,
Paint the outline on the letters and shadow (or 3D effect).,
Paint the ""skyline"".,
Add effects to the ""piece"" if desired.,
Complete any additional (and optional) elements.,
Take several pictures of your ""piece"" from different angles and lengths with your digital camera.",How to Get Started Making Legal Graffiti," Beware that amongst graffiti artists, ""biting"", which is having similar signatures as other graffiti artists, is not accepted and can be dangerous. So find something unique, that is not similar to other graffiti artist's signatures, especially not big graffiti artists that live in your area, city or country.


Draw a sketch of your signature with big letters on an A4 sheet of paper, with a black or blue ballpoint pen.;
, The best brand without doubt is Montana. Get both fat and skinny caps to use on them, and also thin rubber gloves that fit your hands well, like the ones doctors use.


If you want an even better result, buy normal wall paint on a regular paint store. This is to paint a layer on the wall with a paint roller before spraying. Also a tray for the paint roller. This helps covering up old graffiti on the legal wall, so that it does not show through your ""piece"" (the name for the composition of letters graffiti artists make). It also makes the background look better, and makes your ""piece"" stand out more from the wall. Because other ""pieces"" that have been made earlier will not be a disturbing element when looking at your ""piece"". 

, There is a big chance that you will get paint on your clothes and especially shoes. To wear a hooded sweater and hat is smart if you do not want to be recognized. Many people will start taking pictures of you or others there, and even film you from the back while you paint on legal walls without asking; if these images are posted on social media, it can actually lead to problems for you later.

, Legal walls are all around the world, and you can often find them by asking at the shop where you buy your spray paint, or checking online.Start painting the wall with the wall paint and paint roller. If you use an extension shaft for the paint roller, it makes this process go much faster and easier. You do not want to wait hours before it dries, so do not use to much paint on the paint roller. Paint a layer that is enough to cover the graffiti that already is on the wall completely from top to bottom. That is enough. Make sure you paint long enough on both sides, so not any of the letters becomes to big and goes outside the field you have painted.

, This is called to sketch the letters. If you want to make a cartoon face or portrait somewhere around the ""piece"", also start with that now, and follow the same procedure as with the letters. You use a light color, because if you want to make adjustments later, a light color will be covered by darker colors. But it is not always like that the other way around, so you will see lines from the darker colors come through. You only make empty letters first without any ""fill in"" (painting inside the letters). Also make the shadow or 3D effect on the letters with the same color. Imagine that light shines on the letters from a certain direction, and make the shadow on the opposite side. It is really important that you make the shadow with the same thickness on all the letters.

, Try making patterns and symbols in different colors inside the letters. For the main colors you can use a fat cap, which makes it come a lot of paint from the can, but for the patterns, and especially if you want to make a fading effect, it is better with a skinny cap. This can be anything. It is important that you get finished with the ""fill in"", before starting with the outline, because you will quickly end up spraying over the outline with the ""fill in"" colors, because e.g. the wind blows the paint around.

, Here you also make e.g. patterns and symbols. A smart thing is to choose colors that are colder than the ones you used inside your ""piece"". Because this will make the background look like it is further away than the letters, which will stick out.

, Use a color that stands out a lot from the colors you have used in the background and inside the letters. Often a dark color is the best, like black, but not always. This is important to make it easy to see the difference between background and ""fill in"". This is one of the most important steps, because black is hard to cover up, so if you make mistakes when spraying the outline, it will quickly make the ""piece"" look bad. Take small lines at a time, not whole letters. But from point to point where the letter's shape changes direction. If there are complicated lines, take a ""practice swing"" to simulate the movement you have to do with the can before starting to spray the line.

, This is a line that goes outside the letters and the shadow, that separates the background from the letters. This makes the ""piece"" much better at once. If you spray over the outline while making the ""skyline"", just use the color you used for the outline to fix it. But remember to save enough of the outline color until you are finished, to fix the most important things.

, This is what separates the really great ""pieces"" from the not so great. Now you can add something called ""shining"". Which is a line that is white or yellow that you put where the light would shine on the letters. And that is supposed to be on the exact opposite side of the shadow. So where you have shadow, you are not supposed to have ""shining"" and vice versa. If you make a 3D effect instead, then a ""shining"" is wrong to make, because if there is no shadow, there is no ""shining"". It is just like when you draw a person, one place there is shadow and another place there is light. 


You can also make something called an ""inline"", this is almost the same as outline, but it is complicated to make and will definitely ruin your ""piece"" if you do not do it properly. Something the ""shining"" will also do, because these effects are advanced. The ""inline"" is a line that goes on the inside of your outline in all the letters. This can be very cool, but it is not in all ""pieces"" this effect is suitable.

, It is very common to write the year that you made the ""piece"", and it is also very nice to know when looking in old photo albums. To write the place you made it is also a possibility. Because if you start making a lot of graffiti you are not going to remember when and where you made every ""piece"". Then you write your signature beside the ""piece"". The best thing to do is to take a skinny cap and write it on the right side of the ""piece"" low down under it. Because a huge signature draws a lot of attention, and you do not want the signature to grab the viewer's attention from the big letters. 


After this you can also dedicate your ""piece"" to someone, and write 4: which means for e.g. ""My buddies"". You can also write a greeting to someone with Yo. E.g. Yo: Eric and King D. You have to know the people you are greeting; you can not greet to or dedicate your ""piece"" to, for example, a big graffiti artist you do not know, because that is like ""saying"" that you know him or that he or she said it was okay for you to do it. If you have something smart to say that is short, or know a good line from e.g. a rap song you can also write it.

, If you can not go a very long distance from the ""piece"", because some other thing like another wall is blocking you from doing it, the best angle is from the side close up to the ""piece"". Because then you can get all of it in one picture. The best thing is to use a tripod for your camera, so you get a steady and balanced shot.


If you do not take a picture at once, remember that at legal walls your ""piece"" can get painted over at once. Think of the composition when taking the picture, try to get the ""piece"" as much in the middle of the picture as you can, and make sure that the ""piece"" is perfectly horizontal in the lense.

, Use a good eraser to remove anything that doesn't quite work and then redraw and refine your design. Keeping it simple at this stage will help you in the next step.

, Try to keep one style per word or sentence, as mixing up styles can get distracting.

, Try different shapes and variations on ornaments and decorative elements. When you are done perfecting your word, use a black or blue pen or Sharpie to go over the basic letters and color in with highlighters, Sharpies, crayons and colored pencils. Try not to get too extravagant yet, just do what you really want to do.

, If you don't like your style now, start over—maybe even by tracing or redrawing the parts you do like form the old design and using that as a starting point. Keep trying and work hard to get what you want out of your art. Practice makes perfect, they say, and perfection can't be rushed. So have patience—and have fun!

Write down the name in pencil or chalk.,
Turn the letters into blocks or bubbles.,
Connect some of the letters.",How to Draw Graffiti Names1," Write in print, rather than cursive, and use an erasable writing tool, since you'll need to manipulate the letters. Make it big, bold and clear. This will be the skeleton of the finished name . Here are some style elements to keep in mind:









Think symmetry. You want your graffiti to be balanced and eye-catching.Play around with the letters so they fit together well; they don't have to be the same size. Mix up capital and lowercase letters to make them fit together nicely.
The first and last letter should balance each other out. For example, if you're writing the name ""JOSEPH,"" play with the ""J"" and the ""H"" to create a frame for the rest of the letters. You can add a hook to the second leg on the ""h"" so it matches the hook on the ""J.""
A lot of graffiti artists write words in an arch, rather than a straight line, to give the design some extra punch.;
, Draw around the original letters to create a larger 2-D sketch of the name. Block letters have straight lines and sharp corners, while bubble letters are more rounded; choose one or the other, but don't use both. Start thinking of the name as a work of art, rather than a written word.









Make some bends in the straight lines. If you've got an ""L,"" for example, you can make it look more artistic by bending both lines instead of keeping them boringly straight.
Make the letters fit together like puzzle pieces. For example, in the name ""KARLOS,"" you could tuck the ""A"" into the crook of the ""K"" and tuck the ""O"" into the corner of the ""L.""

, Extend the block or bubble where one letter ends to the point where another begins, and erase the lines in between to connect them. This adds motion to the design and creates the illusion that the letters are flowing together.









Don't necessarily connect letters that are right next to each other. In the word ""SKYLAR,"" you might create a rectangular block that extends from the second leg of the ""K"" under the ""Y"" to connect with the ""L."" Take a look at your name and figure out which letters you could connect to make it more interesting.
Make the original words you wrote your guide, not your prison. Don't be afraid to alter the letters beyond all recognition.

Include original elements.",How to Draw Graffiti Names2," Adding your favorite flair is what sets your graffiti art apart from the rest. Feet, seraphs, bits and arrows are used to decorate the letters and add balance to the word.









A foot is a blocky piece added to the bottom of a straight line. So if you've got an ""E"" with a bend in the bottom line, create a joint at the end of the line with a vertical line jutting up.
A seraph is like a foot, but it juts from an upper line instead. On an ""E"" you'd add a seraph to the end of the top line.
Bits are like blocky dots trailing off the end of a line. You can add them to any letter.
Arrows also trail off the end of lines. A letter like ""T"" could have an arrow extending from the bottom line or either side of the top line.

, Add a shaded edge to your letters, then sharpen the lines to make the letters look 3-D. You could also approximate a 3-D effect by making the lines thicker and narrower at different places. For example, the top and one side of an ""O"" might be very thick, while the bottom and other side is narrowed.








, Once your letters are as you want them, you can add additional details if you choose to. Make them personal to your style and interests. Add a lightning bolt for the dot of an ""i,"" or eyes peering out of the holes in your ""B."" The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.

",How to Choose a Lens Aperture (F Stop)," You'll need to know these in order to make sense of the rest of the article.



Aperture or stop. This is the adjustable hole through which light passes on its way from the subject, through the lens, to the film (or digital sensor). Like the pinhole in a pinhole camera, it blocks rays of light except those that would, even without a lens, tend to form an inverted image by passing through that central point to a corresponding point in the opposite direction on the film. With a lens, it also blocks rays of light that would pass through far from the center, where the lens glass may less closely approximate (usually with various easy-to-make spherical surfaces) the shapes that would focus it perfectly (usually much more complex aspherical surfaces), causing aberrations.

Because every camera has an aperture, usually adjustable, and if not, at least has the edges of the lens as an aperture, the aperture size setting is what is normally called the ""aperture"".



F-stop or simply aperture. This is the ratio of the focal length of the lens to the size of the aperture. This kind of measurement is used because a given focal ratio produces the same image brightness, requiring the same shutter speed for a given ISO setting (film speed or equivalent sensor light amplification) without regard to focal length.

Iris diaphragm or simply iris. This is the device most cameras use to form and adjust the aperture. It consists of a series of overlapping thin metal blades that can swing toward the center of a hole in a flat metal ring. It forms a central hole that is perfectly round wide open, when the blades are out of the way, and constricts by pushing the blades toward the center of that hole to form a smaller polygonal hole (which may have curved edges).

If your camera uses interchangeable lenses, or it is a ""bridge"" type digital camera, the lens will have an adjustable diaphragm iris. If your camera is a shirt-pocket sized ""point-and-shoot"" compact model, especially a lower priced model, it may have a ""neutral density filter"" instead of a diaphragm iris. Also, if the camera's mode dial includes ""M"", ""Tv"", and ""Av"", it almost certainly has an actual diaphragm iris; this applies even on small compact models. If the mode dial doesn't include these three settings, the camera might have a diaphragm, or it might only have an ND filter; the only way to know for sure is to read the specifications in the owner's manual, or read a detailed professional review (Google your camera's model name with the word ""reviews"", and you will probably find at least two or three reviews on the Internet). If your camera uses an ND filter, your ability to ""fine tune"" your settings and control depth of field and bokeh effects will be limited to whatever the fixed aperture of the lens provides. NOTE on Mode Dial settings: ""M"" stands for ""Manual"" - in this mode you have to set both the shutter speed and aperture. ""Tv"" is shutter speed priority: you manually set the shutter speed, and the camera's exposure computer sets an appropriate aperture. ""Av"" is ""Aperture Priority"" - you manually set the f-stop (aperture) that you want, typically to achieve a specific depth of field, and the camera's exposure computer decides what shutter speed to use.
Most SLR cameras only close down the iris diaphragm, making it visible from the front of the lens, during an exposure or when the depth-of-field-preview function is activated.



Stopping down means to use a smaller, or (depending on context) a relatively small aperture (large f/ number).

Opening up means to use a larger, or (depending on context), a relatively large aperture (small f/ number).

Wide open means to use the largest aperture (smallest f/number).

Depth of field is the specific front-to-back area, or (depending on context) the scope of the front-to-back area that appears fairly sharp. A smaller aperture increases depth of field and decreases the extent to which objects outside the depth of field are blurred. The precise extent of depth of field is somewhat subjective because focus drops off gradually from the precise distance of focus, and the noticeability of defocus depends on factors such as subject type, other sources of lack of sharpness, and viewing conditions.

A relatively large depth-of-field is called deep; a relatively small depth-of-field is called shallow.



Aberrations are imperfections in a lens's ability to focus light sharply. Generally speaking, less-expensive and more-exotic types of lenses (such as superwides) have more severe aberrations.

Aperture has no effect on linear distortion (straight lines appearing curved), but it often goes away toward the middle of a zoom lens's focal-length range, and pictures can be composed to avoid drawing attention to it such as by not putting prominent obviously straight lines such as on buildings or horizons close to the frame edges, and it can be corrected in software or by some digital cameras automatically.



Diffraction is a basic aspect of the behavior of waves passing through small openings which limits the maximum sharpness of all lenses at smaller apertures.It becomes increasingly apparent past f/11 or so, making a great camera and lens no better than a so-so one (albeit sometimes one exactly suited for a specific need such as great depth of field or a long shutter speed where lower sensitivity or a neutral-density filter is not available).;
, Depth of field is, formally, the range of object distances within which objects are imaged with acceptable sharpness. There is only one distance at which objects will be in perfect focus, but sharpness drops off gradually in front of and behind that distance. For a short distance in each direction, objects will be blurred so little that the film or sensor will be too coarse to detect any blurring; for a somewhat greater distance they will still appear ""pretty"" sharp in the final picture.The pairs of depth-of-field marks for certain apertures next to the focusing scale on a lens are good for estimating this latter measure..


Roughly one-third of the depth of field is in front of the focus distance, and two-thirds is behind (if not extending to infinity, since it is a phenomenon relating to the amount by which light rays from an object have to be bent to converge at a focal point and rays coming from far distances tend toward parallel.)
Depth of field drops off gradually. Backgrounds and foregrounds will appear slightly soft, if not in focus, with a small aperture, but very blurred or unrecognizable with a wide aperture. Consider whether they are important and should be in focus, relevant for context and should be a little soft, or distracting and should be blurred.

If you want great background blur but do not have quite enough depth of field for your subject, focus on the part that will draw the most attention, often the eyes.


Depth of field generally appears to depend on, in addition to aperture, focal length (longer focal length gives less), format size (smaller film or sensor size gives more, assuming the same angle of view, i.e., equivalent focal length), and distance (there is much less at close focus distances).
So, if you want shallow depth of field, you can buy a super-fast lens (expensive), or zoom in (free) and set even a cheap smaller-aperture lens wide open.
The artistic purpose of depth of field is to deliberately have the entire picture sharp or to ""crop depth"" by diffusing distracting foreground and/or background.
A more practical purpose of depth of field is to set a small aperture and pre-focus the lens to the ""hyperfocal distance"" (the closest at which the depth of field extends to infinity from a given distance; see a table or the depth of field marks on the lens for the aperture chosen) or to an estimated distance, to be ready to take a picture quickly with a manual-focus camera or a subject moving too fast or unpredictably for autofocus (in which case you'll need a high shutter speed too).

Remember that you normally won't see any of this through your viewfinder (or on your screen as you're composing. Modern cameras meter with the lens at its widest aperture, and only stop down the lens to its selected aperture at the moment of exposure. The depth-of-field preview function usually allows only a dim and imprecise view. (Disregard any odd patterns in the focusing screen view; they will not appear in the final picture.) What's more, viewfinders on modern digital SLRs and other autofocus cameras don't even show the true wide-open depth of field with a lens faster than f/2.8 or so (it's shallower than it looks; rely on autofocus, not subject to this limitation, when possible). A better option on digital cameras is to simply take the picture, then play it back and zoom in on your LCD to see if the background is adequately sharp (or blurred) enough.

, A flash burst is normally so short that the flash component of an exposure is affected only by aperture. (Most 35mm and digital SLRs have a maximum ""flash-sync"" flash-compatible shutter speed; above that only a fraction of the frame would be exposed due to the way in which their ""focal-plane"" shutter works. Special high-speed-sync flash modes use a rapid burst of weak flashes, each exposing a fraction of the frame; they greatly reduce flash range and so are rarely helpful.) A wide aperture increases maximum flash range. It also increases effective fill-flash range by increasing the proportionate exposure from a flash and reducing the time during which ambient light is allowed in. A small aperture may be needed to prevent overexposure in close-ups due to a minimum output below which a flash cannot be reduced (indirect flash, which is inherently less efficient, can help in this situation). Many cameras can adjust the balance of flash and ambient lighting with ""flash exposure compensation"". A digital camera is best for complex flash setups because the results of instantaneous bursts of light are inherently non-intuitive, even though some studio flashes have ""modeling lights"" and some fancy portable flashes have modeling-light-like preview modes.

, All lenses are different and are better shot at different apertures for optimal performance. Get out and shoot something with lots of fine texture at different apertures and compare the shots to figure out how your lens behaves at various apertures. The object should be all essentially at ""infinity"" (30 feet or more with wide-angles to hundreds of feet with tele-lenses; a distant stand of trees is generally good) to avoid confusing defocus with aberrations. Here's some hints as to what to look for:



Nearly all lenses have lower contrast and are less sharp at their widest aperture, especially towards the corners of your image. This is especially true on point-and-shoot and cheaper lenses. Consequently, if you're going to have detail in the corners of your pictures that you want to keep sharp, then you'll want to use a smaller aperture. For flat subjects, f/8 is typically the sharpest aperture. For objects at varying distances a smaller aperture may be better for more depth of field.

Most lenses will have some noticeable amount of light fall-off wide open. Light fall-off is where the edges of the picture are slightly darker than the centre of the picture. This can be a good thing for many photographs, especially portraits; it draws attention towards the centre of the photograph, which is why many people add falloff in post. But it's still good to know what you're getting. Falloff is usually invisible after about f/8.
Zoom lenses can vary depending on how far in or out they are zoomed. Test for the above things at a few different zoom settings.
Diffraction makes almost every lens's images softer at f/16 and smaller apertures, and conspicuously softer at f/22 and smaller.
All of this is just something to think about for optimum clarity of a picture that already has as good a composition--including depth of field – as possible, and which will not be much more grossly marred by insufficient shutter speed causing camera-shake or subject blur or noise from excessive ""sensitivity"" (amplification).
Don't waste film investigating this – check your lenses on a digital camera, check reviews, and in a pinch assume expensive or prime (non-zoom) lenses are best at f/8, cheap simple ones such as kit lenses are best at f/11, and cheap exotic ones such as superwides or lenses with wide or tele adapters are best at f/16. (With an adapter lens on a point and shoot, stop down as much as possible, perhaps by using the camera's aperture-priority mode – look in its menus.)

,



Bokeh, a Japanese word often used to refer to the appearance of out-of-focus areas, especially highlights because those appear as bright blobs. Much has been written about the details of those out-of-focus blobs, which are sometimes brighter in the middle and sometimes a little brighter at the edges, like donuts, or some combination of the two, but at least one author rarely notices it except in bokeh articles. Most importantly, out-of-focus blurs are:

Much larger and more diffuse at wider apertures.
Soft-edged at the widest aperture, due to the perfectly round hole (the edge of a lens, rather than an iris blade).
The shape of the diaphragm opening, when not at the widest aperture. This is most noticeable at wide apertures because they are large. This might be considered unattractive with a lens whose opening does not closely approximate a circle, such as a cheap lens with a five- or six-bladed diaphragm.
Sometimes half-moons rather than circular toward the sides of images at very wide apertures, probably due to one of the lens elements not being as huge as it would have to be to fully illuminate all parts of the image at that aperture, or weirdly extended due to ""coma"" at very wide apertures (which is pretty much only an issue when taking pictures of lights at night).
Prominently donut-like with mirror-type tele lenses, due to a central obstruction.



Diffraction spikes forming sunstars. Very bright highlights, such as light bulbs at night or small specular reflections of sunlight, will be surrounded by ""diffraction spikes"" making ""sunstars"" at small apertures (they are formed by increased diffraction at the points of the polygonal hole formed by the iris). These will either have the same number of points as your lens has aperture blades (if you have an even number of them), due to overlapping of opposite-sides' spikes, or twice as many (if you have an odd number of aperture blades). They are fainter and less noticeable with lenses with many, many aperture blades (generally odd lenses such as old Leicas).

, Most importantly (in terms of aperture at least), Control your depth of field. It's as simple as this: a smaller aperture means more depth of field, a larger aperture means less. A larger aperture also means more background blur. Here's some examples:


Use a small aperture to force more depth of field.

Remember that depth of field becomes shallower the closer you get.If you're doing macro photography, for example, you might want to stop down far more than you would for a landscape. Insect photographers often go way down to f/16 or smaller, and have to nuke their subjects with lots of artificial lighting.

Use a large aperture to force a shallow depth of field. This is great for portraits (much better than the silly automatic portrait scene modes), for example; use the largest aperture you have, lock your focus on the eyes, recompose and you'll find the background is thrown out of focus and is, consequently, made less distracting.
Remember that opening the aperture like this will cause faster shutter speeds to be chosen. In bright daylight, make sure you aren't causing your camera to max out its fastest shutter speed (typically 1/4000 on digital SLRs). Keep your ISO low to avoid this.

, If you're photographing lights at night, have adequate camera support, and want sunstars, use a small aperture. If you want large, perfectly rounded bokeh spots (albeit with some incomplete circles), use a wide-open aperture.

, Use a relatively large aperture and fast shutter speed if necessary to mix flash with daylight so the flash isn't overwhelmed., If depth of field is not of primary importance (which would generally be the case when pretty much everything in the picture is relatively far from the lens and will be in focus anyway), the shutter speed will be high enough to avoid blur from camera shake and the ISO setting will be low enough to avoid severe noise or other quality loss (which would generally be the case in daytime), you don't need any aperture-related gimmicks, and any flash is powerful enough to balance with ambient light adequately, set the aperture that gives the best detail with the particular lens being used.

For auction house auctions, do your homework in advance. Take along your camera and try it with the lens. Most auction houses not only encourage this but require it as part of the terms of sale, as you're buying ""as is"". Ring up to find a good time to visit before the auction to test out the lenses.;
, Where you can, ask the seller why he or she is selling the lens. While not all sellers will be completely up front with you, most will because they care about their reputation, especially if they're known within photography circles.


If it's an online auction purchase, read the description thoroughly. Does it make any mention of condition? If not, ask questions well before the end of auction. If you're not satisfied with the answers, let it go. Expect to see photos of the lens from several angles. No photos, no purchase. No or evasive answers to your questions, no purchase. Questions you should have answers to include:

Are there scratches or blemishes on the front and rear lens elements?
Is there oil on the aperture blades? Do they snap into place quickly?
Does the inside of the lens have any dust or fungus?
Are you also including the hood, both lens caps, user manual, and original box?


Check the shipping policies. Has the seller explained how the item will be packed and the shipping method? If it's unclear, ask. The item is fragile and should be shipped with the greatest of care, and you should be aware of the shipping costs in advance.

, If you're purchasing it locally or from a store, pick the lens up and give it a thorough looking over. Can you identify any scratches, dents, nicks, or cracks? If the lens is dusty, use a blower brush and rubbing alcohol first. If you see anything, ask what happened to the lens and why the seller considers that the damage hasn't impacted the lens.


Shine a light through the lens. Use a small flashlight to illuminate the lens from different angles. Also look through the lens at a bright light source, such as sunlight on a wall, or a lamp. Look for cracks, dust, blockage, etc. Look through the lens both ways, and with the light shining through both ways and at angles. Hold the lens at a comfortable distance and look at the lens glass itself, not right up to your eye where any defects won't appear clearly.
Large scratches should be obvious. Deep and large scratches tend to be more of a problem than finer ones, especially if located on the rear element. Avoid buying a lens with a scratched rear element; you can be a little less concerned with finer scratches on the front element provided you've proof it doesn't impact the images taken.
With older lenses or when buying in a humid climate take special care to look for fungus. Early stages will look like water marks on your bathroom mirror, more advanced stages can look more like spiderwebs. Do NOT mount a fungus infected lens on your camera, there's a slight chance it can spread to your other lenses.
If it's possible, take a photo of the bright sky or something bright, not just uniformly bright but with patches of glare and some detail (don't point a super-speed or telephoto lens at the sun lest you hurt your eye or your camera), at the widest and the smallest apertures in a no compression RAW format, or the lowest JPG compression your camera has available. Check the photo for blemishes. Normal-looking flare patterns from the sun generally don't indicate problems (though, if severe, might mean you want another kind of lens); odd flare spots, overall haze, or unusual softness (a little symmetrical edge softness is normal with cheaper and wide-angle lenses wide-open) are problems.
Listen for rattling noises or loose pieces. This can be an indicator that something is damaged from drops or knocks, and even if the loose piece is not an issue, it could indicate that something else is about to give way.

, Consider using a blower brush on the lens and a little rubbing alcohol. This will help to reveal anything that is stuck on or within the lens. Some of the specific things to look for include:


Eroded lens coatings; while slight erosion won't impact the quality of the picture, severe erosion will impact the pictures and make them appear ""blotchy"".
Be wary of even light damage. While some sellers may insist this is easy to fix, it's a lens, and nothing to do with a lens is ever cheap.
Check the contact points. This only applies to more modern lenses. There needs to be a good and consistent contact between camera and lens.
Check the filter threads. It doesn't take much for those threads to lose their usability; a small ding and you can't get a filter on, or off, your lens. If buying online, be sure that you get a decent picture and that it is of the lens you're actually purchasing, and not simply one that is ""like"" the lens.
Test all of the switches. If any of them are loose, check that they still work as they are supposed to.

, Watch for sticky aperture blades; the oil coating aperture blades will gel together if the lens has not been serviced regularly and this will make them sticky. The effect will leave you with over-exposed or under-exposed photos.Do the aperture blades move smoothly? Are there any nicks?
To test the aperture blades, bring a depth of field preview feature down to its lowest aperture. Look through the lens and press the depth of field preview button. Sound aperture blades will move into place immediately, and the viewfinder will go dark. If there is any problem with the aperture blades, there will be a delay in moving or turning dark., You want to be able to fasten the used lens to your camera without breaking either the mount or the lens. In addition, make sure that it is the right kind of mount. Depending on what type of camera you own, and its age, the mount may vary. Double and triple check.


If purchasing online, ask questions about the mount ring and mount if the description is unclear.
If purchasing in a store, take your camera in with you to check the fit.

, Also, make sure that it doesn't 'telescope' itself out on its own.


While a loose zoom action won't impact picture quality, it's an annoying thing to have to constantly remember and work with. It is possible to tape with care but that's a last resort fix for a real budget buy.
Lenses that have been knocked or dropped a lot may not extend to their full range anymore. Check by twisting the zoom ring back and forth.
Repair costs for the zoom feature can be costly.

, You want to be sure that you can get focus. If it's a focus assist, check the assist function, and also its manual focus ability. The focus mechanism should move in and out with ease.

, If you do find or learn about damage to the lens, and you're still prepared to risk it, only do so if the price is so right that the lens is a bargain. Better still if it's free, or you're only up for postage costs.


Check Craigslist and Freecycle for unwanted lenses. Cheap or free is best when there is damage involved.
Always bear in mind that problems with a lens can be expensive to remedy, and can leave you with a repair bill that may have made a brand new purchase a better option. Buy with your eyes wide open.

Blacken your sketch lines.,
Add color.,
Set it against a background.",How to Draw Graffiti Names3," Use marker or paint to darken the lines drawn with your pencil or chalk. Make bold, thick lines. This is graffiti, so it doesn't have to look nice and neat; the lines should be expressive. When you're done, erase any pencil or chalk lines skill peeking through.








, Fill all the letters in with just one color or experiment with lots of different hues. Graffiti artists traditionally had to work secretly for fear of getting caught - many still do - and so they could carry only one or two different colors of spray paint at a time - a lot of very good graffiti is just one color. If you want to try more than one, think about these options:









You can do each letter in a different color or make the added details a different color than the letters.
Try an ombre-style work of art with colors that gradually fade from one to the next. To create a sunset-like appearance, make the top part of the letters red, then blend that into orange, and fade into yellow at the bottom.
For a bolder 3-D effect, color in the shaded edges of the letters with a darker color than the faces of the letters.

, Now that the name is complete, make it stand out by painting the background area a different color. If your name looks dark, paint a brighter background behind it; if it's light, set it against a dark color. Your work of graffiti art is sure to make people stop and stare.

Pick a speed that won't blur when shooting still objects.,
Choose a fast shutter speed if you want to freeze movement.,

Determine the shutter speed based on light.",How to Choose a Camera Shutter Speed," The shutter is the device in a camera which obstructs light to the sensor. When the camera fires, the shutter briefly opens to expose the camera sensor to a controlled amount of light. The shutter then closes, obstructing the light again.Shutter speed is the time the shutter is open. This means it is the length of time a camera's image sensor sees the scene. This is usually a small fraction of a second.;
, Shutter speeds are measured in fractions of seconds. These times range from 1/8000 to several seconds long. Speeds of 1/60 or faster are the most commonly used speeds.


Anything below 1/60 may result in camera shake, which causes blurring on the picture. You will need to use a tripod if you use slower speeds.Typically only the denominator is marked on the camera. For example, ""125"" means 1/125 second.
Some cameras allow you to take photos at a shutter speed in full seconds, such as 1, 2, or 10 seconds. This is used for low light photography and a lot of movement., To know which shutter speed you should use in a situation, you first have to know what a fast and slow shutter speed is. Generally, 1/60 is the base shutter speed that marks the boundary between fast and slow.


Denominators larger than 60, like 1/125, 1/500, or 1/2000, are fast shutter speeds. Denominators below 60, like 1/30 and 1/15 are slow.
Shutter speeds that are full seconds long, like 1 or 2 seconds, are very slow shutter speeds., Most cameras have a shutter priority setting. This mode will allow you to choose the shutter speed based on the picture you want to take while the camera matches the aperture so you get the best exposure.On most cameras, the shutter priority setting is labeled ""S."" On some cameras, like Canons, this setting is labeled ""Tv.""
You can shoot in aperture mode and let the camera choose the shutter speed while you set the lens aperture.
In manual mode, labeled ""M,"" you set the shutter speed and aperture., The focal length of your lens can cause camera shake. Because of this, you need to take the focal length into consideration when choosing a shutter speed. If you have a long focal length, you will probably want to use a faster shutter speed.The shutter speed denominator should be at least equal, if not larger, than the focal length. For instance, a 50mm lens should be casually handheld at speeds no slower than 1/50 second; a 200mm lens should be no slower than 1/200.

, The main thing you want to do when you take a picture is eliminate camera shake. Use a faster shutter speed to avoid camera shake blur. Try at least 1/60 for this type of photo. If you have steady hands, 1/30 may produce a good picture.For this situation, a change in shutter speed has essentially no effect (other than on overall exposure level) unless something moves enough during the exposure to smear it by at least a pixel width. Even then, it will only make the picture a little soft unless something moves enough to smear it across many pixel widths.
An image-stabilizing lens or camera can let you hold the camera a stop or two slower, as can careful holding technique.
Setting the camera on something sturdy like a tripod eliminates camera shake, especially when you choose a slower shutter speed.

, Determining if what you want to photograph is still or in motion helps you choose a shutter speed. If you want to photograph something that is moving, you need a fast shutter speed.Use 1/500 for general photography of everyday events, sports, and subjects.
Use 1/1000-1/4000 when shooting subjects that are extremely fast and up close.1/1000-1/2000 works well when photographing birds. 1/1000 works well when taking photos of cars., When you take a picture of something moving, a slow shutter speed will catch the movement as a blur. This works really well for action shots of sports photography. A slow shutter speed will give you a blurry background.


You can also use this technique to pan the action by showing a still subject on a moving background. For this, use a shutter speed of 1/15.Follow the subject so that mostly the background, rather than the subject, moves relative to the camera and is blurred.
Use a slower shutter speed when shooting running water that you would like to be blurry.

, Light affects the exposure of your picture. The source of light determines what kind of shutter speed you will choose. If you allow too much light, your photo will be overexposed. If you let in too little light, it will be underexposed.Faster shutter speeds work well with a lot of light.
Slower shutter speeds are used with less light so that light can enter the camera and illuminate the photo.In situations where you have very low light, you may want to use multiple second shutter speeds.For this, you will need a tripod or something else to stabilize the camera.
Slow shutter speeds can be used at night. This will give you light trails, like from cars or fireworks. Try 2-30 seconds if you want to attain this effect.For getting an action shot in a dark area, increase the ISO sensitivity and choose a slow shutter speed. Use an external flash, and combined with the slow shutter speed (like 1/250), you can freeze the motion."

Click ""Next""., Just click through it by hitting ""Next""; you probably won't want to bother with anything therein., Again, these parameters do have some effect, but the defaults are usually pretty sensible. Hit Finish. You now have a high dynamic range image, but not one that can be displayed in a low dynamic range format (like the universal JPEG format). This is where tone-mapping comes in: compressing the dynamic range of the image you have created so that a 24-bit format like JPEG can appear to have more dynamic range than it really does., Hit the ""Tonemap the Hdr"" button in the toolbar.

But you may want to play with the others as well. Hit ""Apply"" to tone-map the image., Experiment with algorithms and their parameters on a reduced-size version of your image (you can pick a smaller one from the dropdown box of different sizes near the top left).

Under ""File name"", be sure to give your file a jpg extension., You'll need Adobe Photoshop, or its free and open-source alternative GIMP, or photo editing software of your choice.

Plan the album cover: If the party is to honor a friend or colleague for their birthday you might want to have a close up picture of the honoree (perhaps holding a sign or wearing a ribbon or hat announcing their birthday) as well as a group picture of everyone attending the party surrounding the honoree.

Organize your photo album as a book with many chapters. You might, for example, have chapters for food preparation, the food buffet, the guest of honor arriving, opening gifts, the cake, telling stories, a chapter for each game, and a chapter for the cleanup crew. For the first page of each chapter you might want to get a photograph of the people involved in that activity holding a sign announcing the activity. For the food preparation chapter you might want to have a full page for each person who made a special dish holding their specialty dish with, possibly the recipe for that dish in a text box on the page.;
, Take photos of your setup. Check photos to be sure that the lighting is good. Take photographs of groups of people as they arrive.

, If your party is an 'event', then there will be a core group of people that you want to get. If it is 'just a party', then try getting shots of the various groups that are there.

, Try to avoid lots of photos in which the participants are posing like tin soldiers. Is it a 'staid' event? Maybe a Christmas Party? Halloween???

, Another good reason to break out the camera early is because people will be a lot more amenable to surprise shots if they know there is a camera floating around.

, Either zooming in or out can make for an interesting shot. Try to capture facial expressions in your photographs.

, Quite often, this is a result of using your on camera flash.

, Go for natural lighting whenever possible.

, Know when the keynote speaker is supposed to speak, when the break out sessions are, etc.

, This can be something like shooting from your chair or at an unusual angle.

, Those can result in a variety of shots that you would never have gotten otherwise.

, Everyone gets stuck in a rut and their pictures can show that. Have someone else taking photographs for you.

First, turn your body so that your side is closer to the camera than your front. Stand with your back straight, shoulders down, and chest out. Finally, flex your stomach to bring in your waist..Don’t stand flat-footed. Instead, balance your weight on the ball of your feet.Ladies should cross their feet while they stand. This will slim their hips and can also make a photo more interesting.;
, Keep your arms away from your body to make them look slimmer. If you’re a woman, put the hand closest to the camera on your hip and point your elbow behind you. This will elongate your arm and help it look toned. Men can put a hand in their pocket, holding the arm away from their body. Next, hide your other arm behind your body or gently rest it on a chest-high surface.


If you have to face the camera directly and want your waist to look smaller, put both of your hands on your hips.Hold purses or bags slightly away from your body or over a self-conscious area., A well-defined jaw will make you look slimmer in photographs. Bring your head towards the camera by extending your neck. However, don’t simply point your chin at the camera as this looks unnatural. Angle your head slightly as you pose by tilting it to the left or right.Remember to keep your back straight while you pose. Otherwise, you may look like a turtle with your head stretched out.
Men should consider growing a beard that will help accentuate the jawline.

, Turn your body away from the camera towards your picture partner. Balance your weight on your back foot and drop your hips, relaxing your front leg. Put the other hand around or on your partner’s shoulder. If you want to look extra slim stand slightly behind your partner. Remember, never flatten your arm against your body.Women can put the hand closest to the camera on their lowered hip and push their elbows back.
Men can put a hand in their pocket and push the elbow out.

, Never be the closest person to the camera. This will make you appear larger than anyone else in the photo.Next, either put your hands on your hips or around the shoulders of your picture partners. If you can choose who you stand between, choose people with similar body types to your own. This will reduce a contrast between body types in photos.


If you’re especially self-conscious about your arms simply put them around your picture partners’ waists. They won’t be seen in the picture at all.
Women can cross their legs one in front of the other to appear slimmer. "

Organize the frame.,
Use a selfie stick.",How to Take Group Photos1," It is important to choose the right location for a group photo so that you have the best chance of getting a good view of all the people. For example, if there is a light source behind the photo’s subjects, the people will appear darker and less visible than if you position the picture so that the light is behind the camera instead.You also want to make sure that there is something you want to commemorate in the background of the photo, rather than something unappealing.;
, Different angles can make for a completely different picture. In general, if you hold the camera at a slight elevation and angle it down toward you, this will make for a more flattering picture., Use a front-facing camera (if possible) to make sure everyone fits in the screen. Rearrange people as needed to ensure everyone is visible in the picture. Make sure you can see everyone’s faces and that there aren’t any unwanted items in the background.


If you’re having trouble fitting everyone in the screen, it might be a good idea to try using a selfie stick.

, Selfie sticks allow you to capture more in the screen of the camera because it helps you hold the camera further away from your body. This means that you can fit more people into a group shot, or you can capture some cool scenery in the background behind your group shot. Either way, if you are having trouble fitting everything in because your arm just isn’t long enough, try using a selfie stick.


With most selfie sticks, your phone fits into a slot on the end and connects wirelessly (usually through Bluetooth) to the selfie stick. This allows you to use a button on the end of the selfie stick that you hold to take the photo, while your phone is too far away to physically reach the button.

Raise and lower the camera while taking practice photos to find your perfect angle.Men should push their chins out while taking photos from an overhead angle. This will make the jaw appear stronger.
Keep your chin down and turn your face slightly to the left or right., Find a spot that has light coming in from behind you. The light will filter around you and give you a soft glow.If you’re wearing dark clothing, pose against a light background for a slimming effect. If you’re wearing light clothing, pose against a slightly darker or lighter background. If the background is too dark, it will make you appear bulky.


Find natural sources of light. Avoid fluorescent lights at all costs.If you’re posting the selfies on the internet don’t use the same location for every selfie. Keep it interesting!

, Once you’ve taken a selfie you like, crop anything unwanted out of the picture. For example, if you like the way your face looks but you feel like your arm looks bulky, crop your arm out. Similarly, if you took your selfie in a bathroom, make sure you crop out the toilet or any beauty product clutter on the sink.Download a selfie app to help you crop photos more easily.

Get everyone ready.",How to Take Group Photos2," All cameras are different, but most have some kind of timer settings that allow you set up the camera and join the group before the picture is taken.


Some cameras even come with a remote feature that allows you to take pictures by clicking the remote rather than figuring out the timer process., Instead of having to find an object to prop the camera on and awkwardly adjust until it is pointing in the right direction, use a tripod. These hold the camera firmly in place and are adjustable to any angle. So you will always be able to aim at exactly the picture you want to capture.

, Look through the camera’s lens and make sure everyone is in the frame. If anyone is standing too far outside the camera’s view, tell them to move so that they’ll be in the picture. You can also check that everyone looks acceptable (hair in place, no ruffled clothing, etc.).

, The more people there are in a photo, the harder it is to get a good shot of everyone. Someone will inevitably blink or sneeze or look away. This problem gets exponentially worse when people don’t know when the exact moment of the picture will be. If you know your camera takes the photo after five seconds, you need to count out loud to five so everyone can be prepared.Many cameras have a flash feature that warns you when it is about to take the picture. Just make sure that everyone knows what to look for (the flash) so that they can be prepared when it is time for the picture.

, As the photographer, it is your job to ensure that everyone is visible and looking their best in the photo. Make sure that you can see all of the faces (especially if there are a lot of people of varying heights) and that no one will be embarrassed by anything in the camera’s frame – like spinach in their teeth or their fly being down., Try to be cute and funny to get people to feel more comfortable with you. This will help them produce more natural-looking smiles. Make sure you let everyone know when you are taking the photo so that they can smile on cue.

, Inevitably, someone will not look their best in each photo that you take, especially when you are dealing with large group shots. The more photos you take, the more likely it is that there will be one that is acceptable to everyone. Take several so that they have some to choose between.

, People look relaxed and comfortable when they're engaged in activity - smoking a cigarette, fixing their hair, petting the dog. Anything that keeps their mind off your lens is good.

, Forget that your camera has a viewfinder and an LCD. Get everything in focus, then hold the cam in front of you and rely on your own sight. This lets your subjects warm up to you and helps you read their expressions.

, Don't worry about framing the perfect shot while the camera is in your hand. Keep moving, getting as many angles and moods as possible. Click fast and often.

, Back at home, you can refine your raw material into a beautifully composed candid. Purists like Henri Cartier-Bresson shunned cropping as a kind of photographic half-truth; for the rest of us, there's Photoshop.

, Reframe the shot by moving the subject left or right in the viewfinder. If the background continues to be too cluttered, use a wide aperture. Using a wide aperture in the camera's aperture priority mode can throw the background out of focus so that the eye concentrates on the subject.

, Bright shapes or objects too near the edges of the frame will pull the viewer's eye away from the subject.

, Keep visual distractions away from the edges of what will be the final picture.

, Do what everyone else is doing so you fit in with the situation. Then when you see a good candid moment, bring your camera up to your eye.

, Nothing is more boring than a group of people with all backs turned to the camera. It just doesn't work

, If they object however, you need to stop. If you're not sure, it never hurts to ask permission before hand. Your subject may want to pose, so explain what you saw them doing and ask them to continue as if you weren't there

, Sometimes the artistic expression of a candid photo can be limited by you; the photographer. Try different angles, places and scenes. Look at candid photos created by others (they can be found in lots of magazines) for inspiration.

Consider your lighting.,
Set up the scene.,
Set up the composition of your photo.",How to Take Better Pictures of Your Kids," If you don’t have studio lights (which by the way you really don’t need), try to find a good natural light source like a window. You don’t want direct sunlight as it causes harsh shadows, so try to find a window where there is enough diffused light to create a little drama. Try to avoid flash unless it’s just too dark. If you can’t get enough light without it, place a piece of wax paper over the flash to help diffuse the light. This will help you avoid reflections off your piece and keep the colors more true to life. Now decide what you want your picture to say about your piece. If you really need to showcase the details in your image, you will want to shoot really close to your subject and make sure the light is illuminating those areas you want to focus on. If you want to tell a story with your image, or make a more dramatic picture, consider backlighting. Place your child facing toward the light and shoot from behind. This will create a silhouette and can make for a more interesting photo.;
, Get rid of all other distracting elements so you can so your image will focus on your child, or the story you are trying to tell about him/her. You can easily create a backdrop by using a black or white sheet. If you want a little more excitement, find a cute roll of patterned wrapping paper and use that as a backdrop. If you don’t want a backdrop, and want something which shows how it is naturally displayed, just try to crop in close so that you aren’t seeing the couch, or whatever other distractions there might be in the background. If you have a camera which will allow you to change the aperture, or select the style setting, you can help the background become less distracting by shooting wide open, or on a low number aperture. In many point and shoots, this is likely your portrait setting. What this setting will do is narrow your focusing area so that you will have a more shallow area of focus, leaving your ceramic crisp and your background blurry.

, The rule of thirds is a good baseline for doing this. Basically what that means is if you took a photograph and drew a tic-tac-toe grid on it from end to end you want all important elements of the photo to fall along one of those lines, or intersecting points. What that really means is, don’t always put your subject in the middle of your frame.

"
"
Frame what's important.,
Put some distance between the camera and the subjects, then zoom in a lot.,
Take pictures at eye level.,
Keep the sun behind and/or to the side of the subjects without having the sun show up on camera.,
Avoid taking pictures in very bright and very dim places if possible.,
Use the flash.,
Get subjects to show emotion.",How to Take Better Pictures of People for Free," On people, this is usually just their face and part of their upper body. Additional elements will cause more distractions. If their shoes are really that great and important, take a separate picture of them alone.;
, The more the camera is ""zoomed in"", the more flattering their faces become. Also, the blurrier the background becomes which draws attention to the subjects. The goal is to zoom in a lot, and stand back far enough so that step 1 is still accomplished.

, Unless there is a specific mood or message to the picture, eye level pictures are generally the most pleasing.

, By keeping the sun out of the subjects' eyes, it will minimize their squinting. Eyes are very attractive elements in portraiture.

, Scenes with too much light will show both very bright and very dark areas in the same picture. This often leads to distracting elements and loss of detail on subjects. To remedy, try finding shady areas (trees, umbrellas, etc). Poorly lit areas can cause the background to disappear from pictures and possibly show the subjects moving with blur. To remedy, try to find bright backgrounds while keeping the subjects poorly lit (the flash should light and freeze the subjects well)

, Many have the misconception that flash should only be used for night photography. If possible, set the flash to ""slow sync"" or ""fill light"" mode. Flash in the daytime lifts unattractive dark shadows that maybe caused by other sources of light such as the sun. Flash in ""slow sync"" or ""fill light"" mode at night will help the background (ambient lighting) show up in the picture while still seeing the subjects.

, A fake smile is easily seen through, so tell a joke, story or recall a memory to stir the appropriate emotion on their faces. There is nothing wrong with taking a picture when they are laughing or even crying as long as it looks natural. In fact, the results can be surprising this way.

"
"
Use a DSLR camera.,
Select a prime or zoom lens.,
Protect your gear from the elements.",How to Take Sports Photos1," Shooting sports photos requires a more versatile camera than still frame or simpler photography. DSLR cameras present clearer images through the viewfinder than other digital cameras. They have a wider range of settings that are designed with professional or skilled photographers in mind.Expect to pay at least $500 or so for an average quality camera. Higher quality cameras and lenses can run you multiple thousands of dollars.;
, The particular lens that you choose is about personal preference. Choose a prime lens for a sharper zoom, which gives you clearer images even when the lighting is not great. Pick a zoom lens for greater range flexibility if the things you’re shooting will be constantly moving closer or further from you.One drawback to a prime lens is that it’s distance range is lower, so you have to move around a lot more to get good shots.
One drawback to a zooms lens is that as you adjust the zoom length, you may lose the sharpness of the image.

, Whenever you are shooting outside, carry your equipment in a bag to make it easy to transport and keep it safe in case of rain. A fanny pack works well for extra film, batteries, or small lenses. A shoulder bag or backpack can carry your camera and larger lenses.Also look for hoods or covers that allow you to keep shooting in the rain without ruining your camera.

"
"
Adjust the ISO setting depending on the available light.,
Widen your aperture.,
Use a high shutter speed.,
Turn on your camera’s burst mode setting.",How to Take Sports Photos2," Pay attention to the light available to you and raise the ISO number as needed. Each camera has different options, so the exact setting will vary. Things that affect the lighting are being indoors or outdoors and how much sun is shining. When shooting at night, a setting of 1600 is good.ISO is important for indoor sports too as the lighting is not always high enough. You won’t need to set the ISO as high as night shoots, but higher than sunny day shoots.
You may need to change the setting at different points during the sports event if the lighting changes. Evening games that go into the night will pose particularly obvious lighting changes.

, Setting your aperture to one of the lowest possible numbers means that it will open wider. This allows more light in, which is helpful for most sports shots. A wide aperture also tends to blur things in the distant background, which sharpens the focus on what you’re shooting.Test this setting before the game starts to see how low you can go and still get quality shots.

, Sports photography seeks to capture quick movements in a still frame, so a faster shutter speed helps you get a crisp shot. 1/500 of a second is fast enough for most sports, but experiment with the highest speed your camera allows. Many cameras have a 1/1000 of a second speed.Remember that the shutter is only open for a fraction of a second, so it can’t let in much light. This is why increased ISO and aperture settings are helpful.

, High speed action means a great shot may pass before your lens in the time it takes to press a button. Burst mode takes 4-6 pictures with each click, so you increase your chance of catching the perfect shot.Keep in mind that this setting means your camera automatically takes extra pictures, so you have to wait until it’s done.
This will also fill your memory card up faster, so you may run out of space earlier. Plan ahead and have a second memory card, or a larger capacity memory card.

"

Scout your placement ahead of time.,
Anticipate upcoming moments of action.,
Include surroundings in your shots.",How to Take Sports Photos3," If you are able to be down close to the action, get to the event ahead of time and find the spots where you’ll have the best view of the playing area. Try to find a place where you can move around, crouch, and maybe even lay down. You want to pick a safe place where you won’t end up getting hit by the players.The coaches, officials, or other game authorities may restrict where you can stand, which is important to find out ahead of time as well.
If there are going to be other photographers at the game, getting there early will ensure you don’t lose a great spot to someone else.
Go to more sports games to take pictures, even if you don’t have a specific reason for being there. You’ll get practice but the stakes are lower.

, Great shots pass in a moment, so always be looking ahead of the action to where the action is moving. Learn the game well so you can tell when big plays are about to happen. You won’t have time to react if a great shot reveals itself, so always be ready.For example, when shooting a football game, watch for the quarterback to cock the football back as he prepares to pass. Or in baseball, watch as a runner nears second base as he may be about to slide.
If you have kids, take photos of them playing in the yard, watching for specific moments of action that would make good photos.

, Don’t focus all of your attention on close-ups of the players, because the game is more than that. Catch photos of the coaches on the sidelines or the crowd reacting to a big play. Take wide shots that show the pitcher’s reaction to a home run hit. All of the extras add drama to the shot.In between plays is a great time to get shots of the packed stadium, the many players on the sidelines, or the players on the field when they are resting. Don’t ignore a shot just because it isn’t action packed.
Sometimes when you take an up close photo of a player, you lose the context of what is happening around them.

"
"
Check photos at breaks or after the game.,
Improve after each game.,
Let your photos tell a story.",How to Take Sports Photos4," When you think you’re getting great shots, you’ll be tempted to check your photos constantly. Every time you take your eyes from the action to your camera, you potentially miss a great photo opportunity. Only check your photos when the action is stopped, or wait until the game is totally over.Once you take a shot, the moment has passed anyway. You either got a great shot or you didn’t, and checking your photo immediately won’t change that.
Looking away from the action also poses a potential safety risk because you won’t see a ball or player coming at you. Keeping your eyes on the action keeps you safer.

, Look through all of your photos and sort through which are good and which aren’t. Learn to be critical of your shots and pick out specific ways that you could have improved each one of them. Do your best to implement your self criticism the next time you take photos.Thinking that all of your shots are perfect leaves you no room to grow as a photographer. Don’t be afraid to be overly critical so that you can find your weaknesses and improve them.

, After you have carefully sorted through your photos and picked the best ones, organize them in a way that tells the story of the game. Include the high points and the sad moments to fully capture the whole story.If you have to pick one photo, choose the one that reveals the most about the game or has the highest emotional value. With a spread, pick a variety of shots that encompass the game.

Smile with your eyes.,
Show some teeth.,
Find your best angle.,
Hold your face level with the camera.,
Say a word that ends in ""uh.""",How to Smile for Pictures1," When it comes to smiling for pictures, the worst offense is flashing a jack-o-lantern: all teeth, no eyes. In order for your smile to look authentic, you've got to bring your eyes into it and give what is called a Duchenne smile. A true Duchenne smile is naturally authentic, since it's very difficult to engage the muscles around the eyes unless you truly have something to smile about.


Check out the difference in the mirror. Do you see how much less happy you look when your eyes aren't engaged?
When you're smiling for a picture, pretend like you're smiling at someone you love. Your eyes will crinkle convincingly and your smile will look authentically beautiful.;
, It's not necessary to give a big, toothy grin, but showing some teeth in your smile will brighten your face. Try showing just your upper teeth, rather than smiling so big that all of your teeth are exposed. If you prefer a close-mouthed smile, that's fine - just know that you'll probably look more serious than everyone else in the picture.

, Facing the camera head-on isn't the most flattering pose for most people. It flattens your features and can cause you to look a bit distorted in the photograph. Instead, show off your pretty bone structure by turning your head slightly to one side. If you have what you would consider a ""good"" side - a side that makes your features look finer - bare that side to the camera.


While angling your face can make your picture look more flattering, it can also look contrived if you overdo it. Make sure your face is tilted at what looks like a natural angle.
If possible, stand a bit below the camera, so that it's pointing slightly down at you instead of pointing up.

, If you tuck in your chin, the shape of your face will look distorted. If you tilt your head up and stick your chin out, it'll look like you're trying to hide a double chin. The most natural position for your face is to hold it level with the camera, as though you were going to have a conversation with it.

, Photographers love to tell their subjects to say ""cheese,"" but this tends to result in ""cheesy"" photos for two reasons. First, the ""ee"" sound stretches the mouth into an unnaturally, fake-looking smile. Second, your smile won't look authentic unless you're authentically cheerful, and being told to say cheese causes most people over the age of 8 to feel annoyed. The solution? Think of something you love that ends in an ""uh"" sound. Pronouncing ""uh"" causes the lips to form a more natural smile. Thinking of something you love also results in a natural smile. Doing both at the same time will help you produce your most gorgeous expression!For example, if you love a person named Elijah, think of him and say his name when it's time to smile for the camera. Any other person, place or thing works just as well, as long as it brings a smile to your face when you think about it.

Shoot in RAW.",How to Shoot an Outdoor Portrait," You need to put some thought into it and make a decision before you do it. You want something that will enhance your portrayal of the subject and not detract from them. What are you trying to 'say' with the photograph? A happily married couple with their children, a college graduate...they all have different requirements.


Be sure that traffic isn't whizzing by or there are a lot of crowds. You want your client able to hear you and concentrate on your instructions. Having to yell at each other will do nothing for the actual photograph.;
, Be sure that when you shoot your subject (with the camera, of course), that you want them to be tack sharp, but you want the background out of focus.

, Be sure that there are not busy or overwhelming patterns in their attire. Take into consideration what the location looks like and be sure that they don't clash or blend in.


If this is going to be a group portrait, be sure that everyone knows it and that their clothing will match somewhat. Darker colors are a good idea because this allows you to be sure their faces are what is seen and noticed in the photograph.

, Get in the trenches with them, so to speak, and show them how you want them to sit. It is a lot quicker and easier to do that, than try to verbally explain to them what you want them to do.

, Obviously your 5'4"" mother needs to be in front of her 6' son.

, That is always necessary. This will have the camera in one location while you move around and position the subjects the way they need positioned. It will also ensure that your image is as sharp as it can be.

, Unless going for an 'artsy' look, you will always want the eyes to be sharp. That is where people will look first most of the time.

, That would be early morning or late evening, but not dark yet.


Shooting at this time will reduce harsh lines and squinting from the sun.

, With it, you can direct the light where you want it. You will probably need an assistant to hold it and maneuver it, but it is a much better solution than using a fill flash.

, This will help to diffuse the light if it is too harsh. There are ways to make your own, if needed., You want to make sure that your depth of field is what you want.

, RAW is your image BEFORE it becomes an image. When you open a JPG, it has been converted with software from a RAW file. This will allow you to make a lot more tweaks and adaptations, if needed.

Have good dental hygiene.,
Brighten your teeth with whitening methods.,
Wear lipstick that makes your teeth look pearly.,
Make sure your lips are moisturized.,
Use other makeup to bring out your smile's contours.,
Be confident with what you've got.",How to Smile for Pictures2," Your best smile will stem partly from feeling confident in your appearance. If your teeth aren't clean, you're not going to want to reveal them to the world. Make sure you brush and floss your teeth and get regular dental cleanings to keep them looking as bright and pretty as can be., If your teeth are yellowed or discolored, you might feel more confident in your smile if you whiten them. There's no need to get an expensive whitening treatment done. You can brighten your smile in just a few minutes using a natural whitening technique. Here's what to do:


Rinse your teeth with hydrogen peroxide. It's a safe, natural bleaching agent that will brighten them a few shades.
Brush your teeth with baking soda. Add a little to your toothpaste or make a simple paste of baking soda and water, then brush away. Don't do this too often, though, or it could wear away your enamel.

, Certain lipstick shades downplay the yellow in your teeth and make them look brighter and whiter. You can give your smile a boost by applying one of these shades before you get your picture taken:


Rich berry reds. These contrast highly with your teeth to make them stand out.
Shades with blue undertones. They downplay the yellow in your teeth.
Steer clear of orange and yellow-toned lipstick. These bring out the yellow and make your smile look duller., Smiling with flaky or chapped lips can make you feel self-conscious and result in an unflattering picture. Exfoliate your lips with a facial scrub and apply lip balm or gloss to keep them in good shape. When it's time to smile, you won't worry about how your lips might look.

, Applying foundation, blush, and bronzer can provide contrast to your smile and make it stand out even more. Choose shades that work well with your skin tone. Your teeth will look whiter if you err on the side of using darker makeup that helps you look like you have a tan.

, Smiling isn't about looking perfect - it's about looking happy and confident. Your smile will look more beautiful if you face exudes confidence and relaxation. Worrying too much about your appearance will come through in your face, and you'll end up looking tense or disturbed in your photos. Just remember to be relaxed and think happy thoughts, and you'll be rewarded with a photo that captures you at your best.

Practice in the mirror.,
Feel out an authentic smile.,
Blink before smiling.,
Wet your teeth before you smile.,
Don't think too much about how you look.",How to Smile for Pictures3," If you have an event during which pictures will be taken coming up, and you're nervous your pictures will come out looking stiff, take some time to practice your smile beforehand. Look in the mirror and find your best angle and the right amount of teeth to show. Don't forget to smile with your eyes, too. When you find a smile you love, notice how it feels on your face, so you can replicate it at will.

, If you're worried that the expression on your face in pictures tends to look fake, pay attention to how it feels next time your face cracks into a genuine smile - like when someone is making you laugh, or your favorite comedy is cracking you up. Ask yourself the following questions that will help you ""memorize"" the way your authentic smile feels:


What feelings are flooding your brain when you flash a real smile? See if you can recreate those when you're in front of the camera.
What position is your face naturally taking? If possible, glance in the mirror before your smile fades and make a mental note of what your genuine smile looks like. When it's time to get your picture taken, try to recreate the facial positioning that come together to create your most winning smile.

, If your eyes tend to be half-closed in pictures, try a little trick to help you look wide-eyed and alert. Just before the photographer takes your picture, let yourself blink for a full second or two before opening your eyes and smiling. You'll be less likely to give in to the urge to blink when the flash goes off.

, If your teeth are a little dull, there's quick fix to try that requires no preparation: just before you smile, run your tongue over your teeth to wet them. Teeth that are a little shiny will look brighter than dry teeth. The gloss will keep your smile from looking dull. Some makeup artists actually advise rubbing a little vaseline over the front of the teeth to keep them looking smooth and shiny throughout the photo session.

, If you're worried about the way you look, chances are that negative emotion is going to show up in your smile. You'll end up looking tense and strained instead of natural and happy. Next time you're posing for the camera, ignore the photographer's encouragement to say cheese, and go to your own ""happy place."" Instead of thinking about how awkward your face must look, think about something that you can't help but smile about. Your positive feelings will shine through, brightening your smile.

Use ISO 400 indoors and ISO 200 outdoors.,
Use the zoom for close-ups.,
Stop asking young kids to smile!,
Keep it natural.,
Get down to their level.,
Get them used to the camera.,
Let kids take photos of each other.",How to Succeed in Taking Photos of Children," When taking photos of children indoors, use ISO 400 as the setting on your camera and use the flash as well. It will help with movement, shadows and will avoid fuzziness. During the day, take photos of children using ISO 200 to help avoid blurring.;
, That way, you don't even have to interfere with the game and children can keep on playing away happily as you snap away.

, It's a habit we all acquire but if you ask a young child to smile - what is the usual response? They grimace, frown, groan or poke out their tongues. Instead of insisting on the smile, talk with your kids, try to make them laugh and goof around a bit. At the same time, be 100% ready to take the photos at any moment.

, Capture kids at play, in concentration mode or talking to their grandparents and family members. Posing should be reserved for rare occasions; the best shots are those taken as the children are doing what comes naturally.

, The best photos of children are those taken at their level. Get down on your knees for the kids and down on your belly for the babies. The results are worth the dirty knees and sore bones!

, From as early an age as possible, use the camera around them so that they get used to it and don't fret upon its appearance.

, Familiarisation with cameras is a good pastime for kids. They have a different and equally valid perspective worth sharing - let them gave a go now and then and add their efforts to your photo album to encourage them.

Choose good photo editing software and learn how to use it.",How to Shoot Product Photography," If you do not understand the settings on your camera, then you are not using the camera to its full potential.


Use the camera and lens constantly.
You will develop knowledge of what the camera can do and how to maximize the camera's use by taking photographs of a wide range of products.;
, Harsh shadows are the enemy of good product photography.


The way to eliminate harsh shadows is through the use of multiple light setups and bouncing the light off of reflective surfaces.
It is not uncommon for product photography to make use of 3 or even 4 light sources to get the right shot.
Start out using a light source behind the product and the camera flash in front. Adjust the lighting by adding and moving lights around until you have the shot you need.

,


You can build a light box using white foam board, gaffer's tape, a straight edge and a hobby knife. These are all available from a craft store.
Cut the foam board to the size you need, using the hobby knife and a straight edge as a guide.

,, Set your lights so you have eliminated harsh shadows from the object. The white foam board acts as a reflective surface building a room of light all around the object.

,, No matter how steady you think your hand is, a tripod is even more so.

,


A busy background only hurts the product. The shot is about the product, not the background.
A light background, combined with a light-colored product, results in the product blending into the background. The same goes for a dark background and a dark product.
Let the background highlight the product.

, There are many good programs at a variety of prices. This software helps you edit and publish the right shot.

Know what you will be using the images for.,
Know your habits.,
See if your camera has a RAW + JPG setting to automatically record both kinds of files for each picture.",How to Choose Between RAW or JPG1,"


If you don't plan on any post processing, then consider using *.jpg.

, If you are prone to using the wrong settings, then you might want to consider *.raw. RAW files tend to be a little more recoverable.

, This gives you the more-or-less-finished JPGs for convenience, and the RAW files for careful editing where that may be desirable. The only cost is increased storage space consumption as well as possibly slightly reduced frame rate and buffer depth.

"
"
Consider why you haven't been shooting in RAW.,
Understand what RAW is.,
Examine the ability to make enhancements to your images.,
Realize the difference it can make when you photograph using RAW.,
Find a lab that uses RAW.,
Do some comparing to help you decide.",How to Choose Between RAW or JPG2,"


I don't know how use RAW files, I've never done it before.

Spend 5 minutes with your camera's manual and a few minutes with the help in your imaging program such as Photoshop that supports RAW files. Or worst case, a few minutes with the free software that came with your camera that supports raw files. You can also find a lot of free software on the Internet that will process RAW files.


They take up too much space.

Ok, you just spent at least $1000 (several hundred on a decent consumer point and shoot digital) and probably a lot more on your camera to take great pictures and you want to skimp on your memory cards? Memory is cheap when you consider how much it saves you over film. You can get multiple gig cards for under $100 today. With RAW files, that's still equivalent about 3 rolls of film on many cameras and you can use it over and over and over. If you are a professional or avid shooter, buy enough cards hold you until you can download to computer or storage device.


They slow the camera down.

Maybe in some cases, but with most of the Digital SLRs you have a buffer that lets you shoot from about 6 to 9 images before you have to wait for the camera to finishing saving to the card, so this becomes less of an issue. So unless you are shooting sports or doing a lot of rapid fire shooting, shooting RAW may still be the better way to go.


It complicates the workflow too much and slows me down.

Ok, yes, it ""Changes"" the work flow slightly, but it doesn't have to slow us down. As serious photographers, your goal should always be to get the best image you can both in camera and after the fact. Most of the cameras that can shoot raw files also came with software that will allow us to work on them, and/or convert the images to jpegs which is where they will usually end up before they go to the lab. If we do our job right to begin with, and get the images as close to what they should be in camera, we can do a batch convert to jpeg and be ready to crop and print. Go get a cup of coffee or do something else you need to be doing anyway while the computer does the batch convert. It doesn't take that long and let's face it, we always have something else productive that can be done while running a batch convert that is going to take several minutes. Once we have the jpegs, our workflow doesn't change.

;
, RAW files have a very minimal amount of processing done to them. This puts the responsibility and the ability of creating your image in your hands, not the questionable hands of a camera. You have to have software that will convert the images into images and not files. RAW files have all of the information in the metadata that it stores.

, When you a need to correct exposure, white balance, contrast and a host of other typical post processing tasks, doing so in a RAW file lets you do a better job since you have all of the original information in the image.


In fact with white balance, which can be a biggie if you shot with the wrong settings or the camera just didn't get it quite right, you can correct with absolutely no loss in image quality. When you do major tweaking a non-raw file, the more you tweak, the more you risk losing quality in the image. It may not be a lot in some cases, but it may be bad in others. You want to be able to go back to what the camera actually captured, instead of a jpeg that was converted in camera and a lot of information tossed out.
What if the one shot that needs serious correction is a jpeg and is the money making shot, you just know it. But it's just too far off in one or more areas to adjust and really get the quality you need? Yeah, maybe you can do some magic in Photoshop, but if you are striving for excellence, you'd have a much better chance of getting the best if you had a RAW file to work with and it would take much less time. Think about that when your concerns of slowing the workflow down come up.

, You load your image into a raw conversion program and then save to a TIFF or .PSD format file which will be exported in 16 bit mode. The 12 or 14 bits recorded by the camera are then spread over the full 16 bit workspace. If you've saved the file in-camera as a JPG than it is converted by the camera's software to 8 bit mode and you will only ever have 256 brightness levels to work with. You reduce your options, 'right out of the gate'.

, Some labs are even starting to process from RAW files. There also should be options on line for you to choose from.

, Shoot a daylight image with white balance set for tungsten as a jpeg and another as a raw image. Shoot the same subject so you can compare. Now, take 30 seconds to correct the raw image to daylight. Now see how long it takes to do on the jpeg, if you can even get close. And don't even think about saying that you would never, ever shoot with the white balance or other setting set incorrectly. Don't even go there!!! Everyone makes mistakes. The point is, shooting raw is much more forgiving than jpeg and there's nothing wrong with that, especially when our images are important to us. Using JPEG compared to RAW is like throwing away your negatives on film. You figure what the heck, you can always make a copy of your print if you need to fix something. It just isn't the same. The choice is yours.

Pick beach-themed clothing and accessories.,
Make use of towels.,
Use boats.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Use a bicycle.,
Take pictures with a surf board.",How to Take Beach Themed Engagement Photos1," Before leaving for the photo shoot, get some beach-themed accessories and clothing. You can use these to enhance your photos while taking pictures on the beach.For example, you can grab things like towels, umbrellas, hats, and visors. Even quirkier items, like pales and buckets, can make for unique photographs.
Wear beach-appropriate outfits. Wear things like shorts, tank-tops, and even bathing suits.;
, A towel can make for a great accessory for a beach-themed photograph. Try spreading towels over the ground and take some pictures. An umbrella over a towel can really highlight the beach theme.Try holding hands on a towel to show off your rings. You can also kiss in a way that makes the rings visible.

, A boat can add to the beach theme. You can sit on the ledge of a kayak that's resting in the sand, for example, or take a picture of the two of you on a romantic canoe ride. If you have boats to use, add them to your engagement photos to showcase the fun beach theme.If you don't have a boat, see if any beaches in your area allow you to rent them for a fee.

, Sunglasses are a great accessory for beach-themed engagement photos. Try wearing sunglasses during pictures to show you're enjoying soaking up the rays at the beach.Try grabbing on to your sunglasses in one photos to highlight the ring.
Try kissing while wearing sunglasses.

, Many people enjoy bike rides on the beach. Try taking a photograph of you and your partner enjoying a romantic bike ride. You can ride a bicycle with two sets and ride two bikes side by side.If you don't have a bicycle, see if you can rent them from somewhere near the beach.

, Bring a surf board and take pictures with you. You could play with the board by standing on it or hold it up as a couple. You can bring a surf board from home or rent one near the beach."

Buy a card reader.,
Be careful when buying memory cards.,
Buy another battery.,
Shoot raw.,
Shoot carefully.",How to Use Old Digital Cameras," Forget trying to use the manufacturer's software or drivers to copy files from your camera; if your camera is very old, it probably won't work with modern operating systems. Every common card reader will work with every operating system from the last decade.
Even if you could get the manufacturer's software to work, the very cheapest $5 card reader will copy files much faster than trying to transfer them directly from the camera.

, Some old cameras will not work with larger memory cards. Check your manual; if it doesn't specify an upper limit it's generally safe to assume that it can't handle cards larger than 2gb (the maximum that the old FAT file system could address).
This isn't as big a deal as it might seem; older cameras typically have much less resolution than modern ones, so the files tend to be much smaller. It also means you don't need to cheap out with off-brand memory cards, as well-known cards from manufacturers like SanDisk are very cheap in this size range.
, Batteries wear out over time, and it's almost guaranteed that an old camera will get substantially fewer shots on a charge than a new one. Don't bother with genuine batteries; even if you can still obtain them, they tend to be so expensive that it's not economically viable to do so. As you've got no warranty to void, there's no reason to avoid cheap after-market batteries; most of them are actually very good, and some actually work better than the manufacturer's originals.Remember to dispose of your old battery in an environmentally sound way.
, Older cameras generally do not do such a great job of getting superb images when shooting JPEGs, and often have some issues with colour accuracy. Carefully-processed raw files often give much better results.
, Very old cameras tend to have slow read and write speeds; therefore shooting blindly then looking at your LCD can take a frustrating amount of time. Treat it like a film camera; shoot slowly and thoughtfully.

Pay attention to your highlights. Old cameras don't handle high contrast scenes as well as modern ones do. Fix your lighting by moving somewhere else, by shooting at a different time of day, or by simply popping up your built-in flash.
Keep your ISO as low as you can. Old cameras cannot shoot in near-darkness and maintain clean images like modern digital cameras (especially modern SLRs) can.
Pay attention to your white balance and exposure. Old cameras rarely do a good job of getting automatic white balance perfect. They also rarely nail the exposure perfectly; use your camera and learn what situations will require exposure compensation. (You'll probably find yourself defaulting to about -2/3 exposure compensation most of the time.)

Learn some reasons to shoot JPG.Files are smaller and therefore more of them fit on a card.",How to Choose Between RAW or JPG3,"* For many applications image quality is more than sufficient (family snapshots, news images).
Small files are more easily transmitted wirelessly and online. This is important to newspaper photographers.
Many photographers don't have the time or inclination to post-process their files.
Many cameras (especially digicams) can not shoot quickly when working in raw mode. Some lower-end models can't record raw files at all.

Get close for pictures.,
Take a combination of candid and posed shots.,
Pose in the sand and the water.,
Try kissing on a deck.",How to Take Beach Themed Engagement Photos2," Getting close to your partner is important for any engagement photos, including beach photos. While being photographed, cuddle, kiss, hold hands, and otherwise get close.Make use of your beach surrounding while cuddling for your photographs. You can, for example, hold hands while walking in the water barefoot or share a kiss while swimming.

, Go for some deliberate poses, especially if you have rings. You want to have some photos where your ring or rings are clearly visible. However, candid photos can be great as well. This may lead to unexpected poses or facial expressions that showcase your personalities and the nature of your relationship.Make use of the beach for candid poses. You can, for example, splash in the waves or play beach-related games like volleyball.

, Talk to your photographer about how to use the sand and water to inform your pictures. You can take pictures of the two of you, say, seated on a towel in the sand. Try to get some shots walking through the water or even swimming., Kissing on a deck can make for a romantic pose. If there is a deck on the beach where you're shooting, take a few posed kissing photographs there to emphasize the beach theme.If you have rings, you can hold your hands in a position that shows them off while kissing on a deck.

Take advantage of sunrises and sunsets.,
Get in the water.,
Use rocks.,
Photograph reflections.",How to Take Beach Themed Engagement Photos3," Try to aim to be at the beach around a sunrise or sunset. A sunrise or sunset over the water or sand can give you a romantic backdrop for a variety of photographs.Try kissing in front of a sunset or sunrise, for example, or holding hands with your partner.

, As you're at the beach, make use of the water for your photographs. Using the ocean or lake on your chosen beach can emphasize the beach theme of your wedding photos.You can try walking through the water together barefoot.
If you brought swimsuits, take some pictures swimming. Kiss or cuddle in the water to show off the beach theme.

, If there are rocks in or around the water, make use of them. Take candid photos of you and your partner climbing the rocks. Stand on a rock in the middle of the water and snap a picture of the two of you kissing. You can also sit on a rock together and cuddle for pictures., Make use of the water surrounding a beach. Strive to take photographs of you and your partner's reflection. This can make a fun addition to your engagement photo album."
"
Choose the best time for beach photographs.,
Be flexible.,
Have a backup plan in place.",How to Take Beach Themed Engagement Photos4," In general, aim to schedule a beach photography trip at the beginning or ending of the day. Less people will be present, allowing you to take photos without disturbing others. Sunrises and sunsets also produce better lights and angles for photographs., This is important for any type of engagement photos, including beach photos. Do not go in with a very specific plan. Be willing to listen to your photographer and take their suggestions. Try to do what feels right when interacting with your partner. Allow for some spontaneous kissing, cuddling, and hand holding., Weather can always affect a beach photo shoot. Check the forecast, but keep in mind things like wind and rain can come unexpectedly. Have a few days in mind to reschedule in case weather affects your plans."
"
Understand what white balance is and how it affects your digital camera's picture.,
Find the white balance control on your camera.,
Try your ""Auto"", ""Daylight"", ""Cloud"" and ""Shady"" white balance settings under daylight.,
Try using your ""cloudy"" and ""shade"" settings to get warm colours, even in daylight!,
Use white balance trims to get your colours perfect.",How to Adjust Your Digital Camera's White Balance," Different kinds of lighting look the same to the human visual system (although once you, as a photographer, know that there is a difference, you'll look for and notice it everywhere!). Our brains compensate for it automatically, so that a white thing will look white under any light. But a subject in the shade is slightly bluer than the same subject in bright daylight, and incandescent lightbulbs are very orange compared to both.
People who shoot film need to use coloured filters on their lenses (or use special films). A digital camera can digitally alter the colour information from its sensors to compensate for the different colours coming from various light sources. The setting which controls how and to what extent this is done is called the white balance. Apart from compensating for the colour conditions, though, the white balance control can be used to warm or cool colours for artistic effect.

Most cameras have a white balance control, and will have all or some of the following settings:







Automatic white balance. The icon for this is either ""AWB"" or ""A"". The camera will analyse the image and set the white balance automatically.






Daylight. This is for shooting in direct sunlight.






Cloudy light. The light on an overcast day is somewhat cooler (bluer) than it is in direct sunlight, so this setting compensates by warming the photograph.






Shade. Subjects in shady areas will be slightly bluer than daylight (and bluer than with overcast weather, too), so this setting compensates by warming the colours even more. You can also use this setting to get warm colours even in daylight. (The photograph at the top of the page compares Auto"" with the Shade setting.)






Flash. Flash light is slightly cooler than daylight, using this setting will warm the picture a tiny bit compared to the ""Daylight"" setting. This only applies for situations in which the flash is the sole source of lighting. If you're balancing ambient light and flash, and the ambient lighting also needs correction, then you might need to use coloured filters on your flash to match the ambient lighting and then use a white balance setting appropriate for the ambient lighting.






Tungsten. Light from tungsten bulbs is substantially more orange than daylight, so the camera compensates by adding blue to the picture.






Fluorescent light. Fluorescent lamps are somewhat redder than daylight (less so than tungsten bulbs, however), so this setting will compensate by cooling the picture somewhat.






Preset white balance. You take a photograph of something of a neutral colour under the lighting, then your camera effectively subtracts the colour of said image from your subsequent photographs. This is often the only way of getting good results under ""energy saving"" lighting. It can often get more accurate results under artificial lighting than the white balance settings dedicated to that kind of lighting.
Setting this differs from camera to camera, so read your manual. You can either use a grey card or an ExpoDisc (or make your own 'ExpoDisc' with a coffee filter).













Manual white balance. This allows you to specify a colour temperature for which to correct. Nikon cameras call this ""K""; on most cameras you can specify the temperature by spinning the front command dial.
Some compact cameras lack white balance settings entirely and put them as scene modes. You'll have to figure out the effects yourself. A ""Foliage"" mode will typically bias the colours towards green, ""Sunset"" will make them warm, ""Fall Foliage"" will also warm the picture.;
, See your manual for details, but here are a couple of hints:

Digital SLRs will usually have a button on the top or back of the camera that says ""WB"". You hold the button down while spinning one of the control dials, to adjust it. (The cheaper Nikon digital SLRs omit this.)





On your compacts, it's generally buried fairly deep in the menus, because they really don't want you messing with it, but you can get there. Hit the menu and it's generally in the camera or shooting mode, you'll find the setting white balance or WB and once again, press the button and choose which white balance you want to use.
If the white balance control does not do anything, or if you can't find it in your menus, it could mean you're in a ""Scene"" or Auto mode which locks out this control. Try shooting in a semi-automatic exposure mode, like Program.

, Most of the time the colours will be too cool in ""Auto"", and you'll also find that things will look much nicer in the other settings. This differs from camera to camera; some cameras (specifically camera phones) have terrible white balance algorithms in some settings.
, As said, these settings are intended to compensate for bluer light, but you can use them to warm your colours, too. Cameras have built-in colour correction algorithms, not built-in artists; they don't know that your photograph should be warm.
, You might find, for example, that under certain kinds of indoor lighting your camera almost gets the white balance perfect in its ""Auto"" setting, but could do with being a little cooler, or that your sunsets would be perfect if they were a little bit warmer. This is where white balance trims (called ""hue adjustment"" on some cameras) come in: it allows you to take one of the camera's white balance presets, and adjust them slightly warmer or cooler to get perfect results. On all but the cheapest Nikon SLRs, you can do this by holding the white balance button and spinning the front control dial. Many cameras lack this adjustment entirely.

Study your favorite smiles.,
Recreate these smiles.,
Practice your signature smile.",How to Smile for the Camera1," Studying old images of yourself is an easy way to identify your signature smile. Flip through a photo album, click through your social media pictures, or thumb through a stack of photographs of yourself. Note your favorite pictures and consider why you like these images of yourself:


Is your head tilted in a certain way?
Do you have a toothy grin or are your lips closed?
Are your eyes focused on the camera or staring off in the distance?
Is your face relaxed, with wrinkles around your eyes and mouth?
Does your smile look natural or forced?;
, While standing in front of a mirror, try to replicate your favorite smiles.


Replicate your body position in the photos—tilt your head and angle your shoulders as they appear in the photograph.
Recall the moment captured by the camera and note your emotions.
Channel these memories and feelings; embody them with your smile., To master your signature smile and flash it on command, you must devote time to practicing your grin. Continue to practice your smile in front of a mirror—recall the memory, recapture the emotions, and produce your signature smile. Gradually, your muscle memory will improve and it will become more natural to flash your signature smile."

Be aware of the ability for your images to be geotagged.,

Understand the risks involved.,

Know when to use the geotagging feature and when not to.,

Know how to disable your cell phone's or camera's geotagging feature.,

If using geotagging websites, control with great care the people who are able to see where you're located.,

Be aware where you post your pictures and what geotagged information you leave.",How to Avoid the Potential Risks of Geotagging," Geotagging is the process of adding geographical identification to photographs, video, websites and SMS messages. It is the equivalent of adding a 10-digit grid coordinate to everything you post on the internet. Many people are unaware of geotagging possibilities held in the gadgets they own, while for others, they know but forget to disable them. Images from many digital cameras and cell phones capture not only the picture but all the related information ranging from make of the camera to location and latitude where the image was taken.
While not all cameras capture the geotagging information, a lot of cameras do, such as the Canon brand; and such cameras will include the metadata (shutter speeds, flash, and other settings) embedded into the individual photo. In GPS devices like iPhones and other smartphones, additional information is automatically captured, such as longitude and latitude of where the image was taken. Using particular tools and programs, a person determined to find out this type of information can decipher any geotagged image and retrieve the information for their own purposes.

Geotagging websites such as Yelp, Foursquare and Facebook's Places are also able to pinpoint your location when you check into public places such as cafes, restaurants, and theaters.Photo sites such as Flickr and Picasa can provide geotagging information but this is not an automatic function.;
, Geotagging information could potentially give someone intent on scaring you (such as a stalker) or a potential house thief the opportunity to know your exact whereabouts, particularly where you've cross-posted your check-ins on places such as Twitter and any other sites. For example, say you take a photo of your favorite garden rose, posted it online and left a message on Twitter about the photo: ""Just took this rose in my garden before I left the house 5 mins ago"". In doing this, you've just signaled to anyone watching your account that you've left your house and if they wanted to find the address via geotagging and you haven't removed that information, it can be found.

Another problem with geotagging is that it has the potential to ""establish patterns"" of your movements.If you post photos or use geotracking sites on a regular basis, it is possible for someone to work out where you end up at particular times during the day. This might allow a person to determine where you work and live, simply by watching your daily patterns.

, There will be occasions when it's clearly not appropriate to use geotagging on images, especially where the information you're sharing is about a private residence, such as the location of your home or another person's private residence:

Private locations such as residences, schools, a beach house, or a hotel room are private and it's never wise to broadcast the address by geotagging.
Never geotag photos containing children.
Public settings such as a beach, an amusement park, a camping trip in the mountains, and so forth, might be fine for geotagging and can be a great way to keep tabs on the dates and locations of vacations and fun days. All the same, if this information has the ability to reveal something personal about yourself that should not be made public, think twice.
House or college dorm parties might be the highlight of your weekend but it's important to be cautious when posting pictures of the event to the internet.

, Every smartphone has the geotagging feature automatically set to operate, so you need to put in the effort to prevent it from doing this. It's recommended that you disable the geotagging ability and enable it again when you make a conscious decision to use it; it's far better to opt in than to try to remember to opt out.

If using an iPhone, disable it through the ""Settings"" page of the geotagging program. Tap ""Settings"", then ""General"" and then ""Location Services"". Disable the applications that use GPS data. For older iPhones, tap ""Reset Location Warnings"" under ""Reset"" to cause the phone to prompt you about using geolocations when using the relevant applications. If you have a hard time remembering to disable the geolocating features of your iPhone, consider leaving it off permanently.
On a Blackberry, go to the camera icon. Press the ""Menu"" button, select ""Options"" and set the geotagging option to ""Disabled"". Click ""Save"".
On an Android, start the camera application. Open the menu to the left and go to ""Settings"". Turn off ""Geotagging"" or ""Location storage"" (the name depends on the version of Android you own).
For your digital camera, read the user manual. Not all digital cameras come with geotagging and the manual will explain whether it does and how to shut off the GPS features.

, Each website differs in how it confines your information to only those people whom you want seeing it; always be sure to read the instructions carefully and don't just rely on the default setting which might be allowing anyone to see your whereabouts (or the metadata in your images, such as on photo sites).

Be aware of the tags you're using. Many people include the name of the city, town, or country with the photo in the tags, and there are many location-specific tags too. Tagging photos with an exact location on the internet allows random people to track any individual's location and correlate it with other information. The tags are completely within your control, so think carefully about the information you share.
Always check a geotagging site's default settings and what needs to be done to fix automatic geotagging defaults. Facebook Places is active until disabled - read How to disable Facebook Places for the instructions.

, Security and safety come first. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of geotagging pictures on the internet, either upload them to a website that has different security settings that can be easily managed to protect your privacy, like Facebook, or use another image capturing device that lacks a GPS enabled feature.

If you want to wipe geotagging information from your photos, look for free EXIF editors online. These will help you to wipe that information from the photos.
Don't check in to geotagging sites from home and don't include your GPS coordinates in your Twitter updates.

Combat a toothy grin by shifting the position of your tongue.",How to Smile for the Camera2," To achieve a consistent natural smile, it is important that you commit to having fun during the photo shoot. Jump around between shots to stay loose. Recall funny memories or jokes to make yourself laugh during the session. Fill your mind with happy thoughts that will ease your nerves. Don’t take the photo-opt too seriously, but stay calm and enjoy your time in front of the camera., To relax your face, begin by taking a deep, cleansing inhale. On the exhale, smile. Simultaneously, relax your forehead, release your brow, and unclench your jaw. There will only be slight points of tension at the corners of your eyes and lips., Wrinkles are a byproduct of your natural grin. A natural smile causes lines to appear around your mouth. It also produces small lines around your outer eyes. When you fake a smile, these lines are less likely to appear, causing your grin to look forced., While flashing some of your teeth is acceptable, it can be unbecoming to reveal all of your teeth when you smile. Fortunately, there is a quick and simple trick to avoiding the joker grin. Raise your tongue and place it directly behind your top front teeth. This will lift your chin and relax your mouth."

As you relax, you will feel more comfortable and confident in front of the camera., When smizing, it is essential that your eyes are full of life and energy. Open your eyes wide and search the camera for a focal point. You may choose to focus on the lens, a logo, or a specific button. By connecting with the camera, you will generate a twinkle in your eyes and a sense of vibrancy in your face.


Staring off into the distance can cause you to look bored and lifeless., Posture is the key to an exceptional picture and a memorizing smize. Pull your shoulder down as you extend your neck and head up.Once your neck is elongated, bring your head forward and lower your chin slightly.This will result in an elegant posture and an exquisite look., When smizing, the alluring look rests in the squint of your eyes. In order to keep your forehead wrinkle free, you must squint from below not above. As you pull up the muscles below your eyes, consciously strive to relax your brow and forehead. This will produce a mysterious, enticing glint in your eyes., To pull of a convincing smize, you must exude confidence. As you continue to squint, transform your relaxed lips into a glorious natural smile. Maintain your elegant body position and sustain eye contact with the camera. Push aside your insecurities and tell yourself that you are powerful and full of confidence."

Shine external light on your focal point.",How to Do Night Time Photography," You’ll want a camera that lets you adjust how much light and movement you can capture. Doing nighttime photography requires you to be in control of these changes, rather than relying on a camera’s automatic mode.You may also use a film SLR camera. While these cameras will take nice pictures at night, they are more difficult to use. Digital SLRs now provide the same capabilities as film cameras, so make a choice depending on your preferences.;
, Lens size, or focal length, is measured in millimeters. Wide-angle lenses have smaller focal lengths than typical lenses, ranging from about 35 to 10 mm. Wide-angle lens allow you to let in more light in order to capture broader scenes than the naked eye. This makes them perfect for nighttime photography.Wide-angle lens are especially recommended when shooting the night sky.

, It’s important to keep your camera as stable as possible when taking pictures at night. Because you’ll be experimenting with the amount of time your shutter remains open to let in light, you’ll need an extremely still camera. This will minimize any blurriness to give you sharp and clear images.If you’re going to be doing a lot of walking to reach your spot, try a lightweight aluminum tripod.
If you’re concerned about your camera’s stability, purchase a large and sturdy carbon-fiber tripod. Be aware that these tripods are both heavier and more expensive than alternatives., When you push the button on your camera to take a shot, you create a small amount of vibration. To avoid this movement, use a cable or wireless remote that allows you to push the button from a distance.If you don’t have a cable or remote shutter release, use your camera’s self-timer feature. This will allow you to engage the shot and then step away from the camera.

, It’s important that you’re able to see when you travel to your chosen spot and set up your equipment. If you’re in total darkness, a flashlight is essential for safety.Your flashlight may also work as an external flash bulb. You can shine it on your subject to help your camera focus on that subject.

, You don’t want your camera to die on you or run out of storage space during the middle of your photography session! Check that you have a minimum of 8Gs of free space, and fully charge the battery the night before., RAW is a type of file format for images. Unlike JPEG files, RAW files store all the data recorded by your camera’s sensor when you snap a photograph. JPEG files compress some of this data. You’ll generally want to make some post-photography edits with nighttime photographs, and taking RAW files gives you more control over those adjustments.RAW files also record higher levels of brightness, or steps from black to white, than JPEGs. This gives you a smoother transition in color tone, a crucial feature for nighttime pictures.

, Be sure to minimize the vibration and movement your camera is subjected to while you photograph. Either set up your tripod or place your camera on an extremely flat and stable surface.

, The aperture is the size of the opening in your camera’s lens, measured in f-stops. Moving from one f-stop to the next doubles or halves the size of the opening and, as a result, the amount of light you let in.Start with a small f-stop, such as f/2.8, to let in a higher amount of light. Wide-open apertures are optimal for shots of the starry night sky.Experiment with higher f-stops, such as f/16, f/18, or f/22, for low-light exposure. Low lighting can also produce great nighttime shots, especially if you’re photographing landscapes that have streetlights., The shutter speed refers to the amount of time your camera shutter is open, measured in seconds. This affects the level of light let in and the amount of movement that’s captured. For night shooting, start with slow shutter speeds, such as 10-30 seconds. This long exposure time should provide you with excellent shots of the stars, nighttime traffic, or cityscapes., The ISO refers to the sensitivity of your camera’s image sensor to light. The lower the ISO, the less sensitive the camera is to light, which results in less grain in your image. Higher ISOs of above 500 will give you more light sensitivity and more grain, which is important for nighttime photography.If you’re worried about “noisy,” or overly grainy shots, you can experiment with lower ISOs of between 100 and 500., Most cameras have a light meter reading on their viewfinder or live view display. This readout gives you the exposure value of your image, which indicates whether your image will be properly exposed based the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.You want your light meter to hover just over zero, rather than a negative or positive number. Adjust your aperture, shutter speed, and ISO based on your needs for the photograph while also aiming for zero.

, This will pre-flip the mirror, exposing your digital image sensor, before your push the button to take your shot. As you won’t be able to use the viewfinder after you’ve set up the mirror lockup, choose this feature only after your shot is completely set up., While your phone isn’t comparable to a digital camera, it can still capture images in the dark. Stabilize your phone on a tripod or flat surface, minimize your use of the flash, and don’t engage the zoom., In most nighttime photographs, your main focus will be the sky and the stars. Angle the camera so that the sky dominates the upper and middle sections of the picture., Adding an interesting element at the base of the shot will provide contrast with the sky and complete the photograph. Try unique rock formations, mountains, trees, or even your car., The moon and stars will affect your photograph in different ways. A full or bright moon will light up elements of foreground, but will make it difficult to see the stars. Without a moon, your foreground will be darker, but the stars will be more visible.For a balance between the two, photograph at the beginning or end of the moon’s cycle.

, In order to see your chosen focal point in the shot, you may need to brighten it up. Experiment with the amount of light you shine by employing a variety of light sources.Try using a flashlight or headlamp for a small amount of extra light to help your camera focus. These small sources won’t add too much artificial light to the shot.
Use your car’s headlights or portable studio lights to illuminate a large object like a building or rock structure. Bring shields just in case you need to dampen the amount of light you receive from these larger sources.
Remember to turn off your camera’s built-in flash, as this will wash out the entire landscape.

Have a balanced stance when you hold the camera.,
Create a tripod with your knee.,
Lean the camera against an object.",How to Do Night Photography Without a Tripod1," You can get better images at night without a tripod by having a balanced stance when you hold your camera and take a picture. Plant your feet about shoulder width apart. Then, hold the camera in your dominant hand and tuck your elbows tightly into your chest. This will make it easier for you to keep the camera steady and get a good shot, even in the dark.Always hold the camera with your dominant hand around the body and use your other hand to hold the bottom of the lens. This will make it easier to keep the lens steady.
Make sure you also control your breathing, inhaling as you take an image and exhaling once it has been taken. This will help you minimize any sudden movements of your body that can blur the image.;
, You can create a makeshift tripod with your body so your images turn out sharp and clear. To do this, get in a crouching or seated position and rest your elbow on your knee. Place your dominant hand on the body of the camera and use your other hand to hold the bottom of the lens. Keep your elbows tucked in for better support.You can also try shooting while lying down on your stomach to minimize any shaking or moving of your hands. Let the camera sit directly on the ground. Then, place your fist or palm under the lens to prop it up. This will allow the camera to be stable and tilted upward to capture an image.

, You can also improvise by using a stable object as a makeshift tripod. You may try leaning the camera against a bean bag, a heavy rock, or even your camera bag. Just make sure that the object is stable and will not fall over, as you do not want your camera to get damaged.You may also try using a flat surface as a tripod. This could be a flat, solid slab of rock or a wooden ledge that is at a certain height. Place the camera on the surface and use the timer on the camera to capture an image or crouch behind the camera and capture the image that way.

, Walk around and determine what will have the best angle and lighting conditions for you. What you are looking for is:


An angular perspective. You don't want to be directly in front of, but at an angle.
Look for foreground elements. You might want to include them, or not. You need to be aware of them.

, Turn it around until you get the best result.

,, You will need to adjust the aperture and shutter speed.


A small aperture is the higher number. Look at it like a fraction. 1/2 is much bigger than 1/8. Try about F16 to start with.

, This will help keep the sharp parts sharp in your photo.

,, Look for areas that are too dark or blown out.

Start by setting your alarm for around 3 in the morning...it sounds ridiculous yes, but to get the full on beauty of the crater you need to be there for the elusive sunrise.,
Before your departure, be sure that your own personal mode of transportation (rental) is fueled up fully as to not promote further delay while on your journey.

,
Be sure to bring warm clothing as the days can be rather unpredictable but rather cold in the morning.

,
Bring water and some snacks.,
Have a tripod.,
The early trek up to the top of the mountain will give you the optimal timing and perfect light to take lovely snapshots from all aspects.,
As the natural light moves throughout the day you should be inspired to venture down in through the crater as some of the best photographs can be taken of the interesting vegetation using macro to emphasize the beauty and details.

,,, You will be hiking, as well as standing out in the sun, and it will have warmed up by the time you depart.

, It is your own eye that will be taking the pictures, a tripod of any sort is ideal for grabbing snapshots of you and others.

, The lighting is perfect and only gets progressively better.

,,, Spread out the shots. The scenery will still be there but the lighting will change. Different lighting can open new beauties, so be mindful not to spend to much time or film on any one scene.

,, Part of the beauty is the vast expanse, and panoramic photos can help convey a sense of perspective.

,, The crater can be very dusty and travelling with any camera, be sure to have a case to protect it.

Set your expectations for the picture.,
Determine the subject.,
Mount the camera on a tripod.",How to Photograph an Easter Lily1," Do you want the whole plant?, the bloom?, the reproductive parts? Knowing what you hope to capture will help you decide on aperture (depth of field), light and speed.

If you want to blur the background and only show the bloom or part of the bloom, use a wide open aperture (F1.4 or as low as the camera goes).
For the whole flower to be clear, use a larger aperture (F11 or higher).

, Will the photograph be of a cut lily or the live plant? A cut lily could be put in a light box, where it would be easier to set up the photographs. If live, take care how you work the plant and manipulate it. Notice here how delicate the stem is.

, Yes, you could shoot handheld, but if you want the picture to be 'tack sharp', use a tripod (or use a super fast shutter speed)."
"
Go for a wide aperture setting.,
Use a high ISO setting.,
Adjust the shutter speed.,
Check if your camera has a night mode setting.",How to Do Night Photography Without a Tripod2," Because you are shooting in low light at night or perhaps no light at all, you should have your camera set at a wide aperture. Use the widest aperture setting on your camera, also known as the smallest F number or F-stop. This will help to bring in as much light as possible into the lens and make your shot much clearer, even without a tripod.You may want to go for a 50mm f/1.8 lens if you plan to do a lot of photography at night. These lenses are great for their sharpness even at low light. They are often not very expensive and easy to find.

, The ISO is the level of sensitivity your camera has to light. A lower ISO setting will mean your lens is less sensitive to light and a higher ISO will increase the light sensitivity of your camera. Using a higher ISO will allow your camera to pick up as much available light as possible, which is important if you are planning to shoot at night. It will also make it easier to get a sharp, clean image at night without a tripod.Keep in mind a higher ISO means you may have more of a grainy look to your images, known as “noise.” You may decide to keep some noise in the image or edit it out in post processing.

, The shutter speed determines how long the lens stays open and captures an image before it closes. Often when you are shooting at night, you are trying to capture images with light, such as cars on a dark highway or stars in the sky. Go for a slow shutter speed to allow the lens time to pick up light trails in the dark. You may opt for a shutter speed of 15-25 seconds to give the camera time to capture all the light in the image.You can also check if the camera lens has an image stabilization feature. This feature allows the lens to pick up light at lower shutter speeds and produce clearer images. You may be able to drop the shutter speed to very slow if this feature is available for your camera lens., If you own a digital SLR camera or even a phone camera, you may have a night mode setting you can use. Night modes are great for taking landscape or portrait photos at night, as they will set the shutter speed and the aperture for you. You can check the settings on your camera to see if you have this feature.You may still need to keep the camera steady and level when you take a picture at night on the night setting to get a good image. This may depend on the quality of the night setting on the camera as well as your ability to keep your arm stable when you take the picture.

"
"
Shoot in RAW format.,
Edit the images using a computer program.,
Combine several images together.",How to Do Night Photography Without a Tripod3," If you are using a digital camera, you should consider shooting in RAW format. This format allows the camera to record more detail. It also makes editing the images easier and you can then bring up the sharpness, the contrast, or the saturation of a dark image in post processing. Having images in RAW format, especially when shooting at night, can allow you to edit your images with more flexibility.Keep in mind RAW format will save the image as a large file. You should make sure your camera’s memory card has enough space for RAW format images before you use this option.

, You can use computer programs like Adobe Photoshop to edit your digital photographs after you have taken them. This may be useful if you end up with night pictures that have a lot of “noise” or graininess to them. Play around with the images using a computer program and adjust the sharpness, the saturation, the contrast, the lowlights, and the highlights until you are satisfied.If you plan to edit your images using a computer program, you should shoot in RAW format. Even if you are not sure if you want to play around with the images in post processing, you may shoot RAW just to have the option.

, If you are shooting digital and would like to get the best night photographs possible, you may try layering several images together in a computer program. This option may be ideal if you tend to edit your images in post processing anyway and are looking for a way to get sharper, clearer images of landscapes at night.Use Adobe Photoshop to take five to ten shots of the same image and layer them on top of each other. You can then use the Stack Mode functionality in Photoshop to blend the images together. This will create a long exposure effect that you may not be able to get if you are shooting at night without a tripod.

Determine the location of the flower.,
Set up your lights (if using them) depending on the look you want.,
Photograph your outdoor plant in the early morning to ""catch the good light"" and any morning dew.,
Get a variety of shots.",How to Photograph an Easter Lily2,"

Is it in a pot and somewhat portable, or is it rooted in the ground?
Even though you need to be careful not to break the stem, you can manipulate a live plant just like a cut flower.;
,

Are you shooting for a botany reference manual or using it as the basis for your sister's new tattoo?
Be aware that too much light will ""wash out"" the shot, so power down your lights and/or diffuse them.

, Failing that, use a mister to provide a few water drops., You will want to see the flower as a whole, pictures of the blossom from various angles, and neat close-ups of reproductive parts.

"
"
If your lily is in the ground, be prepared to get on the ground.,
Zoom in closely.,
Use a reflector to provide extra light for your shot.",How to Photograph an Easter Lily3," Since the bloom points down, you will need to get under it.

, Not shooting macro, but fill the frame with the lily., This will help you get the subject lit without blowing out the white.

If you are shooting close up, you will want to have a somewhat limited depth of field. Try starting with an aperture of 5.6 and adjust from there. Depending on the conditions, you will also need to vary the light. Take your time and keep trying different set-ups until you are satisfied with the results. The extra time you take in getting the shot right will show in the finished result.

"
"
Set up your camera on a tripod mount.,
Stop the aperture down as as much as you can.,
Start with a 'longish' shutter speed.",How to Photograph an Easter Lily4," Yes, you could pull off a hand held photograph, but it will never be as sharp as a tripod mounted shot will be., This makes the iris smaller and helps improve what will be a very limited depth of field. F16 or F22 are some good places to start., With the aperture setting closed down so far, you will need all the extra time you can get."
"

Select a scenic area.,

Recognize that a good photo consists of beautiful natural colors, like a red maple tree for example.,

Before you capture the photo, try it from a different perspective.,

If you are taking a photo of a structures, make sure you have a whole building, as this is vital in landscape photography.,

Know that a good landscape photo consists of 3 layers: Up close, the distant scenery, and finally the sky.,

Time it.,





Check on the weather.",How to Do Landscape Photography," A rural area, park, beach, or natural attraction would be a good choice for a photo like this. Also a good clear day is vital for a good quality photo. Avoid any air pollution, this can make the photo appear foggy even when it appears to be a clear day. However, mist, fog, or haze can often contribute to an artistic angle.
, If the landscape simply doesn't have enough drama, you can easily turn the photo into black and white with any photography program. Try to get a photo with the sky in it, or if you are trying to capture something unique like a river, have something like the riverbank sitting just on the top of the photo. If the sky is partly cloudy, the best time to take a photo is when the cloud just sits on the horizon., Try sitting or crouching or taking a few steps in either direction. Angle the camera a bit, trying to capture different pieces of landscape., If you are trying to capture just a select image with only one layer, that is beyond the scope of this guide.,, The best time to capture a photo is either early in the day or near sunset. Many clear skies can leave the sky pink which adds drama into the photo. DO NOT take a photo of the sun directly, unless it's seconds before it disappears, as your finished product will end up as a white blank photo. Take a photo of the area near the sun rise or sun set, depending upon the time of day., If the sky is very cloudy and if the cloud parts, it leaves an opening above the subject, with the light shining down on the subject. If you get an opportunity to take a photo like this, then you are very lucky, because they only tend to happen in the evening in the summer, and it tends not be so cloudy in the summer."

Make sure that you understand any commits before signing any contracts with your agency.While many photographers freelance, an agency lets you concentrate on the creative side of your passion rather than worry about the business aspect.

, Create a website, blog, and utilize existing social media tools like Facebook and Instagram to show off your talent. Work with a graphic designer to develop a site that stands out from other photographers. Participate in online photo sharing forums.Choose where you post your photos because you want to make sure that the audience is large enough to garner a following. Strategically post on sites that will showcase your talent. While you are most likely promoting yourself for free, the number of views for a photo can translate to visits to your site. Your goal is to get noticed by having your photos go viral.
If you have the resources you can hire someone to help you manage your website. Otherwise, read blogs, forums, or invest in classes to learn how to create and manage an effective website., Sell prints, ebooks, video tutorials, calendars, or whatever else you can on your site. Once you begin to get traffic to your site you want to be able to convert views into sales. Selling art prints alone can be a difficult source of income at first so diversify your revenue streams., Submit your work to galleries, art fairs, and printed publications. Learn how to write an article to go along with your photos as magazines will often look for stories before they look for photos. If your work is published or featured at a gallery, be sure to make a note of it on your website.Visit exhibitions and award ceremonies. Network and learn what is at the top of your field.

, Many digital cameras also shoot video. Learning how to shoot and edit video can give you an additional stream of income. You can sell nature footage to broadcasters specializing in educational programming like the Discovery Channel or National Geographic.Make note that learning video can double your costs depending on how much you want to invest. While there is some photography equipment that you can use for video, there is also special equipment made specifically for video.

, Whether you’re talking about your equipment or software, sharing your knowledge with the public shows that you have a firm grasp of your craft and that you are a trusted voice in your field. You may even specialize in order to capture a niche market like underwater photography.There are thousands of aspiring photographers in varying levels who share the same passion as you. Creating a workshop where they can meet and exchange ideas helps cultivate your presence as an expert nature photographer. It allows you to share what you have learned to others.

, While you will need to image editing software, it is also wise to learn web development, word processing, and bookkeeping software to help keep your business afloat.You will have to be more than a photographer in order to turn your passion into a career. You must also learn how to grow your business and each new skill can mean eliminating an outside cost.

, Nature photography can mean a lot of extended travel and long hours growing your business. Remember to balance your professional life and personal life. Allow your personal experience to inform your creative sensibilities."

Avoid harsh light.,
Play around with images at different times of the day.,
Amplify the colors of summer.,
Carry, or use, flash for your closer shots.,
Tell a story with the photographs.,
Ask your subjects to at least look like they're having fun.",How to Take Summer Photographs," Sunlight that is too bright will wash everything out and summer certainly brings its fair share of light problems for the photographer, with its brilliantly sunny days. Midday sunlight will spoil your photos and is the time of day for enjoying your lunch or an indoor museum, rather than for taking photographs. If you have no choice, prefer photos (especially portraits) in the shade at this time of day or your subjects will end up with a lot of unflattering shadows on their faces. Otherwise, the best times for shooting are early morning or the late afternoon and into the evening, when the light is softer and creates shadows.


The time of day is dependent on the angle of the sun at your latitude. Depending on where you live, you may have to rise earlier than other places to capture fast moving early morning light and low angled light. The light appearing just after dawn carries many warm tones but indirectly lit subjects will appear blue because the light is weak.
Adding the right types of filter to a camera can help create better shots during harsh light.;
, Select a scene that you particularly like and try photographing it at different times of the day, both when there are shadows and when there is direct sunlight only. You'll be amazed at how differently the photos turn out and how the colors, shapes, and structural elements vary in strength dependent on the time of the day the shots are taken. Practicing with this a little will give you a good feel for the best light for different objects throughout the day.


Strong, direct light creates short shadows. These are best used for emphasizing large shapes. This is usually midday sun, so don't completely dismiss it but work with it for strong shapes and forms that will still appear majestic in spite of shadows. It's a good time for photographing anything with texture that needs to be made clear on vertical surfaces, such as tombstone carvings, and anything that has contours, such as landscape.
Diffuse sunlight will bring out the colors and shapes in objects such as flowerbeds more.
As the day grows older, the shadows begin to lengthen and you'll be able to best capture the shapes of your subjects but you'll find the contrast is less obvious than at midday.
Late afternoon photography tends to bring less wind and some excellent still shots of land and water can benefit from this.

, Summer and spring are a time of growth and much vibrant color. It is important that your shots reflect that, to give the viewer the best feel for the season possible. The best time for maximizing color is early in the morning or late in the afternoon. If the sun is too bright and washes everything out, use some type of filter on your camera, although it's best to avoid garden photography when the sun is too bright (midday) as it rarely turns out well.


Overcast early morning light can create evenly illuminated effects on your subject, making it ideal for clear photography.

, Using the flash will reduce shadows in the images.

, You and your photography subjects are out there doing something... not just sitting in the front yard. Let the pictures relate at least part of what is going on.


Follow people's movements. At the beginning of the day, you'll probably capture much activity. As the heat of the day wears on, people will retreat and relax or slacken their pace. As the heat of the day begins to dissipate in the late afternoon and evening, the pace will pick up again. Try to work with the natural flow of what your human subjects are doing normally and capture informal portraits, which reflect the ease and informality of summer.
For a garden scene, the story could focus on the abundance of annuals that are in flower, the blossoms, and the wildlife that is enjoying the warmth and easier living summer brings with it. A lot of color behind a garden border is best photographed from a distance; use a long lens to compress the various colors and fill the frame.
When taking photos of people lazing in the summer sun, find interesting angles and features in the photo. For example, someone lazing in a hammock could be asked to smile and lean out a bit, while the backdrop might show a bright green lawn and the foreground some beautiful flowers.

, Obviously, capturing your subjects while they're feeling happy and enjoying their summer activities as much as possible is the best time to take shots. However, maybe for some reason, it isn't the most fun they've ever had, but incite them to 'fake it till they make it'. A dour mood will reflect itself in the images and doesn't make for very pleasant memories!

Get an on-camera flash diffuser.,
Try a variety of softboxes for different effects.,
Use an umbrella to produce broad and diffused lighting.Photography umbrellas are easy-to-use tools that diffuse light two different ways – by bouncing the light off its surface or by diffusing the light through it.",How to Diffuse Light1," These are great to use on location when you know you’ll be taking flash shots. On-camera diffusers simply attach to your camera, covering the flash with some kind of material to soften the light. There are many different models and types, each providing a slightly different approach to diffusing the light.For example, some work by bouncing light off the ceiling and directing the rest straight toward the subject through the fabric.


Others reflect the flash off a panel in the on-camera diffuser before directing it through the fabric at the subject.;
, Softboxes, also called lightbanks, are rectangular enclosures that you place over the light source (usually your flash) to soften it. These versatile tools create diffused, directional light, such as the kind that would stream in through a window.Soft boxes come in many different sizes. In general, the larger the softbox, the softer and more diffused the light will be.Most softboxes work by using a reflective material lining that bounces the light through the sheer fabric.
If you use a softbox, make sure that it can handle the wattage of light you’re using. Using the wrong softbox can create a fire hazard.

, Similar to a softbox, an umbrella is attached to the light source. They are typically made of white cloth or a metallic silver material. Both types diffuse light effectively and are very affordable (some cost less than twelve dollars).To diffuse light by bouncing it, aim the light source at a silver or white umbrella, which should target the light away from the subject.
To diffuse the light through an umbrella, use one made from sheer material. Aim the light source toward the subject, placing the umbrella in front of the light source.

Choose your camera.,
Make sure the flash is not turned on.,
Use a self timer or cable release.,
Set up a tripod.,
Determine the focal length.,
Pick an interesting foreground.,
Take the picture.",How to Photograph a Lunar Eclipse1," An expensive, professional camera is not needed to use the simplest method, the wide angle technique, which involves shooting long exposures for one single photo of a small moon in the sky. Any camera that is capable of long exposure of at least five seconds is okay to use. A film camera, digital camera, or even your smartphone will work., A flash keeps the exposure time short. In this case, you don’t have to worry about an overexposed photo., A cable release allows you to control the shutter without touching the camera. A self timer or cable release prevents vibrations that could blur your photo., A photo can be taken without a tripod, but it is best to use one. A sturdy tripod will keep your camera from moving and messing up the photo.Tripods for smartphones are available.
Propping the camera on a wall, fence, or rock can act as a makeshift tripod., The type of camera you use will determine what setting is needed. Choose a speed film setting or an ISO setting of 400, if you are using a digital camera. An exposure range from 5 to 40 seconds is best if you are using a camera with a manual exposure setting. A longer setting than that may cause the photo to come out blurry.ISO (International Standards Organization) determines the sensitivity of the sensor in your camera. This affects the exposure of your photos., A photo of a lunar eclipse using the wide angle technique will make the moon appear pretty small. An interesting foreground will fill up the negative space left by the small size of the moon in your photo.Consider a cityscape. The shape of the skyline will provide an interesting foreground for your photo.
Go out into nature. A clear sky and natural landscape is a sure way to have an interesting foreground. Go to the mountains or a forest for a sure way to fill the foreground in your photo.

, Wait for your chosen duration of the lunar eclipse, and the duration of exposure time. Enjoy the lunar eclipse in the meantime.

Soften light subtly with diffusion paper.,
Hang a professional silk between the light source and your subject.,
Experiment with Chinese paper lanterns.",How to Diffuse Light2," Diffusion paper is clamped onto the “barn doors” of the light you’re using. These papers create an even field of soft light and they are best used to slightly soften up the overall look of a shot. They are sold with different finishes to create different lighting effects and look a lot like tracing paper.


These light diffusing materials are quite affordable, but if you’re forced to improvise, try using wax paper instead. A similar effect can be achieved.Wax paper should only be used to diffuse LED lighting. Avoid using wax paper with tungsten lights, since the paper could possibly catch on fire.

, Professional silks come in many different sizes and are usually hung on a metal frame. When placed between the light source and your subject, a silk can very effectively diffuse light. If you’re on a budget, a similar effect can be achieved by using a sheer piece of fabric you already have around, like a white bed sheet or clear shower curtain liner.Though this approach won’t give you the same results that a more professional diffuser will, it does serve to soften the light and to reduce harsh transitions and shadows.
You can use any type of light-colored sheer fabric as a diffuser. In a pinch, you can even use a tissue as a diffuser.

, Chinese paper lanterns, sometimes referred to as China balls, cost very little and can create very even, soft lighting. They are able to diffuse light in almost every direction simultaneously, making them very versatile.Chinese lanterns come in many different sizes and colors. The all-white ones are best for diffusing light in a typical way. Experiment with colored lanterns if you are trying to create unusual lighting effects.


You can buy China balls online, at most home décor shops and at Asian markets.
To get an idea of how China balls can be used – you could hang several of them from the ceiling to softly brighten up a scene, or you could use a single lantern to light a more intimate shot, such as a dinner conversation in a restaurant."
"
Put bubble wrap around your flash.,
Bounce light using any semi-reflective white surface.,
Experiment with different fabrics and materials to create DIY silks.",How to Diffuse Light3," Bubble wrap is a plastic packing material that creates a cushion with lots of tiny, air-filled “bubbles.” You can diffuse light with bubble wrap by cutting a two foot long strip of it and wrapping it around the flash on your camera. Attach it to the flash with Velcro, gaffer’s tape or a rubber band. After wrapping the bubble material around the flash, be sure to leave plenty of room over the top.


You can create an even softer lighting effect by using two layers of bubble wrap., White poster board, whiteboards, and even white walls/ceilings can be effectively used to bounce off soft light. To diffuse light by bouncing it, aim your light source at the semi-reflective white surface of your choice. The light reflects, or bounces, off that surface and creates a secondary source of light, which will illuminate your subject with diffused light.Make sure you target the light source away from the subject so that only the bounced light – not direct light – is being used.

, Professional silks are fabrics placed between the light source and subject to diffuse light. White bed sheets and clear shower curtain liners can be used quite effectively, but in a pinch you can get even more creative and still achieve some nice, soft light.


Experiment with a variety of different materials and objects to get a feel for the diffusion possibilities.
Try using things like bath towels, visqueen, paper towels, white t-shirts or dress shirts, printer paper and even opaque Tupperware."
"
Use a digital or film camera.,
Plan the camera placement in relation to the positioning of the moon.,
Use a tripod.,
Make sure you have a full battery or an empty memory card.,
Choose your camera setting.,
Turn autofocus off.,
Position the moon in the corner of the frame.,
Use a cable release.,
Lock the shutter open with the cable release.",How to Photograph a Lunar Eclipse2," This technique takes long exposures of one hour or more so that the path of the moon during the lunar eclipse appears like a long light trail. Make sure your camera has a manual bulb setting. A manual bulb setting is needed to lock the shutter open.The shutter needs to stay open for a long duration photo, so make sure your camera has the ability to take long exposure photos.

, Research the position and duration of the moon ahead of time. You will need to line the camera lens up with the path of the eclipse. Try estimating the moon’s direction and elevation one or two night before the eclipse. The moon will appear in the same position 50 minutes later each night. If the eclipse begins at 10 p.m., then the moon will be in the same position at 8:20 p.m. two nights before., A tripod is necessary tool because this technique captures the path of the moon, and the exposures need to be steady to capture that path. Use a makeshift tripod, like a wall if necessary, but make sure the camera stays very still.Be sure the tripod is sturdy and not prone to vibrating from surrounding movement.

, Long exposure photos can drain the battery quickly. A fully charged battery will prevent your camera from dying before the photo is completed., Pick an ISO of 200 or 400. Choose an aperture of f/stop, f/8, or f/11. The photo exposure will be between one and three hours for this technique.Aperture is the hole in the camera’s lens that allows light to pass through.The larger the aperture, the more light allowed in.
The lower the aperture, the less amount of light allowed in.

, Focus manually. This will help the photo to be as steady as possible., Make sure that the camera’s field of vision lines up with the path of the moon.The camera’s line of vision can be traced by planning the positioning of the moon one or two nights before. This should have been planned already, so that it won’t be a problem to line the camera up with the moon.

, The cable release prevents vibrations. This is a necessary tool to use for for a photo that relies on a steady camera. , Open and lock the shutter when you are ready for the photo to begin. Make sure to time this with the beginning of the eclipse."

Decide between a film and digital camera.,
Use a tripod.,
Position the moon to the corner of the camera’s field of vision.,
Capture multiple exposures with a film camera.,
Capture multiple exposures with a digital camera.,
Take the first exposure.,
Change the exposure settings throughout the eclipse.",How to Photograph a Lunar Eclipse3," This technique combines the star trail and wide angle technique by capturing multiple individual pictures and combining them into one photo. The details for the multiple exposure technique are different depending on what type of camera you use. Whichever camera you use must have an ability to shoot double or multiple exposure., A tripod is necessary because multiple exposures are being taken, which requires a smooth shot. Make sure to use a steady tripod or makeshift tripod., Like the star trail technique, this technique will capture the path of the moon. Make sure the camera will capture the full path of the moon during the eclipse.Calculate the positioning of the moon by determining where the moon is one or two nights before. A lunar eclipse that starts at 11 p.m. will be in the same position at 9:50 p.m. two nights before.

, A film camera captures multiple exposures on one frame on film. Your final photo upon development will have multiple exposures compressed into one picture., A digital camera captures multiple exposures and saves them as separate image files. To complete the photo, multiple photographs will have to be layered into one image in Photoshop., The first exposure needs to be taken when the lunar eclipse begins. From there, an exposure will need to be taken every five to ten minutes.Make sure to be consistent with your time intervals so that the eclipse will be documented evenly., The moon’s brightness will change throughout the lunar eclipse. Because of this, the exposures will need to be changed for the duration of the eclipse.An initial ISO setting of 400 at f/8 would call for a shutter speed of 1/1000 second at the beginning of the eclipse. From there, the shutter speed would be 1/500, 1/250, 1/125 and 1/60 second.

Use a camera with a long zoom focal length.,
Use a large tripod.,
Calculate the focal length depending on the size of the camera lens.,
Take a bracketed series of exposures.",How to Photograph a Lunar Eclipse4," The telephoto technique relies on a long zoom to take a photo with a large appearance of the moon. It is best to use a long telephoto lens or telescope. A point and shoot camera can be used if the zoom lens is 6x or more.A point and shoot camera can be used, but it will not fill the frame of the photo like a SLR (single-lens reflex) or DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera.A lot of telescopes will allow you to connect a camera with an adapter.

, You will need to use a larger than usual tripod if you’re using a telephoto lens or telescope. In this case, a makeshift tripod probably won’t work., The focal length determines how large the moon will appear in your photo. The moon size will appear larger with a larger lens.An SLR photo with a 50mm lens produces photo with a moon size of 0.5mm across. This is probably too small.
A 200mm lens will make the moon appear 1.8mm across.
A 500mm lens produces a moon size of 4.6mm across. The lenses cost between $100 to $250.
DSLR cameras follow almost the same rules about lens size, but then lens can be smaller than an SLR camera’s lens and produce a larger moon size. A 750mm lens in a DSLR camera will produce the same moon size as a 740mm lens in an SLR camera.

, Bracketing photos means taking two extra photos at different brightness levels for every photo you take. It is best to take a bracketed series of exposures every ten to fifteen minutes.Consult the Lunar Eclipse Exposure guide to determine how to time your exposures. This guide will tell you how to change your camera’s settings for the different stages of the lunar eclipse. http://www.mreclipse.com/LEphoto/image/LE-Exposure1w.GIF

The exposure times will depend on the specific eclipse you are photographing.

Frame your picture.,

Use differing levels and angles.,

Use colour to break up the blues and yellows of a beach scene.,

Choose the best times of day to take beach photos.,

A clever use of black and white to make a silhouette rather than a shadow.Find the best ways to take portrait photographs.",How to Take Beach Photos," While the seaside as a whole is beautiful to the naked eye when you're actually on the beach, it is less interesting as a photograph because the viewer sees only a wide, open space featuring blue sky, blue sea, and yellow sand - a fairly predictable scene. To provide something on which the eye immediately comes to rest within a photograph, find a ""focal point"" - this is the art of focusing on something out of the ordinary to bring the beach shot to life:

Find the focal point of interest - a shoe, a beach umbrella, a fish and chip wrapper, your child's toes, prints across the sand, a sandcastle, etc. Good focal points are often brightly coloured, or vary in hue from the other colours in the picture.
Find natural features of interest - some pebbles, rippling sand, the wave breaking at the water's edge, palm trees, shells, seaweed, etc.
Find something out at sea of interest - perhaps a boat with bright sails, seals playing, or a jumping dolphin.
Note that anything moving across water can create interesting ripples (a bird, sea creature, boat, or wind, can all create this effect), and movement in the water will distort anything reflecting in the sea water, which can heighten interest of the photograph in good light.;
, Centering the horizon can give the viewer a sensation that the photo has been sliced in half, which can be disorienting, as long, unbroken horizons contain little of interest in a photo. Instead, break down the image into thirds (the ""rule of thirds""), both horizontally and vertically, to create nine equal parts to your image. Keep the horizon square to the framing of your shot, in order to avoid a sloping effect.

When imagining the division of the image, focus on where the lines intersect - according to this classical rule of composition, these intersections create the optimum positions for the main subjects of your image., Look around you. Ask yourself what points of interest you can include in the photo. For example, are there any rocks, trees, beach houses, piers, etc., that you can use to add a natural frame to the picture? If so, use them. For example, framing a sea shot through trees can be particularly effective if you have a focal point out at sea, such as a boat., Don't just shoot straight on, mix the angles up a bit. Aim for something kooky, funky and interesting. Get down low to photograph children and their beach activities, stand up high to take a tree, or lie down under a pier., Blue, more blue, perhaps some yellow: beaches aren't the most imaginative places colour-wise. This makes it important to capitalise on any splashes of colour. Vibrant colours will really stand out, and make your photo look doubly attractive.

For a DSLR, consider using a UV filter. This will reduce the atmospheric haze that is increased by the blueness of the sea.
Again for a DSLR lens, use a polarizing filter to reduce reflections and boost the contrasting shades. This can help to improve skies and ocean water by making them a darker blue., When the sun's riding high it might be a nice time for sunbathing, but it's the worst time of day for decent photos as the light is too strong and bright. The best times of day for beach photos are at the beginning and end of the day, especially around sunrise and sunset. The sun resting on the horizon looks brilliant, and it's hard not to take a decent snap at these times. As an added bonus, you will have less people on the beach at these times of day.

Morning air is usually still and the light is quiet, delicate and diffuse until the sun rises. Early morning light changes rapidly with the sun rising, so expect your exposure times to change rapidly and to move quickly to capture the special moments.
Evening light often has a warm glow that provides intense gold and rose colours. Haze and shadows are common features that you can draw on as the day draws to an end.
Take care not to include your own shadow when taking photographs early and late in the day when the sun's shadows are at their longest; check around the whole frame to make sure you're not forming a part of the picture! You can easily rectify this by moving to a different position.
Make the most of non-sunny days. Windswept, threatening weather can create incredible, mood-infused photos at the beach. With nobody about, you can take uninterrupted views and dramatic views of dark clouds and stormy seas.
Mist, fogs, and haze can all work to your advantage in creating interesting features.
Try shooting in black and white, or flip it to black and white using a photo program such as Photoshop when you get home to cover the overcast, cloudy, sky and make things look a whole lot more atmospheric.
Just after a storm moves through can produce dramatic light contrasts.

, Photos of people on the seaside can be the stuff of nightmares – on a sunny day, it is all too easy for people to appear washed out and squinting. You have several options to ensure a good photo of people at the beach:

Wait for cloud cover to soften the light over their faces.
If there is no sign of cloud, use other cover, such as trees or umbrellas.
Have your subjects turn away from the sun and use spot metering to focus on their faces. This will allow you to expose their faces well while the image around the person will be over-exposed. You can use a photo program to put the entire image into better shape later. Use the flash. Forcing the flash can take care of shadows caused by clothing, caps, sunglasses, etc., and will help to improve the exposure of the person. You might need to experiment with the level of flash, however, if relevant.
Consider using bracket exposures if you want to be sure of getting one really good shot. This means taking several pictures, one at the usual exposure and then others a stop more or less exposure than indicated by the meter.Try photos from behind. They can be effective provided there is enough interest in the entire scene.

Reduce the sources of movement.,
Eliminate or greatly reduce sources of light that aren't from the candle.,
Increase the background light.,
Position both candles and the human subject with consideration for the features you're seeking to highlight.,
Experiment with the ISO.,
Don't use color balance correction when shooting the image.,
Stay close to the subject and keep the image as clean as possible.,
Try some random and less constructed shots.",How to Take Candlelight Photography," Be sure that there is little, or no, movement in the shot. While the candle flame will be moving, it is important to get rid of any other movement or the photo will be blurred or filled with distractions.



Use a tripod. Shooting in the dark will cause your shutter to move slowly and a tripod will help reduce any vibrations from the slower shutter speeds you'll need to use.






Ensure your tripod's rubber foot caps are in serviceable condition and attached. If one or more have come away, vibration from your movement may be transferred up the tripod leg to your camera from the direct contact that the metal tripod leg has with the floor surface.






If a person is in the picture, use a wide aperture for a fast shutter speed, focus on the closest eye (where sharpness or lack thereof is most apparent), and have her or him hold still.






Be sure that there is no breeze in the room. A breeze will cause the candle to flicker which will appear in the shot as extreme movement resulting in an image capture that results in a blurred photo.





;
, You aren't going to get any good shots if your candle is outshone; rather, you want the warm aspects of a candle, so removing other light sources will help to increase the warmth and genuine color coming from the candle itself.
Turn off overhead lights, bright lamps and remove or turn off electronic devices that throw light such as computer screens, television sets and digital clocks. And be sure to turn off the flash unless you've added an orange or red gel over the flash (it's recommended you only do this if you know what you're doing).

, Although you need to reduce the light sources near the candle itself, the reality is that lighting is low with candle shots and low light always makes taking a good photo harder. However, there are three ways you can improve lighting without spoiling the candle's warm glow, namely by adding more candles, by using reflective light or by using dim light:



More candles: Adding more candles to the scene can increase the desired lighting effect. The benefit of this is not only the possibilities of producing a pretty display but it also gives you greater flexibility with the ISO, shutter speed and aperture settings.







Reflective light sources: These aren't light as such but are sources of bouncing light. There are a number of possibilities here:






White backgrounds and surfaces can improve the look of the candlelight in photos. And don't neglect the usefulness of white pajamas or other clothing if using human subjects with the candlelight.
Try using a mirror or silverware on the surface where the candles are. The reflection of the mirror or silverware adds to the available light and to the ambiance.
Be sure to polish up the silverware if using it and if using a mirror, keep yourself out of the shot and ensure that no streaks resulting from the polishing action remain as these have a great tendency to show up in the resulting photograph.

Moonlight through a window might work if it's available and strong enough.



Dim light: If a little bit of detail in other areas is desirable, turn on a very small, dim light, or have a light on in an adjacent room. Or, if you have an adjustable flash, use it for exposure computed (or set with flash-exposure-compensation) to underexpose a lot, such as by three stops.
The secondary light source should be from a wide area, such as a doorway or bounced off a wall or ceiling, so as not to cast its own shadows.







, Bear in mind that candlelight can be really flattering to the human face, so don't be coy about placing the candles to ensure the best angle of the human subject. Play around with the placement a bit until you're happy with it.
Also be aware that lighting only one part of the human subject with the candlelight (such as the face) while leaving the rest of the body shadowy can create an incredibly atmospheric photo. Don't be afraid to let a lot of the shot fall into the shadow, so that the viewer is drawn to the point where the candle and candlelight are.


If using extra candles, just be thoughtful about where you place the additional candles. If you're just photographing the candles themselves, the positioning is probably more a matter of making an artistic or patterned display, whereas if you're using the candles to throw light on a human subject, you'll probably need to balance the lighting for a general reflection of the human subject, or maybe you'd prefer more lighting on one side of the person's face or some part of them.






With extra candles, bunching them together will produce more shadows, while positioning them apart will make the light more diffuse.






If using objects, position them as closely to the candle or candles as possible to keep their shape clearer in the photo by being lit more obviously.







, You will probably have to have a fairly high ISO, but too much will produce a lot of noise in the photo. Try to keep the ISO under 400; use the lighting fixes suggested above to help keep the ISO level down.


Use daylight balanced film. This will assist in both creating and maintaining the orange tones that candlelight produces.
Some of the more modern digital cameras now come with a candlelight setting – be sure to check if your camera has this before fiddling too much!
Determine exposure by reference to the candlelight (some automatic modes will set a fast shutter speed whenever flash is used, which you don't want).
Experiment with shutter speed. A shutter speed of around 1/4th of a second will usually capture candlelight well.Be careful, as any decrease of shutter speed will also increase picking up movement; 1/15th of a second could work provided not even the candle flame is flickering., Unlike most types of photography the color balance should allow the orange glow of candlelight to dominate the photograph. The viewer expects to see the orange tones. Over-correction of these might spoil the effect.Later use photo processing software such as Gimp, Picasa or Photoshop to fine tune the color balance.


If using a digital camera and you want to tone down the oranges a bit (cooler tones), try changing the white balance. ""Incandescent"" is a good starting point for an only moderately orange photo. However, bear in mind that this is one of the times when the heavier color tones work well and it's important to steer clear of ""auto"" settings.
If the digital camera is automatically adjusting to create color balance (a fairly standard feature), check the LCD screen to see how the end result will appear. You may need to switch to manual white balance and select a sunny daylight setting.Shooting in RAW might help you with post-processing of the colors.Taking a number of shots using different settings is also a wise post-processing option as it gives more opportunities for the clean, perfect image that you're after.

, It's recommended that you remain close to the candlelight and any subject being photographed with the candlelight as this will give you the most detail and most light possible.
Also be careful with zooming, as the aperture changes when zooming and it's probably better to use a wide angle lens than to rely on zooming. In terms of what you include in the photo, it's recommended that you don't include much more than the candles and the human subject.
A few objects might be needed to complete your scene but it's best to keep these to an absolute minimum and rely on the candle being central to the photo's story.

, Don't be afraid of blurring the images and trying moving flame shots. You never know what might result and it could be very artistic, especially with post-production effects.
Never let the basic rules stop you from trying to push your photographic endeavors further!

What you are trying to do is ""create a small inverted triangle of light on the subject’s cheek which is opposite the light source"".The lights that create the inverted triangle will also create catch lights in your subject's eyes. This is very important. Without catch lights, your subject will look flat and lifeless.;

Clean the product meticulously.,

Soft light makes dirt stand out less, but the sharpness you want for everything else will show the dirt too.Use a soft, clean, low-lint cloth such as a cotton terry towel. Rubbing alcohol leaves no residue and is safe for most non-plastic modern surfaces (Rubbing Alcohol may damage plastics, and can cause clear plastic to become foggy), but very dilute soapy water is gentler to some. Spot test an inconspicuous area first if in doubt.;
, An overcast day is best. If it's a nice day, head for ""open shade"": an area shaded from the sun but open to much of the sky. These areas are more plentiful in the morning and evening; at midday, you'd have to get under something. You want nice, soft, diffuse light; what you don't want is the sun directly facing into your setup.
You can also work inside close to a big unshaded window that the sun isn't shining on directly. This is dimmer; you'll need a longer exposure and the tripod later., Find a solid object to prop up the paper behind your subject; in the example photos, you can see a handy patio umbrella post sitting there.
, This will permit you to use the smaller apertures (and consequent long shutter speeds) needed for product photography. If you don't have a tripod, stack up some random objects you have kicking around until you're at a good working height., Get your camera at the right angle to the product: a roughly corner-on isometric view.or edge-on oblique viewgives a three-dimensional appearance generally more appealing than a face-on orthographic viewGet your camera at the right distance from the product, too: generally ""far enough"" (and zoomed in) because a flat undistorted perspective is generally more useful than a perhaps-artistically distorted close-up one.Products, like anything else, will look weird if you try to take photographs from too close to your subject.If possible, try to get at least half a meter away.
You might find that your zoom lens will only focus to closer distances at shorter focal lengths; make your own experiments here, because this may dictate your working distance.
,

Make sure your flash is turned off. Subjects lit by direct, on-camera flash look eBay-tastic,with harsh untamed highlights in many places and harsh shadows in others.
Set your white balance. If you have a ""shade"" or ""cloudy"" setting, you want to use this. The sky, which lights the shade, is bluish-white. Otherwise, use the ""sun"" setting. If you're a raw-shooting headbanger you don't have to bother with this, although it'll give your favourite raw conversion software a starting point.
Set your ISO as low as you can. For product photographs shot from a tripod you don't need the faster shutter speeds that higher ISOs permit, and lower ISOs means less noise (meaning smoother original pictures) and that less or no noise reduction needs to be applied (meaning sharper smooth pictures).

Set your camera to aperture priority mode. All digital SLRs and some compact cameras have it. If you're using a compact camera without an aperture-priority mode, you might want to try the ""macro"" mode.

, Product photography often requires small apertures (larger f/ numbers) for a lot of depth of field, but at some point the image (including the parts of it outside of the plane of perfect focus) will be softer because of diffraction effects.
Your optimal aperture will depend on many factors (including your lens, your focal length, your working distance and even your sensor size), so experiment. Start at f/11 on a digital SLR or the smallest aperture on a compact camera, and try the neighbouring few apertures, and zoom in on your LCD when you play the images back. Use the aperture that seems the sharpest all over. If you have to choose between not having enough depth of field and having a slightly softer image due to diffraction, then choose the latter; diffraction is modest all over and relatively easy to correct in software to some degree, whereas defocus gets more severe as one moves away from the plane of focus and is a complex phenomenon that is close-to-impossible to correct., The white piece of paper will often confuse a camera's meter; the camera will see it as a bright thing that needs to be exposed to grey, rather than left white. Use your exposure compensation; a whole stop of over-exposure is a good place to start. Ideally, you want to keep the paper bright, but not overexpose it all the way to 255 white.
, For the kind of exposure times you'll be using, and the act of pushing the shutter button can cause noticeable camera shake (especially on cheaper tripods). Turning on the self-timer will give that motion a little time to damp. If you have a selectable self-timer length, try setting it to 2 or 5 seconds., If you're happy with the results, then go on to post-processing., The GNU Image Manipulation Program is a piece of open source software that can be downloaded for free. It's not as sophisticated as Photoshop in every way, but it's free, and plenty good for simple post-processing jobs like you're going to do here.
,,

Go to Colors -> Levels, which will bring up the levels dialog. Click on the ""white point"" eye-dropper (the rightmost of the three near the bottom right of the dialog).





Click on the darkest part of the background that should be white, but isn't. Then hit ""OK"".





This will make your background pure white (at the cost of bringing out a little noise).






, You probably have a lot of unnecessary empty areas in your photo (and probably some of the background behind the white paper, too). Bring up GIMP's crop tool (Tools -> Transform Tools -> Crop, or press Shift+C), and click-and-drag a selection around the area you want to crop. Hit the Enter key when you're done to crop the photograph.
, This means dust and marks on your subject, and possibly marks on your white paper background as well. But clean your monitor first; anyone who's spent any time in a photo editor knows well the frustration of wondering why their clone tool isn't working, and it turning out to be dust on their screen!

Marks on the white background are obviously easy to correct; use the paintbrush or pencil tool with the foreground colour set to white.





Use the Clone tool (press C) or Heal tool (press H) to paint out dust on your subject. The Heal tool usually works better; experiment with this. With the tool active, select an area of similar or identical colour and texture, hold down Ctrl, and click somewhere in that area. Then click (and drag, if necessary) on the specks of dust.

, You might find that there's a yellow or blue cast to grey objects (especially after the earlier step to bring the background back to white; this has the effect of shifting the colour balance of the whole photograph away from the colour of the area you clicked on). There are two ways of fixing this:

The Hue-Saturation tool can often be used to very good effect. Go to Colors -> Hue-Saturation, and click the selector next to the colour (R, Y, M, B, etc) to which the photo is shifted, then turn down the ""Saturation"" slider until it looks right (it can look weird if you turn the saturation down too far; playing with the ""Overlap"" slider might help here). Hit ""OK"".





If that doesn't work, you might want to try the colour balance (Colors -> Color Balance) and play with the sliders until it looks right.

, For example, if you've shot at a very small aperture, your photo will almost certainly benefit from a little sharpening to make up for the softening caused by diffraction (Filters -> Enhance -> Unsharp Mask, use a radius of about 1 and ""Amount"" set to somewhere between 0.5 and 1).

Determine your budget.,
Find light kits among brands of photography equipment that are at least relatively popular.,
Look for reputable photography equipment vendors in your area or online.,
Compare kits from different stores or sellers.",How to Buy a Light Kit for Photography," These features include whether you want lights arranged on the floor or ceiling, what kind of photography you will be doing, how many lights you will need, etc.


Floor studio lights and backgrounds can be transported and arranged on stands or supports. Ceiling lights are more expensive and must be on a rail system for positioning in a rectangular area while background rollers are mounted on the ceiling.
Your type of photography can determine how much light you need. For taking photographs of someone from the shoulders up, for example, less light is needed than for photographing cars.
Factor in any natural light from windows or photographing outside during the daytime when considering how much artificial light you will need.;
, The 3 main categories are ""hot,"" ""warm,"" or ""cold.""


Lights that are ""hot"" are continuously burning tungsten or Metal Halide Iodide (HMI) bulbs that allow you to clearly see what your photographic results will be. ""Hot"" lights are not the best for still photography because the heat they give off will make you and your photography subjects sweat and you must make sure all your equipment can work with the heat.
""Warm"" lights are fluorescent lights that are cooler than tungsten or HMI bulbs but can give the same amount of light. Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are better for photography than older fluorescent bulbs. ""Warm"" lights can be used for taking photos of rapidly moving subjects but the bulbs can be fragile and break during transport.
""Cold"" lights are powerful electronic flashes created by a studio strobe, which can be a mono light or a power pack/head system. Both kinds of strobe have an incandescent light bulb surrounded by a flash tube. The bulb is used to judge the effects and ratio of the lighting.
Mono lights are made of a wall outlet, a block of capacitors, and the flash tube. The power pack/head system has somewhat lightweight heads connected by cables to a power pack filled with capacitors. You can adjust the light given by the heads and the overall amount of light, making the power pack/head system a flexible, often used option by photographers.

, Hard light creates strong shadows from a light that is small and/or far away. Soft light is cast by a big, diffuse light and does not create shadows.

, Search for light kits that fall within your price range. If you cannot afford all the equipment pieces you want right away, you may need to buy fewer pieces and add to them later.

, This will help you find and buy accessories for the kit more easily when you need them.

, Auction websites or pawnshops may offer lower prices but the light kits may be in poor condition and those selling them may not be knowledgeable about photography or the kits' features.

, You may be able to find a lower price for a light kit that meets your needs.

Realize when you need to use a diffuser.",How to Make an Emergency Flash Diffuser1," For point-and-click photographers, it is helpful to understand there are times in photography when a diffuser for your flash can make all the difference between a good photo and a poor one. Diffusers help to create more natural and softer lighting. In particular, a diffuser can help:


Taking a photo with white components. Without a diffuser, you are liable to get blown out white.
If strong shadows are falling on your subject or object, a diffuser will help to minimize or remove the shadows.
If the lighting in the images looks unnatural and harsh, a diffuser is required.;

As well as changing the distance of the lights, work on the angles.",How to Set up Indoor Photography Lights," You will get the best effect, if you do. Having said that, if you don't, make adjustments, such as your lights and the window, and you can use your wall and ceiling as a reflectors for the light you do have. The lights are the main light, fill light, and the hair or rim light.;
, This is assuming that the key light will be off camera. If it is on its own, use a tripod. The main light adds definition and highlight to the subject.

, The fill light is a less powerful light that helps fill in some of the shadows without blowing out parts of the photograph. Set it up directly in front of the subject. Make sure that:


It is aimed lower than the main light.
It is positioned lower than the main light.
Use less fill light if you want more shadows.
Make sure that it is less powerful than the main light.

, The hair light (also called backlighting or rim lighting), separates the background from the subject and helps bring it out. If you have a light background or want the subject to blend in with the background, don't use it.


You can set up the rim lighting above or below the subject, depending on how you want the effect.

Choose the right film for the job.,
Use the right f-stop.,
Shutter speed is the other big variable.,


,
Don't forget to focus!,
Notice your results.",How to Take a Photo With an SLR Camera," For Portraits (little motion) in a well-lit area, or in sunlight, ASA (or ISO) 100 is a good choice; but you wouldn't use that film for action shots or low-light situations. Lower ASA numbers mean finer grain, which translates to better detail. If you wanted to make a poster-sized blow-up, you'd want to use the lowest ASA number possible for the lighting/motion conditions. For extreme motion, low light, or a combination of these conditions, ASA 400 offers decent grain at the higher shutter speeds necessary to stop motion (i.e., 1/250th of a second). Extreme shutter speeds or very low little light can require an ASA 1600 film. Be aware, however, that detail will suffer. Every time you choose a film, you're making compromises, and you need to be aware of how your choice of film is going to affect your prints. Taking photos of the same subject, in the same lighting conditions, using several different films may be the best way to learn how to make intelligent compromises.;
, The f-stop controls how far the shutter opens when you depress it. A high f-stop will only open the shutter a small amount. This means less light falls on the film as would if you used a lower f-stop (assuming the shutter speed (the amount of time the light strikes the film) is constant. F-stop settings directly affect the depth of field. Using a low F-stop setting will make anything not perfectly in focus in your viewfinder look even blurrier, while using a high f-stop will increase the depth of the subject that appears in focus. The combination of f-stop setting and shutter speed will determine whether the total amount of light striking the film (the ""exposure"") is acceptable, or not. Each time you change the f-stop, be sure to check the light meter (most SLR's have one built-in) to be sure the needle falls near the center. Too low and your photo will be dark; too high, and it'll look ""washed-out"". You may have to adjust the shutter speed to compensate for changing the f-stop. Once again, it's all about successful compromises.

, The shutter speed determines what length of time the shutter will remain open once you click the shutter. A good rule of thumb is to shoot at 1/125th of a second or faster if you're holding the camera, because movement of the camera can show up at longer shutter speeds. If you're very steady, you can hold the camera and shoot at 1/60th. 1/30th or slower absolutely requires a tripod. For action shots, such as sports, you're going to want to ""freeze"" the action, so the shutter speed needs to be at least 1/250th of a second. 1/500th of a second would be even better, but the available light may not be enough to get a good exposure at that speed. Once again, whenever you change your shutter speed, check the light meter; you may need to adjust the f-stop to compensate for the change in shutter speed. Set the shutter speed to 1/125th when you're using flash. The extra light from the flash is only available for a short time, so there's no advantage to using other shutter speeds. For a slow shutter shot of flowing water use f 1/30,, There's a ring on the lens you'll need to rotate so that your subject comes into focus. SLR's allow you to take out-of-focus photographs, too, which is cool, as long as it's not an accident.

, If you take notes of what settings you used for each photo, then review how each photo turns out, you'll learn very quickly which compromises are good choices, and which aren't so good. Try ASA (ISO) 100, 200, 400, and 1600 speed films. Don't forget there's a setting for film speed you must make to select each choice. Some cameras automatically detect the film speed, others have a thumbwheel you need to set to the correct number. By all means, jot down all your information for each shot with these four rolls of film, then review your notes when you look at the prints.

, Learn how to make use of whatever light that's available.

, Once set, leave it alone. With film cameras, you can't change ISO speeds without changing the roll of film you are using. Higher ISO speeds are more sensitive to light, but produce grainier images.

, If you're shooting in color, be sure to set the White Balance to the appropriate setting. Film is available in different types (Daylight, Indoor, etc.). If you're using a DSLR camera, you may also use colored filters. Your camera may also provide different color settings (Vivid, Neutral, etc.).

, Film cameras don't provide the ""instant feedback"" that's possible with digital cameras.

, Evaluative/Matrix metering didn't exist back then!

, If you're using a DSLR camera, this should be easy - set the switch on your lens to ""MF"" (Manual Focus). Turn the focus ring on your lens until the image appears sharp. Point-and-shoot cameras may also provide a manual focus mode, but it can be more difficult to use due to the lack of an optical viewfinder.

,


The aperture (also referred to as an ""F-stop"") is the opening in your lens. Larger apertures (or smaller F-stops) let in more light, but provide a narrower depth-of-field (less of the image will be in focus). Smaller apertures (or larger F-stops) let in less light and provide a larger depth-of-field (more of the image will be in focus).
Shutter speed refers to the amount of time the film (or the sensor of a digital camera) is exposed to light. Faster shutter speeds provide less light and can ""freeze"" action. Slower shutter speeds provide more light, but any movement of the subject (or the camera itself) will cause blur in the image.
As you adjust these settings, watch your camera's exposure meter. It will indicate whether your image is properly exposed, underexposed (too dark), or overexposed (too light).

, If you're using autofocus, press and hold the shutter button halfway down - your camera will indicate whether or not the image is in focus. Press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture.

Gather polaroid film (Polaroid SX-70) and a polaroid camera (one that uses Polaroid SX-70 film).,
Insert film into the camera.

,
Find an appropriate subject for a photo.,
As the polaroid begins to develop, use a bluntly pointed tool (bone scraper, the non-business end of a paintbrush, a non working ballpoint pen, a butter knife) to etch and delineate areas you'd like to highlight in your composition.,
Consider taking the polaroid apart and removing sections of the image.,
Once you have removed the clear top layer (to which the photo should adhere), continue manipulating the photo by using the same blunt-tipped tools, as well as any other scraping tools you prefer, to remove and highlight additional parts of the image.,
When you have sufficiently manipulated your polaroid to your liking, replace the black backing of the polaroid as a protective covering by gluing or taping around the edges.",How to Scratch Polaroid Art," These cameras are increasingly easier to find in thrift stores and eBay for not much money. Film is somewhat expensive -- about $1/polaroid -- although relatively cheap compared to traditional art supplies.;
,, A set-up scene is an interesting base for a polaroid manipulation -- make a backdrop using a bright-colored cloth, and set up objects in interesting combinations. You might even use Polaroid camera or other photos as a subject: a picture of a picture. The idea is that you run with the abstract nature of this medium. Nature scenes are also great, as they make for a nice juxtaposition with the flat, uniquely cardboard-esque picture quality of the polaroid. Experiment with unexpected angles and perspectives.

, Don't be afraid to block out large areas of the photo with textures such as stripes or cross-hatching. Sometimes being too conservative makes the composition seem uncommitted and, for lack of a better term, wussy. Try choosing one item in the photo to spotlight and scratching out everything else around it. Or simply outline objects in the image as a means of emphasizing shapes and relationships -- the more you work with polaroid manipulation, the more developed your personal style and instinct for working the image will become.

, Start by removing the white foil-backed border by picking at the seams on the back of the photo and peeling it away from the black backing. You should now have a clear top layer and black back layer, with the photo ""gunk"" sandwiched in between. Carefully peel these layers apart -- depending on how developed the photo is doing this more quickly or more slowly may be better. Experiment, experiment, experiment!

, Try removing large areas and gluing or taping images from other Polaroids or magazines, foil, paint, etc. to make collages and evolved versions of the object in the original polaroid. The polaroid ""gunk"" is water-soluble -- use a wet paper towel or q-tips to remove large areas of the photo from the clear overlay. Remember that you will be working from the back side of the image.

, If your work has a lot of emulsion (the ""gunk"" that contains the polaroid image) exposed, you may want to use tape exclusively as glue may cause it to run or smudge.

Build yourself a portfolio.,
Find the right clients.,
Consider your price point.,
Check the local market value for a wedding photographer of similar style and standard to your own work.,
Calculate your cost of doing business.,
Factor in how many weddings you're likely to book in a year.,
Decide what you want to earn.,
Make the figures realistic.,
Review as you develop feedback and figures about your actual experience and progress.",How to Set Prices for Your Wedding Photography Services," If you're brand new to the wedding world, you're going to have some problems relating to your portfolio; initially, you may not have one at all. This is a significant factor in the earliest days in putting out a price which works for you and potential clients. Part of your investment in the business in the first year is going to be about getting yourself a solid portfolio of various couples at various venues; however great your photography is, you need that to show your skills and depth of experience before you'll get close to a price deserving of a business situation.


Assuming you don't have that portfolio yet, be prepared to make an arrangement with an experienced photographer to 'second shoot' with options to use the pictures in your portfolio, or to charge a low amount to attract jobs to get you started. One really good wedding in the bag is a great investment for your portfolio, even if you just cover your expenses to shoot it. Three is much better.;
, OK, so if step one was you and your situation, you'll already find yourself in 'happy shopper territory'. At the budget end of the market are many unrealistic clients who probably don't value photography highly and suggest their 'Uncle Bob' or student friend with hipster Polaroid can cover the job just fine. Even if you're offered these jobs with a modest fee, you don't want them; it's the wrong client type now, and forever more.


Keep an eye out for the client who values photography, but, quite honestly just doesn't have a budget to match your aspirations, or a budget at all. That's honest and understandable. This kind of client will value and appreciate your work, and you're more likely to enjoy the job. In this case, carefully work out your costs and expenses (no inflating the figures, be honest with yourself) and ask the client to cover these. If they can't, and it's a great client at a great venue, well maybe you'll need to suck up the costs to get your portfolio running.
Continue at this step until you can look at your portfolio of weddings shot and believe its a clear indicator of your competence, and has enough pictures to prove to a prospective client that you really can do the job. The more that proves itself to be the case, the higher your next price hike, the less true it is, the longer you spend with the 'happy shoppers'.

, Portfolio in place? Well done! Now you need to consider a heap of factors. Is this a part time or full time ambition? - This shouldn't affect your price really, after all if you undercut all the other professionals who've established their work in your area, after a short while you'll be established and earning less than the market rate. Essentially devaluing a trade you want to practice!


What is ok of course is to have a smaller profit margin if you are part time; your day job still pays the bills so the additional money is a benefit rather than buying your food.

, It's no good aspiring to earn top dollar in your first year, chances are the established photographers in your area will get jobs based on trust and reviews, word of mouth, website presence etc etc. Do your research, find the pecking order and price yourself accordingly.

, So your gear, replacements costs as gear wears out, insurance, travel, tax and national insurance, provision of services such as digital media (USB and DVD etc) online gallery services, printing costs, album design and manufacture, stationery, postage, website hosting.... the list goes on, so be really careful not to fool yourself into thinking this bit is easy or quick.

, Of course you won't have any idea initially so be conservative about it. Now you know the going rate/your costs/number of weddings you can expect to cover, which will give you a figure; if the figure looks really healthy and profitable in year one, you've probably underestimated costs and over estimated bookings achievable! Look again.

, At some point, driven by your skill, marketing ability, activity in your local market and a pinch of good fortune, you'll become established, confident and competent. To become profitable and run a business that fulfills your needs you'll need to make a final judgement call. What do you wish to earn? This is balanced against costs and how many weddings you wish to shoot per year.


If you shoot every Saturday, that's 52 a year, but you have no holiday time or flexibility. Let's say you want 6 weeks off per year to relax. Ok 46 weddings shot, and your costs amount to 55% of your price perhaps? That's about  25 weddings to cover your costs and 21 to provide enough money to pay the rent and buy food etc.

, It sounded good huh? 46 weddings a year? You're not going to get there in year one, probably not year two and possibly not year three either. It could happen and congratulations if you progress at that rate, but realistically you need to drag the figures down to 15 weddings year one, 25 year two, 35 year three. Respectively that means your 'profit' weddings in the first three years will be: Year one 8 weddings x your profit margin, Year two  14 weddings x your profit margin, Year three 19 weddings x your profit margin. Your mileage may vary in a better or worse manner of course.

, Firstly, do you go full time or stay part time? In either case you still need to earn enough to make it worthwhile, and also to live a happy life.


Make no mistake; shooting weddings and working with your clients, their family and friends to produce an end product that is truly beautiful is a real joy, but it's damned hard work too. On the day you may be working 16 hours, the following week you may be editing, making albums, uploading etc for 40 hours; you're always on call to answer inquiries, mail detailed responses to questions, telephone calls outside office hours and every 'free' day or weekend will be spent drinking coffee and consulting with new and current clients to ensure they receive an excellent customer service experience.
It's fun; actually it's a real buzz when you get into the zone, but it's not to be taken lightly, and you shouldn't give all that for free! Wishing you happy shooting, and good luck!

Behave like a professional.",How to Photograph the Female Nude," Your first task is to locate someone willing to be subject of a nude photoshoot. Get in touch with women in your area who are involved in photographic art and modeling. If you don't have any success on your own, you might be able to hire models through a professional agency. Make sure you’re able to pay what they’re asking before securing their services.Ask around at your local college campus. You’ll probably have the most luck in the photography and traditional art departments.Be delicate with your recruitment tactics. Emphasize that it's an artistic endeavor. ""I'm producing a photographic tribute to the human form in its natural state"" sounds a lot better than ""would you be up for posing naked for the camera?""
Don’t try to coerce conventional models into doing a nude shoot. Some models specialize in that type of thing; others don’t. Find a subject that suits your project and aim as an artist.;
, Before you get too eager to start shooting, you should have a definite vision in mind and the means to realize it. Think about what types of thematic elements you might want to incorporate, as well as technical details such as possible angles and ideas for lighting and framing. The worst thing you can do is go into a nude photoshoot unprepared. There should be an unspoken trust between the photographer and their subject, and the idea of taking her clothes off for an unprepared amateur with no real plan in mind may make your model uneasy.Sketch out the poses and compositions you envision most vividly and have them handy on the day of the shoot.
If possible, show your model a few visual references of the kind of images you hope to capture., Keep an eye out for eye-catching places that might work well for a nude photoshoot. The visual intrigue of your location should do your model justice. Natural landscapes, such as fields, forests and bodies of water, are a popular choice because they complement the natural state of the unclothed body. However, you might also choose an industrial site, urban sprawl or some other area that’s interesting to look at.Avoid public areas and places where you’re likely to be spied on or interrupted.
If you need a permit to take photographs in a particular location, make sure you have the details sorted out before you begin shooting.

, Schedule a preliminary meetup with your model to discuss your ideas for the shoot. Buy her lunch, take her out for coffee or invite her to your studio space for a friendly chat. Take the opportunity to break the ice before getting right down to business. Once it’s time to uncap the lens, you’ll already be acquainted and comfortable with one another.


Be sure to outline the particulars of your concept so she’ll have an idea of what to expect. Feel free to ask for her input in return.
Use this time to gauge your model's comfort level regarding your ideas for the shoot. Cut to the chase and open a dialogue with questions like ""would you be alright with...?"" and ""how would you feel about...?""
The initial meetup is not a date. Do your best to help her feel relaxed, but keep things professional and appropriate.

, Set up your light sources in a way that highlights and accentuates your model’s natural features. This might be a soft, diffuse sunset glow if you’re shooting in a cornfield, or a more stark balance of light and shadows for high-contrast black and white photos. Your lighting should work in conjunction with your model’s form and pose to produce the most aesthetically-pleasing images possible.As much as you can, rely on natural light sources, such as the sun, moon and firelight, when shooting nude subjects. It has a much warmer, more immediate feel than artificial light (studio lights and reflectors, for instance), especially for daytime shoots.
Move your light sources around and try out different brightness levels, placements and orientations until you arrive at the look you want., Unless your photography is known for a distinctive visual style, don’t be afraid to try out different compositions, filters, types of lighting, etc. Every model will be unique—every shoot should therefore be a little bit different. Be thoughtful in your approach and take the time to capture every nuance of your subject, location, lighting and action.Mix it up. Include a few black and white photos in a vibrantly colored set or find ways to incorporate other thematic elements into the shoot.
See what you can do to enhance the look of your photos (without altering them too much) during the editing phase.

, There's no need to stick too rigidly to predetermined plans. Though it’s important to have a specific vision in mind, improvising a bit can help keep your shoot fresh and exciting. Sometimes the best ideas start as accidents when you’re just playing around. You never know when you might achieve a breakthrough by simply letting things unfold on their own.Instead of simply running through a sequence of poses you decided on before the shoot, allow your model to move and position herself freely and capture everything you can. If there’s nothing usable you can always delete it later, but you might end up with one or two really special shots.

, Shake up a lifeless shoot by finding tasteful ways to hide or tease your subject’s form. Use minimalistic accessories (like scarves or jewelry) to cover sensitive parts of the body, or shoot your model from unorthodox angles or interacting with their environment from a three-dimensional perspective. The point of nude photography isn’t always to show the body in plain detail. Sometimes, less is more.In the end, your goal is to make a powerful statement. Don’t restrain your creativity in finding unique ways to shoot the human body.
Avoid graphic depictions of the genitals. This is leaving the domain of art and entering that of pornography., Provide your subject with a place they can undress and prepare for the shoot. That way they won’t be forced to change in front of you and the rest of your crew on location. It can be very nerve-wracking to strip down to your most vulnerable state around others. Remember that your model’s comfort is paramount, even if they’ve done this a hundred times before.It’s also a good idea to keep a robe or set of comfy clothes on hand that your model can slip into if they get cold while you’re setting up between shots.
Be prepared to clear the set and work with your model one-on-one if she doesn’t like the idea of having too many people around.

, As the photographer, you’re expected to know what you’re after and be able to offer direction for how to realize it. This doesn’t mean that you should treat your model like an inanimate object. Issue clear, direct instructions for how you’d like things done rather than trying to pose the subject yourself. Even if your intentions are good, putting your hands on someone when they’re completely exposed can send the wrong message.As a general rule, keep your hands off your model unless they specifically ask for help getting into or maintaining a certain posture.
A nude model isn’t a prop. Keep in mind that the woman you’re photographing is another person and has a right not to be touched without her permission.

, Give your model some freedom in depicting herself. Encourage her to contribute in her own way to the project and let her personality come through. Chances are, it won’t be her first time posing nude, and her experience and familiarity with her own body will give her a better idea of what looks good in pictures. Feed off of and draw inspiration from each other's ideas.Make sure your subject is accepting of your requests before asking her to go along with them.
Working with a model who knows how to help you make your mental image a reality can be a very rewarding experience.

, If you’re interested in shooting nude subjects, it should be because you find beauty, mystery and bold expression in the human figure. Take your model seriously as a knowledgeable fellow artist with a mind of her own. Never joke or make suggestive or judgmental remarks about her body. It takes a lot of courage to let someone photograph you without clothes on. Offending your model could leave her with a negative view of the experience.If you really upset your model, she may be outspokenly critical of your talents and discourage others from working with you.

Plan around your children.,
Make the lighting work for you.,
Coordinate clothing.,
Use a mix of staged and candid shots.,
Keep the background simple.,
Shoot at eye level.,
Place family members at different levels.",How to Set up a Family Portrait," Children often grow used to their daily routines, so if they are pulled away from them, they may become grouchy and uncooperative. Try to schedule your family portrait during a time they are naturally playful and attentive.;
, Whether shooting your family portrait indoors or outdoors, it is important to watch the amount of lighting.


Outdoor portraits are often best near dawn and dusk, when the sun is not nearly as fierce as it is in the middle of the day. Shooting during the afternoon can cause deep shadows and squinting eyes.
Indoor portraits need sufficient light to see each family member's face, but should not be so powerful that it washes faces out.

, It is not necessary to wear matching outfits, however, wearing clothing within the same color scheme can help unify your family. Wearing complementary colors or patterns can also ensure family member's outfits do not clash with each other.


Stick with solids or simple patterns. Busy shirts create a distraction and may also make you look larger than you really are.
Avoid trendy or tight-fitting clothes, sleeveless shirts, and clunky shoes. These often appear comical when you look at family portraits years later.
Make sure each person's entire outfit matches. Some family portraits may include shoes and socks that are similar styles or colors.
Casual photos include lighter colors, while more traditional portraits gear toward darker colors.

, Allow your family to interact naturally with each other while the portrait is being taken. These casual shots allow your family's personality to shine through and will provide more natural photos of your family.


If having your portrait professionally taken, ask the photographer for candid shots. This way they will have their camera ready at all times, and not just when staging the portrait.

, The purpose of a family portrait is to capture the faces of your family. Plan backdrops, natural parks or outdoor environments, bedrooms, and other simple settings help prevent the background from becoming a distraction.

, This is especially important if children are in the portrait. Kneel down or sit on a stool or the ground. These eye-level pictures create more engaging and natural pictures.

, Lining your family up in a single line is not very interesting. Instead, stagger them or pair them up. Create interacting poses where family members have arms around each other or have a hand on someone's shoulder or knee. Mix it up.

Perform a sexy photo shoot.",How to Pose at a Photo Shoot," This involves the basics like taking a shower, washing your hair, and brushing your teeth. When you are in the shower, make sure to shampoo and condition your hair so that it is soft and flexible. When you leave the shower, dry your hair off with a towel. Brush your hair at least 20-30 times through, starting at the roots and moving your brush outwards.If you want your hair in a particular style, now would be the time to do it. You can braid your hair, style it using hairspray/gels, or straighten it. The options are nearly endless depending on your personal preferences.
Professional modeling agencies might have stylists on location to help you with your hair.
Brushing your teeth is important as well. If you have stains on your teeth you may want to invest in some quick whitening strips. You can always edit the photos later, but it won't look as natural.;
, For women going to do a photo shoot, you will want to shave your legs, armpits, and trim/pluck your eyebrows. You will also want to shave any upper lip hair and sideburns. For men, grooming your facial hair is the most important thing. If you will have your shirt removed, you will want to trim some of your chest hair back as well.If either men or women are planning on doing swimsuit or sexy photo shoots, make sure to shave any excess pubic hair. Make sure to shave that area with the grain of the hair so that your skin doesn't react negatively.

, You want to make sure your skin looks as healthy and vibrant as possible. First, apply a basic moisturizing lotion with your hands. Make sure to dampen your skin first with some warm water. On top of that, you can add another layer of accented lotion which adds a glistening effect. These could be lotions which have added oils or glitter.Make sure to use extra thin layers of lotion. You do not want it to look bulky on your skin. Thin layers also help when it comes to applying makeup later on.

, You can either perform your daily makeup routine, or change it up. Make sure to apply lipstick, mascara, and eye liner. Depending on the type of photo shoot will change the way you apply your makeup. If you are going for an exciting, fun look, you might add ""funky"" colored eye liner such as lime green or teal. A more serious photo shoot might call for traditionally darker tones, such as black and brown (colors which match your eyes).Use coverup to get rid of any noticeable marks you don't want to appear in the photos. This could be a mole, a zit, or a scar.
Highlight and/or accent your cheeks with foundation and face powder. Apply these with a soft brush so as to not irritate your skin.

, This all depends on what you are doing the photo shoot for. If you are working for a modeling agency, you will obviously have to wear that companies clothes. They will usually dress you right before the shoot on location. If you are just doing a normal photo shoot for yourself, pick an outfit which represents the ideas you want to express.You might focus on season. For example, if you are doing a Christmastime photo shoot for a greeting card, choose sweaters, long pants, leggings, etc. You want to express warmth, and calmness. If you are doing a summer photo shoot, wear a nice skirt or dresses with no arms. You want to express liveliness and fun.
Focusing on a mood is another way to go. If you want your pictures to be serious, wear darker colors, and clothes that cover more skin. Short shorts and bright colors are best for more upbeat, happy photo shoots.
You will also want to pick out a pair of matching shoes if you are doing a full body pose.

, Unless your photographers tell you to be inspired by those awkward, uncomfortable looking mannequins in the Forever 21 windows, hold yourself confidently and high. You'll look much taller and thinner if you keep your back straight and your shoulders back. Whatever size you are, hold your stomach in as well if you want to look more toned.Photography that is more avant-garde (experimental and/or unusual) may shy away from this. If you're modeling for a photo shoot that is about shunning preconceived concepts, then by all means try it. Your photographer will probably want you in not-so-true-to-life poses.

, It's important to be aware of exactly how you're positioning your entire body. Nonverbal communication is all you have to rely on in photos. Whatever you do, you'll be sending a message.As a model you'll need to look natural. This is where you may need to practice. A key point is to keep your arms and legs relaxed. You don't keep them straight all the time in normal life, so don't do it in front of the camera.
Keep in mind the effects of light on your body. The more angles you create in your body position, the more shadows which will appear.

, You'll feel a lot more comfortable as a model if you build a rapport with your photographer or director. It will make the experience a lot more enjoyable, give you the confidence to introduce your own ideas and ultimately help you with future modeling assignments.In addition to making that project more enjoyable, the staff will be more apt to like you. The more they like you, the more they'll think of your name when future projects come up. And, possibly, the more they'll recommend you to another company.

, Unless directed by the photographer to do otherwise, when standing, put the majority of your body weight on one foot only; this will make your body make a naturally gracious ""S"" shape.Regardless of your body shape, doing this will simulate more of an hourglass figure. Popping your hip out gives you a curve in just the right place. Think of modeling in curves and angles.

, This will accent your waist in a good way, regardless of its size. When you can, keep your arms separate and slightly flexed.If you put your hands to your sides and your feet together, you'll feel like one of those dolls from the nutcracker, i.e. you won't feel natural or human. Always use the space around you to create life in the image.

, Never display the full palm or the back of the hand. This is an old photography go-to that most photographers still swear by.


The hands are best viewed at an angle to the camera. Care should be taken to photograph the side of the hand, which gracefully continues the line of the arm when the hand is bent upward at the wrist.

, Research poses in magazines from models you'd like to emulate and practice them at home. When it comes to your next photo shoot you'll feel a lot more confident. Also, ask for advice from the directors of previous assignments so you know what types of posture and positions make the most of your body.As you get going, you'll realize what elements of the photo the staff is trying to emphasize. Think of yourself as a machine to display the beauty of the image; you're there to emphasize the clothes, the makeup, or the feel of the photograph. What can you do to make the picture more cohesive? Take the emphasis off yourself and think of the bigger picture.

, When it comes to your visage, make sure you get some variety in your shots. Have some looking directly at the camera, some looking away, some smiling and some serious. Also, try not to blink when the photos are being taken.You don't have to stick with the feel of the scene. For example, if there is a sunshine as a backdrop, you can still express sadness in your face. If there is a moon and a dark atmosphere, you can still smile. The goal is to create dynamism and a greater message.

, The photographer can either cut you off at your midsection for a close up photo, or you may have a surface in front of you blocking the rest of your body. Work with this in a number of ways.Turn around and look backwards over your shoulder. It's very simple, but it can also be evocative.
Play with your hands near your shoulders or face. But remember the rule: only show the sides of your hands. This continues the line of your arm, making them look longer and leaner.
Lean forward slightly. This, when done well, can look candid and emphasize the curve of your body. Since you don't have the entirety of your shape to create the ""S,"" allude to this by leaning forward slightly, invitingly.

, With your whole form on camera, you have loads of options when it comes to posing. Ask your director what he/she is looking for and narrow it down from there.Turn slightly and put your hands in your back pockets. If you don't have back pockets, place them where they would be if you did. This accomplishes another rule: leaving space between your trunk and your arms.
Support your back against a wall. Throw up the leg closest to the camera and rest the foot on the wall as well. Don't put up the other leg; you generally want to keep the outer thigh exposed, not the inner thigh.
Move your hands up and down your body and slowly twist side to side. Full height shots are hard to do and you'll want to keep a constant curve and natural flow. Consider raising your hands above your head, too, for a rather sensual pose.

, Just as you have a plethora of options while standing, you have just as many on the ground. And you may be more comfortable.Place your hands behind your back, resting on the ground and throw out your legs, with one knee slightly up. Throw your head back a bit. The long line of your body will create a nice angle and shape.
Sit Indian style, but pull up one knee to your chest. Wrap your hand around the leg closest to you and tilt your shoulders and neck. Clasp your hands together just past the view of the camera.
Sit on the ground, but on your side. Throw one hand to your side and one arm resting loosely on a bent knee. Place the foot of your other leg at the heel of your foot that is resting flat on the ground.

, This might involve women getting in either bikinis or lingerie, and men getting into swim trunks or their underwear. The key for a sexy photo shoot is to tease the audience. Place your hand gently on sensitive areas, like right outside the chest, or near where your lower torso meets your leg.You will want to lower your eyelids as you glance towards the camera.
Tilt your head slightly to the left or right, and back a bit, to showcase your neck line.
You can also emphasize certain aspects of your body. Men can tighten their torso muscles, leaning their stomach in slightly as they protrude their shoulders out. Women can twist their bodies slightly to showcase their breasts and butt. Bending your knees while arching your back slightly also helps to accentuate your features.

Prepare a photography project.,
Develop the project.,
Find the location.,
Find a model: Depending on your skill level, you can join a modeling website and from there you can locate a model that fits your needs for an image.,
Plan the Outfit.,
Set the Date and Time of the shoot.,
Day before Preparations.",How to Run a Photography Project on Scene1," This might be the most difficult and most important step to an entire photo shoot. You must first come up with a concept or idea that you want to shoot. It could be as simple as, ""I want to shoot my friend in the park,"" or as complex as, ""I want to produce a conceptual image, depicting how a dog sees the world."";
, Whether it is difficult or not, you have to go further with what you want. Maybe write down a short list of what you want from the image or images. Here's a short list of questions you can ask yourself to develop your idea further


Am I trying to make an emotion connection? If so what emotion?
What do I want to be in the image?
Do I have a specific location to use or do I need to find one?
Are there specific poses that I would like to use?
What is the most important part of the image? etc.

, The next important step is, if you don't have one yet, find a location. With your idea developed, you should have an idea of what you are looking for in a location. Finding the location can take time and you might not find the location that you imagined in your head, so improvising might help. Scouting the location, whether you know it or not, is key to success in making a solid image. You need to pay attention to the lighting of your scene and other factors, like weather. Things change, but having an idea of what you will need for lighting and for weather changes is nice to know going into a shoot.

, If you're new or don't want to join a site, you can always ask a friend for their time. Usually finding a person to be in your image isn't too difficult, it seems.

, Sometimes this doesn't matter too much, but if you have a specific style for the photograph, you might want to take time to figure this out. When you have connections to people or money to waste, you can always go out and get exactly the outfit you want, but that won't apply to many people here. The best way to do this then, is to have an idea of what you want and explain this to your model. It can be helpful to have images of what exactly you are talking about. Visuals help people to be able to think of what they have that is similar to what you are asking.

, You have the idea, the location, the model, and their outfit planned. You should have a understand of how the lighting of the photograph will be done. Now it is time to set up a date and time for the shoot. Timing matters. There needs to be a common time for you and your model can meet, but this time has to also coincide with the time of day you want the image to be taken also. When a date and time are finalized though, attempt to make a ""make up shoot"" day also. This is a fall back, in case something happens to force the shoot to another time.

, Usually the day before you shoot, you should make sure that your model is still ready for the next day and that the weather, if important, is going to be ok for you. All of your equipment should be checked and cleaned and ready to be transported.

"
"
Plan your day ahead of time.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Get a haircut or tan a few days before the shoot.",How to Prepare for a Professional Business Portrait1," Make an appointment with a photographer well in advance. Visit the websites of several photographers or call them directly to ask about pricing, time frame, and availability. Don’t plan anything immediately following your shoot, in case you and your photographer spend more time than expected.Be aware that different photography studios will have different rules about booking, including cancellation policies. Make sure to choose a appointment on a day and time you’ll be able to keep!
If you need your portrait to be ready by a certain date, schedule you shoot a few weeks before, to make sure there is time for your photos to be edited and finalized.;
, Get eight hours of sleep during each of the two nights preceding your shoot. It’s most important to get plenty of sleep two nights before the shoot, though you should get to bed early the night before too. Otherwise, do whatever makes you feel happy and healthy. In particular, try to squeeze in a jog or another form of exercise on the days leading up to your shoot.Avoid drinking the night before your shoot. Alcohol can have a detrimental effect on your in skin tone, give you baggy eyes, and diminish the quality of your rest.

, Plan to get your hair trimmed about a week before the shoot. Don’t plan to get a haircut the day before, as this may lead to evident tan lines along the edges of your hairline. Further, ensure your skin is in good shape for the shoot by taking care to prevent a sunburn in the days preceding your shoot. If you do want to tan before the shoot, do so at least a few days before.Avoid spray-tanning before a photo shoot.
A hair cut might be worth the time even if you don’t think you need one. Getting rid of split ends or touching up any grey areas can greatly improve the quality of your photos.

Set up.,
Do your thing.",How to Run a Photography Project on Scene2," It's the day of the shoot. You've arrived early to scout the location real quick, just in case something is different or something needs to be changed quickly. Before your model arrives, if they aren't early themselves, set up your equipment. If you have any extra lighting equipment or backdrops needed to be place, make sure those are done. Set your exposure on you camera and fire off a few test shots.

, The time has finally come. All of your planning has come to this moment. When everything is the way you want it, it is time to shoot. When working with a person, it is nice to talk with them, make sure they are comfortable and relaxed. This is the fun part, so move around and even if you think you got your shot, take more. Get every angel and every pose you can think of and then make some up.

Default to solid colors.,
Compliment your skin tones.,
Wear a suit.,
Wear a well-fitting blouse.,
Accessorize minimally.,
Wear long sleeves.,
Contact your photographer with questions.",How to Prepare for a Professional Business Portrait2," You can get away with a bit of pattern on a tie or scarf, but you should wear mostly solid colors. Avoid large stripes or any especially loud patterns. Even if they look good in person, patterns will dominate your photo and distract attention away from your face.Avoid wearing anything with a visible brand or other decals.
Avoid any especially bright or neon colors.

, Choose clothing colors based on your skin. Light brown skin and hair pairs best with shades of brown, orange, or soft yellow. Dark hair and skin match wonderfully with bright colors like strong blues, greens, or red. Especially light skin and light hair is often complimented by pastels, including blues, purples, and greens. Light-skinned people should minimize the red they’re wearing.If you can’t decide, think of the shirts you wear that get the most compliments. Frequent compliments may indicate a good color match between the shirt and your skin tone.

, For men in particular, a suit is an integral component of a professional business portrait. Blue suits are usually better, especially when paired with a light blue shirt. White shirts and black suits, though they great in person, often appear less attractive in digital photos.You have a bit more freedom regarding the color and design of a tie. Red is said to convey power, while yellows are another popular set of colors for ties.

, Ladies, pay particular attention to the fit of your shirt. You want to avoid anything too baggy or too loose. Opt for a fitted blouse or dress that compliments your figure. If you're going with a button-down shirt, make sure none of the buttons gape when the shirt is fully buttoned.


A collared button down that fits well is the ideal choice for most women. Wear a tailored suit coat as well if you usually do so at your job., A few subtle accessories can liven up your portrait. However, it’s best to keep accessories low-key. Definitely leave large hoop earrings at home the day of your shoot. Similarly, don’t wear an oversized watch or ring if your hands may be in some of the shots. Opt for simple, elegant jewelry, if any. , Exposed arms may look great, but they will distract attention away from your face. This applies to both men and women, though it can make clothing selections a bit more challenging for women in particular. Regardless of gender, it’s best to dress conservatively for business professional portraits. Button your shirt most of the way up, perhaps leaving only the top button open if you’re not wearing a tie., The person you hire to take your portraits will be happy to give you advice on what to wear. Call them or shoot them an email with any specific questions. They can also provide general tips on what to look for or avoid."

Bring extra clothing options.,
Wear your regular eyewear.,
Freshen up before the shoot.,
Bring your makeup.,
Show up on time!,
Relax and smile!",How to Prepare for a Professional Business Portrait3," In fact, bring two changes of clothes. It’s best to wear something else to the studio and bring the clothing you hope to wear to make sure they stay cleaned and pressed. Further, be sure to bring at least one extra shirt and multiple different accessory options., Professional portraits should positively represent who you are in your everyday life. For instance, if you usually wear glasses, wear them in your portrait. Don’t worry about glare or reflection, your photographer will ensure that you get glare-free photos.Avoid wearing transitions lenses in either glasses or contacts.

, Make sure your hair is washed and styled for the shoot. This will ensure a clean, professional portrait. Bring a brush or comb with you for last second hair maintenance. Bring a toothbrush and toothpaste too! It’s worth brushing your teeth just before your shoot., You’ll likely want to touch up your makeup right before your shoot. In fact, it’s likely worth putting on a tiny bit more makeup than usual, as photography lighting often diminishes the effect of makeup. Either way, bring your makeup kit, just in case. Powder to help reduce shine on your face may prove especially helpful.If you have the time and money to get your makeup done professionally earlier in the day, consider this option. This is by no means necessary, of course.
Rest assured that your photographer will edit out any blemishes or acne, so don’t worry too much if you breakout just before your shoot.
The best makeup for a shoot is slightly different than your everyday makeup. There are tutorials available on YouTube to help guide your makeup application.

, Give yourself some extra time to prepare for your shoot at the studio before you’re scheduled to get your photos taken. Feel free to contact the studio with any questions about dressing or otherwise preparing for your shoot at the studio. They may also have specific recommendations about when to show up and how they may be able to help you prepare for the shoot.Be prepared to do some last minute touches. Don't assume that the makeup that you put on this morning is going to last the day. You may need to redo your hair, makeup, and clothes!
Some studios may not have space for you to prepare before you’re scheduled to arrive. Instead, they may expect you to spend some time preparing with them.

, It may be challenging to stay calm while having your photo taken. If this is the case, allow yourself a few minutes to ease into the experience. The photos will turn out better if you’re able to relax and flash some genuine smiles. Your photographer will likely help you relax by trying to chat with you. Listen to what they’re saying and allow yourself to laugh – not matter how bad the jokes.If something in particular is making your nervous, let the photographer no about it. They will either address the issue to assure you that the photos will turn out great anyway!
Remind your photographer has chosen a profession helping to make other people look good. Follow their advice, and trust in the process they’ve developed!

Talk a bit before the shoot, but don’t overdo it.,
Go slowly, but not too slowly.,
Have her remove one item at a time, even just a zipper or button; and do anywhere from a couple to a dozen shots.,
Don’t progress to nudity as quickly as you would with an experienced model.

,
Try non-frontal angles of view.,
Do not be hesitant or reserved.,
The first full-frontal nude will typically occur within twenty minutes of starting to shoot.,
Keep moving onward.,
As soon as each pose is captured, direct a new one.,
Fire the flashes two or three seconds apart for a few frames and then switch to the next pose.",How to Photograph a First Timer Nude," Do the shoot as soon as she’s comfortable; don’t delay unnecessarily. Don’t make a big deal of it. Greet the model warmly with a handshake and chat a bit.;
, Start off photographing the model wearing an outfit.

, Don’t do more than a dozen shots without progressing, unless you feel your model is becoming ill at ease. Props or accessories can help the model feel more comfortable and focus her attention.

,, Side or back shots can be mixed in to help the model warm up.

, Simply instruct the model as to how you want her to pose, including her outfit.

, Of course it’s not necessary for your style to include frontal nudity.

, It’s important to keep things moving so the model doesn’t have a chance to feel nervous about why you may be pausing. Keep shooting in a steady (but not rushed) fashion.

, By the time you shoot a model’s first nude, you may have captured over a hundred frames of her in a fifteen or twenty minute warm up, shooting an average of every 10 to 15 seconds.

, By keeping a steady pace, it puts the model into a great mind set to keep working. This helps with all models, but especially first timers.

Plan ahead.,
Identify what kind of kid you are going to photograph: a shy kid or a restless one?,
Make friends with the children.,
Does your camera have ""Kids & Pets Mode"" or an ""Action"" mode?,
Be a kid.,
Allow the children to make faces or silly poses.,
Use soft colors.,
Resort to bribery.,
Go for candid shots.,
For shy kids...,
Shoot a lot and shoot fast.,
Have fun... and go wild!",How to Photograph Children," When getting ready to photograph children, think beforehand about possible locations, backgrounds, poses or activities and props. Having a plan in advance will allow you to be able to move more quickly during the shoot and change direction with the children at a moment's notice. Choose locations that will not distract the kids' attention away from you.;
, A loner on the playground or a crazy sleepover party? Steel yourself for the problems you might face, especially with hyperactive children.

, Get down to their eye level. Children will feel more comfortable with you if you are not towering over them. Ask them questions. Get to know them a little. This will help you relate to them while you are taking the photos and will warm them up to you and your suggestions.

, This can help immensely, by reducing blurriness and shutter lag, and snapping the photo quicker. Find this mode and use it!

, Or at least let them be kids. Forcing children into structured poses that take a long time is probably not going to be the most successful approach to obtaining fabulous photographs. Make the time fun and fast-paced. Cater to what makes kids smile. Keep in mind that children, especially smaller ones, rebel against long periods of sitting still.

, Throw out a few jokes or funny actions that will make them laugh. If you have a knack for acting or have some goofy gimmicks you are known for, this is the time to pull them out and have them really work for you. This keeps their attention and provokes the smiles the parents are looking for in the photographs.


Make sitting down for a photo seem fun. In exchange for one nice photo, tell them they get one silly photo. This is a lot of fun for groups, where everyone smiles innocently in one photo and then goes crazy in the next.

, Harsh blue and white lights seem strange on kids. Go for soft, friendly colors that will put your kids (literally) in a better light.


Use props. A prop can attract the kids' attention to you. You can also use a prop to increase the kids' interest. A smaller child may also feel special if he or she gets to hold or stand near the prop in some of the photos. Because of this, you may want to coordinate props with parents beforehand.

, An effective tactic for photographing children is to bribe them--treats, candy, props or even being able to come view the photo in the viewfinder after a photo is taken. Just make sure this is approved by the parents ahead of time.

, Instead of announcing that you're about to take some photos, hide in the shadows. Take those funny pictures of your kids laughing hysterically with (they think!) no adults around. Watch Sarah blow bubbles in silence, or Joey observe the anthill in peace. Take pictures of them doing things they love, so the photo is genuine and not posed.

, If a kid refuses to pose for a photo, wait for the right moment, when she's not looking, and snap away. To convince them to pose- bribe, beg, or threaten. Tell them it won't hurt, it's just one snapshot, and you'll portray them in the best light possible.

, One of the great benefits of digital photography is that you can take some superfluous shots in order to get to the shots you have been wanting. If you sit and wait for the perfect moment, you are likely to miss it and many others. Keep your finger on the shutter button and you will be rewarded in the end with photographs you never imagined capturing.

, There are lots of different fun ways to photograph kids. Have them pretend to be dinosaurs or supermodels. Dress them up in funny clothes or have them make silly faces. The possibilities are endless!

Find a model.,
Decide where to shoot.,
Get comfortable.,
Get the lighting sorted.,
Focus on the muscles.,
Strike a pose.,
Forget that you are looking at a nude model.,
Focus on natural poses to hint at the sensual.",How to Photograph the Male Nude," You're asking a guy to pose nude for you for hours at a time, so he needs to know you're legitimate. Professional artist models are used to posing nude, but most people aren't. So it is important to show prospective models a portfolio of your best pictures. Draw out what you plan to photograph. That way, there will be no surprises during the shoot. Some good model sources include:


model agencies
ads in photo magazines
college art departments;
, Remember, the focus is on the body, not the background. That said, paper or cloth backgrounds can transform an ordinary room into a photo studio.


And shooting outside gives you great natural light. A nude beach is perfect but a secluded garden or yard will do.

, Keep the room warm. Put up a storyboard of what you plan to shoot. That way, the model knows exactly where you're going. Also, provide a changing room.

, Use some strobe flash heads with either chimera soft boxes or reflecting umbrellas. You can rent these, including the stands, for under US$75.


If your camera can't fire the lights, rent an independent socket that you can attach to the camera's hot-shoe. Attach a sync cable to the flash unit, so that the strobes fire when you snap the pictures.
And use a light meter to set the exposure.

, There are many ways to light the male nude, but since the male form is all about the muscles, you want to light in a way that highlights these best. Light from angles that cause the muscles to cast shadows on each other. Go really dramatic with only using backlight or use no light on the subject at all, exposing the background and creating a silhouette.

, The male body is about power. Muscles. Make them stand out. Have your model flex or twist his shoulders off-axis from his hips. This creates a sense of movement.

, Just look at the form in front of you, as if it were an abstract sculpture or a landscape. What shapes are interesting? There's no need to show the full Monty unless it adds to your picture. Usually, showing it will distract viewers from everything else in the picture.

, Steer clear of the pornographic.

"
"
Use a longer lens.,
Don't shoot from a lower angle.,
If photographing multiple people, use one to shield the view of the other.

,
Don't shoot the body of the individual.,
Work with the lighting.,
Find a flattering position.,
Be sure the subject's face is pointed approximately 45 degrees away from the camera.,
Be aware of the possibility of a 'double chin' and use lighting and position to alleviate the look of it.

",How to Photograph an Overweight Person," Either a telephoto lens or a long zoom. This helps to compress the shot and reduces distortion.;
, Shoot straight across or at a bit of an upward angle.


Shooting from a higher location looking down is a common ploy used by photographers and is considered somewhat overused. However, try it and see if it helps.

,, Try headshots and head and shoulders shots.

, Short (or narrow) lighting works well with rounder faces.

, Have one shoulder angled away from the camera.

, This way, the main light can light the side that is turned away and a weaker fill light for the other side of the face. You will need to experiment and adjust because it will show more facial contours than broad lighting will and may give a more masculine look.

Feed your baby before the photography session.,
Keep the space as warm as possible.,
Use a white noise machine to drown out camera noises.,
Soothe your newborn constantly during the session.,
Try using sound to get your newborn's attention.",How to Photograph a Newborn1," It’s best to photograph a newborn after a full feeding. They’re more likely to stay calm during or sleep through a photography session on a full stomach.If your newborn is fussy or needs a feeding, take plenty of breaks as needed.;
, Try to keep the location around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). Newborns need a warm environment and have trouble regulating their body temperature.Feel their skin to make sure they’re warm, and look for splotchy patterns or any discoloration. If necessary, take a break to swaddle the baby in a warm blanket.
If the baby is sweating, it’s too hot and you should turn down the heat.
You can use a space heater to help warm the room, but make sure to keep it far away from the infant., While photographing your newborn, your camera might make lots of strange noises. Turn on a white noise machine to drown out the noise and avoid startling your newborn. That way, you’ll reduce the chances that they’ll be fussy during the photo shoot., Try continuously making cooing noises to reassure your newborn. They might be a only a few days old, but if you’ve already discovered calming techniques that they like, use them frequently to keep your newborn from fussing.For example, if you’ve found that your newborn loves bouncing, try keeping a yoga ball on hand so you can take calming bouncing breaks during the shoot.

, Getting a newborn to look at the camera is tricky business, so you might want to embrace capturing a natural or sleeping pose. A newborn can only see within a foot of their face, so your best bet is to use sound to get them to look at the camera.Try cooing, speaking softly, or making other quiet noises. Try not to startle your newborn, and if they're sleeping, just let them be.

Use a digital camera.,
Consider the setting.,
Consider how you will light the picture.,
Use a fan to add movement to a shot.,
Talk to the model.,
Get the white balance and exposure right.,
Think carefully about how you frame your shots.,
Get the model to try out lots of different poses and expressions.,
Move around.",How to Photograph a Model," While many professionals still prefer film, a digital camera allows more room for experimentation. Until you know exactly how to get the very best shots, or are being paid a lot of money to take them, stick with digital so the number of pictures you can take isn't limited and you can see immediately how good a shot is.;
, Are you going to be shooting against a plain white background or something more exciting? Will you be indoors or outdoors? Make sure you know where the model will be and have an idea of the kind of poses you want them to do, so you can make sure the setting is suitable for what you want.

, Natural light is very different to indoor lighting, plan how you will light your picture and allow for anything going wrong with the lighting if you are shooting outside.

, Fans can add movement to hair and clothing, making an image look for more exciting. A fan won't be appropriate for all pictures however, so if it won't look right in your shoot, don't use it.

, It is easier to get a good picture of someone when they feel comfortable around you, chatting to the model while you are working together can help make her feel more relaxed, resulting in better pictures.

, Technicalities aren't everything, but these two are vital to getting a picture that looks right. Make sure your white balance and exposure are right and don't be afraid to change them if the lighting changes.

, Consider which parts of the picture are important and which parts aren't. Try not to let the rest of the image detract attention from the model.

, Give them directions on what kind of poses you want, if you need them to move their arm an inch the right to make the shot look great, ask them to move their arm. You are the one who can see how the shot will look, you need to tell the model what to do, don't rely on them figuring it out themselves.

, Don't take all your pictures in the same spot, move around and take pictures from different angles, you might be surprised what comes out looking good.

Choose a location with lots of natural light.,
Use a blanket or duvet as a backdrop.,
Prop your newborn on a bean bag.",How to Photograph a Newborn2," Look around your house for a well-lit spot, like by a north or south facing window. A slightly diffused natural light source, like a window covered by a shear curtain, is your best option. That way, your shot will be well-lit without exposing the newborn to direct sunlight.If your home doesn’t have any good natural light sources, see if you can set up a photo shoot at the home of a friend or family member. If necessary, you can also push the ISO setting up to make your camera more light sensitive.While it won't cause any damage, a flash can startle a newborn, so it's best to go with natural light., A simple backdrop will give your newborn full focus. Try creating your own backdrop by hanging a solid-colored blanket, duvet, or curtain by the natural light source.You can use thumbtacks to hang the backdrop or drape it over a pair of tall chairs.
Go for a solid, neutral color like black or beige.

, Try swaddling your baby in a blanket or just pose them in a diaper. Cover a bean bag with a soft, solid-colored sheet or baby blanket that will be comfortable for your newborn. Place the bean bag in front of the backdrop, then lay the newborn on the bean bag.If you want to photograph your newborn in the nude or without a diaper, try placing a puppy potty pad under the sheet to avoid soiling the bean bag.

Use continuous shooting mode so you don’t miss a shot.,
Use an aperture setting smaller than f2.,
Choose an ISO of 100 to 400.,
Zoom in to capture tiny details.",How to Photograph a Newborn3," Babies can be unpredictable, and taking rapid consecutive shots will help make sure you get the photograph you need between fussing and fidgeting. Chances are, if you can take 30 pictures over the course of several seconds, you’ll find at least one winning shot.You’ll also increase your chances of capturing an adorable happenstance expression using continuous shot mode.
If you’re not sure how, check your camera’s user guide or look through its settings to find a continuous shooting mode.

, The aperture size is similar to your eye’s pupil: it controls how much light enters the lens and which part of the image appears in sharp focus.When photographing a newborn, use an aperture setting of f2 or smaller. A smaller aperture will increase your depth of field, or give you a larger area of focus.Keep in mind an aperture set to f2 is smaller than one set to f1.4. The larger the number, the smaller the aperture. The larger the aperture, the smaller the area in focus.

, ISO controls your camera’s sensitivity to light. When a camera is too light sensitive, lots of distracting background “noise” will appear in the photograph.If you have a good amount of natural light, set your ISO between 100 and 400.As you take photographs, check the backgrounds for undesired spots or patches. Lower the ISO if your camera is picking up too much light.
The higher the ISO, and the more sensitive a camera is to light, the less time it takes to capture an image: ISO 100 takes one second to capture an image, while ISO 400 takes a quarter of a second. Try to find an ISO setting that eliminates background noise but gives you the quickest capture time., In addition to full portraits, grab a macro lens or use whatever zoom function you have available to capture tiny details. Zoom in on little fingers, feet, toes, noses, lips, and other features to preserve your newborn’s precious proportions.Try placing your newborn’s hands over your own (or your spouse’s or other children) to create size comparisons.

Sketch out your idea on paper.,
Scan your drawing.,
Open the file in whatever program you want to use.,
Alternatively, sketch directly in the art program you're using.",How to Make Digital Art1," Unless you don't have a scanner, this is the best way to start. Try to get the anatomy and physiology of your subject as close as possible, but don't fret, as adjustments can be made later. Don't add too much detail such as fur or clothing texture just yet. Be sure to use pencil if you want to fix mistakes.With the sketch, getting the details right isn't as important as getting the general ideas and feel of the illustration down. The drawing will likely change a lot between this step and the final result.;
, Place your drawing face down on the scanner. Close the scanner and then start the scan. Name the file once it's finished scanning and save it as a .PNG or .JPEG for the highest quality.

, GIMP is good for beginners since it is free to download. It's probably not a good idea to use Microsoft Paint because of its limited features and hard to view canvas. A lot of people use Adobe Photoshop for making digital art.

, If you do not have a scanner, you can make your sketch directly in the program you're going to use. Plug the tablet into the computer using the cable that came with the tablet, and follow the instructions with the tablet to install the software.


Open the program you chose to draw with, and connect your tablet. Then create a new file, and start sketching.

"
"
Make layers.,
Outline the drawing.,
Get the basic colors in.",How to Make Digital Art2," Right now your sketch is the only layer in the file. First, create a background layer by hitting the new layer button, and using the fill-in tool to fill the transparent layer in white. Then drag that layer to the bottom, so that it's the first layer of the drawing. For each major part of the drawing, like the face, hair, clothes, and background, create a new layer above your sketch layer, and name them appropriately.Multiple layers allow for more detail and flexibility without the risk of messing up the entire piece.

, On each layer you've created, start outlining the sketch with the brush tool. Set the brush to a small size like 2 to 4 pixels. The outline will make things easier to color later on. In this step you can also fix any anatomy mistakes that you made while sketching.After outlining the whole drawing. Delete or hide the sketch layer, so you can color in the outline without being distracted by the sketchy lines of your original sketch.

, After you've outlined your drawing, you'll need to sketch out the colors of your drawing. Use brushes of varying sizes, depending on how big of an area you're filling in, and color in all the different sections of your drawing. Just use a single color for each area, like the face, hair, and each article of clothing."
"
Add detail.,
Shade your drawing.,
When finished, be sure to merge all the layers.,
Export the file.",How to Make Digital Art3," Depending on your skills, style, and ease with the program, you can do many different things here. You can add more layers and get even more detailed, or skip straight to the shading section. Just remember that more layers are good if you want to fix one aspect of a picture and not the entire thing. This is when you can add things like more detail to the eyes, pockets and creases in the clothing, and structure to the background.

, To start shading, pick the eyedropper tool and use it on the area you want to shade. Then go into the color picker and drag the color to a darker shade. Use that color and the brush tool to shade the area you're working on. Repeat to add more shading and shade the entire drawing., First, save a copy of the file so that you can go back and work on it more later if you choose. Since .PNG and .JPEG can't handle them, you'll have to merge all layers into one in order to save in those formats.

, Go to file, and save as. Save the file as a .PNG or .JPEG. If you ever want to go back and change something in the drawing, you can open the .PSD file, or whatever file type the program you have uses.

Buy a bunch of LEDs.,

Set up your mini studio.,

Clean everything.,
Set up your camera.,

Set up your lighting.,
Shut off any other light sources, artificial and natural.,

Take a few photos.,
Do whatever you need to in software to fix up a final version of your image.",How to Make a Mini Photo Studio with LED Lighting," The more, the better. LEDs are so ridiculously cheap that you may as well buy a bagful of them in different varieties.




  Cheap LED keychains might be the best way to get your individual LEDs.

Individual LEDs, of course, give you the most precise control over your lighting. Unless you know what you're doing, don't buy LEDs by themselves; you'll have to worry about power sources, wiring and so on, all of which takes time better spent on having fun taking photographs. The easiest (and hardly more expensive) way is to buy some cheap novelty LED key-chains; they invariably come with batteries included, and you get a free switch thrown in, too.




 A multi-LED torch, diffused with cigarette rolling paper, is an excellent addition.

Cheap multi-LED torches are another good source of LED lighting. You'll want a couple of these. Bear in mind that the directed, multi-LED light from one of these will massively overpower your single LEDs. You'll want to diffuse the light with thin paper, such as cigarette rolling papers. Don't buy anything that doesn't have batteries included.;
, You'll want a plain-coloured backdrop to shoot against; find yourself a relatively thick piece of A2 or A3 card, or a few sheets of paper if you want to be really cheap. Optionally, a piece of glass under your subject works well to cut out harsh shadows under your subject, and the reflections look somewhat cool to boot., When photographing small things, every last speck of dust will show up in your final picture, and you'll find yourself spending way too long clone-brushing it out in Photoshop or GIMP later on. Make sure both your subject and your studio are meticulously clean, or at least as close to it as you can be bothered to get., Because nothing's moving, speed doesn't matter here, so you can take as much time as you need to get it looking as good as it can — that means low ISOs, small apertures for depth of field, and (consequently) long exposures. You'll also need to set up your camera to deal with the weird colour balance typical of LEDs.
Get it on a tripod. If you don't have a tripod, get one, even the cheapest, nastiest plastic tripod you can find. You'll be looking at taking some very long exposures (into the seconds), so you can rule out hand-holding the camera. If you have a remote release (or self-timer) and a mirror lock-up, use these too.
Set your white balance. Bright ""white"" LEDs actually have a significant blue/purple shift. If you're too lazy to use a grey card and set a custom white balance (even if your camera supports it), your best bet here is to set it to ""Auto"", and pray (which is how all the example photos here were done). If your camera guesses it wrong, you can always fix this later in software.




 Depth of field is critical close up; at f/2 at half a meter, depth of field is almost non-existent, as illustrated by the defocus visible here.

Set your camera to aperture-priority auto-exposure if you have it. Because we're taking photographs of relatively small things at short distances, you're going to need every bit of depth of field you can get. Use the small aperture you have, typically anywhere between f/16 and f/32.Turn down your camera's ISO as low as it will go, and don't use ""Auto"" if you have it. Lower ISOs mean less noise and longer shutter speeds; we don't care about the latter (since we're not in a rush and nothing's moving) and less noise is always better.




 This old 58mm (90mm equivalent) lens took most of the photographs in this article.

Use a longer focal length. The 55mm end of a digital SLR kit lens will do just fine if you don't have something longer. Just don't get closer than you have to; small things look weird if you get too close., This is art, not science, so nobody can tell you how it should look. Just take your many LEDs and move them around until things look just about right, and your scene is consistently lit (or inconsistently lit, if your art requires that)., The point of using LEDs is for total, minute control over your lighting; with their limited power, even the weakest incandescent lightbulb can overpower them. Close your curtains and turn off the lights., Look on your LCD and check the exposure. If it's consistently over - or under - exposed (look for blown-out or nearly blown-out highlights, or crappy shadows), set some exposure compensation and try again. If only part of it is incorrectly exposed (assuming this is not the effect you're looking for), then keep moving lights around and adding new ones until it looks good. Digital makes this easy, and free, so experiment away.Don't throw away anything but the most pathologically badly-exposed shots; you can keep these around for painting in lost detail with layer masks, ghetto HDR style, in software later on., This will inevitably involve removing dust, fixing the colour balance and probably some selective sharpening as well."

Don't pose too much.,
Stand straight with your head held high.,
Smile.,
Relax as much as you can.Just before the photograph is taken, take a deep breathe and then breathe out.

",How to Look Your Best in Photos," The more natural you look the better the photo.;
, Turn your body slightly to the side by putting one leg in front of the other,as shown below. This allows you to show your face and body in a ""semi-profile"", which is very flattering., Nobody looks good when they are miserable. You've probably been told to say ""cheese"", but this can make a smile look more like a grimace. For a natural, gentle smile that is easy to maintain, push your tongue against the back of your top teeth.


Open your eyes wide (not too wide or you'll look startled or slightly crazy). Don't stare directly into the camera,as this may result in your eyes looking red in the photograph. Direct your gaze slightly above the camera.

Lighting of your photo
Squinted or closed eyes
Wrong angle on your face
Not using your best smile
Cosmetic issues, such as blemishes and black heads, or a hairstyle or clothing choice that doesn't suit you;
, The best way to find out your best angle or smile is to practice. Decide what positions you look best in.


Decide if your right or left side looks the best. Our faces aren't completely symmetrical, so one side generally looks better than the other.
Try angling your body so that you will be familiar with how to position yourself when you get in front of a camera. You need be turn about 45 degrees for the most flattering pose.
Your hair style usually helps determine which side looks better, especially if your hairstyle is asymmetrical., Wear clothes that you know look good on you. Dress in flattering cuts for your body type. Know what colors look good with your complexion and hair. This is important for looking your best in photos. As a general rule, solids look better than patterns.When wearing patterns, make sure to choose them carefully. Patterns can make you look bad, depending on your body shape. Smaller patterns can look busy and messy in a photo. Instead of wearing patterns from head to foot, pick one patterned element in your wardrobe.If you want to look thinner, wear darker clothes. If you're thin, try wearing a light dress or light-colored sports coat.Most importantly, wear clothes that you are confident in.

, A fake smile can make you look bad in a photo. It looks forced and doesn't meet your eyes. When you take a photo, you need to give your best, most natural smile so you look your best.


To give your best smile, you need to feel some kind of emotion. If you aren't happy in the moment, think of a happy memory, your favorite meal, or something that makes you laugh.A real smile engages the eyes. Try squinting with your lower lids. This can help you look more natural.Put the tip of your tongue on the back of your top teeth. This can help you smile naturally and avoid a too-wide grin.Get someone standing out of the picture frame to make you laugh.
Practice in a mirror. Learn to feel the difference between your natural smile and your fake smile.

, For women, makeup can help make you look great (or terrible) in photos. Learning how to highlight the right areas can help make you look good in just about any photo.


Use concealer instead of thick foundation. Use concealer for those trouble spots on your face, like red areas around the nose or dark circles under your eyes. Place concealer on the shadows on your face, which can be found by tilting your chin down while looking in the mirror. Then place translucent powder on your T-zone - the forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin. These areas can look greasy.Line the eyes with eyeliner to help them not disappear in a photo.Pair that with mascara to help your eyes pop.Place some blush on your cheeks to make them look less flat. Try a medium pink, coral, or peach shade on your cheeks.If you don't have blush, pinch your cheeks right before you take a photo to give them color.

, Before posing for a picture, flip your head over. This gives some volume if your hair has gone flat. You can also try running your hands through your hair to fix your part or fluff it up.


Go easy on the styling products. Hair that looks wet or crunchy from too much product won't photograph well.Control frizz so you don't see flyaways in your photo. Put some pomade or dry oil on your hands to help sleek down your hair.Also think about posing your hair. Don't have it on your shoulders. Instead, have it in front of you, behind you, or over one shoulder. Practice beforehand and decide which placement flatters you most., When you look at the camera, don't look straight at the camera. Look slightly above or slightly below. Then, tilt your head up or down slightly.To get a stronger jawline and reduce the likelihood of a double chin, elongate your neck and tilt your chin down. It might feel funny, but it'll help you look great., Lighting is important when taking good pictures. If there's no flash, find a light source that shines on your face, not on the side of your face.


Lamps, streetlights, windows, and doorways can give good light sources when there's no flash.They also can produce nice soft light for more flattering photos.
Move around rooms to find the lighting. Try putting the lighting behind you, above you, and in front of you to find the best placement.
One hour after sunset and one hour before sunset provides nice lighting for photos.Avoid lighting which places harsh shadows on your face. This can accentuate imperfections and give you unflattering dark areas. Bright lighting can also emphasize wrinkles and other trouble spots. The sun or bright, harsh overhead lights can cause this unflattering light.Look for lighting that creates an even glow from the forehead to the cheeks to the chin.Try taking photos on a cloudy day or using a lamp or softer light.

, Turn your body 45 degrees away from the camera instead of taking a photo full on.This pose gives a slimming effect and creates angles that look better in a photo.


Pose like you're on the red carpet. Put your hand on your hip, angle your body away from the camera, and turn your face towards it.Turn your torso so one shoulder is closer to the camera than the other. This helps make you look slender.Whatever you put towards the camera looks the biggest. If you don't want to emphasize parts of your body, make sure they are not the closest to the camera.
Pull your shoulders back and straighten your back. Good posture can make a world of difference when you are taking a photo., Instead of having straight, limp arms and stiff legs, try bending them to give them life. Bend your arms and hold them slightly away from your body. This also helps create shape to your midsection instead of bulk.Keep your hands relaxed and slightly bent.


Bend your front leg and place your weight in the back leg.Or try crossing your legs at the ankles.
Pull your arm away from your body and bend it slightly to make it appear slimmer., One of the best ways to get the best picture is to take more than one! Even models go through numerous frames to get that one perfect picture. The more pictures you take, the better likelihood you will get a great photo., Make sure you feel proud of who you are. You are unique and have great features. Focus on that instead of any faults you think you have. Being happy and giving a genuine smile in the photo can make a world of difference.


Don't try to bend your body into uncomfortable or awkward poses. Pose to flatter your body, but make sure to stay natural. Being stiff will just make you look awkward, which will result in a bad photo.

Pick a clear night.,
Choose a location away from direct light sources.,

Take multiple shots.",How to Photograph the Moon," A camera phone will not take good pictures of the moon--they will turn out blurry and distant. It’s best to use the highest-quality camera you can obtain. Lens quality is more important than camera quality, so many camera models will be suitable once the right lens is applied., A high mm measurement on a lens means that the lens can zoom in at a greater distance. Get the highest mm lens you can. More than 300mm is the best, but you can also take good moon photos with a 200mm lens., Stability is very important when photographing the moon. Even the slightest jiggle can result in a blurry photo, so you will need a tripod. Pick a tripod with adjustable legs in case of uneven terrain., Touching the camera to take a picture can wobble it and blur your picture. A shutter release cable allows you to take the shot without touching the camera again once it's set up. If you don't have a cable, use the shutter delay set to 3-10 seconds., The moon can be photographed in any phase except the new moon, which is not visible to Earth. The first quarter, half, and third quarter phases provide high contrast that allows you to see the craters in greater detail, while the full moon is a dramatic choice for a skyscape. What phase you choose is up to your personal preference, but it’s best to have a phase chosen before going out to photograph the moon.

, When the moon sets or rises, it is closer to the horizon, making it appear larger and closer. This makes it much easier to photograph! Check an almanac or a weather app for moon rising and setting times in your area., Clouds, fog, and air pollution will blur your photographs. Check a weather app before leaving for your session and while photographing. A clear night with low smog content and no rain is best for moon photography., The moon appears bright because it reflects the light of the sun, and additional light from streetlights, homes, and cars can make the moon appear duller and blurrier in pictures. It is fine if there is light in the distance, but be sure that you are not photographing close to another light source., Set up your tripod on stable, level ground, and adjust the legs to keep your camera level with the horizon. Make sure your tripod is stable before mounting the camera and lenses. Remove the lens cap and turn your camera on. If you are using a shutter release cable, attach it now., Turn off your camera’s auto-focus feature first--auto-focus is not ideal for night photography and may not produce the best focus. Look through the camera view and manually adjust the focus until you can see crisp details of the moon’s surface. Each camera model has a different method for adjusting the focus, so be sure to consult your camera’s manual beforehand., Shutter speed is also referred to as “exposure time.” A shorter shutter speed exposes the camera to less light, which means that the details of the moon will be sharper and there will not be a halo of light surrounding it. Use the shortest shutter speed your camera has., When you take a photograph, the pressure of your hand on the camera can destabilize it, making your shots blurry. A shutter release cable allows you to stand away from the camera while taking the photo. If you don’t have a cable, use the camera’s shutter timer., Once you have your camera set up and focused, take a series of shots of the moon. This will let you have a selection of photos to choose from. Try a few different shutter speeds and focuses to make sure you have the best possible shots!

Know what types of birds you want to photograph.,
Know your feathered subjects well.,
Purchase a reputable bird guide if you're a beginner birdwatcher or you're new to the area.",How to Photograph Wild Birds1," Do you want to photograph birds of prey, water birds, nesting birds or flying birds? Both the type and positioning of the bird can have a major impact on your photography success. Some birds are much easier to find and shoot than others. For instance, a wren or robin will be much easier to photograph than any type of raptor.


Bird environments vary widely. Some of your decision will be determined by where you live or your ability to get somewhere by traveling in the time you have available. Seabirds, for example, require you to be near the ocean, while forest birds will require you to be near the forest.
What is your own level of willingness to go where the birds are? If you're keen on the outdoors and love a good hike, you'll be more likely to head back country, climb, swim or whatever to get those rarer bird shots. On the other hand, if you're more of a park stroller, you may need to settle for the local, more common types of bird. Both are equally fine choices––it is simply that you need to match your expectations to your preparedness to expend effort.
Consider starting with a bird sanctuary. If there is a bird sanctuary or bird nature reserve near you, you're fairly much guaranteed to find birds as that's the focus of the place. As well as good amenities such as boardwalks, hides and seating, you'll also get lots of information on the birds and their habits too. Such a place is great for a beginner to practice bird photography.;
, This means doing a lot of research unless you're already knowledgeable about the bird's habits and quirks. Consider doing some birdwatching first––if you don't already have experience with that species, make a concerted effort to locate and watch them. Learn their habits and what they do before attempting to photograph them. It will put you at a distinct advantage to be personally aware of expected bird behaviors.


Information that will make your photography more interesting and better directed includes: feeding habits, breeding, nesting, and migratory behaviors.
Also consider season. Some birds look during some seasons than others, due to molting, over-wintering, etc. This knowledge will only be gleaned by doing your research first.
Birdwatching beforehand also teaches you more than any guide can about the approachability of different species of birds. This will vary on the type of bird, the experience the birds have had with human interaction and where you are in the world. There is no one hard and fast rule for approaching birds, other than that being noisy and running at the birds will cause most birds to fly away (even pigeons), at least temporarily.

, Most, if not all, states, provinces and countries have bird guides of the birds that are native to the area. This is a good way to become familiar with a variety of bird species that may be in the area too.

Pick what you're photographing.,
Change your camera settings.,
Lock your camera's exposure.,
Adjust the focus.,
Choose a lens.,
Set up your tripod.,
Identify a start and end point.,
Take your photos.,
Stitch the pictures together.,
Print your panorama.",How to Photograph Panoramas," Choose your scene and decide what type of panorama you are going to be photographing. Distant scenes such as mountains, calm lakes, and sunsets stitch together the best because they don't cause parallax. Panoramas can be made of as few as two photos or up to 50 and more.


A horizontal sequence shot creates a wide image across a scene. For example, if you wanted to photograph a wide plain, you would use a horizontal sequence shot.
Use a vertical sequence shot to create a tall image of a scene. For example, if you wanted to photograph a waterfall, you would use a vertical sequence shot.
A 360 degree panoramic shot allows you take in the whole scene in one shot. If you wanted to capture the entire scene all the way around you, you would use a 360 degree shot.;
, If your camera has a panorama function, use it. The panorama functions on a digital camera or cell phone will allow you to take panoramic images easily by helping you to line up one image after the other so that they fit together seamlessly. If you are using a DSLR camera, adjust it to be in manual mode. Keeping a camera in automatic mode will guarantee that all of your photos have different exposure levels and focuses.

, Take a few test photos to find the perfect exposure, so that your panorama isn't too light or too dark. Find a happy medium for the exposure so that all your photos will be the right brightness..

, Set your lens to Manual focus. This stops the camera from automatically refocusing on a different point whenever you take a new picture.

, Although it might sound reasonable to use a wide angle lens to create a panoramic view, using one can actually increase the amount of flaring that is created when the photos are stitched together. Use a lens smaller than 50mm and larger than 25mm for the best panoramic shot. .


If possible, use a prime lens that has a single focal length and does not zoom.
Remove any filters, polarizing or otherwise, from your lens before you begin shooting. Otherwise, there will be a lot of discoloration between each photo.

, This will help you keep your camera steady and will allow you to control it easier. Place your tripod on a smooth, flat surface that will not be budged by wind. Test your tripod to make sure that you can easily pan across or up and down without struggling with the equipment. You can take a panoramic shot without using a tripod, but you will likely have a hard time keeping the photographs steady and even.

, You will have to hold very steady as you take your photos, so it is good to keep in mind what you want to start on the left side of the stitched photo, and what will end on the right side.

, Start along the leftmost edge of your ideal stitched photo, and begin taking pictures. Look through the viewfinder of your camera rather than the LCD screen to accurately line up the scene. Each photo should overlap the one prior to it by 30-50%Watch out for any movement in the foreground of your photo, as this will create blurry spots in your final picture. This includes wind-blown branches and waves; unless the wind is very strong, avoid shooting anything greatly affected by the wind.
Keep your camera at eye level all the way across your scene, otherwise you will create parallax in the foreground or skyline. Avoid dipping the end of the lens up or down to capture details, as this will put the photos out of line when stitched together.

, Once you have taken the pictures you need, you'll want to stitch them together into a panoramic shot using software. Several panoramic photo-editing software programs are available including Photoshop, Hugin, and PTGui, the latter of the two being downloadable for free.


Upload the photos to your computer and put them in one folder. You will want them to be numbered in order so that you can easily select the correct sequence of photos for your panorama.
In Adobe Photoshop, you can easily create a panoramic shot by selecting all your images and clicking the ""Merge to Panorama"" option. This will create a seamless panoramic shot. The other panoramic photo programs have easy-to-follow directions for stitching your photos together and adjusting them accordingly.

, Panoramic shots make great prints because they capture a massive scene in just a single frame. Print your panorama on a large scale for the best looking shots, showcasing the grandeur of the scene and taking full advantage of the multiple shots.

Be thoughtful when visiting a cemetery.,

Use quality photography equipment.,

Plan for the best lighting.,
Familiarize yourself with different kinds of surfaces.,

Enhance the inscription, if necessary.,

Take plenty of pictures.,

Photograph the tombstone's surroundings as well as the stone itself.",How to Photograph a Tombstone," Before you even set forth on your gravestone photography expedition, spare a thought for cemetery etiquette and do the right thing so that others may enjoy this experience too.

Park your car in an appropriate place. It is better to walk a distance than to park in a poorly chosen space.
Do not wander around with your equipment if there is a committal or graveside service in progress.
If you move any flowers or remembrance items to get your photograph, remember to replace them before leaving.;
, A good digital camera that has auto-focus, flash, adjustable light settings, and zoom. Optical zoom is best because it allows you to get the most details in an image but it will cost more for such a camera and it is a battery depleting element.The Association for Gravestone Studies recommends a 35mm SLR fitted with a 50-55mm lens or a wide angle 35mm lens for crowded graveyard sites.Have enough memory or take along extra cards if you think you might run out.

Prefer a camera with an LCD monitor. This will allow you to check before going home that you have got all of the information you want captured taken clearly. If you can't read the inscription or it's out of focus, you'll know straight away.

, This is the most important step as the fine details of the headstone are what you're keen to capture.


Front light. The morning light may be recommended if the headstone is facing east. This is often the case, but not always. West facing gravestones (such as in New England) are best photographed at the middle of the day and north facing stones are best photographed in later afternoon light.It is more difficult to get a good shot if the stone is backlit.

Angle of sunlight. Direct lighting may not produce a good result as it can wash out the inscription. Noonday lighting can supply contrast of bright light on the stone surface and darker shadows inside the engraving. An angle of the sun of 30 degree at midday is considered to be the best for lighting.Use shadows to your advantage on worn stones that are difficult to read.

Reflecting light. Some photographers have portable reflectors or mirrors for this purpose. You can redirect sunlight by the simple placement of a piece of white board. You can buy an inexpensive folding ""science fair display"" of corrugated cardboard. Lean it against your tripod or a nearby stone so that it directs the light where you want it. Aluminum foil may also work, but may result in unwanted distortions and glares. You can also use two mirrors to create light over a shadowed headstone.Of course, keep your reflector out of the camera field.






Off-camera Flash. For best results on difficult stones, or if you don't want to wait around for the perfect sun angle, use off-camera flash. Typical flash units are bright enough to overpower the sun and give sharp contrast even on worn tombstones. You need a camera, probably with a flash shoe, a flash unit (often called Speedlight or Speedlite), and a wired or wireless triggering mechanism. The Cowboy Studio NPT-04 is an inexpensive radio wireless trigger. You will also need a flash stand or an assistant. Position your flash unit so that the light falls across the face of the tombstone from the side, or slightly above. Set your camera on Manual exposure at a fixed, low ISO value. ISO 100 and f/20 at 1/200 is a good starting point for your exposure. You may have to try some test shots to find what works best with your equipment.

, Be aware that different surfaces photograph differently, some better than others. Shiny metallic surfaces will reflect a lot of light and will require more care to avoid getting nothing more than a blur of sunshine, while dull stone surfaces will often need dampening to help bring out the inscription clearly. Check your photos after taking them to see what adjustments need to be made for the headstone surface., Don't use anything other than pure clean water. Many gravestone surfaces are porous and fragile, such as granite, marble, sandstone, slate, etc.; part of their charm is also part of their fragility, so be extremely careful when attempting to clean or brighten them up. It's fine to spritz a little water onto the inscription to bring out the inscription more clearly or to clean it. Wipe off the surface of the stone with cotton cloth, natural sponge, or a kitchen towel and leave the engraving damp. Allow the surface to dry a bit, and the damp engraving will appear slightly darker. If you have a very soft brush, you might consider using it on non-flaking gravestone surfaces to remove dust build-up or soil.


Do not use shaving cream. It will leave a residue of stearic acid that may stain or actually damage the stone (especially if it's granite or marble). This is considered vandalism.

Do not use chalk or charcoal directly on the stone. A memorial marker is not an appropriate place for graffiti; moreover, the pigments used in chalk can stain permanently (as can plaster of Paris). Do not use anything gritty or harsh that could remove any part of the headstone.

Be very careful if grave rubbing. First, be aware this can damage old headstones and that it is illegal in some States in the USA and possibly in other places. If it is permissible, do so with great care and avoid doing it on any headstones that appear fragile, very old, and in disrepair. To do a gravestone rubbing, place a very large sheet of clean paper over the face of the stone. Then, using the side of the chalk, very gently create a rubbing that leaves an image of the marker on the paper. Always supervise children who do this and ensure that they are very careful with pressing and standing around the grave site.

, Digital cameras free you up to take lots of photographs, some of which won't work out as well as others and some of which simply serve as a record rather than a photo of any beauty. Make use of this ability to take various shots of the headstone from differing angles and distances. Take photographs of the section of the cemetery so that you can document the location of the grave. Take a photograph of the entire cemetery from a distance and of the cemetery sign or entrance to document the name and location of the cemetery.

You may need to take several shots of some headstones to get all of an inscription. In this case, the panoramic feature of a camera capable of such an operation or phone such as an iPhone can come in handy. If you have an iPhone, carry it with you.

, Statues can tell a lot about who a person was and how they are remembered. Flowers, plants, and other parts of a stone's environment can also enhance the picture."

Get out there early.,
Set up your camera.,
Get in the right place.,
Wait for the sun to be in the perfect spot, and then snap a picture (multiple ones if you have the film or memory card space).,
Wait around.,Develop the film or print out your picture and then enjoy your work of art!",How to Photograph a Sunset," You never know when the best and most beautiful light is going to happen, but it usually happens in a one-minute window, which can be any time within 15 minutes before and after sunset (this, plus the half-hour window at sunrise, is what the folks in Hollywood call ""magic hour""). Consequently, you want to be on location at least half an hour before the sun sets, to give you time to look around and set up.

, Alternatively, don't, and skip the technical trivia below if it bores you; some proficiency with these things is useful, but not essential. More important is being out there at the right time. With that said...


Play with exposure compensation (the feature of your camera that makes pictures lighter or darker). You want to make sure that you don't end up with large parts of your sky blown out to pure white. Remember, on digital cameras, you can always recover from all but the most terminal underexposure.
Set your ISO to its lowest setting on digital cameras. The sky at sunset is still bright enough that you can get away with doing this. It'll also give you much more latitude for correcting underexposure, as per the above (since doing this in post-processing inevitably brings out any noise present). Don't increase it unless you have to.

Set your white balance; again, this only applies to digital cameras. Many cameras do a reasonable job of this in ""Auto"". Others don't; they may see too much red in your scene and try to balance it out (which is not what you want -- the whole point of being out there is to capture these great colours). ""Daylight"" or ""shade"" settings are a good bet, but you'll doubtless want to experiment with this. Every camera is different, and some are much smarter than others. Which brings us around to the last point.
Get to know your camera. Few cameras will get a perfect exposure all the time, and many will require tweaking every time. Some cameras are smarter about photographing sunsets than others. Many will require some degree of exposure compensation. If you're using center-weighted or spot metering, you may find it useful to meter on one of the brighter (but not the brightest) parts of the sky, use your auto-exposure lock, and then recompose.

, Move around as much as you can and find the perfect angle. There are an infinite number of angles, locations, and compositions you can play with; some ideas, if you're out of them, follow below.

Use reflections off bodies of water, if you're near one. Get down as low to the water as you dare, or do the opposite and go to the highest angle you can get at, to get an entirely different reflection in the water. Try making your picture near-symmetrical, or don't, or try taking a photograph of the sunset through its reflection alone.Experiment!






Look for interesting silhouettes. Try silhouetting trees, people, or anything else against the sky or the sun.






Play with panoramas, if you don't feel that you're getting enough sky into your picture (this is especially so for those of you with small-sensored digital SLRs). Take several photos with the intent to stitch them together later in software.






Try using your flash to illuminate things in unexpected ways. Make sure that your shutter speed doesn't go any faster than your camera's rated flash sync speed; it'll either refuse to fire or (in the case of off-camera flashes) cause a large part of your image to be blacked out (of course, if you're clever about it you can use this to creative effect).





Experiment with everything. Doing so is free on digital cameras. The more photos you take, the better equipped you will be in future to recognise peak lighting conditions, to figure out what looks good and what doesn't, and so on. If you're on film, shoot as much as you can afford to get developed.

, Exactly what is the perfect moment is a matter for your artistic judgment. If you're out of ideas, try waiting around for the sun to hide behind a cloud; more often than not you will get very visible sun rays coming from the cloud., Sometimes the most spectacular lighting happens a short while after the sun has gone down. Don't miss it! You don't want to find yourself on the way home (and, worse, stuck in your car) when the sky turns spectacular colours.

Determine where the birds that interest you will most likely be located.,
Use your sketch to plot the types of birds you expect to see.",How to Photograph Wild Birds2," Once you know the type of area, get a map and make a sketch. This will help you to know more precisely where the birds will be.


What is the area like? Is it flat, hilly or rough terrain? Can you access it with ease or do you need to hike in and out?
Do birds use a cliff or other spot to take off over the ocean or land? Are there paths leading to this are that you can use?
Can you ask the locals for information? If there is a bird colony in the area or it's a feeding/nesting/take-off area, the locals will know a lot more than any static guidebook. Ask at the local store, recreation center or information center to begin with, and call any local birdwatching clubs too.

, Note both where and when you're likely to see particular birds (if you're looking for various birds, this may vary considerably).


Are there any hides? These are camouflaged hideaway shelters that permit birdwatching without disturbing the birds. They can be very useful for taking candid shots of birds that are happily unaware of your presence.
Plotting the places on a sketch map will come in handy for future photographic expeditions too. You can make notations on the map while on your first expedition to update or confirm data already input.
Slip the sketch map into a plastic cover to protect it from the elements and mud.

Know what to watch for.,
Expect the unexpected.,
Look for nesting birds.",How to Photograph Wild Birds3," Some things that are helpful to know are:


Most birds take off and land into the wind. Anticipating that, be aware of the direction of the wind.
Watch for the birds to 'tense' their feathers. When they are relaxed, they are relaxed and won't be taking off. Most of them will tense before taking off.

, Birds move swiftly and without warning. Be ready for fast movement and antics.


When getting ready to shoot your subject, anticipate the bird's actions and be ready to pan.

, Captive to caring for their nest, you can get some fantastic shots if you know of a nest of birds somewhere. Be careful not to disturb the nest in any way.

Be comfortable and keep warm.,
Be sure you have your camera set ahead of time.",How to Photograph Wild Birds4," Outdoor photography requires that you keep aware of your own comfort levels foremost. If you are likely to be taking photographs in the rain, under the searing sun, in bodies of water, etc., you need to be wearing the right gear.


For pond, stream, swamp, etc., photography, get some decent boots, waders, gaiters, etc.
For searing heat environments, wear a good hat with a wide brim, neck cover and an elastic band to keep it in place. If the brim can be turned to one side or folded back, this might be useful to prevent shading your photos on occasion.
For cold weather shooting, rug up appropriately and get gloves that are warm but still allow you to move the camera apparatus.
Pack adequate food, drink and snacks. Take along anything that can make the experience more comfortable, such as a blanket, mat or umbrella.

, You should have a solid idea of the aperture and speed that you will need. You don't necessarily need the best camera gear out there but you do need to know how to use what you have well, and be patient to get those good shots.


Digital or film? Digital cameras tend to be faster and cheaper, so for most amateurs, they are the ideal choice. And it needs to be a DSLR––bird photography requires a good quality camera with a fast shutter speed.What sort of lenses do you have? Ken Rockwell recommends cheap, ordinary lenses for pet birds, and then a skip up to practical long lenses in the US$1000-1600 range for wild bird photography for amateurs.For the more serious, you can dabble in very expensive lenses but wait until you know that this is going to really be your hobby before investing at the high end.
Do you want to stop the motion of the bird in flight, or allow some blurring to convey action? If so, know how to do this in advance; many good cameras have a continuous movement tracking mode. Read up on how to set your camera to use all of its focus sensors. Birds won't stop flying for your fiddling! (Note that many cameras are good at tracking birds against a bland sky, not so good when a complex background comes into play; see How to photograph sports or How to photograph motor racing for tips on dealing with movement.)
Do you want to convey the colors of brilliantly colored birds? Will you require filters or other gear to improve the colors?

"
"
Check your exposure constantly.,
Be aware of the lighting.,
Put some thought into what you are doing.,
Consider including action in your shots.,
If at all possible, shoot from the bird's eye height.,
Aim to take shots that are good enough to identify the bird.",How to Photograph Wild Birds5," Things can change quickly. If shooting up into the sky a lot, you will be in danger of the colors in the sky being blown out as the day moves on and weather or lighting changes occur.


Know how to use the manual exposure on your camera; this may be useful if the camera's automatic mode loses the bird against an endless sky.

, Early morning and late evening light is good for bird photography; aim to reduce the glare of taking images of birds into the noonday sun. Lighting can add elements to the photos that make the birds more interesting; even a sparrow can look amazing in the right light.


Have you thought about background lighting? This can add mystery, elegance or sparkling features to the photos.

, Don't just 'spray and pray'. You might get a shot, but most of the time, its quality won't be what you want. Patience is what pays off with bird photography, and the more patient you are, the more likely it is that you'll capture some amazing bird moments.


Aim to get a good shot of the bird's eye. If this can be achieved, blurring effects around it can often be forgiven.Sit still and simply be. Some birds are content to go about their business when the beings around them are thudding through the forest or talking loudly.

, Unless the background is amazing, a sitting or standing bird often won't be as interesting as a bird doing something. Action includes preening, fishing, flight, fighting, feeding and waddling. That said, if the background is of interest or the lighting is amazing, or if the bird's own colors or markings are the feature of the shot, a still bird can make a great shot.


Think of a duck floating mid-lake on a dull day with nothing to break up the endlessness of the lake, as opposed to two ducks fighting mid-lake––which one is likely to hold more interest? However, that floating duck might be amazing if it's floating in front of old ruins on the shore and a snow-peaked mountain in the distance.

, For most birds, it's really important to get as close as you can––markings, facial features, beak outlines and eyes are all of interest to the bird lover who will be looking closely to see the bird's individuality; this needs to be captured as best you can.


For ground birds, get on your stomach. Bring along a cloth or map to protect clothing if the dirt or bird poop bothers you.
For flying or high roosting/landing birds, get as high as you can and/or catch them at takeoff or landing.
For water birds, put on your waders and get into the water, among those reeds if it's safe to do so.

, This is especially important if you want to sell the photographs or make a book of birds. But most of all, it's about having a sense of achievement that you're captured the birds in the best way possible.

Change your approach from treating light as illumination to treating it as subject.,
Get a good position!,
Set the camera on the tripod.,
Ensure the camera settings are correct.,
Frame the picture before shooting.,
Keep the shutter open to capture the entire burst.,
Spice it up.",How to Photograph Fireworks," This requires a different way of thinking about how you use the camera because fireworks create their own exposure.In order to preserve color and shape, you will have to be prepared to vary the exposure and to account for other elements such as smoke from fireworks, or building lights in the background. Knowing how to focus the camera properly is also going to be important because passive autofocus systems cannot manage in darkness or low light situations,so be prepared to go beyond the simple point and click.


A fireworks show involves many, many fireworks, so be ready to experiment, preferably with a digital camera so you get instant feedback. Since fireworks produce basically monochromatic light (from chemicals), their colors will be distinct at a variety of apertures and ISO settings. A long exposure is required to let a few fireworks trace out their patterns. Different aperture and ISO settings will affect the brightness of the surroundings – bright surroundings are distracting, but subdued rather than completely black surroundings are much more interesting. Choose the amount of foreground and sides to include with this in mind. (The aperture setting isn't very important for depth of field with far away fireworks, since they'll be essentially at infinity, and any foreground should be dim and indistinct in any event – it mainly matters for overall exposure, and a relatively wide aperture and low ISO will give less ""noise"" than a small aperture and high ISO.)





;
, Try to determine approximately where the fireworks will be bursting and get a spot with an unobstructed view of that area. If the fireworks are popular, you'll need to show up early to get a good spot. Figure out the wind direction and get upwind of the fireworks so that your shots aren't obscured by smoke blowing toward you. Find a spot where you can avoid getting a lot of extraneous ambient light in the picture, as this will cause an overexposure.


When scouting out your location, choose some interesting features to serve as the background. This will make your photos more exciting for others to view.







, Fireworks generally accompany celebrations, so it's not surprising if your memories of them are a little blurry. Your pictures, however, should be crisp and clear. Photographing fireworks requires long exposure times, so a tripod is your most important ally. No matter how steady your hand is, it's not steady enough.


Don't extend the legs or center column of the tripod. Keep everything close to the ground to keep the camera as steady as possible.






A flashlight can be used to fill in shadows.Ensure that wherever the tripod is set up is safely out of the way of other people tripping over it. If you're in a crowd, ask a friend to act as a shield to ensure other people don't walk into your camera shooting while you're looking upward.

, While some digital cameras have a ""fireworks mode"", where you don't have to worry about the settings, knowing how to fix the settings to work to the best advantage for taking great shots of fireworks is essential. It's best to set these well ahead of time, as it may be difficult to see your camera controls or your checklist in the dusk or dark. Double checking before you set off the take the photos is a good way to get used to changing the camera settings and knowing the limitations of your camera. The changes that you need to consider making to the settings include:


Set the focus to infinity. You're generally far enough away from fireworks that you can adjust the lens focus to infinity and leave it there. If you want to get a closeup of a small part of the burst, you may need to adjust the focus as you zoom in. If you want to include buildings or people in the background, you may want to bring these into focus. Avoid the use of auto focus if possible; as already noted, most cameras have difficulty adjusting focus in low light conditions.






Use a smaller aperture. Set the aperture in the f5.6 to f16 range. F8 is usually a good bet, but if you're shooting with ISO 200 film you may want to kick it up to f16.






Turn off the flash. The fireworks are bright enough, and your flash wouldn't effectively reach them anyway; however, it will dull the atmosphere of the shot, thereby lessening its impact.






Take off any filters or lens caps before shooting.






If your lens has IS (Canon) or VR (Nikon), turn it off before shooting. If you are shooting with an SLR or DSLR camera, chances are your lens has the IS (image stabilization) or VR (vibration reduction) feature built in. And if you have IS or VR (it is essentially the same thing, but Canon and Nikon just had to label it differently), then chances are you are used to leaving it on close to 100 percent of the time - which is generally a good idea. IS/VR is meant to sense the vibration (the shaking of your hands, mostly) and compensate for it. When it does not sense any, it... creates it. Turn it off in order to get sharper images. (This tip goes not only for shooting fireworks, but is valid any time you shoot off a tripod.)







, Look through the viewfinder during the first few bursts and figure out where the action is. Point your camera at that spot and leave it there. You don't want to be looking through the viewfinder while you're trying to shoot, because you'll likely shake the camera or your timing will be off. If you're trying to get closeups, of course, your framing will need to be more exact and you'll probably have to play with it more. Once again, frame carefully to exclude other light sources that might distract from the fireworks or cause your photos to be overexposed.

, Despite what it may feel to you, provided the sky is very black, leaving the shutter open won't result in overexposure.Set the exposure to the maximum length. To get the sharpest image it is best that nothing comes in contact with the camera during the exposure. Use the automatic long exposure of 30 seconds or more. If your camera does not have an automatic long exposure the use of a cable release is okay. Use the BULB (B) setting, which will keep the shutter open as long as the button is depressed. A rule of thumb is to open the shutter as soon as you hear or see the rocket shooting into the sky and to leave it open until the burst is dissipating. This will usually take several seconds.


To capture the best effects from bursts, exposure times will usually be about half a second and four seconds but judge it as you see it.For ISO 100, photography expert John Hedgecoe recommends trying 4 seconds at f5.6.When taking a reading for exposure, don't point the camera at the center of the light source; if you do, the shot risks being underexposed and the trails of light will be faint. Instead, experiment with a range of shutter speeds and if it's possible, bracket the exposure.To use auto focus in the dark of night, try to first take a picture of lights on the horizon. Then when you set off the next exposure into the pitch black of night the lens will already be set at infinity. Also, try starting the long exposure when there is a large fireworks burst. The auto focus may work on this pattern and therefore ensure that a subsequent burst during the exposure will be in focus too.







, Even good pictures of fireworks can be boring if there's nothing to distinguish them. You can make more interesting photos by including buildings in the background or spectators in the foreground. Choose your shooting location to try to get an unusual and unique perspective on the show if possible. Ensure that the camera is stable on its tripod and that the focal length and frame is right for the height of the fireworks.


For a wide angled shot of fireworks in a setting such as a well lighted cityscape, judge the height of the first few fireworks bursts and use that as a reference for framing the whole scene. Vary the exposure times set on your tripod-locked camera so that it captures both single and multiple fireworks bursts."

Make it simple.,
Use high-quality content.,
Choose the order of your slides.,
Be consistent.",How to Make a Slide Show4," Avoid overcomplicated slides that could distract the audience away from your intention. If you have a lot to say or show for one slide, stretch out the content over a few slides. If you are only using pictures in your slideshow, use one centered picture for each slide. If you have text and pictures, be sure to have plenty of white or negative space. Negative space allows the content to breath and will draw the audience in easier.


Limit the number of bullet points per slide. Don’t force people to read a lot while listening to you speak. In general, avoid being text heavy in your slides.Limit the number of words for each bullet. If a bullet has two or more lines of words, there are too many words for that bullet.

, When using digital photos it is a good rule to never “break” the image. Breaking an image means stretching it along the vertical or horizontal axis alone, or stretching a small image larger.Poor image resolution can detract from your slideshow by straining your audience.

, Creating a logistical flow is important in slideshows. There should always be some type of narrative even in photo-based slideshows.Think of it like a story or essay where the slideshow has a beginning, middle, and conclusion.


When sorting through your slides you can also decide if you want to break up any slides that are packed with content.

, Let the slides communicate with each other instead of clashing against each other. Use the same typography, colors, and imagery throughout your slides. Using a template can help keep a consistent flow. Templates can also become restrictive, so be sure to add your own message and creativity."

Choose your subject.,
Place the subject in a setting with a lot of angles and depth (not in front of a flat wall), and about 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) from the camera.,
Take two pictures of the subject.,
After this, you can edit the images in 3D.

",How to Take 3D Photos," Some of your options are still life and shots like pictures of flowers. Keep in mind that wind can make taking good 3D shots extremely difficult. Tiny leaves and narrow vertical objects are often difficult and unrewarding 3D subjects. People are also good subjects because they tend to pop out in 3D photos, but only if they can sit or stand perfectly still.


Macro shots are fairly difficult to make 3D. Macro (extremely close) shots of flowers and other objects can be glorious, but they're more difficult to process, because even very small differences between the two shots in distance to the subject will produce significant differences in image size of the subjects, and resizing one image to match another can be challenging.;
, To emphasize the 3D effect, select a scene, where are objects of different distance from the camera.The scene can't change between taking of the two pictures (the left one and the right one). If it changes then the two pictures don't show the same scene and creating of 3D photo is impossible.

, Take one shot, then move the camera over slightly and take another. The general rule of thumb for re-positioning the camera right-to-left (or left-to-right) is 1/30th the distance to your focal point (i.e. for a primary subject 10 feet away, 1/30th of 10 feet is 1/3 of a foot, or 4 inches). Some artists prefer a 1/50 ratio. Of greater importance is to take care to keep the distances from the camera to the focal point and subject of your photos consistent.


When you only need to move the camera slightly, you don’t even need to turn your camera to keep it in the center. Put your feet square on to the subject. Put your weight onto your right foot, without lifting your left. Take the first photo. Put your weight onto your left foot without raising your right, and take the second photo.
Always take photos in portrait orientation.
Using a tripod is extremely helpful, but not really essential. Using both a tripod and slidebar will make processing your images much easier, and your success rate much higher. Even so, it's not always practical to carry a large tripod with you, and small ones are often not suitable for the circumstances of what you're shooting.
If you have a natural horizontal reference in your picture (i.e. a waterline or rooftop), you can use it your advantage, especially for lining up two hand-held shots.
With a digital camera, it's helpful to scroll back and forth to review the two shots immediately. The best indication of a well shot pair is that when scrolled back and forth you'll notice only a slight rotation of the subject.
You can also use two cameras. Try fastening two camera together with some type of separator, like a block of wood or a metal bar.,"

, Once you’ve collected some of your own photos, start reaching out to people you’ve stayed in communication with. (Another great place to start would be the reunion planning committee.)

, If you’ve made it as easy as possible, and you’re still lacking enough images for a decent slide show, you might consider offering a prize or incentive to the person who submits the most photos.

, Striking a balance is key in any photo slide show.

, Figure about 12 slides per minute of music (1 second each for fading in and fading out of each image, and about 3 seconds of viewing time per image), and this should give you an idea of how many songs you’ll need.

, Be sure to test it in a DVD player or on another computer, just to be sure everything is working. You can either use a DVD or hook up a laptop to your rental projector to display your slide show at the appropriate time.

Have what you need.,
Take the picture.,
Process the images.,
When you have the prints, lay a given pair out side by side aligned horizontally (not twisted) on a flat surface such as a table (later you can put them in your album).,
Learn to cross your eyes and refocus.,
Cross your eyes.,
Concentrate on the merged image and some object within it.,
Do not practice for more than the count of 10 or 20.,
Try an alternate method.,
This may take some practice.,
You know those side-by-side drawings or photographs that challenge you to 'find the differences' between them?,
If this fails for you, you can avail yourself of any of several ways of viewing separate 3D images.,
Bear in mind that the basic idea here is that you can take 3D photographs of static scenes with a single camera, no special equipment required, and with moving scenes using a pair of identical cameras mounted on a rig (both to be triggered simultaneously either by using two fingers or a split cable-release).

",How to Make and View 3D Color Photographs Without Glasses," It is assumed that you have one suitable camera, digital or film. If it is a digital camera it is helpful if the delay time ready for the next shot is short, say less than one second. If it is a film camera, better one that does not require awkward manual film advance.;
, Frame your subject (which must be static as wind in nearby bushes will not reproduce well), steady your arm, ask your subject to hold as still as possible. Count down, take the first picture, then shift the camera laterally, horizontally 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), with as close to the same framing as possible, and squeeze off a second photograph. Moving the whole body is probably easier.


This creates the stereo pair in two successive photographs recorded on the film or digital media. Especially with digital cameras, if it is a memorable scene and shot, repeat the process a few times so that the best pair can later be saved.

, We will assume printed copies in this example, but the same can be done by displaying the two images side-by-side on a sharp computer monitor using ordinary photo processing software.

, If you always take the left image first then move the camera right (a good habit to adopt), then put the first of a pair on the RIGHT and the second on the LEFT, that is, reverse them, left image on the table to the right, right image to the left, because you are going to view them by crossing the eyes.

, This is a bit of a challenge, but once learned, it can become automatic, and you can go through your album without glasses and see everything in 3D!

, Let us assume for this that you attach the two photographs to a bit of cardboard and prop it up near the vertical, for 3x5 to 4x6 prints, say at about a forearm's length away. Try to cross your eyes; you may be able to do this 'by force of mental command'. If so, concentrate on the pictures. You will come to see three or four images with the middle one 'hunting back and forth' to find its overlap-place. Concentrate on that image and ignore the others. Alter the crossed-eyes until the middle image freezes into one and holds there.


It may be out of focus because the brain links how much you have crossed your eyes with where they focus (this is actually easier for older people than younger because we cannot refocus with the lens inside the eye).

, For those who can learn this, and it may take some practice, the middle image will slowly come into focus then snap to focus, and the image will be full 3D without the need for glasses. You may find that the images separate again. Just keep practicing, in the order: first merge the images, then try to hold them together, and allow the refocusing to happen.

, If it doesn't work first time, relax, and try again after resting the eyes for a minute or two. Don't come too close to the prints at this stage, it is easier if they are at middle-distance. Later you will be able to come closer.

, If this does not work for you after trying several times, you can use this trick that does work for most everyone. With the photos on the vertical surface and higher in your vision field than midline, hold your arm out with a finger or a pencil or some such held vertically under the photographs at the same distance. Concentrate on the finger rather than the photos, which you leave in the background for now. Slowly bring your finger towards your eyes keeping it in focus, but 'sense' what is happening to the two mounted photographs behind it. They will separate (as above) and gradually merge together as you bring your finger forward. A point will be reached where you have the finger in focus AND the middle photograph (the pair overlapping as above) is now one, the overlap precise, though out of focus. Stop moving your finger and slowly, mentally, redirect your attention to the photographs but don't try to focus on them just yet; leave the finger in focus. Now leaving the pencil and photographs 'aligned' in this way, without breaking this 'lock', try to let the photographs come into focus and let the finger go out of focus. Again, you may need to try this for a 'session' every day for a while. Most serious attempts suddenly succeed because you have learned how to 'decouple' the focus from the crossing. It has a certain 'feel to it' just like many other manual dexterities we learn to master.

, If you tire of it, rest and come back to it as you might when learning any new skill such as touch-typing or shooting baskets. It can be learned and then once learned, be used throughout your life.

, When you can view them in pseudo-3D by crossing your eyes, you can solve these puzzles in a flash, and amaze your friends, because the differences literally 'stand out'!

, One of them is to process the photographs with software that will present them sequentially, rapidly on your screen, and you use shutter glasses. There are hundreds of Web links to those technologies. This is particularly impressive for high-resolution digital photographs on a large, flat screen.

Mount the cameras together physically.,
If you've chosen the setscrew method, secure the cameras on a setscrew (grub screw) as follows:


Use a stainless steel setscrew fitting the cameras' tripod sockets to screw them together.,
If you've chosen the Z-bar method, make the bar and then mount the cameras to it:


Use a ""compact bender"" to very carefully bend a steel flat bar into a ""Z"" form (with a nearly perpendicular vertical) to hold the cameras snugly together (including any accessories and the bar itself between, unless a central opening can accommodate them) and the lenses side-by-side.,
Synchronize the shutters.,
Give each a moment to prepare at its own pace - methodically half-press then press, don't stab, the button.,
Synchronize focus.,
Synchronize exposure.,
Synchronize zoom.,
Synchronize flash.",How to Make a Twin DSLR 3D Camera,"  Choose a method. If you're not satisfied, you can take them apart to go back and try another. In order of initial complexity:


A basic commercial ""stereo bar"" simply holds two cameras side by side. But fancier cameras' widths, plus side connectors that may be needed to synchronize operation, typically put their lenses too far apart. This excessive ""stereo base"" causes unnatural, distracting depth effects at usual foreground distances. And the cameras generally have to be removed or loosened to access bottom battery doors (then replaced and realigned).
Screwing them into each other's tripod sockets with a setscrew is even cheaper, and easy too. A practical  prerequisite is that battery doors or any other essential access points begin further out than the other side of the camera ends, so that they can be opened with the cameras mounted base-to-base. The setscrew method typically allows a somewhat shorter, typically near-natural, stereo base best for closer work like portraits.
A ""Z-bar"" holds the cameras' shorter sides together for the closest possible, but still usually mildly exaggerated, stereo base in the more-popular ""landscape"" orientation.  It often requires custom-fabricating the metal bracket - a relatively simple metalworking project, but still more demanding than typical do-it-yourself home improvement.;
, 
Shim each cameras' base with tape to take up their spacing along the screw threads and hold their lenses perfectly parallel in the horizontal axis, not toed-in or out. 
Tack the mating surfaces together with a little white glue, twist the cameras into perfect vertical alignment, and allow to dry (sitting on lenses adjusted to identical lengths, or otherwise supported so as to prevent creep). 

, 
Bend in increments, checking for and adjusting positioning in the bender to keep the axis perfectly straight-across as you go. 
Stick each end in a steel pipe to bend out a curve.  Use a pair of oversized adjustable wrenches to undo a twist.

,  Generally, the cameras should share both a ""half-press"" signal to ready themselves and a ""full-press"" signal to then take the pictures at exactly the same time. 

,


Canons can generally do this by plugging one right into the other - with a submini stereo cable for cheaper ones, or a double-ended fancy shutter release cable for fancier ones (which one must improvise, it seems).  The EOS SL1 / 100D has its remote-release port vertically aligned with its lens, so a double-ended male adapter can connect them right through a Z-bar.
Two camera connectors can generally be connected to the same wired remote.
Two cameras can generally share an aftermarket wireless remote transmitter.  This works great with no mount for hyperstereo pictures with a friend.
On some cameras, an infrared remote signal can start video recording precisely simultaneously.
On some cameras, simultaneously triggering stills can restart video recording precisely simultaneously.  (A shutter-button press on one camera may fail to immediately communicate to the other in video mode, in which case an external trigger may need to be connected.)

,  Allowing the cameras to automatically prefocus on subjects they identify on their own usually works pretty well, especially when the subject is very prominent in the frame.  Selecting corresponding focus points helps.


Single-shot autofocus generally readies the cameras more precisely than continuous, enabling better synchronization.  Timing mismatches on moving subjects can be a little distracting in themselves, but even subtle mis-synchronization can cause one camera to fail to catch the other's flash at the higher sync speeds. 
Some cameras' setting to allow prioritizing release over perfect focus in continuous mode may help. With stepping-motor (Canon STM) lenses, one camera can simply command both lenses to precisely the same focusing position - you will need to match focal length. 
A relatively easy way to do this is surgery on a pair of kit lenses to connect all of the camera-conecting leads but the ""DLC"" pin, and a piece of tape on one's contacts to keep them from its camera.  (For anything but a pair of kit lenses, modifying the cameras would probably risk and devalue less gear.)

,  Post-processing can iron out little discrepancies.  So long as shutter speed is sufficient to prevent blur, matching aperture, and thus depth of field, is the more important to match.  Thus, aperture-priority is often the best automation mode.  Or just set matching manual settings for a given scene. 


A simple center-weighted pattern typically works better with a Z-bar than evaluative metering, which may be confused by upside-down lighting patterns on the inverted camera.  If a pair of Canon lenses is being controlled by signals from the same camera, this will include their apertures, and (in the basic implementation) the second camera will not know. 
In that case, shutter-priority on the first camera, manual shutter speed on the second, and manual sensitivities on each can prevent the second from becoming very confused and grossly mismatching exposure in other automation modes. 
Evaluative metering works fine, however, when the inverted camera isn't controlling the exposure.

,  You could connect the lenses with a toothed ""timing"" belt or drive them with a pair of those neat stepper motors, or just remember to set them by hand.  Supplemental focus scales and pointers in tape on the same side of each lens let you do that with a glance.  They can be neatly made with contrasting print on clear backing with a label-maker.

,  Digital cameras' typical ""preflash"" automation can introduce a small delay.  Avoiding the very highest sync speed generally, dialing back to 1/125 or so with automatic rather than manual flash power or continuous autofocus, or more with both, and decreasing shutter speed even further with automated multi-flash, typically slower built-in flash, and/or second-curtain sync will generally enable the two cameras to share a flash.  Special high-speed sync flash modes often enable synchronization at very high shutter speeds, possibly due to the overall beam being much extended (so each camera can capture part of it, although not necessarily the same part).  Experiment to confirm reliable operation.

Final Cut Pro
Adobe’s Premiere
Cyberlink
Corel

, Upload the video you are attempting to three -dimensionalize. All softwares have their own protocols for importing video. This is typically found under file/import off of the menu bar.

, Not every software will allow you to duplicate footage. Make sure you are using a software that can handle two videos on top of each other. Manage your layers and be sure you can go back and forth between videos easily., Select one of your layers and adjust the color so that the color is red. Then select the other layer and color it cyan. When doing this you won’t instantly see the 3D effect., Opacity is also referred to as transparency. You’ll need to adjust the top layer of the video’s opacity. This will create a blend of the colors. Set the top layer to 50%., Now you will need to adjust the position of the top video layer. This will create the classic 3D image that you see without wearing 3D glasses.


You can use your 3D glasses to help guide the positioning.
The top layer does not need to be too heavily adjusted, but far enough so that there is a dizzying effect.
Once the position is correctly aligned, you’ll be able tell using your glasses.

Now, keep the camera level and move it to the side before taking your second photo. One way to do this is to move your camera to the other side or take a step to the side.Don’t move too far. The subject should appear identical in the photos besides the very small shift to the right or left.;
, Any software will do as long as it allows you to edit layers and color channels. Photoshop is a common choice and GIMP is a comparable free option. Click on the photos or open them through the software’s file menu. They should open in separate windows.

, Select one of the images using Ctrl+a for PC or ⌘ Command+a for Mac. The entire image should be selected. Copy it with Ctrl+c or ⌘ Command+c. You can close this window.

, Navigate to the window with the other image and click on it. Now paste your image by pressing Ctrl+v or ⌘ Command+v.

, The image you pasted should already be labeled as a layer. The other one will be labeled as a background. Double-click on the background image. Name it left or right so you remember which image it is, then press “ok” to convert it to a layer.


You can also name the other image by double-clicking it.

, Double-click on the image. Find the boxes labeled R, G, and B under the layer style box. Click the R one only. When the check mark is gone, the image will only have green and blue colors., Double-click on the right image. Find the channel boxes on the layer style box again. This time remove the check marks from the G and B boxes.

, You may need to adjust the positioning of the layers to achieve the desired effect. The move tool is in the upper left corner of Photoshop’s left toolbar or in the toolbox menu in GIMP. Use it to drag the right layer towards the left one., Pick a point you can focus on near the center of the image, such as the edge of the land to the right of the pier in the image above. Move the right image towards the left one until the piece of land in both images overlap. You’ll only see one image at this point.

, Navigate to the crop tool in the menu or in a toolbar. In Photoshop it is on the left toolbar near the top. In GIMP it looks like a knife. Use it to make an outline around the parts of the image you wish to keep. Cut off the streaks of red or blue on the outside where the images don’t overlap., Go to the top toolbar. Navigate through the file menu and click “save as.” Name your image to store it and get your 3D glasses to see how well it turned out!

It helps to create a device that holds them both from the tripod screw spots on the bottom. The cameras need to be setup so they are side by side, facing the same direction.Three inches works best, but the greater the distance the greater the 3D effect.
You’ll also need a decent video editing software. The software will need to be able to manage two separate videos and adjust the colors.

, You can film whatever you want in 3D with both cameras, but understand that 3D video should not be overused. The most typical use of 3D film is for action movies. This is the best application because the action literally comes out of the screen into your world. For a serious drama that is dialogue based, consider 2D unless you're making an experimental video.

, You’ll need a competent video editing software. All softwares have their own protocols for importing video. This is typically found under file/import off of the menu bar.

, Adjust the tint of the left video to be red. Make the right camera's video have a blue overlay. The result should be the same video in two colors around three inches apart.


If you only see one video and one color, you’ll need to adjust the transparency or opacity. Whichever video is the top layer will need to be adjusted about 50% opacity., Once you’ve adjusted the colors and opacity, test the footage with 3D glasses. You should see a the intended 3D effect. If not, you should try experimenting with the settings.


You might need to switch the colors darker or lighter shades. You might even change the distance of the lenses when filming."

Usually these types of cameras use a digital effect. Other options are old school 3D cameras. Even some of the old school designs with two lenses have become very accessible.


3D is a popular effect and the market is producing more and more ways for everyone to create 3D film.

, Depending on what type of camera you choose, you can begin shooting your footage following the right settings. For cameras with a built in digital effect, select this option before filming., Many of these types of devices will give you different options for using in a software afterwards. Some devices will even come with an editing software that can simplify the process.

, Once you film all the footage you want in 3D, it’s time to rip the footage to a computer. You’ll probably need to edit your footage down to create an interesting presentation for everyone to view.

, Before uploading your content to an online server, you should test it by watching it with 3D glasses on. Even if the video looks 3D, it may not turn out the way you want.

Care for the K1000.",How to Load and Use a Pentax K1000 SLR Camera," Although not required for operation, the battery powered light meter built into the K1000 prevents the user from having to carry a separate meter or guess the right f-stop to use.


To load a battery into the K1000, first locate the battery door on the bottom of the camera and insert a coin or flat head screwdriver into the slot. Unscrew the door until it can be removed from the camera body.
Insert a single LR44 or SR44 into the camera with the positive side facing out of the camera.

The door can now be screwed back onto the camera to secure the battery.


To check if the battery is working correctly, look through the viewfinder of the K1000 with a lens on the camera and the cap off of the lens. When moving the camera from an area of darkness to an area of light, the needle on the right of the viewfinder should move from the bottom of the viewfinder to the top.;
,


The K1000 requires 35mm film, which is available in several types. Color, black and white, slide, and infrared film can be used in the K1000. The speed of the film to be used is dependent on the subject and environment the subject is in. A higher film speed, such as ASA 800, can be used in lower light and produces less blur when the subject or camera is in motion. A lower film speed, such as ASA 100, is better for shooting in brighter light, but can produce more blur. A lower speed film will typically have a better quality than higher speed films, which may have a larger grain.

,


The K1000 uses lenses with the Pentax K bayonet mount. Adapters can also be found to use other style lenses with the K1000. The K1000 is commonly found with a 50mm prime lens, but many others can be found that were made with the K bayonet mount system. Zoom lenses can be used in a large variety of situations but owning several different prime lenses is popular among many photographers as well.


To mount a lens on the K1000, first line the red dot on the side of the lens up with the red dot on the camera body and insert the lens into the body of the K1000.
Twist the lens clockwise until the lens is unable to move any more.
To remove the lens, press the release button on the front of the camera inward and rotate the lens counter-clockwise until it can be removed from the camera.

,


To open the back of the K1000 and load a roll of film, pull up on the film rewind lever until the back of the camera pops open.
Place the film cartridge nub side down into the chamber on the left of the camera, with the film leader facing towards the right of the camera.
To lock the cartridge in place, press the rewind lever back down into the camera body.
Pull the film leader out of the cartridge and across the camera, keeping it straight, until it can be secured in the slot in the film take-up of the K1000.
After feeding the leader into the slot enough to keep it secured, actuate the quick advance lever on the camera, making sure the perforations on the film catch on the sprockets to the left of the take-up.
If the film moved advanced smoothly and did not release itself from the slot on the take-up, then press the shutter and advance the film again.
If the film advanced smoothly the second time then close the camera back and alternate activating the shutter and advancing the film until the shot dial on the top of the camera is set to zero.

,


To set the film speed on the camera, lift the outer ring on the shutter speed dial and rotate the dial until the number matches the speed of your film.

,


The integrated light-meter in the K1000's viewfinder shows when the camera is set up to give optimal brightness in a photo when the camera is pointed at the subject. The needle in the viewfinder indicates optimal brightness when the needle is pointing horizontally across the viewfinder to the left. When the needle is pointing higher the photo is too bright, and when the needle is pointing lower the photo is too dark.


To adjust the brightness, first rotate the aperture ring to see if the brightness improves.


A lower aperture size, or f-stop, allows more light through the lens, brightening the picture. A higher f-stop allows less light through the lens, darkening the picture.


If the needle does not move, then rotate the shutter speed dial and try to adjust the f-stop again.

A higher shutter speed allows less light through to the film, and a lower shutter speed allows more light through to the film. Any shutter speed less than 125 can be used with a flash and would mean a longer exposure time and more chance of blur if a flash is not used.


Adjust the shutter speed and f-stop until the needle is pointing horizontally across the viewfinder to the left.

,


To take a good-looking photo, you may need to make the subject bigger or smaller in your viewfinder. To do this, you either rotate the zoom ring on your zoom lens, switch between different sized prime lenses, or physically move the camera towards or away from the subject.

,


To focus on the subject, simply rotate the focus ring on the camera until the subject is no longer blurry.
Experiment a little with rotating the ring back and forth past the point where your subject looks clear so you can best judge when the subject is clearest.

,


When you are satisfied with the camera settings, take the picture.
Press the shutter button slowly and evenly to best prevent shaking of the K1000. The shutter button on the K1000 allows for a remote release to be screwed into it to completely eliminate shake when using a tripod.
To advance the film to the next shot, simply actuate the quick advance lever, making sure the shot counter move up to the next shot.

The K1000 does not know automatically when a roll of film is finished, so it is important to remember how many shots your roll of film has.


If you feel any resistance when attempting to actuate the quick advance lever, then it is important to not force the lever as it may damage the film. Resistance would generally mean the film has been used up.

,


When the roll of film has been used up, it is time to rewind the film. Press the film release button on the bottom of the K1000 and then unfold the little handle on the film rewind lever.
Start rotating the lever in the direction the arrow on the lever is pointing until you no longer feel any resistance.
The back of the camera can now be opened by lifting the rewind lever.
At this point, the film can be lifted out of the camera and placed back in its protective canister.
The film can now be taken to a photo developer or even developed yourself.

,




A flash can be used with the K1000 by setting the shutter speed dial to below 125 and connecting a flash either using the hot shoe or using the plug on the front of the camera body. Most flashes use the hot shoe. To connect the flash simply insert batteries into your flash, slide the flash onto the hot shoe, and tighten the knob on the bottom of the flash.


To use the flash, you have to set the aperture to the f-stop given by the flash and either determine the correct distance for manual usage or use the automatic function of the flash.

,


The K1000 is durable but it should be cleaned regularly. Clean the lens with a soft lint-less cloth spritzed with a small amount of lens cleaner, using circular motions to rub the lens clean.
The inside of the camera can be brushed clean with a small camera brush and the mirror can be blown clean with a small puff of air from a camera cleaning kit.

Processing and drying.",How to Print Photographs in the Sun Using the Classic Cyanotype Process,"


This recipe makes approximately 50 8x10 inch prints. The cyanotype is made up of two simple solutions:

Solution A: 25 grams (0.88 oz) Ferric ammonium citrate (green) and 100 ml. water.
Solution B: 10 grams (0.35 oz) Potassium ferricyanide and 100 ml. water.

;
,

The cyanotype is made up of two simple solutions.






Potassium ferricyanide and
Ferric ammonium citrate (green) are mixed with water separately.


The two solutions are then blended together in equal parts.








Dissolve the chemicals in water to make two separate solutions.






Add Ammonium ferric citrate to water into one container and Potassium ferricyanide to water in another.






Stir with a plastic spoon until the chemicals dissolve.






Mix equal quantities of each solution together in a third container.








Unused solutions can be stored separately in brown bottles away from light, but will not last very long once they have been mixed. Dispose of any unused chemicals in a sensible and environmentally friendly way!







,

Using a brush, simply paint the chemicals onto the material. Paper, card, textiles or any natural material can be used to print on.






Decide how big your print is going to be, and cut your material to size.






Make sure your working area is dimly lit, or lit with a low-level tungsten bulb. Once the material is coated, leave it to dry in the dark.







,

Print a cyanotype by placing your negative (to reproduce a photograph) or object (to make a photogram) in contact with your coated paper or fabric.






Sandwich it with a piece of glass.






Expose the sandwich to UV light. Natural sunlight is the traditional light source, but UV lamps can also be used.






A photogram can also be made by placing items on the surface.
Plants, decorative items or other objects can be used to create silhouettes or interesting shapes.
Exposure times can vary from a few minutes to several hours, depending on how strong your light source is or the season where you are printing.



,

When the print has been exposed, process your print by rinsing it in cold water. The wash also removes any unexposed chemicals.






Wash for at least 5 minutes, until all chemicals are removed and the water runs clear.






Oxidation is also hastened this way - bringing out the blue color.
The final print can now be hung to dry and be admired.

, The red filter is for the large window.

, You can use a sander to get rid of the jagged edges. Use glue or double sided tape to stick the inner and outer boards together. Place the mirror and beamsplitter in the groves on the inner board while the glue is setting.

, The cross hairs on the template should be used to mark the holes for the standoffs (I used a M4 drill with M4 screws).

, Position the mirror and beamsplitter between the top and bottom fiberboard panels so that they are sitting in the slots. If you used a first surface mirror (recommended), make sure the reflective side is facing the beamsplitter (you can test this by placing your finger against the glass; the side that doesn’t give you a double image is the reflective side).

, Tape the top and bottom of the wall panels to the fiberboard panels. Congratulations! You’re done.

, I find it best to turn off the flash and zoom in as close as possible. Then put the camera lens through the hole and shoot.

, Mount and fasten lens as quickly as you can. Dust entry can be minimized with these techniques.

, Never provide a safe haven for dust.

, Keep away from dusty rooms or windy outdoor locations.

, Minimize the time you have to leave your camera without lens.

, Find waterproof gear for your camera, if you want to use it underwater or in some watery locations.  Waterproof casings allow you to take pictures while protecting your camera.

The first thing you should do is to think about where the person and/or behavior you're monitoring is likely to occur. Make sure your camera is in a place where it can point directly to this area with no visual obstructions present.


For example, if you were worried about someone breaking into your home while you were away, you could place cameras near your doors and windows.
If you suspected a partner cheating on you, you might place a camera facing your bed or pointing towards the passenger seat of your partner's vehicle.
If you were worried about how a nanny was treating your baby, you would point the camera facing your child's crib.
If you want to feed the neighborhood cats, you might want to check to see if other animals you would rather not feed are frequenting the food bowl. If you live in an area where passersby may see your camera, you would want to keep it disguised to prevent theft. In this case, you would keep your camera hidden and pointed at the food.;
, If you're also trying to record crisp, clear sound, you will need to position your camera in a place that's conducive to audio recording. Make sure it's as close as possible to where you think the speaker will be. The camera should not be near anything noisy, such as a television or radio, which may drown out the speaker's voice or make it difficult to understand.


For example, if you're installing a camera in a room with a television, place it on the opposite side of the room.
Place a camera near a couch or chair your target is likely to sit in.
When installing your camera in a car, place it away from the car's speakers.

, While many modern hidden cameras are battery operated, some rely on an external power source and may need to be plugged into an available wall socket. If your camera draws power in this way, put it in a place close to an electric socket. The plug and wires will need to be either hidden or disguised as some mundane household appliance., Some hidden cameras have internal storage, while others broadcast video through some type of network connection, and still others feature both as options.


If your camera connects to a network through an Ethernet or USB cable, it must be well-disguised and in an inconspicuous place. Keep such a camera close to the computer or router it connects to.
Most common commercial nanny cam models connect wirelessly. If you purchase this type of camera, make sure it's within range of a secure wireless network.

, Certain layouts will attract attention more than others. Avoid any spots where your target is likely to look directly at often.


Keep your camera either significantly above or below average eye level.
Ask someone to look for a camera you've installed in a particular room. If he or she is unable to find it with the knowledge that it's there, an unsuspecting individual is even less likely to spot it. If he or she quickly finds the camera, choose a different spot and try again.
Some examples of good hiding spots people would not normally think to look include inside an air vent, within a fake smoke alarm, or under furniture.
Some examples of potentially bad hiding spots where the eye is often drawn are any spots near paintings, light switches, and television sets.

, Make sure any outdoor security cameras are both weather resistant and placed in a way that makes such damage unlikely to occur in the first place. Ideally, you should buy a camera specifically designed for outdoor use. If you don't, keep the camera sheltered within a sunroom or screened patio., Many hidden cameras require bright light to work their best. At the same time, they are unable to clearly record images when such light is shone directly into their lenses. Position your camera facing away from major light sources. Make sure that whatever you're trying to film is well-lit at the specific time of day it's most likely to be seen., A hidden camera does you no good if your target knows it's there. There are two major strategies for making sure hidden cameras stay hidden:


Make the camera itself small and difficult to see. In other words, a camera with a tiny visible lens that is put in a discreet location. This is what comes to mind when most people think of hidden cameras. The truth is this type of disguise is much easier to spot since an effective hidden camera must have an unobstructed view of whomever it's watching. If the lens can see a person, the person can see it.
Disguise the camera as an everyday object. Tissue boxes, coffee makers, alarm clocks, digital picture frames, wall hooks, and even plug-in air fresheners are all examples of commercial nanny cams that blend seamlessly into the home environment. A person is much less likely to see a lens that was designed to look like a button compared to a separate camera that has simply been hidden.

, There are hundreds of different commercially available hidden cameras and each comes with its own particular set of installation instructions.


If you've purchased your camera secondhand, try looking up its model number online. The user manuals for many electronic devices are freely available for download.
Don't forget to install any necessary software. Most hidden cameras rely on external software to function. This can be a program that was bundled with your camera or one made by a third party available for download. Some programs are even meant to be installed on you smart phone for you to keep watch while on the go.

, It's very important to check your camera's functioning, especially if it's motion- or sound-activated. It's a good idea to make sure that your camera switches on when given the right stimulus. How you do this will vary greatly depending on your particular camera and any companion software.


Start by waving your hand in front of the camera to see if your camera records at all. Check your computer or the camera's internal storage to see whether or not this motion was recorded.
Try mimicking a real world scenario, such as walking into the room, to see if the camera records your actions with appropriate image quality.
Test it again in a few hours and yet again a few days later to ensure that it continues to work., Even if setup was a breeze, you will likely need to do some maintenance from time to time to make sure your camera is still working.


If your camera runs on battery power, you will need to either swap in fresh batteries or recharge the device. Consult the owner's manual for advice on how often this should be done. If no suggestion is provided, make a note of how quickly it takes the battery to discharge.
Clean out the camera's memory regularly. For cameras with limited internal storage, you should review and purge footage often. If your camera is hooked up to a server with a vast storage capacity, you may never need to do this.
Like all electronics, your camera may break or wear down without you immediately knowing. Periodically double-check your camera to make sure it's still working., In many instances, hidden cameras are illegal. However, the exact laws vary between different countries and even between different states. Check for applicable local laws before you install any hidden cameras.


A general rule of thumb is that it's legal for you to install hidden cameras as long as they are on your property and there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. For instance, it's usually legal to install a camera in your own living room or inside your car. However, cameras in rooms where privacy is expected are typically not allowed even when you own the property, such as in the case of a bathroom or inside a spare room you are renting out.
Laws for audio recording are often different and more stringent than those concerning video. In the United States, 38 states allow for the hidden recording of conversations if at least one party consents, while the remaining 12 forbid recordings unless all parties are aware and consent to it.Hidden cameras at a place of employment are usually considered legal only if the employees are informed that they may be filmed.In the United Kingdom, special allowances are made for placing cameras outside one's property in cases where elder abuse is suspected., While all hidden cameras basically do the same thing (provide covert surveillance), knowing your needs is fundamental for choosing the general type of camera you plan on installing.


Do you need to be able to clearly identify the people being recorded? If your camera is intended to catch an otherwise unknown thief, you will want a camera that captures either video or still pictures with a relatively high resolution.
Are you observing a known person looking for specific actions? Then you should find a camera that records movements well. Buy a camera that takes video with a higher frame rate/frames per second (fps). Avoid cameras that only take a series of still photos. Lower resolutions are fine in this case.
What are the lighting conditions of what you would like to observe? If you plan on recording trespassers at night, you may consider getting an infrared camera., There are hundreds of different hidden cameras on the market. They range from pricy, high-tech models sold by surveillance experts able to record high resolution or infrared video to inexpensive low resolution cameras available in most shops that carry any type of electronics.

, You will need an old webcam, an electronics tool kit, a hot glue gun, and some type of inconspicuous housing. The housing should be something that you can safely take apart and won't look out of place with a wire attached to it. Some possibilities include a power supply, a coffee maker, or an old alarm clock.You will be hooking this up to a computer, so a private desktop or laptop is also necessary. You can even use a tablet if you have one that is compatible with USB.
With cheap nanny cams regularly available, making your own hidden camera is not the most practical method. However, if you happen to have these materials on hand, it has the advantage of being free.

, Very carefully, use your electronics tool kit to remove your webcam's original housing. Remove all components besides the camera's lens, the circuit board, and its USB cable.


Be very careful not to disconnect the lens or the USB cable from the circuit board. Keep all of these components attached., Unless you're using an object that is already hollow, you will need to make room for your camera to fit inside. Take the housing apart using any necessary tools and remove some or all of what's inside., If you're using something like an electric pencil sharpener, objects like this already have two perfect apertures built in. If not, your best option is likely to drill the holes yourself using an appropriate cutting bit. Make sure that the hole for the cable is at a seam where the housing opens.When drilling a new hole, you need to consider a spot where the camera will look inconspicuous. Pick a part of your object that is relatively dark so that the lens will better blend in.

, Using your hot glue gun, attach your camera and circuit board to the inside of the housing. Glue the circuit board to the bottom or side of the housing, placing the glue between it and the circuit board's solder side. Mount the camera so that the lens is up against one hole. Be very careful not to get any glue on the camera lens.

, Place the USB cable on its opening before closing the housing back up. Use more hot glue if you need to. Be very careful to make the item look exactly as it did before and obscure any signs that it has been tampered with. Consider covering the cable with a well-positioned book or piece of paper.

, Connect your new hidden camera to a computer using its USB cable and the computer's USB port. If the cable is too short, attach it to a USB extender. Install the webcam spy software of your choice and check to see if your camera is working.


Test your camera by waving your hand in front of it. Can you see your hand on the computer screen? Did the software record that action? If so, try leaving the room for a while and then coming back in. Did your camera record your entrance? If so, then you have successfully made your own hidden camera.

Photograph!",How to Load a Polaroid 600 Camera," Keep the film in a cool, dark place so that it does not warp and deteriorate. Most pack film will last at least one year after its expiration date if kept cool in the dark – and that shelf life may extend for three years or more if you store your 600 film in the fridge.Take the film out of the fridge and let it warm up for about an hour before you load it into the camera.Do not freeze the film! This may damage the film and will not lengthen its shelf life.

Look for new 600 film under this brand., Remove the film cartridge from the box, and unwrap the sealed foil package. Hold the pack by the sides to avoid putting any pressure onto the film itself. Be careful not to touch the dark slide!Depending on what kind of film you're using and how it's packaged, this may require carefully tearing through several boxes and/or layers of foil.


Putting pressure onto the film could ruin the photos before you even load the camera. Be gentle!
The dark slide is the sheet that protects your film from premature exposure. It is the side of the film cartridge that does not feature metal contacts.

, Pull the switch on the side of the camera, below the red shutter button. This tab should pop open the bottom front flap of the device. Look for a slot where you can insert and remove film.

, If you are using a classic Polaroid, then there may already be a cartridge of film loaded into the camera. If you care about preserving any photographs on the film, then remove the cartridge in a darkroom (or a pitch-black space) and immediately store it in a box or bag where it will not receive any exposure to UV light. If you don't care about the film, then you can simply pop out the old cartridge and throw it away.

, Hold it by the sides. Then, slide the film into the film compartment. The cartridge should slide in easily, and then pop securely into place. The metal contacts should be facing down, the dark slide should be facing up, and tab should be facing out of the camera slot toward you., Once the film is properly inserted, shut the film compartment to complete the loading process. The dark slide should automatically eject from the front of the camera. Once the dark slide has emerged, you are ready to begin shooting!


Do not force it shut! If you need to use force to close the compartment, then the cartridge isn't all the way in yet. Unnecessary force can damage your camera.
Consider saving the dark slide. Use it to cover your pictures for several minutes when they come out of the camera to avoid damaging UV exposure., Press the red shutter button to take a picture with your Polaroid 600 camera. If you are using a OneStep instant camera: when the photos come out, make sure to immediately turn them face-down or place them inside a pitch-black container. If you are using any other Polaroid 600 device, make sure to pop out the film cartridge while you're in a darkroom or a pitch-black space in order to keep the pictures safe from harmful UV exposure.

Start with a hall view, showing the call buttons and the surrounding elevators (if there's more than one).,
Give your viewers an introduction to the elevator and the building it's in.,
Press the call button.,
A suggestion is to start on the bottom floor; if you're not there, proceed to it; if you're already starting there, proceed to the top floor.

,
If you want, you can narrate with a bit of information/trivia about the building or the elevator it contains.,
Keep your camera focused on the floor indicator for the first part of the trip (going up to the top floor from the bottom floor).,
For the next leg of the trip you can focus on the interior of the cab.,
End the video with a view of the hallway and the doors closing.,
For scenic elevators, on the way up, film the window.",How to Film Elevators,";
, Don't give a history or anything, just a simple one-sentence video starter (i.e., ""This is the elevator at "", ""These are the elevators at "", or ""Here we come to the elevator(s) at ."" Of course, this is completely optional, but it helps if you can narrate it.

, When the door opens, walk in, showing a steady camera view. DO NOT shake the camera or use poor film/resolution quality, as this gets very annoying when watching one of these videos.

,, DO NOT create background music for your video as this is also annoying.

, If for some reason there is no floor indicator, then do whatever you want.

, Point out interesting things, etc. about the elevator. Again, this is completely up to you. The reason it is suggested you carry out these steps in this order is mentioned in the ""Tips"" area of this article.

, If the place is too busy and you don't want to be seen, you can end when the doors open, or even sooner.

, On the way down, film the indicator.

Then, your containers for mixing the chemicals need to be airtight.To ensure the containers are airtight, buy three chemical containers or 3 one-gallon glass jugs. Label them “Developer,” “Blix,” and “Stabilizer.” This is so you do not confuse the chemicals and accidentally mix them together.;
, Get a plastic measuring pitcher and fill it with clean tap water at 110 degrees Fahrenheit or 43.5 degrees Celsius. Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the water. Fill the pitcher up to 800ml. Open the contents of the Developer pouch and pour it into pitcher. Mix well. Then add more water to make it a 1000ml solution. Once the contents have dissolved, transfer the them to your chemical container or gallon jug with a regular kitchen funnel.The water that you add in after the mixing the Developer needs to be 110 degrees Fahrenheit or 43.5 degrees Celsius as well.
Be especially cautious with the Developer; it must not get contaminated with the Blix because it has bleach in it.
It is best practice to wear gloves and safety goggles when handling chemicals.

, Like the Developer, fill your plastic mixing pitcher with clean tap water, at 110 degrees Fahrenheit or 43.5 degrees Celsius, up to the 800ml mark. Open the Blix pouch and pour the contents into the pitcher. Mix well. Add more water to make it a 1000ml solution.When you are sure it is mixed well (all the powder has dissolved), transfer the Blix into the chemical container or jug labeled “Blix.”
Because the Blix has a strong chemical smell that can make you lightheaded when inhaled directly, make sure your space has proper ventilation.

, Unlike the Developer and the Blix, the water for the stabilizer only needs to be room temperature (70 degrees Fahrenheit). Fill your plastic measuring pitcher with room temperature water up to the 900ml mark. Mix in the Stabilizer contents thoroughly. Once your contents are mixed well, add more water to make it a 1000ml solution.Again, pour the mixed contents into your chemical container or jug labeled developer using a regular kitchen funnel.

, With this tank, you will not need a darkroom to develop your film. A tank has three parts—a cup, a top, and a reel.


The tank comes in two sizes. The smaller size holds only one roll of 35mm film, while the larger tank holds two 35mm rolls or one 120 or 220 roll.

, You can buy a changing bag at a camera store. This is a heavy bag with two sleeves to slip your hands in and a zipper. The bag is sealed against light so you can load your film in darkness. Unzip the changing bag and place your canister of film, bottle opener, scissors, and development tank into the bag, and zip it back up. Then place your hands in the sleeves. This enables you to access the materials inside the bag without letting any light in.If you do not have a changing bag, use a room with minimal to no windows. To ensure that the room is lightproof, sit in the room for 10-15 minutes and let your eyes adjust to see if any light is seeping through. If light is seeping through, block off any light by securing dark sheets over the parts where light is coming through. Also try going underneath a bed sheet or into a closet or cupboard. Also, before you turn out the lights, have your bottle opener and scissors set up so you can access them easily in the room.

, Once you're in the dark room or have your hands in the changing bag, use the bottle opener to remove the lid from the canister. While only touching the edges of the film negative, pull the film out of the canister. The film will be taped to the center film spool., Unless you want to cut through your pictures, cut the film at the base of the spool. Also, cut the tip of the film so that you have a square edge (the odd shaped piece that sticks out of the canister when you first buy the film).

, Start to feed the film into the outer edge of the spool at the beginning of the spiral. You only need to feed it in for a few inches. Once it is in, twist the sides of the reel back and forth. While twisting, keep your left hand steady, and with your right hand twist the right side of the reel forward, then bring it back. Keep feeding the film into the spool until it is all in (a few inches past).For 35mm film, you will need to cut the end off when you get to the end of the roll. For 120 film, you need to detach the end from the backing paper when you get to the end of the roll.
Loading your film onto the reel can be a challenge, especially if it is your first time. Start practicing by using already developed film or junk film, i.e., film you do not care about.

, Once the film is reeled, load it into the development tank and tightly close the tank. Once the tank is secured, you can turn the lights on or take it out of the changing bag., Place your Developer and Blix containers in a sink or a bathtub with water that is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius. Use your thermometer to monitor the temperature of the water.

, Place your development tank in clean tap water that is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius. With your agitator, agitate the tank for one minute while it is soaking. After one minute dump the water out. It is OK if the water is colored.Make sure any excess water is removed from the tank.

, Use a thermometer to ensure that your Developer is 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.8 degrees Celsius. With a stopwatch in hand, pour the Developer into the tank until it is level with the opening at the lid. Start the stopwatch as soon as you've poured all the Developer into the tank. Agitate the tank for 15 seconds. Do this by swirling the tank around. Flip the tank gently 4 times every 30 seconds. Tap the tank gently on the edge of the sink to pop any bubbles that have formed inside from flipping it. Repeat this every 30 seconds for 3 minutes exactly. At 3:25, start pouring the Developer back into its original chemical container or jug using the funnel. Your developing time will be 3 ½ minutes.Do not neglect to agitate the developing tank. The developing chemicals become exhausted very shortly after coming in contact with the film. The agitation ensures that fresh chemicals are touching the film.

, Ensure with your thermometer that the Blixer is at the right temperature. Pour the Blix mix into the tank until it is level with the opening at the lid, and start your timer. Agitate for 15 seconds then cover. Flip the tank four times, but you do not need to tap it this time! Flip the tank 4 times every 30 seconds for 6 minutes. At 6:25, pour the Blix back into its original chemical container or gallon jug using the funnel.You will need to wash the film after you pour out the Blix. Fill the tank with tap water that is 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 to 40.5 degrees Celsius. Agitate it again for a couple seconds and leave it soaking for 3 minutes., Fill up your tank with the Stabilizer until it is level with the opening at the lid. Agitate for 15 seconds, and leave it for 1 minute. After one minute, pour the Stabilizer back into its container using the funnel.


If you like, you can do a quick rinse after the Stabilizer. Pour water into the tank, shake it gently, and pour the water back out. This is to ensure that excess chemicals have been removed form the tank., Open the tank, and, one at a time, pull the film gently off the reels.

, With a squeegee or a sponge, remove the excess water from the film. Try not to let anything touch the film. It is very soft and can be damaged easily at this stage.


If anything gets on the film, immediately run liberal amounts of distilled water over the film. It is normal for the film to look cloudy before it is dry., Clip the film to a string, ideally one that you have already hung, using clothespins or film hanger clips. You will need one or two clips at the top and one at the bottom. Some clips have small ""hooks"" on them. You can run the hooks through the square holes running down the sides of the film, and thus avoid puncturing the film negative. The bottom clips act like weights to prevent the film from curling up while it dries.Let the film dry in a room that is temperature room for at least two hours.

, Once the film is dry, use scissors or a sharp knife to the cut the film as you see fit. Use sleeves bought from a camera shop to store your film.


You can also take the negatives to a store, like a camera store or some pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens, and have prints made. Or, you can scan the negatives into a computer and order prints online.

That's it!",How to Develop Black and White Film," Most photographic chemicals come in concentrate form, which needs to be mixed with water. You are going to use the graduated cylinder to measure the chemicals and water, and the gallon jugs to store them.;
, That is, 1 part developer to 3 parts water. This gives you a ""stock"" solution. Fill one gallon jug with this stock solution. The stock solution will be diluted more before using it on the film. Diluting this stock solution will provide you with a ""working"" solution.

, Mix the stop bath and water together and store in a gallon jug. This is a working solution.

, Mix the fixer and water together and store in a gallon jug. This is also a working solution.

, This chemical comes as a powder, and you need to ensure that it is thoroughly mixed. Store in a gallon jug.

, Fill a large sink (like your kitchen sink) with water that is 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). Use the thermometer to get the correct temperature. This is very important. Now put your gallon jugs of chemicals in the sink, floating in the water. These chemicals must be 20 degrees Celsius when you use them. You are going to put them in 68 degrees water because the temperature of the water is going to drop a bit while bringing the chemicals to the correct temperature. Try to be as accurate as possible when it comes to the chemicals' temperature. More than 1 degree above or 1 degree below 20 degrees can have a big effect on the film! Remember, the final chemical temperature you want is 20 degrees, and you are soaking the chemicals in 68 degree water because the gallon jugs will sit in the water for at least 30 minutes, and the water temperature will drop a couple degrees during that time.

, This must be in complete darkness. No light whatsoever. No red safety lights either. Take the scissors, bottle opener, film canister, film reel, and developing tank into a dust free room that you can make light-tight. For the moment, you can have the room lights turned on.

, You're going to be loading the film onto the reel in complete darkness, so make sure you lay the tools out in such a way that you can find them in the dark.

, Use the bottle opener to pop the bottom off the film canister, which should be very easy. While only touching the film negative from the edges, pull the film out of the canister. The film will be taped to the center film spool. Make sure you cut it off right at the base of the spool or you'll be cutting through your pictures. Also cut the tip off the film (the odd shaped piece that sticks out of the canister when you first buy the film) so that it's flat. You only need to cut about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the tip.

, While not touching the surface of the negative, slide the negative into the opening of the reel. Slide about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of film into the reel. Start walking the film onto the reel by twisting one side of the reel back and forth. To be clear on this, keep your left hand steady, and with your right hand twist the right side of the reel forward, then bring it back. Continue doing this until all the film is loaded onto the reel. If your reel looks like the one in the image, it's not the auto-loading type, and you will need to trap the loose end of the film under the spring clip in the center, then fit the film into the space between the spiral wires as you rotate the reel. It's a lot easier to do than it sounds. Squeezing the film to make it slightly curved will help.

, The tank is now light-tight, and you can turn on the lights. Even though the developing tank has a hole in the top for pouring in the chemicals, it is in fact light-tight. Pour water into the tank, let stand for 1 minute, this is called pre-wetting and will make the film swell up and accept the developer solution. pour out the water

, Check the developer chemical with the thermometer. If it's at 20 degrees Celsius, then you are ready to go. If it is higher than 20 degrees, then keep checking every 10 minutes until it's ready. If it is below 20 degrees, add some hot water to the sink the gallon jugs are floating in. Pour 1 ounce of the stock developing solution into the graduated cylinder and then add 7 ounces of 20 degrees Celsius water to that. You are making a ""working"" solution by using a 1:7 chemical to water ratio. To recap, you made a stock solution of the developing chemical by using a 1:3 chemical concentrate to water ratio, and then mixed that stock solution with a 1:7 working chemical to water ratio.

, Do this very quickly and start the stopwatch as soon as you've poured all the developer into the tank. Smack the developing tank on a counter a few times to dislodge any bubbles that might be clinging on to the film. Agitate the tank for 30 seconds. Do this by swirling the tank around. You are going to leave the film in the developer for as many minutes is appropriate for your film type (<a href=""http: check the mas dev chart</a>). Agitate the film for 5 seconds every 30 seconds. Agitation is very important. Do not neglect to agitate the developing tank. The developing chemicals become exhausted very shortly after coming in contact with the film. The agitation ensures that fresh chemicals are touching the film. However, this exhaustion of the chemicals is an important part of the process. Over-agitating can give negative results or positive results. It depends on the ""look"" you are going for. Too much agitation increases the contrast in the image but often you will damage the film and see sprocket marks if you have over agitated. If you want more contrast consider push processing.

, Do not take the lid off the developing tank.

, Pour the water in the canister agitate for a couple seconds and pour out, repeat 4 times. Or, alternatively you can use the stop bath chemical. With stopwatch in hand, quickly pour the stop bath into the top of the developing tank until the tank is full. There is no need to dilute the stop bath more, so you can pour straight from the gallon jug. Start the stopwatch when you've filled the tank up. Once again, smack the tank against a counter a couple times to dislodge any bubbles. You are going to leave the film in the stop bath for 1 1/2 minutes. The purpose of the stop bath is to neutralize any remaining developer left on the film, and arrest the developing process.

, Some stop bath solutions, like the Kodak Indicator Stop Bath, can be re-used. If this is the chemical you are using, then pour the stop bath back into the gallon jug for later use. The word ""indicator"" in Kodak Indicator Stop Bath means the chemical indicates when it is no longer any good. The chemical, when mixed with water, is yellow. As long as the stop bath remains yellow in color, it is good to use.

, Assuming your fixer is pre-diluted, there is no need to dilute the fixer more, so you can pour straight from the gallon jug. Start the stopwatch once the tank is full. You are going to leave the film in the fixing solution for 6 minutes, as few as 4 for rapid fixer. Smack the tank against the counter to dislodge any bubbles. Agitate the film for 3 seconds every 30 seconds. Some people don't agitate during the fixing process. It is safe to open the tank completely after 3 minutes.

, Do not re-use the fixer. You can now unscrew the top of the developing tank and expose the film negative to light. Once the film has been ""fixed"", it is no longer light sensitive. The rest of the process is done with the lid of the developing tank off.

, There is no need to dilute the hypo-clearing agent more, so you can pour straight from the gallon jug. Smack the tank against the counter to dislodge any bubbles. You are going to leave the film in the hypo-clearing agent for 1 1/2 minutes. You can agitate the film a little bit if you like.

, After 1 1/2 minutes, dump out the hypo-clearing agent. Do not re-use this chemical. Put the developing tank under the running water. It's time to wash all the chemicals off the film. You are going to leave the film under the running water for 10 minutes. The water should fill up the developing tank and overflow. Let it overflow. Every couple of minutes, dump out the water and let the tank fill back up with fresh running water. You want to keep fresh 20-degree water pouring into the developing tank. This final washing part of the process is very important. Ten minutes is the minimum time to wash the film, but you can do it in a longer time. It is also important that you are washing the film with 20 degree water. Using hotter or colder water can affect the final picture.

, Turn the reel clockwise (could be counter-clockwise, depends on how you're holding the reel, so try them both) until the top half of the reel comes apart from the lower half of the reel. Now use one of the film clips and clip it onto the end of the film negative. Some clips have small ""hooks"" on them. You can run the hooks through the square holes running down the sides of the film, and thus avoid puncturing the film negative. By lifting up the clip, pull the film up out of the reel. If everything went well, you should see your pictures on the negative. Clip the other film clip onto the bottom of the negative. This will act as a weight. Hang the negative up to dry in a room temperature, dust free room. Leave the negative to dry for at least 2 hours.

, You're all done. You can now take the negatives to a store and have prints made, make your own prints, or scan the negatives and order prints online.

C-41 film is a common consumer film used in 35mm cameras, so these developing kits prove the most practical for standard consumer use.


Note, however, that if you are not using C-41 compatible film, you should search for a film developing kit specially designed for your film type. The instructions for such film developing kits and the chemicals used may vary from those included here.;
, Place 1600 ml (51 oz) of hot water into a clean glass or plastic container. Stir in the contents of the ""developer"" powder until dissolved. Add enough water to make 2000 ml (64 oz).


The temperature of the water should be roughly 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.5 degrees Celsius). By the time it cools down for use, it should not have dropped below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).
Use distilled water instead of tap water when possible.
Do not mix the chemicals in a metal container.

, Pour another 1600 ml (51 oz) of hot water into a second clean glass or plastic container. Stir the ""blix"" or ""bleach-fix"" packets into the water and add enough additional water to make 2000 ml (64 oz).


Blix is also known as “bleach-fix.”If there are multiple bleach-fix packets, add them in alphabetical order: ""A"" and then ""B.""
The temperature of the water should be about 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.5 degrees Celsius). It will cool down as it sits, but you should not allow it to drop below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).
Use distilled water and do not mix the chemicals in a metal container.

, Stir the contents of the ""stabilizer"" powder into 2000 ml (64 oz) fresh water and mix thoroughly.


Use room temperature distilled water. The exact temperature does not need to be precise.

, Separate the developing tank into its separate parts: the tank, center column, reel, screen top, and red push cape. Rinse the tank portion out with hot water and dry thoroughly with a clean cloth.


If there are any dried chemical spots, wipe them away with hot water and a clean cloth.
Replace the center column when done. This column is what makes it possible for the tank to remain dark or “light proof” even while you add the developing chemicals.

, The default size setting should be set to work with 35mm film, but if not, you can adjust the reel to fit the size of your film.


Twist the reel apart into two separate pieces. One piece has a long groove in it while the second has a tab that locks into this groove at various points.
The first notch in the groove should be for 35mm film. The second is usually for 127 format and the final one is usually for 120. Lock the tab into the first groove, clicking it into place.

, With the reel in your hand, turn off the lights of the room you are in. Give your eyes time to readjust to the darkness before proceeding.


Exposing the film to light will ruin it, so you need to keep the lights off while loading the film into the tank.

, Use a bottle opener to rip open the film canister, pretending that the bottom of the canister is the bottom cap.


After removing the film, hand it around the edges instead of handling it in the center.
Snip off the leader portion at the beginning of the film with clean scissors and discard.

, Feed the newly-snipped end of the film into the tabs at the beginning of the reel. Make sure that the first 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of film is inserted into the reel.


Twist the reel back and forth to insert the rest of the film. The ball bearings under the tab with grip the film and draw it in. Keep going until the film is completely wound onto the reel.
Snip off the last portion of film connected to the spindle.

, Insert the reel into the center column and screw the lid on securely.


Once done, you may turn the lights back on. The center column should provide sufficient protection against the light.

, Pour plain distilled water into the tank and let it sit for 60 seconds before pouring it out.


The water you pour out will probably be a murky green color.
The water should be at about 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius).

, Pour the developer solution into the tank and let it sit for 3.5 minutes before dumping it out. The film should be completely submerged, and you should agitate the tank for 10 seconds every 30 seconds during this stage.


Make sure that the developing solution measures about 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius).

, Pour the blix solution into the tank and let sit for 6.5 minutes. Agitate the tank for 10 seconds every 30 seconds. Dump the solution out when done.


The temperature of the blix solution should be between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (35 and 40.6 degrees Celsius).
The light-sensitive stage of development is complete with the conclusion of this step. You can work with the lid off as soon as it is finished.

, Remove the reel from the tank and wash it under clean, running water for 3 minutes to wash away the chemicals.


The temperature of the clean water should be between 95 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit (35 and 40.6 degrees Celsius).

, Replace the reel in the tank. Pour in the stabilizer solution and agitate the tank for 15 seconds. Let the film sit in the stabilizer for 30 to 60 seconds total.


The solution should be at room temperature.

, The film will need to develop for 4 to 8 hours.


Remove the reel from the tank once more and twist it apart to open.
Pinch one end of the roll and lift the film out, allowing it to unroll in the process.
Hang the film in a dry, dust-free location, like your shower. Use film flips.

, Much of the process is similar to that outlined above, but the chemicals you need include a developer, stop bath, fixer, and hypo-clearing agent. The water temperatures and soaking times also vary.

, These kits involve a technique even more similar to the one outlined here, but you will not be able to develop black-and-white film with them.

, The coffee and baking soda are dissolved in warm water and used instead of a chemical developer solution.

, While not entirely necessary, creating a dark room to work in will make it easier to organize and manage your film developing supplies.


It is a good idea to build a dark room if you plan on getting serious about photography.
Select a room with no windows to serve as the base for your dark room. Otherwise, light could still bleed in from the outside.

, Chemical spots can ruin your photos if you allow them to sit on your negatives for too long. Knowing how to clean your negatives well is an essential step in developing photos properly.


It is also a good idea to learn about cleaning old negatives as well as recently developed ones.

, Obviously, when your photographs are taken using a digital camera, there is no physical film to develop. If you own a digital camera, make sure you learn how to transfer and print the photos you take with it.

Be aware that when you enter the field, you will most likely have to begin your career with a low-wage entry-level position or even a volunteer position. Factor this likelihood into your debate over whether or not to incur the added expense and possible debt of higher education.While a degree will likely bolster your resume, some production companies value enthusiasm and ambition over a diploma. If you are passionate about this career, they may still consider your application and hire you based on that passion.

, Research colleges and universities that offer associate or bachelor’s degrees in film and TV production. Check with their career centers to see how many students find employment after graduation. Visit each school to talk with professors and department heads. Find out the following:How much coursework is actually devoted to physically operating a camera?
Do they have a studio on campus, or is training done exclusively “in the field?”
How up-to-date is their equipment?

, Once you have applied and been accepted by your school of choice, apply yourself wholeheartedly to your curriculum. Use this formal education to round out your technical prowess with the camera. Save your recorded projects to edit together for a demo reel once you are ready to seek employment. Aim to master the following concepts:Audio
Composition
Color/shading
Editing
Field depth
Frame rates
Framing shots
Lenses
Lighting
Location shoots
Resolution
Studio shoots

, Visit your department or the career center as soon as you enroll. Find out how many credits you need to earn before you are eligible for internships. Once you have covered the prerequisites, apply as soon as possible. Gain firsthand experience with professional shoots. Establish contacts within the industry. Expect your position as an intern to allow you limited access (if any) to operating cameras, but use this opportunity to observe the day-to-day demands of your prospective career.If possible, apply to multiple internships in order to cover the three most common type of shoots:In-studio, where shoots are done in a controlled environment with choreographed camerawork determined by a director.

Live coverage of scheduled events, such as sports, concerts, and speeches. Directors predetermine where to set cameras for optimum coverage, but cameramen must be prepared for the unexpected and respond quickly to new directions.

In-the-field coverage, which may include electronic news gathering (ENG) or wildlife photography. Cameramen must have strong instincts and react quickly to the unscripted nature of the job.

, Expect to have to start your career via an entry-level position that does not involve directly operating cameras. Apply for a position as a production assistant to get your foot in the door. Use this opportunity to familiarize yourself with the production company’s assignments, equipment, and operating procedures. Excel at your job to demonstrate your commitment and capabilities to your coworkers and supervisors so that they will be quick to consider you for your desired position as cameraman.Similarly, begin your job search with smaller production companies and local network affiliates. Larger companies may have unionized work forces with less turnover and fewer opportunities for applicants with little or no experience.
Search online for openings at companies you wish to work for or to find job postings on such sites as LinkedIn or Glassdoor.

, Whether you are a low-level employee, an intern, or a student, keep a contact list of people you meet within the industry. Develop strong working relationships with everyone you work alongside of. Shelve personal likes and dislikes while on the job and focus instead on building a professional rapport with any and all contacts. Utilize these people as sources of information regarding new openings and opportunities, as well as recommendations to potential employers.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that professional references play a key if not primary role in deciding to fill cameramen positions. Consider your contacts to be one most valuable assets you have in obtaining employment.

, Edit your best samples into one video file to submit along with your job application. If not explicitly stated in the job posting, contact the person doing the hiring to find out if they would prefer you to submit a physical thumbdrive or an attached video-file online.


If you are applying to multiple positions that differ in nature, compose a demo reel for each one.
For instance, if you are applying for an in-studio position, use samples that highlight your ability to frame a subject with a proper depth of field and favorable lighting.
If you are applying to become an in-the-field cameraman, favor video samples that showcase your ability to swiftly adapt to changing conditions, as well as track moving objects while keeping them in frame.

, Expect your potential employer to only skim it. Keep it short so that they can get the gist of it in one glance.Regardless of what format you choose to follow, begin your resume with a brief summary that encompasses the thrust of all that follows. In a few lines, highlight your experience, accomplishments, and ambitions, and how you wish to apply them to the job at hand. Aim to make your strongest impression here, in case the reader doesn’t bother with the rest. After your summary, include the following:Work experience: Include internships and any paid employment. For each position, list those duties that have the most direct bearing on your desired job to indicate a transferable set of skills. Use strong verbs to define them as personal accomplishments, rather than the general expectations of your former employer. For instance, write that you “set up camera and lighting equipment” instead of “I was responsible for setting up equipment” to suggest a proactive approach to your work.

Education: Include those schools from which you have already graduated, as well as any that you are currently enrolled in. For each one, mention your graduation date, the degree that you earned, and any honors you may have received. If you are still attending school, include your projected graduation date and major. If you were valedictorian with a 4.0 average, feel free to share that, but otherwise leave out any mention of your class ranking or grade point average.

Other experience: Detail skillsets and accomplishments gained from volunteer positions, academic clubs, training or coursework undertaken outside of a school curriculum, or other examples not covered by your academic and job histories. List them in the same manner as your work experiences. Limit yourself to just those that have some direct connection to the job at hand in order to stay on topic.

, Use the same resume to apply to multiple positions if they are similar in nature, but be sure to write a new cover letter for each single position. Limit yourself to one page so that the reader is more likely to read it in full. Include how your experiences, education, and ambitions make you an ideal candidate for that exact position.Address the cover letter directly to the person who is doing the hiring. Use their title (Dr., Mr., Ms., etc) while omitting their first name to make your letter more personal while still maintaining a professional tone.State the specific job opening to which you are applying as either a subject line in your email or as a lead to your letter’s first paragraph. Avoid making your cover letter seem like a vague, all-purpose letter.
Mirror the language used by the company on their website and publicity materials. Create the impression that you are an ideal fit for their company by speaking the way they speak.
Refer directly to your attached resume and demo reel to ensure they peruse them. Request them to contact you in order to set up interviews. Use assumptive language, as if you know for a fact that they will do these things, such as: “The attached resume will detail my experience more extensively,” or “I will be readily available for an interview once you have made your decision.”

Know your performance genre and the simple principles behind lighting that genre.,
Consider your venue.,
Look into what stock you have at your venue.",How to Do Stage Lighting1," A standard play has lots of dialogue. An audiences ability to understand dialogue is directly linked with their visual connection with the speakers face. Make sure you have a lot of light focused to the actors faces.


Dance is where the movement of the body is most important. Light from the sides is what highlights fluid movements the best. Experiment with side light at different heights and angles.
Musicals are an amalgamation of both, as they contain elements of both drama and dance. Usually, principles of both are amalgamated into the same lighting design.
Concerts are the colour and effects ball game. Often you will have flesh-tones spotlights following your performers around but most other lighting will be for colour, movement and effect. Think symmetry, bold colours, and wash lights.;
, This will help determine how many lights you need, and where you are able to place them. Look at where the lighting bars are. This gives you an idea of where you can hang things. Can you put lights on stands on the floor? Or rig vertical pipe and hang them from the sides?

, Most venues have a base stock of equipment. Make sure you know what they are and what they do. Don't get too caught up in the technical names if you aren't sure what they mean, there are two differences that are most important: FRESNEL lamps are 'wash' fixtures. They have a certain type of lens (called a fresnel) which causes the light to have a fuzzy edge and usually will cover a lot of area. Often you can adjust the spot size but the edge will always be fuzzy. These lights are usually shorter than PROFILE spots. PROFILE spots are usually used for when you want to light something specific - a person in a specific spot, etc. They have the ability to have a sharp edge. Some have a 'zoom' capacity which means you can alter both the size and the edge (fuzzy or sharp) of the light output. They are usually longer and skinnier than FRESNELs.

"
"
Think about your script, dance piece, musical, or concert type.,
Consider how you need to light.,
Consider colours to help in creating mood and atmosphere.",How to Do Stage Lighting2," For scripts in particular, think of moods, atmospheres, locations, times of day. Lighting can help with establishing any or all of these things.

, Lighting is all about angles - particularly in plays and dance. By angles, we mean the direction from which the light source is coming from and how it hits the subject. Get a small directional light - like a torch - and have a look at how shining it from different directions creates a different atmosphere around the subject. Consider how these angles could compliment your performance and where you would use them in the script.

, Deep blues for nighttime scenes (particularly when used from the top or behind the actors, as 'fill light'), yellow for warm sunny scenes, etc. You should be able to get a colour swatch book from any theatre equipment supply store, and choose your colours.

"
"
Decide which lights you are going to put where.,
Hang your lights, and plug them in.,
Focus your lights where you want them to go.",How to Do Stage Lighting3," It is always good to draw up a picture of the stage and any fixed bars that you can use to hang your lights. Then, based on this, decide where you want to put your lights and where they will point, what colour they will be, etc. If you have the facilities, you can add more bars in or use stands on the floor. If your venue doesn't have enough lights, look into hire companies that can hire you lights for a fee.


You can also set up a DMX controller after you have hung your lights. Plug the lights in via DMX cable and set up your scenes including the brightness and color that you think are the best for your event.

, This is usually via a DIMMER RACK. Dimmer Racks give you the ability to fade the lights in and out fluidly using a lighting desk/console.

, PROFILE spots have shutters which you can use to make the beam square, or shutter the light of unwanted bits of scenery or walls. FRESNELS have an attachment called 'barn doors' which serve a similar purpose.

Refrain from shooting the sky.,
Lower the exposure on your camera by about two stops.,
Change the white balance.,
Add nighttime elements to sell the effect.",How to Film a Day for Night (DFN) Scene1," Because the sky is dark at night and light in the daytime, getting the sky in your video will be a dead giveaway to your effect.;
, You will need a camera with manual mode/settings to do this because obviously, it is darker at night.

, There are two ways to do this. One way is to set your camera's white balance to ""tungsten"". The other way is to simply calibrate your camera's white balance to a yellow card or envelope. The reason of doing this is because it is said that the nighttime moon creates a blueish light

, If you were to go outside at night, what would you see? what would you hear? Adding flashlights, car lights, and nighttime ambiance will make your shot more realistic and convincing.

Separate the camera body from the lens and other attachments.,
Clean the inside of the film chamber using a blower.,
Use the blower to remove any particles on the outside of the camera body.,
Use a cloth soaked in a cleaning solution to wipe down the camera.,
Use a pencil eraser to get rid of tough stains or tarnish.,
Clean the ground glass inside of the camera using a cloth or cotton swab.,
Wipe down the viewfinder with a cotton swab.,
Clean the mirror with a cotton swab.,
Use a blower to remove particles from your lens.,
Dust your lens using a lens brush to remove any remaining particles.,
Apply a lens-cleaning solution to a cloth or tissue.,
Wipe your lens clean with the cloth.,
Avoid over-cleaning your camera lens.,
Store your camera and lens in a case when you’re not using them.,
Use a lens cap to protect your camera lens.",How to Clean a 35mm Film Camera and Lens," Make sure the camera is turned off before you start detaching the different components. Remove the camera battery and take off the camera strap if there’s one attached. Press the lens release button located on the camera body at the base of the lens to detach the lens., A blower is a small, rubber device that puffs air out of it when you squeeze it. Open the film chamber and turn the camera so the film chamber is facing downward. Angle the blower so it’s pointing inside the film chamber and then squeeze it to puff air out and blow away any particles.You can find a blower at most stores that sell cameras and camera equipment, or online.

, Go around the entire exterior of the camera with the blower, blowing away any dust or particle buildup. It’s important to do this before wiping down the camera with a cloth, as any leftover particles could be dragged across the camera’s surface when you’re wiping it down, leaving scratches., Use a cleaning solution and a cloth specifically designed for cameras. Make sure the cloth you’re using doesn’t have too much solution on it; you don’t want liquid dripping onto the camera and seeping into the cracks.


If you don’t have access to a camera-cleaning cloth, use a cotton swab or wrap a toothpick in a cotton pad., Gently rub the eraser on any stains or grimy buildup on the camera body. Beware of eraser crumbs; you may need to use the blower or a lens brush to remove them after you’re done cleaning with the eraser., If your camera has ground glass inside of the body, you can access it by lifting the small latch behind the lens mount. Once the ground glass has dropped down, wipe it down using a cloth or cotton swab with cleaning solution.If you notice any particles on or around the ground glass, use a blower to blow them away before you wipe it down with a cloth.

, Dampen the cotton swab with cleaning solution and wipe it across the surface of the viewfinder, making sure to wipe away any smudges or grease on the glass., The mirror is located behind the lens mount. Using cleaning solution, wipe a cotton swab across the surface of the mirror. Let it dry and check to make sure there aren’t any streaks before you put the lens back on., Give the blower a few squeezes away from your lens in case there’s any dust inside. Then hold the blower close to your lens and squeeze to puff out air and blow away any particles.Avoid using your mouth to blow air onto your camera lens. The saliva from your mouth can coat and damage the lens.

, Use a brush specifically designed for camera lenses to avoid damaging your lens. Lens brushes have fine brush hairs that won’t scratch or damage glass. Move the lens brush in a circular motion on the lens until you’ve eliminated the remaining particles., Use a cloth or tissue specifically designed for lenses to avoid scratching your lens. Avoid using facial tissue or your t-shirt to wipe your lens down. For the best results, use a cleaner designed for camera lenses. You can also use reagent-grade isopropyl alcohol or de-ionized water.Always apply your lens cleaner to a cloth or tissue and not directly on your camera lens. Applying a lens cleaner directly to your camera lens can result in liquid getting into your camera’s body., Move the cloth in concentric circles to avoid streaks. Don’t apply too much pressure, just enough to remove any smudges or grease from the lens.

, Camera lenses are durable pieces of glass, but over-exposing them to cleaning chemicals and physical contact can lead to unnecessary damage. Avoid touching your camera lens when you’re taking photos so you don’t have to clean it as often. Don’t clean your lens every time you see a few specks of dust; some dust is OK and will not impact the quality of your images., Use a case specifically designed to hold a camera. Keeping your camera and lens in a proper storage container will keep them dry and prevent any dirt or grime build up.When you’re traveling with your camera, carry it in a travel case as opposed to carrying it in the same bag as your other belongings. This will prevent your camera and lens from getting dirty or damaged.

, Lens caps are relatively cheap and you can find them in most stores that sell cameras. A lens cap snaps on the front of your camera lens so no dust or dirt gets on it when you’re not using it. A lens cap will also protect your lens from drops or impacts."

Wear clean cotton or nylon gloves.,
Use a dry antistatic cloth.,
Clean the negatives.,
Spray the negatives with antistatic film cleaner.",How to Clean Negatives1," Gloves will keep additional fingerprints off your negatives. Make sure the gloves are free of lint and dust. This will prevent your negatives from getting scratched during the cleaning process. You can buy these gloves in your local photography supply store., Static attracts dust, so it's important to avoid other kinds of cloths. The cloth should be soft and clean. Softness and cleanliness will protect your negatives from scratches. Anti-static cloths are available at photography supply stores., Take the cloth in your dominant hand. Drape it over your palm and fingers. Partially close your hand to form a C. Hold each negative in your non-dominant hand. Gently rub the negative over the cloth until it's free of dust., If the cloth didn't do the trick, spray one squirt of cleaner onto a nonabrasive antistatic cloth. Gently move the cloth over the surface of the negative. Use light back-and-forth strokes until all dust, watermarks, and/or fingerprints are gone. The cleaner will dry immediately. You can buy it at your local photography supply store.Antistatic film cleaner emits potent, potentially toxic, fumes. Make sure your work space is well ventilated. Wear a mask for extra protection."

, Doing this prevents the camera from readjusting itself when the sunglasses are put on. To do this, press the second and third buttons from the bottom left corner. The buttons should turn red.

, Try to prevent reflections. The sunglasses need to be the kind that make everything blueish. Try different sunglasses. You will need to adjust accordingly if the picture is too dark or bright. Keep the glasses clean so the camera doesn't focus on them.

Label the photos as you go or create labels.,
If your photos are going in boxes, sort them directly into the boxes.",How to Organize Your Photos," You didn't accumulate these photos overnight, and you're not going to sort them overnight, either. One approach would be to set a timer for 15 or 30 minutes, and just work for that long.;
, Spread them out over a table or use shoe boxes or trays. If you can leave the project on display for awhile or store them in order between sessions, you'll have less preparation time in each sitting.

, This could be an album, scrapbook, frames, flip-frames, or simply a decorative box.

,


Cull any hopelessly blurry shots, along with anything that's much too bright or dark. Also throw out anything featuring the photographer's thumb or camera strap if it cannot be salvaged by cropping. Consider discarding duplicates or near-duplicates, too. If you have good double shots, pass them along to Grandma, or anybody else who would appreciate them.
Sift out anything that could be improved by cropping or other adjustment and place it in a separate pile or tray.
Sort them into broad categories. For example, put family photographs in one pile, nature or artistic shots in another, and utility photos (such as pictures taken of your home or belongings for insurance purposes).

, You could arrange them chronologically, by subject, or by event, for instance. Begin sorting them in whatever detail you choose.

, If you're writing directly on the photo, rather than alongside them in an album or scrapbook, make sure you use an appropriate pen.

, If they're going in albums or scrapbooks, you'll also need to arrange them on the pages. You can do a rough layout before committing to a permanent arrangement.

, It slides towards the power switch.

, Lift the hinged silver cover away first, then fit four batteries in the battery compartment. Press the silver cover back into place.

, This is almost exactly the opposite of removing it; it'll click right into place., This is a small, silver cover on the base of the camera (on the right hand side, if you're looking at the camera the right way up from the back). Use a coin or a large screwdriver to unscrew it.

, There's a holder for it on the top of the winder so you don't lose it. Slide it in as illustrated.

, Make sure the tripod socket on the camera and the screw on the winder, the electrical contacts, and the winder couplers are aligned. Gently push the winder onto the base of the camera.

, The fastening screw is the large, silver knob on the front of the camera. Turn it in the direction illustrated. It only needs to be as tight as your finger can do it; don't bother using any tools to get it tighter.

, If the camera is not already wound on, the winder will advance the camera to the next frame., According to Canon's own literature, the winder will not advance the film to the next frame until you remove your finger from the shutter. Oddly, in practice (on the A-1 and AE-1 at least), it works continuously.Try it on your camera and see what happens.
When you reach the end of your film, the winder will audibly refuse to advance the film any further, and a red LED will illuminate on the winder. The good news for cheapskates is that you can milk as many frames as possible out of a film this way, because it'll keep going until the film cannot be advanced any further, and (unlike with manual winding) you can't wind it too far.

, Fortunately, the Power Winder A provides a rewind release button. Push it, then rewind your film as normal.

",How to Convert Film to a Videotape with a CineMate 20," The table should also be high enough for you to position the camera level with the projected image using an ordinary tripod.;
, Your video camera will need a feature that allows you to make manual adjustment to the shutter speed. Set the shutter speed to 1/60 of a second. If you are recording in the European PAL format, the shutter speed should be 1/50 of a second.

, Make sure the film is attached to the take-up reel. Flip the toggles in the rear of the unit to supply power to the motor and lamp, then turn the operation knob past the ""Forward"" position to “Lamp.” Wait for the film leader (if any) to pass and view the projected “aerial” image on the condenser lens.

, Zoom out until the projected image on the condenser lens fills your viewfinder frame.

Wipe the negative.",How to Clean Negatives2," Avoid regular rubbing alcohol from the medicine cabinet, which will leave streaks on the surface. Make sure the product is free of additives, which could damage your negatives. You can buy the higher concentration at the hardware store or at the gas station.


If you're shopping at the gas station, 98 percent isopropyl alcohol might be sold as “dry gas.”, Isopropyl alcohol in high concentrations emits fumes. Work in a room with an open window. If possible, place a fan in the window so that it faces the outside. This will draw fumes out of your workspace., After putting on your gloves, uncap the alcohol. Place the cotton ball or cloth over the top of the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down for about a second. Return the bottle to an upright position and replace its cap., Holding the negative in your dominant hand. Use your other hand to clean the surface.

Once you've sorted your negatives, store them in fire-proof metal slide boxes. You can buy all of these at your local photography supply store., Heat can discolor and disfigure negatives. Choose a room with an ambient temperature no higher than 70 °F (21 °C). Keep the negatives away from heat sources such as vents, radiators, and windows receiving direct sunlight.


For contemporary color negatives, the temperature should be no higher than 40 °F (4 °C)., Humidity can trigger the growth of mold and rust. Too much moisture in the atmosphere can lead to watermarks on the negatives. Don't allow the relative humidity to rise above 30-40 percent. If your negatives are heirlooms or antiques, you should consider investing in a hygrometer, which measures ambient humidity."

Add text.",How to Make a Photo Essay," These make for great photo essay topics. People are typically at least passingly familiar with the subject matter, and you’ll likely have an audience who cares about your essay. This can be something as simple as holiday shopping or as complex as rising unemployment rates in your area. If you’re interested in finding out more about the subject, chances are others will be too., School activities, fundraisers for charities, and the annual street festival may all make interesting subjects. If you talk about your plans with the organizers prior to the event, you may even have a ready-made place to publish your essay on their website or in the local newspaper., These are subjects you’ll already be familiar with, making it easy to plan for a meaningful essay. Take pictures of the place that you work and people you work with. Not only will it help you get to know your coworkers and business better, you may be able to use the essay as a promotional tool for your company. Hobbies are another great topic. Those who share the hobby or who are interested in taking it up will be interested, and you can share your hard work and enjoyment with others.


Offer a photo essay of your place of business as a training tool.
Use a photo essay about your business as a sales or social tool by publishing it on your website or social media page.
Create a how to photo essay to help others learn about your hobby, so they can take it up as well., Once you have a few ideas, think of how you can photograph and present these to others. Consider which subject will be the easiest to capture and present the most interesting subject matter. Most importantly, choose a subject that inspires you. The chances are if you see something interesting, others will as well., Ask yourself, “Who will want to see this photo essay?” Audience is important when it comes to deciding what to shoot. If you have an idea of who will view the essay, you can choose a subject and images that will appeal to them. If you don’t have an audience or place of publication in mind, it’s still important to consider what subjects will appeal to viewers. Many photographers think this means choosing a big subject like poverty or inequality, but many times, the more personal the subject matter, the more appeal it has for others., Both types of essays can be very impactful, but it’s important to consider how best to approach your topic before you begin shooting. This allows you to look for specific shots to meet your needs. Thematic essays look at a big picture idea and show specific examples, and narrative essays tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Thematic essays are often used to add emphasis to news stories, but it's important to avoid randomly collecting photos. Each image should add something new. Narratives are often easier to organize, but you may struggle to find just the right photo.


Thematic subjects are big ideas including things like local gun laws, at-risk youth, or welcoming home soldiers.
Narrative essays can include a day in the life, how to tutorials, or progression series that show changes over time such as tracking a building project.
If you have been given a commission or specific publication to work with, you may need to choose a topic that will fit a thematic or narrative approach as outlined by the publication. Make sure you are aware of any publication guidelines in advance., If you plan to publish, you’ll need signed waivers from all of your subjects. Even if you don’t plan to publish with a commercial organization but intend to use the images for a personal blog or website, it is polite to ask for permission in advance. If you’re planning to photograph children, always ask their parent’s permission. Make it easy and comfortable for subjects to decline being photographed.


Consider how difficult it will be to get permission to photograph your subjects. If you already have relationships established, it will be easier. If not, allow for extra time to get permission and/or waivers.
Schools, daycares, and other places with kids typically have more regulations on who can be photographed and for what purposes. You’ll usually need to get parental approval, in addition to permission from those in charge., Before you arrive, conduct online searches, read the website of the topic you select, and make phone calls or send emails to find out more. The better you understand your subject before the day of the shoot, the more prepared you’ll be to take images that truly capture the essence of the subject matter.


Consider doing interviews with people involved prior to the shoot. Ask things like, “What’s the most interesting thing you do during this event?” or “How long have you been involved with this organization?”
These interviews are also a great opportunity to ask for permission and get waivers.
If you’re going to visit a job site, charitable event, or other large group activity, ask the person or persons in charge to explain what you’re doing to everyone before you arrive., Once you have your subject and permission to shoot, take a few moments to sketch out an idea of what photos you’ll need. Most essays need a variety of images to showcase the various aspects of the topic. You’ll want to include at least a signature photo, establishing shot, several detail shots, and a “clincher” photo at the end., Sometimes referred to as signature photos, these should be images that capture the heart of your subject. Think of famous photos like the “Migrant Mother” image by Dorothea Lange, capturing a woman and her children during the Great Depression. This photo has become synonymous with the Great Depression in the US.

, This should be a wide-angle image of the overall story. If you’re shooting a day of work at an office, an image of a line of workers entering the building at the beginning of the day could be used as an establishing shot.

, These shots should include a variety of portraits, close up shots of specific actions, and interactions. For instance, you could include a portrait of your “main character,” for an essay on a day at the office, typing on a computer. You could also include interaction images of the character leading a meeting with others or talking over coffee in the break room. Close ups can include things like images of your subject’s hands as she types or detailed shots of her computer screen.

, This image may not be apparent to you in the beginning, but most photographers say they know it when they see it. It’s an image that wraps up the essay for the viewer. This image should say “the end,” give a call to action, or show the end result of a day in the life or how to sequence., Capture test images to determine what ISO is needed. ISO determines how much light the lens allows through while capturing images, and how quickly the image can be captured. You should use low ISO for brightly lit, slow moving, or still subjects. Increase your ISO to capture images in dim lighting or those that are moving quickly.


Many new photographers stay away from high ISO shots because they allow more light through producing a “busy” image. However, these images are often easier to edit later as there’s more information to work with.If it’s very bright in your location or you’ve set up artificial lighting, a low ISO is likely adequate, For darker areas, you’ll likely need to use a higher ISO.
Most cameras have a base ISO of about 200. ISO increases by doubling, so the next ISO would be 400, then 800, etc. This essentially doubles the lens sensitivity, allowing more light through and capturing the image more quickly.
If you need one second to capture an image with a base ISO of 100, you’ll need one eighth of a second to capture with an ISO of 800., If you’re an experienced photographer, you likely have a variety of photo composition methods that you use regularly. For those who are new to photography, learning a basic technique like the rule of thirds is typically a good place to begin. The rule of thirds is the idea that every photo can be broken down into nine specific areas by creating three vertical sections and crossing them over with three horizontal sections. Then, try to place your main subject in one section with a focal point where the sections cross.


Even snapping candid shots, which you may need to capture quickly, take a few moments to think about how objects are placed to make the most impact.
Always think about how the main subject’s surroundings play into the overall image, and try to create different levels and points of interest.
You can change composition as part of the editing process in some cases, so if you can’t line up the shot just right, don’t let it deter you from capturing the image you want., If you’re hoping to get ten to fifteen good shots for the essay, you may need to take several hundred photos to get exactly what you want. Capture each image from a variety of angles. Climb up high or take images from the ground to provide a variety of perspectives for your viewers. Zoom in for details and zoom out for overall shots. Shoot each shot several times to make sure you get what you need and give yourself options..

, Even though you’ll enter the shoot with an outline, don’t create such a stringent plan that you feel unable to waver from it. If you start the shoot thinking you’re going to capture a series of images that show a day of work in an office, and you end up seeing one specific employee who seems to be doing something interesting, don’t hesitate to follow them instead. Odds are, if you think this is the really interesting part of the shoot, your viewers will think so too., The first step in organizing your essay is to get rid of unnecessary images. Delete photos that are blurry, unfocused, or overexposed. Take out any images that don’t seem to capture a part of the story you want the essay to tell. You may not necessarily want to delete these photos, as they may come in handy later, or you may change your mind. The goal is to limit the number of images you’re working with to the ones that best tell your story., Find the picture that best summarizes your story. Think about it as the image on the cover of a book. It doesn’t tell the whole story, but it should provide a good idea what the book is about. Your focus or signature image should convey your main goal in creating the essay. Do this in a way that will draw your potential viewers’ eyes and create immediate interest in the story.


If you’re doing a day in the life photo essay about a frustrated person working in an office, an image of that person struggling to open the front door against the wind might be an apt focus shot.
If your essay is about the process of building a home, your focus image may be something like a contractor and architect looking at blue prints with the framed up home in the background.
If your essay is about a family reunion, the focus image may be a funny shot of the whole family making faces, pretending to be fighting, or a serious photo of the family posed together. Capture whatever seems natural for the family., Once you’ve excluded unusable or unnecessary photos and selected your focus image, sort the remaining photos for easy access. Many photographers sort the photos by the type of image (close ups, interactions, portraits, etc.), and others choose to sort their photos based on the organization of the essay. The purpose of this step is to make it easy for you to find specific images, so use whatever categories make sense to you., Once the photos are sorted, choose an image that specifically fits every part of your essay. You can design your essay in any number of ways. Some of the most common narrative choices include day in the life, how to, and progression (showing how your subject changes over time). For thematic essays, you have many more options. However, most thematic essays begin with a big picture shot, narrow in to show specific examples of the theme, and zoom back out to provide a clincher image that sums up the big idea.


Regardless of essay type, you’ll need a focus image to grab attention.
Use an overall shot to give context to your essay. Where is it, when is it happening, who’s involved, what’s going on, and why should someone be interested? The five “W’s” of journalism are a great way to determine what your overall shot should capture.
Find your final image. This should be something provocative that asks your viewer to think about the topic.
Between the focus and overall shot and ending image, include a series of images that move the viewer from the lead-in shots to its result. Use images that build in intensity or draw the viewers further into the essay., Once you have the images you like in an order you think tells the story, ask a friend or fellow photographer to take a look. Don’t tell them what the purpose of the essay is or provide them with any of the text. Just let them look at the photos and the order and let them tell you what they’re seeing.


If the images aren’t telling the story, ask your friends to look at your other photos and ask, “I wanted this image to make this point. You got a different idea. Would any of these images make this point to you more clearly?”
If the others like the images you’ve chosen, you may still want to ask them to look at your other photos and tell you if they think any of the images you didn’t include should be added in. They may see something you missed., Your final step should be adding text. Doing this last helps prevent the tendency to explain the essay in words instead of relying on your photos. There are three main ways to use text within a photo essay. You can add images to support a written essay, you can add captions to images, or you can limit text to a title and a few introductory or concluding words. Whatever choice you make, it’s important that the photos themselves can tell the same story as the written essay.


If you're commissioned to add photos to an essay, you should make sure images reflect the written word, but also add emotion and context the writing could not capture. For example, an essay on poverty may include an image of a child and parent living on the street could capture more emotional context.
Captions should only include information the viewer could not derive from the photo itself. For instance, you can include a date, the subject’s name, or a statistic relevant to your subject in the caption.
If you choose not to have any text or just a title and some introductory and/or closing words, make sure you convey all necessary information succinctly."

Relax.",How to Look Thinner in Photographs," If you know you're going to be photographed, then you should try to wear clothes that are naturally thinning and flattering. Clothes that are all one color, especially if they are of a darker color, tend to make you look more slender. Pick something that fits well; if it's too tight, the photos can have unflattering bulges, and if it's one of those loose, trendy garments, it may look flowy and awesome in person, but it could actually make you look larger than you really are. Here are some other ways to wear clothes that naturally make you look thinner than reality:


Avoid horizontal stripes, as they are known for making people look larger than they really are. Opt for vertical stripes, which are slimming, instead.
Don't wear clothes with elaborate details around your problem areas. If you have a dress with elaborate details around the stomach area and that's the part you want to hide, this will only emphasize the area further. In general, patterned clothes tend to make people look bigger than solid colors.
If you really want to go all out and know you'll be photographed, wearing some shapewear won't hurt.
Women should wear high heels, as they can make them look even thinner.;
, Being photographed from below can make you look like you have a double chin, make you look shorter than you really are, and can just generally make you look heavier. When you're being photographed, make sure the camera is at least at eye-level, if not even higher. Being shot from below can add up to 50 pounds to your look!

, Ladies, if you’re standing, strike a red carpet pose by turning a bit sideways and putting one leg in front of the other, toe pointed at the camera and knee slightly bent. Shift your weight to the back leg. If you're not facing the camera head-on, it'll actually make for a more flattering angle, because it'll add dimension to your body.

, To avoid the dreaded double chin, tilt your chin a bit upward. You can slightly elongate your neck, too, as long as you don't look like you're searching for something. This can help you look longer and thinner. Just make sure you practice this technique beforehand so you don't look like you're trying too hard, or like you're not being yourself. You can also move your head slightly forward so you're not pulling it back and creating a double chin.

, Position your arms so that they are away from your body. Placing one on a hip is a good look, because it helps define your waistline. If you keep your arms at your sides, it can make you look boxy, and can smush your non-existent arm fat, making your arms look bigger than they really are. If you think that having one hand on your hip is a bit too dramatic, then you can keep your arms at your sides, but place them a bit away from your waist and body, so they aren't flatted against your sides.

, Stand up straight, pull your shoulders back, and suck your stomach in and up, like you’re trying to zip up a tight pair of jeans. If you really want to suck in your stomach, you have to make sure to do it subtly, so that people don't notice your ribs poking out in the photo. It's better to look a little heavier than you want in a photo than for someone to say, ""She sucked in!"" Just maintaining good posture can go a long way in making you look tall, more confident, and more thin.

, For defined legs, bend your knees slightly, wear heels, or tighten your quadriceps (the large muscle on top of your thigh). If you're sitting down in a photo, you should cross your ankles to make your thighs look smaller.

, Though saying cheese in photos can be fun and cute (if you're a fifth grader at a birthday party), it will also give you chipmunk cheeks because your smile will be exaggerated. Instead, go for a normal, natural smile. You can even try pressing your tongue to the roof of your mouth to make your face look a bit thinner than it really is.


If it doesn't feel silly, you can even do the model technique and turn a bit away from the camera before it goes off; then, turn toward the camera and smile just as your picture is taken. This will make your smile look less flat and more natural.

, The closer you are to the camera, the bigger you will look in comparison to everyone else. If you want to look thinner and smaller, you should try to be further away from the camera. However, if the camera is centered and you're standing in a line of people in a row, like if you're posing for prom, then you should try to get as close to the center of the group as you can. People on the ends of rows look bigger.

, If you're taking photos while facing the sun, this will make you squint and will make your face look larger than it really is. Try to get your photo taken away from direct sunlight so your expression doesn't have to alter.

, Though you don't need to get a fake tan, spending some time in the sun (while not taking photos directly in it!) can help your skin take on a darker hue and can keep you from looking washed out in photos. Photos tend to make people look a bit washed out already, with the edges of their bodies looking a bit blurry and ill-defined, and getting a tan can help you have a more defined figure.

, Though putting your hair halfway up or up in a loose bun can help elongate your neck and can make you look thinner, if you have your hair in a really tight bun or ponytail, it can make your face and neck look a bit severe, which will create harsh angles that make your face and upper body look larger than they really are. If you have even a few strands of hair around your face, this can create a nice, soft look that can make you look thinner.

, When the time comes, just smile and relax instead of worrying how thin you'll look in the photo. If you're too anxious about this, your face and body may look strained or unnatural. If you want to look like your best, thinnest self, then it's important to relax when the time comes to say cheese -- even if you don't actually say it!

, Turn your body slightly to the side by putting one leg in front of the other. This allows you to show your face and body in a semi-profile, which is very flattering.

, You've probably been told to say ""cheese"", but this can often make a smile look like a grimace. For a natural, gentle smile that is easy to maintain, push your tongue against the back of your top teeth. Don't just smile with your mouth, smile with your eyes too.

, Don't stare directly at the camera, as this may result in your eyes looking red in the photo.

, Imagine you are looking at a friend to give yourself a friendly expression in the photo.

, Just before the photo is taken, take a deep breath and let it out. Don't hunch, shake your limbs loose a little so you don't look stiff.

, Make sure your hair is how you like it and there's nothing stuck in your teeth., Often the photos you want to look best in are those taken of formal occasions such as proms, weddings, 16 Birthday Parties, etc. Take notice of what the photographer says, they want everyone in a shot to look best so do as you are told. If you want to look best in a photo where you are not the main subject, do as the photographer tells the bride, birthday boy or whoever is the main subject so that you look best, not them, if you want., Perfect your best smile and be ready to give it whenever you are being photographed. Try posing and taking selfies in different light conditions so you know how to look best in sunlight, dim light etc., Be ready to look best in photos by always being best dressed. It might be easier for you to look best in a flattering shirt and nice pants and shoes if everyone else is wearing tee-shirts, jeans and sneakers."

Stick your chin out.,
Try not to blink.,
Highlight your eyes and cheeks.,
Smile!",How to Look Good in Photos1," No one looks good with a double chin. To make it less likely you will have a double chin in photos, stretch your neck out, and push your face forward slightly in the photo.To do this, stick your chin and then tilt your head forward. This should reduce the chances you end up with a double chin in photos, as it creates a slimming effect.Imagine that there is a string pulling your nose up to create a more refined jaw line.;
, We’ve all been there. The second the camera clicks, you blink, ruining the photo! There is a strategy you can use to reduce the chances this will occur.


Asking the photographer to count to three before he or she takes the photograph will help you time this right.Close your eyes fully right before the photo is taken. Open them slowly, just before the camera clicks.

, It’s a good idea to make your eyes the focal point of any photo. The more you highlight the eyes, the better many people will consider the photo. Defining your cheeks can make a big difference too.


If you are female, use mascara on your eye lashes, and curl them, or apply false eyelashes. This will open up your eyes and dramatize them.
Filling in your eyebrows with a slightly darker brow pencil will also emphasize your eyes. Remember that people’s features often look lighter in pictures than they do in real life. Apply your makeup in natural light, though, to make sure it looks good and also use primer.To highlight the cheekbones, apply blush and bronzer. Put the blush on the apple of your cheek, and put the bronzer around the outside of your face as well as on your cheekbones., People are attracted to radiant smiles. It makes them feel better, and so they are more likely to respond positively to your photograph.


To make your smile more natural, take a deep breath, and exhale right before the photo. Keep your jaw open, and make sure not to clench it so you look more relaxed.You can also put your tongue behind your teeth when you smile to increase the natural look.Get someone to tell you a joke, and then have the photographer snap your reaction."

Study past photos.,
Strike the right facial angle.,
Use the red carpet pose.,
Position the camera above you.,
Figure out your “best side.” Most people have a better side, especially of their face.",How to Look Good in Photos2," Look at random pictures of yourself. Is there a certain pose you tend to stand in? Is there an angle that looks best on you?


Try to spot patterns. Which angles, smiles, positioning looks best? Replicate it the next time your photo is taken.
Models and professional photographers often use very precise angles. They study what works for a particular person in photographs and what doesn't. Don't just shoot randomly.

, It’s rarely a good choice to face the camera straight on, unless you have a large nose.


Turn your head to a three-quarter position or a 45-degree angle. This will give your features more depth.
If you have a very large nose, though, you might want to look at the camera straight on, as that pose will reduce the size of your nose in pictures., Celebrities have mastered the art of looking slimmer through a red-carpet pose. This look creates a diagonal line and elongates the body.


To replicate this, put one hand on your hip and angle your body to the side. Now, turn your head towards the camera. Celebrities will do this pose two ways. Either they will put their left hand on their hip and left leg out, or they will put the right leg out with both hands on their hips.
Some experts say this pose will give you an automatic “tummy tuck” in pictures. It’s an immediate slimming effect.Facing straight forward makes the body look wider.

, It is more flattering if you are photographed with a camera positioned above you. This will create a slimming effect, and it will give the illusion that your eyes are bigger.


If the person holding the camera is shorter than you are, sit down when they take the photo to create the downward angle.
If you’re taking a selfie, hold the camera slightly above your head, and tilt it at a downward angle. If someone (say a child wielding a camera) shoots you from below, you’ll look overweight and like you have a major double chin (even if you really don’t). That’s almost no one’s most flattering angle.

, Few people’s faces are exactly symmetrical. The differences often derive from the side of the face a person sleeps on or which side is exposed more to the sun.


Figure out which side of your face looks younger and photographs better. Do this by studying many photos of yourself. Then try to position your face in photos to highlight your better side. The side of your face that is stronger, more structured, and more defined is usually the side that is “best.”One study found that most people’s left sides are their “best side.” Research has found that highlighting the left cheek creates a more positive emotional response in surveys."

Choose a location.,
Interact with your landscape.,
Know your model.,
Go for a variety of images.,
Do the unexpected.,
Quantity, go big or go home.,
Don't forget that photography is an art.",How to Have a Successful Outdoor Photoshoot," Try to find someplace outside that has a background that is interesting, but won't distract too much from your model. You can go for an urban theme in a cityscape, or more of a more natural landscape in a field or a wooded area.;
, Indoor photos can often be dull because a model stands against a flat, solid colored surface, but in nature you have the whole world around you to utilize. Pick a flower, stomp in a puddle, throw a handful of leaves or snow into the air. The world is your playground, use it!

, This is especially true if you are conducting the photoshoot with a friend or family member. If the person is a naturally bubbly, don't make them look too serious. Avoid forcing anything, let poses and facial expressions come naturally.

, Take pictures from far away, or so close you see only half of the face, from high above, or a worm's eye from the ground looking up. Mix things up so you and your model don't get stuck in a trance of repetitive, boring, unoriginal photos.

, Break beyond the tradition of a standing straight up with a full smile and facing the photographer. Take shots in action like when your model is laughing or running. Remember that the model doesn't always need to face the camera, they can be looking at something else or nostalgically staring into the distance.

, Take multiple shots that are similar, there is nothing more frustrating than coming home and finding out your coolest potential photo didn't focus. Take more pictures than you might think you need, because maybe that one last picture of the day will turn out to be your star snapshot.

, It doesn't have to be perfect, sometimes an odd quirk makes a picture stand out from the rest! Trial and error are the best ways to improve, remember that just like any skill practice yields progress.

Relax and trust your instincts.,
Thank the person.",How to Get Someone to Take Your Photo," Make it as easy as you can for your potential photographer.;
, Some people to look for are:


Families (not the ones that are over-burdened with lots of luggage or children). There is a good chance that they are taking photos themselves and won't be lost when you hand them a camera.
Someone that isn't rushing by. Definitely don't stop someone in a hurry to take your image. They probably won't appreciate it.
Somebody that has just taken a photo themselves. You will know for certain that they know something about a camera.

Ultimately, you want someone who has an idea which end of the camera to use.



, Don't just walk up to your camera and hand it to them. One, you might lose it that way, and two, it's rude. If they aren't interested in you and are avoiding meeting your eyes, then they most likely won't be interested in shooting your photograph.

, ""Will you please take my picture?"" is a good way. Simple and succinct. If the person doesn't appear to speak your language, try asking silently.


One way would be raising your eyebrow in question and raising the camera and point to yourself.

, Being tense because your camera is in someone else's hands will ruin the shot.

, Be sure to show your appreciation.

Lift your hair at the crown.,
Master group shots.,
Say “money” not “cheese.” The reason you want to say “money” instead of cheese is that it forms your mouth into a more flattering position.,
Dress right for photographs.,
Stand before a white wall.,
Use natural lighting but at dusk or on a cloudy day.,
Avoid taking photos after drinking.,
Use a free photo enhancement site online.",How to Look Good in Photos3," Photographs can make your hair look thinner than it looks in real life. One way to fix this is to give your hair some lift at the crown.


Dig your fingers into the crown of your hair right before the photo, and scrunch the hair. It will make your hair look less like you have a “helmet head,” too.
Back comb the hair at the crown of your head, and use a little hairspray on it when styling your hair for a photo. Use a curling iron to curl back a piece of hair at the crown.

, Where you stand in group shots can make a big difference when it comes to how you will look.


Try not to stand directly next to a person who is much slimmer than you are. Props or other people’s bodies can hide body parts that you don’t particularly like (the stomach, the arms). Cinch your waist with your hands. Put one hand on either side of your waist but position the hands so they face inward several inches.
Do not be the person who stands closest to the camera because that is likely to make you appear even bigger than you are, especially if everyone else is standing at the same length from the camera. If you’re a lot shorter than someone else in the photo, try not to pose alongside a frame of reference (meaning something we all generally know the height of, such as a mailbox).

,


Money is a stronger sound, and it will turn the corners of your mouth upward. This will create a genuine looking smile.
The problem with the word ""cheese"" is that it turns the corners of your mouth downward, creating a poor angle.

, What you wear in a photo can make a big difference between whether you will look your best or not.


If more of your legs are visible in the photograph, such as by wearing a short skirt, they will look longer. Swimsuits cut high at the hip and skinny jeans with flare bottoms also create the illusion of longer legs.
Patterns can be very distracting in photos. Blue and red photograph well; there is a reason politicians often use them!Sleeves will keep the focus on your face, not your arms. Fitted clothing usually looks better in photographs than baggy clothing does. Collared shirts are nice for framing the face.

, If you have a light-colored backdrop, your face will look brighter.


This also helps the camera’s automatic settings settle on a good color balance, so it means your skin won’t look too yellow or pink in the final photo.
Take a lot of pictures. Very few people look good in pictures all of the time. So if you take more of them – many of them – you can choose the ones in which you look best.

, You want soft light to hit your face from the side, so it’s a good idea to position yourself facing a window or other natural light source.


It’s a good idea to take pictures when the sun starts to set. If you pose for a photograph when the sun is at its height, the downward sunlight will create bags under your eyes and highlight other facial imperfections.
You will look younger at dusk because the light brightens up the area under your eyes, making you look younger overall. Light is also more diffused on cloudy days, so it will lessen the lines on your face. Similarly, you could use your camera’s flash in sunlight because it will even out skin tone and create a brighter effect that is more flattering.

, It’s not a great idea to have your photo snapped after you’ve had a few glasses of wine or other alcohol.


The reason for this is that alcohol can make your eyes look droopy, in addition to causing other issues (your makeup may have started to run, and so on).
The bottom line: almost no one is at their best in photos after a couple of drinks, so avoid it., There are many sites that will allow you to upload and improve on a photo. Be careful! You want to make subtle changes, so they are not obvious.


Putting a filter on the photo or slightly boosting its brightness can even out your skin and even make your eyes look brighter.
Crop the photo to highlight the parts that look better. Boosting the color and saturation of the photo can give your skin a slightly brighter hue. You'll be amazed at the difference a little enhancement can make.

First open your digital editing program of choice.,

Always look directly at the top of the camera.,
Stand as straight as you can and keep your chin up.,
Avoid direct angles, instead coming in from above, below, or slightly to the side with the camera.,
Consider squinting slightly to exude confidence.,
Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and open them right before the camera clicks.",How to Look Good in a Photo1," Looking straight into the lens is preferable, but if this feels awkward than you should look right above the lens. Aim your gaze at the photographers forehead or eyebrow, which will naturally show off your eyes and keep everything lined up.;
, Good standing posture is also good photo posture. Pull your shoulders back slightly and tilt your chin up. If you are sitting, press your knees together, and hold your hands together. Again, sit tall with your shoulders back and chin up. Keeping your shoulders relaxed and back will open up your body invitingly and make the rest of your posture easy.


For your chin, think of slightly pressing your forehead to the camera -- this brings your chin up and out attractively., When you shoot a photo straight on, your face loses all definition and depth. Instead, have the shot framed from a slight angle by turning your head or moving the camera. A good rule of thumb is to make sure your chin or jawline is always defined, not lost in the photo, which can make you look a bit like a thumb.


Don't face your hips right at the camera -- instead, set yourself up and turn your shoulders slightly towards the photographer.
Shorter subjects should ask to be shot at a slightly upward angle, and taller subjects might like a higher angle.

, The trick, according to many portrait photographers, is the squint from the lower eyelids only. Keep it subtle, and this little trick can liven up your expression for any photograph, from serious to silly. Remember that good smiles spread across your whole face, including your eyes, and working on this will make you seem much more genuine and attractive., This little trick is a favorite of photographers everywhere, as it usually calms the subject down and brings out their best side right as the eyes open. If you've been taking pictures for a while, or just feel tense and nervous, use this little mini-meditation to calm everything down and get a great, natural expression."

Make sure you know what you will be wearing beforehand.,
Look good, but don't overdo it.,
Don't come hungry!,
Once you arrive, try to take in as much of the studio or location as you can.,
Be sure to let the photographer know if there is anything about your body that you feel uncomfortable with.,
Try to think about something else.,

Don't just do all of your photos smiling, try some different expressions.,
When you are getting headshots, make sure you do them for at least one full hour.,
Have fun!,
Just let yourself go and be as natural as possible, and your images will turn out great.

",How to Get Good Headshots," Ask the photographer if he or she has any suggestions, but make sure that you don't let them control what you wear. You want to feel comfortable! Sometimes, higher end photographers may have a wardrobe stylist to assist you on the day of the shoot.;
, Too many actors try to come up with something that makes them look really good (clothing AND makeup), but they forget the key point about the whole thing: you want to be yourself. They come to the headshot session wearing these brand new clothes that make them feel slightly out of their comfort zone, and it shows in their photographs.

, Too many actors forget to eat on the big day and wind up feeling more uncomfortable because their belly hurts. I usually suggest eating something right before heading to the session, especially if it is planned to last a few hours.

, Study the layout and the equipment, just as you would arriving in a new theater for an audition or on a film set. Thinking about things like this can get your mind out of worrying whether or not your headshots (that you are paying over $100 for) will come out good.

, If you don't tell him that you feel uncomfortable with the big pimple on your face, you might look more uncomfortable in the pictures than if you had told him about it and he said not to worry, reassuring you that he can remove it in Photoshop (putting you at ease).

, Don't think about trying to look good for the camera. Even though you might get some good pictures by smiling at the camera and acting for it, it will show in the pictures that you only look two dimensional. You have to show that you have the third dimension to your character and self. You want the casting director looking at your photo to see something different about you, something that makes him stop and think. He needs to see that there is more to you than just a face smiling for the camera.

, But sometimes, if you can't afford to pay upwards of $200, you will have to make do with a more inexperienced photographer, one who might not be as good at getting you smiling. Just try thinking about some happy or very funny memories while you look into the camera. It will get you smiling and bring out that third dimension right away.

, Try to make even the photographer laugh! If you can get the photographer laughing (or another emotion) from your expressions, chances are you'll get a winner headshot. The photographer is the first person seeing the images, and you'll be able to tell right then and there how a third party will react when seeing your headshot. If you try to bring out emotions from the photographer, chances are you will become much more comfortable with him and having your pictures taken, and it will show.

, The first half hour will probably be spent getting to know the photographer, and you will still be uncomfortable in those pictures. As time goes on, however, you'll become much more comfortable with the situation, and the pictures will get better and better.

, Stay relaxed and don't think too much about it. The key is to show the casting director who is looking at your headshot that taking headshots is not the only thing you do. You are a three dimensional person who is completely comfortable with yourself in any situation, and can give them what they need in a performance.

Before you even step anywhere near the camera, give yourself a once-over.,
Avoid wearing bright, outlandish, or crazy patterns unless you're certain they photograph well.,
Dry off any ""shine"" caused by moisture.,
Choose a regular, slightly calm background area.,
Find your good side.",How to Look Good in a Photo2," Make sure there is nothing stuck between your teeth, that your hair is decent, and if you are wearing make-up, make sure that it's fresh and not running, bleeding or caking. Simply checking yourself out before stepping into the frame can save most issues before they crop up.

, Solid colors, usually neutrals (pastels, tans, grays, etc.), are almost always your safest bet. Stripes, patterns, and very bright colors often cast off unattractive glares and can draw the eye away from you. Stick to neutral colors, blacks, and whites if you want to be sure you'll come out looking good.


Clothes that fit well are imperative as well. If it doesn't fit your body type, the clothing will minimize your most attractive features., Use a towel or, with nothing else, your sleeve to pat down your face. Moisture will pick up light, leading to an unattractive shine on your face. If you're going to be taking pictures professionally, consider getting some matte gel, a simply photographers tube that minimizes shine and glare on your skin. Simply add it lightly in any areas that are shining in the photo.

, You don't want a ton of stuff happening in the background unless you're a talented enough photographer to balance the background or take it out of focus. You're much better with simple backgrounds, especially those that make you ""pop."" A little bit of contrast is perfect (like a light background when wearing darker clothes) to make sure you stand out., Yes, everyone actually does have a ""good side,"" and you can find it easily by going through some old pictures. There is nothing scientific about this, so just chose the side you like best. Humans have natural variability, and you should decide what side you like best represented. If you're still unsure, talk to a trusted friend -- one you know will tell it to your straight and honestly which side looks best.

Keep the lighting source in front of you, not behind.,
Remember the ""rule of thirds"" whenever possible to stage professional photos easily.,
Check that your face is in focus after the pictures are taken.,
Take twenty photos in order to get at least one good one.,
Know that even the best photos generally need a little touch-up on the computer.",How to Look Good in a Photo3," Once of the most common mistakes young photographers make is that they leave the light -- whether it's the sun, a lamp, or a window, behind their subjects (ie, you). This will lead to washout at best and overly dark, under-lit faces at worst. If your photographer has most of the light shining on your back, turn them around and get the light to come from the front or side for better shots every time.


Natural lighting is almost always best, and avoid the flash at all costs.
Turn on more lights as necessary-- good photography requires good lighting., The rule of threes is the most basic photo composition trick in the book, but it never gets old. Simply imagine that the photo is cut into thirds both vertically and horizontally, so that there are two lines coming in each direction to break the frame up. The rule of thirds says that the most interesting elements should be roughly on these lines.


This even works for close-up portraits: keep your eye line on the top third line, and your face over to one side for a more compelling shot.The horizon, or a similar background line, usually looks best along the bottom third line.
If you're somewhere with a great background, place yourself on one of the thirds to the sides, using the other two-thirds of the frame to fill with your background., ""Focus"" determines whether or not you are blurry, and bad focus can ruin even the best-staged photographs. If you're asking a friend to take pictures for you, ask them to pay attention to your eyes and face. If this is in focus, the rest of the picture will come together around it.


Most cameras have an auto-focus mode that will solve any issues. You simply hold the button halfway down and it will find focus. Press all the way to get the shot off.

, If you're taking headshots, promotional materials, or just want to be sure you'll get one perfect shot, you should take a lot of photos. Even if the shot looks good on the camera screen, you never know if some issues will show up once you load it onto a big computer. Keep the camera snapping to ensure you get at least a few great shots to work with., There are some people who argue that any photo editing is ""cheating,"" but this ignores the history and art of photography. Before computers, photographers used different developing techniques and chemicals to adjust brightness, contrast, and color, which is exactly what you should be doing on your computer to look the best you possibly can. Be sure to look up basic tutorials online if confused -- there is a lot of specific information out there for editors.


Use brightness and contrast to ensure strong, deep shadows and gentle, natural highlights.
Touch up the saturation to add or subtract some of the color vibrancy -- it usually wants to be kicked up a few points.
Play with some of the oranges and reds in Color Balance to bring out a rosier skin color. If the camera catches your skin as slightly flat or pasty, bring in a little extra red or orange. Of course, you can also use this to remove reds when needed."

Recognize and report child pornography.,
Understand about other types of pornography.,
Look at aspects of the picture such as posture, lighting or setting.,
Understand what ""sexting"" is.,
Find out more about nudism.,
Know that nudism isn't a reason to send explicit images to others without their consent.,
Talk to people about nudism.",How to Distinguish Nudism from Pornography," Any images that show a child under the legal age in your country fully unclothed or partially clothed, in a sexual manner or for a sexual purpose, or acting out sexually for any purpose, are called child pornography and are illegal. If you find illegal images of children, whether on the internet or not, you need to contact the police. Child pornography is illegal because it is a crime and harms all children. It also distorts people's views on what is acceptable and what isn't.


It is a widespread misconception that ALL images of a minor child naked constitute child pornography. For instance, it is legal for parents to take innocent pictures of their children in the bathtub, or innocently playing around the house or back yard naked; nudist magazines often feature pictures of nudist families with children; and children can even pose nude for bona-fide artistic purposes (e.g. ""Bodies and Souls, The Century Project"" a photography book by Frank Cordelle), provided that there is no lewd or predatory intent, and parental consent and supervision is given. It's also clearly not a crime to paint pictures of little cupids or cherubs naked.
However, it is true that all images of a child engaged in sexual activity are child pornography and are illegal without exception.;
, The most common type of pornography is images or videos of two or more people engaging in sexual contact. These images and videos are only for people who are over the legal age to watch. People typically view pornography for reasons including sexual arousal.

, In pornographic pictures, the photographer often uses subtle moves to the viewer such as adjusting the lighting or the scenery in a sexually provocative way. For example, a harsh garish glow will be used, or the subject will be posed on a bed or in a bedroom. Often, the subject will also take a provocative pose, the camera will be focussed on a sensitive body part, or the subject will have a lascivious, luring facial expression, or be wearing lipstick, even if they're not explicitly taking part in sexual activity. Nudist photos will invariably lack all of these aspects, and instead portray people simply interacting and living their lives in a natural way., Sexting is the sharing of sexually explicit photos, typically done using mobile phones, but it can be done using any type of device that allows you to take and send pictures to another device. There are many reasons why people might send photos like this to each other. They might join in, because they think 'everyone else is doing it', or it might be a way of exploring their sexual identity. It might also be a way that they meet new people online.


Sexting is illegal if:

A young person takes an explicit photo or video (of themselves or a friend), or;
Anyone possessing explicit images of a child, or sharing an explicit image of a child.


Sexting isn't a good idea because you can't be sure that the person won't show anyone else your image, even if you think you trust them.

, Nudism is when a person chooses to be unclothed for reasons that don't typically include sexual arousal/contact. Nudism is the act of being naked, whereas naturism is lifestyle embraced for reasons such as nature, environment, comfort, and lots of other things. Most nudists (or naturists) don't choose to be unclothed for sexual reasons, and this is the prime difference between nudity and pornography.

, Even if you don't think the image/video is explicit, you should always check with the person on the receiving end of the media before sending anything that could possibly be classed as inappropriate. Nudism is not an excuse to cross others boundaries.


To avoid any misunderstanding, you could first explain to the person that you're a nudist, and explain that nudism is not a sexual lifestyle. Introducing yourself as a nudist should not involve sending a picture.

, Keep the lines of communication open, even if there isn't a problem, because if one occurs then it's easier to talk about it. Keep the general rules of pornography in mind (i.e. don't send anything illegal; if you receive something of that nature or find it on the internet, always tell someone you trust for safety reasons).

, Only place this foundation where you think it is needed, such as over pimples or on the sides of your nose, etc. Avoid caking your whole face in it.








, A shiny face will reflect poorly in the camera and you won't look your best. To avoid too shiny a face, use matte-formula makeup to cover blemishes. For your eye area, use a creamy concealer with reflective qualities.









Avoid any foundation or other makeup containing titanium dioxide if flash photography is likely (it is a commonly used sunscreen in makeup). The shielding effect of the titanium dioxide on your face will make your face appear washed out and mask-like.

, Place blush on the apple part of your cheeks and some glossy lipstick to highlight lips. If you want longer lashes, consider adding false ones.









Avoid too much contouring; this can result in a washed-out look. Be sure to balance the look though - either eyes or lips should be the focus, not both.Blush should be contoured to ensure skeletal detail is brought out in the photo.

, Lashes tend to look a little bare and sparse on the camera. Give yourself an advantage by using the mascara wand to apply mascara. Comb out your lashes with the mascara wand with a wiggling motion. Open your mouth and apply the mascara in a windshield wiping motion for length. Make sure your lashes aren't clumped and spidery, the camera picks up every detail.








, Avoid pastels as these will wash you out. Colors the camera loves in makeup include reds, charcoal,emerald greens, golds and chocolate brown. Beige, tans and dusty shades do show up on the camera well. Anything that is rich and deep in color should look good in a photo.








, Unless you have the best editing team in the world, there is no way you can touch up chapped cracked lips in a photo. Warm your lips up with a washrag and apply any type of oil to your lips and buff away with a washcloth. Apply a nice layer of chap-stick to your lips to give them the dazzle they need.








, To add life to your face, swipe a highlight pencil(shimmery not glittery unless you want to look like fairy) under the arch your brow and blend it in with a brush or finger. Highlighting the inner corners of your eyes can help them look brighter and large. Draw a light line down the center of your nose and blend to define it for that shimmering glow.








, Swish with hydrogen peroxide, to give your teeth a healthy nice glow. You can also use lemons or baking soda for a all natural teeth whitener if you do not have any around. Remember not to get lipstick on your teeth and stay away from lipsticks that make your teeth look yellow.








, That way you be reassured that it's in good condition or you can quickly touch up anything not quite right.









For important events, such as a wedding, a career portfolio, a long-lasting family portrait, etc., seriously consider having professional makeup done. Explain to the makeup artist what the event is so that they can choose a look with you that suits the type of event.

Provide great customer service .",How to Become a Professional Wedding Photographer," Some things to consider when starting out. What makes your images unique, for example, are your images more of a photo-journalistic style capturing candid moments, and working in all natural light? or do you enjoy working with off camera flash in a studio like setting. Always be true to yourself, find your own creative style. If you perfect your skills in a certain style of photography you're passionate about this is the best way to building confidence in yourself. Practice on friends and family, but don't take their word for how good your work is as naturally they are going to be bias. The average customer you will get as a wedding photographer is going to be more critical about your work.;
, You might be wondering how to get exposure out in the field? You currently have no portfolio to show potential clients, and no experience dealing with new clients. From my experience, one of the best ways to start out in the Wedding Photography business and start building your portfolio is to find work as an assistant or second shooter for an already established photographer or studio. This is the best way gain confidence, and get first hand experience not just for producing some great images, but also customer service and learn how to direct a shoot. Even at this early stage you should always carry a backup camera. I wouldn't recommend taking on a friends wedding as the main photographer, this is way to much of a responsibility, even if you think you are well prepared. Its their special day and shouldn't be time for you to practice wedding photography.

, Know that you're good, but also know where there is room for improvement. Rather than trying to compete with a million other wedding photographers out there, set yourself a personal high standard. If you're not at the level you need to be at, find a photographers work that you admire, research what makes them successful, understand the quality of work they have to offer and know what's involved in producing it. Forget about the rest, there are a lot of ordinary photographers out there too. Remember you need to aim high. Research what you need to get to that high level. You can never spend enough time researching new photographic methods and the latest equipment on the market. Always use your camera in manual mode, know your equipment like the back of your hand. This will give you the confidence and practical skill that you will need as a professional.

, Spend plenty of time using Lightroom and Photoshop, buy photography magazines, watch tutorials online, you can educate yourself, as everything you need for honing your photographic skills is online. I've always thought that if you do a course in photography, you are only ever going to be as good as the person that teaches you, their technique is not necessarily the best, teaching yourself builds more confidence, you are learning your own style not someone else's!

, After gaining some experience as a second shooter, and have your own portfolio, you might be thinking that your ready to begin your own business, remember not to don't rush into it. Try to save as much money as you can from your assisting work to go towards advertising your business. If you have enough work on as a paid second shooter you can think about advertising your business locally and online, and see what kind of response you get. If you have a good contact that you are assisting for that has plenty of work, I wouldn't recommend moving on to your own business until you are close to fully booked for a year.

, When setting your prices an important factor is knowing your value. don't set your prices too low, people will second guess your quality, even if you do great work, they will perceive it differently. Of course don't charge too much either if you are just starting out, you don't want to lose clients because you're too expensive! I find smack bang in the middle is a good option. That way clients won't second guess your prices. If they like your work enough they normally have a set budget for their wedding photography, and they'll hire you. The average for photographic coverage with all images in high-resolution on a disk is $2500, this doesn't include an album, but with the disk they can print as many photos as they like for their own personal use, and perhaps create their own album.

, Establish a relationship with a local print lab learn about the proper conversion of files from digital to print, get some test prints done and figure out what type of finish best displays your work.Look in to wedding album suppliers, and have some ideas for when a client requests an album, getting a sample album made up is a good option, you can take this or an iPad with you to show clients your portfolio.

, Make sure you have a logo, and business email, its these finishing touches that make a big difference in how you present your business. When running your own wedding photography business, start locally. Pick an area and start advertising with local business linked to weddings. That includes: Dress makers, Cake makers, limo drivers, wedding planners, wedding venues etc.Get some quality business cards and brochures made up to give to them. A good idea is to offer a finders fee for any referrals. 10-20% is a good amount. This will mean that they will be actively promoting you by passing on your business cards, and brochures and recommending your work to new customers looking for photographers.

, After registering your business, you should be promoting your own website online. A great way is doing some SEO - search engine optimization, again, this takes a lot of time and research, but you will reap the rewards if you put the hard work in. There are great tools online that will scan your website for keywords, meta titles and tags, this is how people find your website. If you don't promote it online, you will not have a presence. People will never see your work. Pick only your best images to display online. Photomerchant.net offers some great web templates specific to a professional photographers needs with pages in HTML format which you need for optimizing your site. Make sure you monitor your site online using google analytics and web master tools. If its not performing as well as you'd hoped, you can do tweak as necessary by doing more SEO.

, There are plenty of wedding photography business listings online that are worthwhile to sign up to, a lot are free, and some can charge $100 or more per month, most of the time their reasoning behind charging that much money is because they get so many views per month. Check compete.com, this shows how popular their site is and then maybe you can possibly trial them for a month and see if you get any leads.

, A very important aspect of being a wedding photographer is your customer service skill, always be on the ball and be very clear with your clients, don't wait to long to reply to their emails, and keep them unto date with what's happening by confirming their payments, and delivering contracts to them.Its very fulfilling when you start your business from scratch. Your images should speak for themselves when it comes to marketing yourself, but with wedding photography producing great images is 50% and the other 50% is great customer service. If they loved working with you they are going to pass on the good word to their friends and family. Do your job well, and you will find most of your work is in referrals.

Fit a battery, if one is not already fitted.,
Fit the lens.",How to Use a Praktica MTL3 35mm Film Camera1," The cover for the battery is on the underside of the camera.

Put a coin into the slot in the battery cover and turn it anti-clockwise (a British 5-pence coin or an American quarter works fine here). If the camera has not been used for a while, it might require some effort to get undone; be careful to not let the coin slip and round the sides of the slot.


  A British 5-pence coin or American quarter is fine for removing the battery cover.

 Drop a PX625 cell into the hole. Note the + terminal facing upwards.


Re-fit the battery cover. You only need to tighten it just enough that it won't come loose by itself. Don't over-tighten it; you risk the coin slipping and rounding the edges of the slot, which might mean you're unable to remove it.;
,

Remove the body cap, if present, by screwing it anti-clockwise (looking from the front).


 An MTL3 with body cap removed.


Lay the camera on your lap, or on a flat surface, facing upwards, and align the thread of the lens with the thread in the lens mount. Grip the lens gently by the aperture ring or focus ring and start turning gently. Do not apply any downwards pressure; doing this can result in cross-threading the lens mount or the lens.


 Align the thread of the lens with the lens mount and start turning it gently


A few turns after the thread has bitten you can start spinning it faster. Continue turning the lens until it can turn no more, then apply a reasonable amount of force to ensure it has locked fully into place.


 Continue turning until the lens is in place; the numbers on the aperture ring will be facing the top of the camera.


If your lens has a switch with an ""A"" and ""M"" position, set this to the ""A"" position. This will allow you to focus and compose at the widest aperture and you'll only need to stop the lens down briefly to meter.

  Press and hold the battery check button.

Open up the side panel, then press and hold the battery check button (indicated). Don't hit the manual film rewind button, which is right beneath it.




 The battery check here shows three bars, indicating a happy T90.

Check the top LCD. It'll be reading ""BC"". It'll also indicate up to three bars at the bottom (each of them made out of three little bars). If you see two or three, then you're safe. If you see one, you might be good for a roll of film, but it's a good idea to carry some spares with you. If you see none, then you should replace your batteries as soon as possible (though the camera will function perfectly right up until they're totally drained).;
,







Unlatch the battery tray. The latch is on the right hand side of the camera (if you're looking from the back). Flip out the lever then turn the latch anti-clockwise.






Remove the battery tray. The battery tray is a little flimsy, so don't yank it out.




 A loaded battery tray.

Fit the batteries into the battery tray. You'll need four AA batteries for this, either carbon-zinc batteries (cheap ""heavy duty"" ones), alkaline batteries, or Ni-Cds batteries. Canon didn't explicitly mention using Ni-Mh batteries, so do this at your own risk. Make sure you insert them with the + and - terminals of the batteries pointing in the correct direction, as the battery tray indicates.




 Slide your loaded battery tray into the camera.

Reinsert the battery tray. You may find that right at the end, you have to apply a little bit of pressure, holding the battery tray all the way in so that you can latch it. This is normal. Turn the latch clockwise to lock the battery tray in place.

, There are two types of Canon FD lenses, which fit in slightly different ways. Note that in the pictures the red dots are not lined up perfectly as the description suggests they should be; this was to stop the lens plopping off while the picture was being taken, sorry.





 Lenses without locking rings mount just like almost every other SLR lens from other systems.

Lenses without chrome locking rings: These are sometimes called ""New FD"" or ""FD-n"" lenses. Line up the red dot on the lens with the red dot on the camera body. If you're looking at it from the front, grip the aperture ring and turn the lens clockwise until it locks into place (you'll feel, or perhaps hear, a distinct click when it's locked).




 Older FD lenses have a chrome locking ring.

Lenses with chrome locking rings: Line up the red dot on the locking ring with the red dot on the camera body. Gently rotate the locking ring until it's tight enough. These lenses never really lock into place like the New FD lenses (and lenses from almost every other SLR camera system) do. Use your judgment as to what is tight enough, but be careful not to over-tighten it.

, In aperture-priority mode, the aperture is set from the camera, not the aperture ring. You will find that if it's not already on ""A"", you'll have to push a button in order to turn it to the ""A"" position., You don't care what this does, but it's the switch on the right-hand-side (looking from the front) of the lens mount on the camera. If this is pushed in as shown in the picture, push it towards the lens, then release it. (The stopped-down-metering switch does have its uses, in particular for using some non-Canon-FD lenses on the T90, but if you're using Canon FD lenses, you won't need to care about it. This is the primary cause of confusing ""EEEE EEE"" errors.), Open the flap on the side again and look at the switch right at the top, marked ""FINDER"". Turn this to the central position, i.e. the solid circle. This turns on some critical readings in the viewfinder, so you want to leave this on if you're not hopelessly low on battery., This is mostly automatic. All you need to do is this:







Turn on the camera. Put the power switch into the ""A"" position, as indicated in the picture.






Open the back of the camera. The buttons to do this are on the right hand side of the camera (if you're looking at it from the back). Hold down the button marked ""1"" in the picture, while pushing the switch marked ""2"" downwards. The back will pop open.
Drop a film cassette into the chamber on the left. There's only one way that it will fit in, so don't lose sleep over this.

Be very careful not to touch the shutter blades. These are very precise and delicate components. Do not touch them, ever.






Pull out the film leader. Extend it so that the edge of the film leader is at the orange index mark, as shown in the picture. Make sure that the perforations on the film line up with the sprockets just to the left of the take-up spool.
Close the back of the camera. The T90 will load the film automatically and set the correct ISO (film speed).

"

Lift the rewind knob.,
Pull it a little further and the back of the camera will spring open.
,
Drop a 35mm film canister into the chamber on the left hand side.,
Push the rewind knob all the way down.,
Pull the film leader away from the canister till the tip is at the green index mark on the right hand side, next to the take-up spool.,
Close the back of the camera.
,
Press the shutter button, then wind on your film.,
Repeat the above step until the frame counter reads 1, as pictured.,
Set the film speed on the film speed dial.",How to Use a Praktica MTL3 35mm Film Camera2," This is on the top of the camera, towards the left if the back of the camera is facing towards you.
,, The flat end of the canister will be pointing upwards.

, You may find you have to rotate it a little in one direction for the fork attached to it to fully enter the film canister. This is normal.

, Ensure that the film properly engages the sprockets as marked in the picture.
,, The shutter might not fire the first time if it's not armed already, of course, in which case just wind the camera on.
, Don't fire the shutter once the frame counter reads 1; this is the first frame on your roll.
, The film speed dial is in the same place as the shutter speed dial; it's the silver dial around the outside, which can move independently.
To change the film speed, pull the silver ring around the shutter speed dial upwards. While holding it there, rotate the dial until you have set your desired film speed.
Notice that the MTL3 has both DIN and ASA settings; modern films typically give their ratings in ASA (which is called ISO on digital cameras). (For example, Fuji Velvia 50 is ASA 50, not 50 ° DIN, the latter being equivalent to an ASA speed in the high five figures.

Wind on your film to the next frame and keep shooting until you hit the end of your roll of film.

",How to Use a Praktica MTL3 35mm Film Camera3," You will notice the following things:


A triangle on the left hand side. This only appears in our photo above, or in your viewfinder, if you have not armed the shutter.

A needle on the right hand side. This is a meter reading. Take note of the +, O and - markings on the scale; we'll be referring to them later.

Three circles in the centre of the image, which are your focusing aids.

, Turn the focus ring of your lens until you have a sharp picture. You have three focusing aids that will help you.

The split-image in the centre. This will cause straight vertical lines to appear split in half if they are out of focus, and they will rejoin when they are in focus. Sometimes half of this image will be blacked out, for example with slow lenses (f/4 and slower).
The microprism ring outside of that will shimmer when the subject in that area is out of focus, and will be clear when it is in focus.
The ground glass of the circle around that will help you if the above focusing aids are not helpful in your shooting situation.

, The MTL3 is a fully manual camera, but this is hardly any harder than doing the same thing on a digital SLR in manual mode.

Press and hold the metering key on the front of the camera. The viewfinder might darken as you do this. This is normal; the MTL3 needs to stop down the lens to measure how much light will come through the lens at the given aperture (this is called ""stopped-down metering"").


 Press and hold the metering key. This is the big black button near the shutter button, which turns on the camera's meter.


Look at the needle. If it is in the middle of the ""O"" mark, then you have a correct exposure. If not, then adjust either your shutter speed or the aperture ring on your lens until it is correct.
A fuller explanation of the role of aperture and shutter speed is beyond the scope of this article, but you might want to take a look at How to understand camera exposure.


 The MTL's metering needle in action. Left-to-right: indicating under-exposure (towards the - mark), indicating over-exposure (needle towards the + mark), and indicating a roughly correct exposure (needle close to the O mark).



, Press the shutter button all the way down; you'll get a nice, reassuring click from the shutter.

"
Make sure all parts are present.,
Replace the battery with one of the right size and voltage.,
Make sure the lens is clean.,
Test the focus and zoom ring.,
Make sure all the dials and levers on the camera are not jammed.,
Check that the aperture ring, if your camera has it, turns smoothly throughout its range.,
Check the shutter.,
Check the aperture stop-down mechanism.,
Check the focus aids, if the camera has them.,
Test your camera's meter.,
Test your autofocus, if you have an autofocus camera.,
Make sure the DX code from your film is reading properly.",How to Test a Used Film Camera," Some of these might not be required for the successful operation of your camera. Some, however, might be more important than you think; missing screws, for example, can often lead to light leaking into the camera.

, Beware, especially, of cameras designed for batteries for which equivalent sizes still exist but equivalent voltages do not. (Hope is not lost if you encounter this: see the Tips below.)
While you're there, check the battery compartment for corrosion (usually deposits of a green or white colour). If you find it, wipe it with a damp, slightly soapy paper towel and if needed scratch it away with a sharp screwdriver or a nail file (which will also abrade protective coatings that may or may not have survived) until the battery contacts are clean.
, This means, being free of scratches, haze, and fungus. Scratches won't necessarily affect picture performance, fungus often does, and visible haze usually will.
, The focus ring should turn smoothly all throughout the range. The zoom ring should turn (or, in the case of some zoom lenses, slide) smoothly throughout its range, too. There should be little slack in the focus ring, except in the very cheapest lenses.
, This includes the shutter speed dial and the ISO/ASA speed dial (if you have them), as well as the film advance lever on manual cameras. Remember that some cameras will have a lock button on the dials which you will need to push before turning.

, It should not require any force (though remember that some Nikon autofocus lenses will have a lock switch to keep them at minimum aperture!).

, To do this, open the back of the camera and point it at a bright light source (not directly at the sun). Fire the shutter at all of its shutter speeds, and ensure that the shutter blades or curtains open and close quickly. You should be able to see a little light through the lens at even very fast (1/1000 upwards) shutter speeds.If this does not work: Restrict your shutter speeds to those that are known to be good by stopping down or opening up the aperture as needed. But you really should get your camera serviced by a professional, or by you if you are very brave.
, To do this, set your camera to fully-manual mode, set any shutter speed at an aperture of f/22 (or whatever the smallest aperture of your lens is), and set a slow shutter speed, then look at the front of the lens. You should be able to see the aperture blades stop down, and this should work instantly.If this does not work: Borrow another lens from the same camera system, if you can, to make sure that it is not a problem with the lens. Otherwise, many lenses, especially for non-SLR cameras, are much sharper wide-open than you would expect, so don't hesitate to use the widest aperture you have if your aperture isn't stopping down properly. If it is stopping down, but not instantly (i.e., it's visibly slow), some camera systems have a stop-down-metering mode, in which you stop down your lens while metering, and keep it stopped down while shooting.
, Manually focus on an upright object (such as a stick in the ground) which is a known distance away; use a tape measure (remember to measure from the film plane if you're measuring close distances, not from the front of the lens). Set that distance on the focus scale on your lens. Check the focus aids to make sure that the image in the viewfinder is sharp (on rangefinder cameras, ""sharp"" means ""the two images in the centre of the rangefinders are aligned).If this does not work: It's likely that the focus aids are misaligned. Get used to it. Take a number of shots at different distances to see how your camera and lens are misaligned, and memorize it so that you can compensate for it while shooting., If you lack a known-good external meter, your best bet is to use your digital camera! Borrow one if you don't have one already. Take a meter reading of a low-contrast scene (a piece of grass or asphalt will do just fine) with your film camera, then shoot the same piece of the same thing with exactly the same ISO, shutter speed and aperture with a digital camera. Check the shot taken with a digital camera to see if there is any massive under- or over-exposure.If this does not work: You may be lucky and find that your camera is giving a consistently wrong meter reading. Check it in a variety of low-contrast lighting conditions; if you find that a shutter speed of 1/500 would have been appropriate for a scene where your film camera's meter reading was 1/250, and that a different, much dimmer scene where a shutter speed of 1/30 would have been more appropriate for a meter reading of 1/15, then you're golden: either set your exposure manually to use a shutter speed of a stop faster, or use exposure compensation appropriately. If it's inconsistently wrong, then you're going to have to have to carry an external meter with you. Failing that, find some way of compensating so that it's a stop or two in line with reality and shoot a negative film, which has massive exposure latitude., Nearly all cameras activate autofocus with a half-press of the shutter button. You should hear or see some movement on the lens, and with SLR cameras, you will see it coming into focus.If this does not work: If you have an ""A/M"" or ""AF/MF"" switch on the lens, make sure it is on ""A"" or ""AF"". Otherwise, focus manually. Hopefully, focus confirmation (usually a green dot in the viewfinder when the selected autofocus point is in focus) should continue to work., DX coding is a feature on automatic and semi-automatic cameras from the mid-1980s onwards that allows them to automatically read the ISO (sensitivity) of the film. This problem is rare; it's mostly limited to very cheap point-and-shoots and some very expensive Leica cameras. If you're planning on actually taking photographs with it, you may as well check it anyway. Usually, a read-out on the top LCD will tell you what ISO has been detected when you load a film into it.If this does not work: Try cleaning the DX code reading pins with rubbing alcohol. Otherwise, most cameras will give you a way to set an ISO manually. Set one accordingly. If you do not, all serious automatic cameras have an exposure compensation setting. If the ISO is reading as 100 with an ISO 50 film, then set +1 exposure compensation. If you have an ISO 400 film and the camera is reading it as 200, then set -1 exposure compensation. Remember that a doubling of film speed means one stop of exposure compensation; see How to Understand Camera Exposure.

Open the back of the camera and pop the film cassette out of the film chamber.",How to Use a Canon T902," Two of these we'll be referring to by name later, so learn them now:





 The power switch of the Canon T90, set to ""L"", meaning ""off"".

The power switch, which isn't actually a power switch (the camera is always on). This is the switch with two positions, L and A (for ""Locked"" and ""Auto"", or ""off"" and ""on"" to the rest of us, respectively). If you're worried about the camera merrily shooting its way through a roll of film while it's stored (or you hitting the shutter by accident), then keep this at ""L"" while you're not using it.




 The T90's shutter button.

The shutter button. This makes it go ""click"".




 The control dial. This does a lot of things, as we'll see later.

The control dial. This is the big dial just behind the shutter button.

, Open the flap on the right of the camera. At the bottom, you'll notice a switch with two positions, S-C and a clock icon. We'll refer to this as the ""drive mode switch"", and confuse you by referring to the big yellow button in the centre as the ""drive mode button"". Here are your shooting options:




 The arrow next to the ""H"" indicates you're in the ""I'm not shooting on a budget"" mode.

Continuous, high speed mode. This will make the T90 continue shooting after the film has wound on from the next frame for as long as you hold down the shutter button, at four and a half frames per second. You might want to use this in low light at shutter speeds that are too slow to get sharp hand-held shots 100 percent of the time (shoot several, pick the sharpest), or just because it sounds awesome. Be careful, because this will burn through a 36-exposure film in about eight seconds.
To get into this drive mode, turn the drive mode switch to the S-C position, then press the drive mode button in the centre until an arrow appears next to the H letter on the left hand side of the top LCD.




 The arrow next to the ""L"" indicates ""I'm too poor for high speed"" mode.

Continuous, low speed mode. This is like the above, but advances at a mere two frames per second. To get this mode, turn the drive mode switch to the S-C position, then press the drive mode button until an arrow appears next to the L on the top LCD.




 The arrow next to ""SINGLE"" indicates that you were a sniper in a previous life. One shot, one kill!

Single-shot mode. This will take a single shot for each press of the shutter button, no matter how long you hold it down (the film is still automatically advanced). This might be useful if you're shooting stills and are paranoid about wasting film. To use this, turn the drive mode switch to the S-C position until an arrow appears next to ""SINGLE"" on the top LCD.




 The arrow next to the ""2"" indicates the two-second self timer is set. Pressing the drive mode button would set it to 10 seconds, in case you wanted to get yourself in the shot, too.

Self-timer. This is most useful for shooting from a tripod when you're making long exposures; having a delay after you push the shutter means any vibration you caused while doing so will have dissipated.

, Looking at beautiful photos is one thing, and learning how to make them is another. But if you're going to take some of your own, you need to get up, get your stuff packed and go outside. And if you're going to do this, you need to avoid some common attitudes and pitfalls which keep people indoors looking at photographs -- or, worse, talking about making photographs -- rather than taking them. Discard attitudes such as not trusting your own ability to take great shots, or thinking that all the good photos have already being taken; your perspective is unique and is definitely worth being represented in photos., An understanding of camera exposure might be helpful here; see How to Understand Camera Exposure. The T90 will set either aperture, shutter speed, or both for you automatically. Which ones they will set, depends on the mode you have it in. So, hold down the ""Mode"" button while turning the main control dial. You'll see that different things, like ""Tv, Av, Program"", and so on appear in the top LCD. Here are the ones that you care about:





 The Canon T90 in ""P"". Note that it reads ""P-1"" and ""WIDE"", meaning the program has been shifted towards favouring longer shutter speeds and smaller apertures. ""TELE"", the opposite of a ""WIDE"" program, favours faster shutter speeds and smaller apertures.

P, for program automatic. This will set both aperture and shutter speed for you, and will guess a combination that works for most people most of the time. Once you're in P mode, turning the command dial will shift between different aperture or shutter speed combinations. This is called program shift. Note that this is not the same as exposure compensation (detailed below), in which a shot is deliberately over- or under-exposed. It simply picks different combinations (for example, 1/30 at f/4, or 1/125 at f/2, rather than the default 1/60 at f/2.8), keeping the exposure the same. You can shift up to two stops in each direction.
(You will have noticed a ""P"" mode, but this isn't the same as ""Program"". ""Program"" doesn't allow you to shift between combinations of aperture and shutter speeds.)




 Aperture priority allows you to set a large aperture to force a shallow depth of field (and blurred backgrounds). (Shot with a Canon T90, Canon FD 135mm f/3.5 wide-open, Kodak Portra 400VC.)

Av, meaning aperture-priority, meaning that you turn the main control dial to select an aperture and the camera automatically chooses a shutter speed to match it (again, see How to Understand Camera Exposure if you're unsure what any of this means). Turning the control dial to the left will select a larger aperture (smaller f/number, meaning less depth of field and faster shutter speeds) and turning it to the right will select a smaller aperture (meaning the inverse).
See also How to Use Your Camera's Aperture Priority Mode, and How to Choose a Lens Aperture (F Stop).




 ""Tv"" mode means that you set a shutter speed, and the camera automatically selects an aperture.

Tv, meaning shutter-priority, meaning that you pick a shutter speed and the camera automatically sets an aperture for you. This might be useful if you want to force a fast shutter speed to freeze motion (or avoid camera shake), or if you want a slow one to blur motion (like those awesome blurred water shots you see). Once you're in Tv mode, turning the control dial to the right will select a faster shutter speed, and turning it to the right will select a slower one.

, The T90's meter is a relatively dumb, centre-weighted one (meaning that it pays more attention to light at the centre of the frame than it does to light sources on the periphery). It's not smart enough to know that bright subjects should be kept bright, nor that things meant to be dark should be kept that way. This is where exposure compensation comes in; it forces the camera to use a longer or shorter shutter speed (in P and Av modes), or a larger or smaller aperture (in Tv mode), than it would do normally, forcing it to over- or under-expose.
To set exposure compensation, hold down the exposure compensation button (marked ""EXP. COMP."") and turn the main control wheel at the same time. Each click on the control wheel is one third of a stop, i.e. forcing a shutter speed one third longer than it'd choose by itself. Turn the dial towards the right to over-expose, and towards the left to under-expose. You'll notice that the exposure compensation readout on the top LCD changes, as indicated in the picture. It reads ""2"", towards the right of the centre, which indicates twice the normal exposure, or one stop.
Some examples of times you'll need exposure compensation:





 A strongly back-lit subject like this one, not shot on a T90, will require deliberate overexposure to maintain detail in the foreground.

Strongly back-lit subjects. You may want to add two stops of overexposure (so that the readout on the top LCD goes all the way over to the right, at the ""4"" position).

Snow. The T90 is not smart enough to know that snow is snow and that it should be kept bright, so it'll attempt to expose it to turn it grey. You might want to add anywhere from two thirds stop to a whole stop or more.Bright sunsets. You'll lose some of the great details in the sky if you don't underexpose a little. Try underexposing by two thirds of a stop if you're shooting a slide film. This will also ensure that shadows stay dark, as they should be.




 This shot in very little light, with a long shutter speed, required a whole stop of overexposure to make up for reciprocity failure on Kodak Ektar 100. (Shot on an A-1, not a T90.)

Film reciprocity. Many films run into problems when exposure times get very long; they require additional exposure as shutter times increase. This is called ""reciprocity failure"". The deceased Kodachrome, for example, required overexposure for speeds as short as a tenth of a second. Most films are not this bad, but still require overexposure at longer speeds. Find a datasheet for your film; it'll tell you how much extra exposure you require.

, These are the following things you care about in your viewfinder:


Shutter speed. This is the shutter speed you have either selected (in Tv mode), or that the camera has chosen for you (in P and Av modes). This is at the bottom of the viewfinder, left-to-middle.

Aperture. This is the pair of red digits at the bottom of the viewfinder, just left of the centre. This tells you either what aperture you have set (in Av mode), or what aperture the camera has selected for you (in P and TV modes).

How many shots you have used. This is the indicator on the right hand side of the viewfinder.

The split-image. You will see three circles in the middle of your viewfinder. The inner one of these is a split-image rangefinder, a focusing aid that we will explain later.

The microprism ring. The second-to-inner of the circles mentioned above is another focusing aid, which we will explain later, too.

Other things. If you see a ""+/-"" in your viewfinder, this indicates that you have exposure compensation set. If you see ""M"" in your viewfinder, this means you've ignored step 4 under ""Preparation"" above.

, Turn the focus ring on your lens. You have two focusing aids, as mentioned above. The split-image in the rangefinder will make vertical lines appear as being split in half; when the image in your viewfinder is in focus, vertical lines will be joined.
The other focusing aid you have is your microprism ring. When subjects are out of focus, the area of the image within the microprism ring will shimmer; when it's in focus, it will not., Push the shutter button down all the way. The shutter will click and you can move on to the next beautiful thing to photograph., Once you do, the film will automatically rewind itself., Get your pictures developed, and don't forget to show them off to the world!"

If yours doesn't have this, it's a late-70s-and-onwards ""new FD"" lens, and the instructions will differ somewhat; in the instructions below, replace the part with twisting the silver locking ring with twisting the whole lens itself until it audibly locks into place.




  Remove your body cap.

Remove your body cap if you have one, as well as the rear lens cap on the lens.




 Line up the two red dots...

Line up the red dot on the lens with the red dot on the body and gently drop the lens into the mount.




 ...and twist the silver locking ring to tighten it into place.

Twist the locking ring clockwise, that is, clockwise if you are looking from it from the front. It won't lock into place, but instead it will get progressively tighter. Don't overtighten this, but do make sure it is firmly in place.;
, Rotate the main switch from ""L"" to ""A"". Canon's manual recommends leaving this at ""L"" when you're not using the camera to conserve battery life. It might not be worth bothering with this, especially if you're not using one of Canon's power winders for the A-1; just handle your camera carefully (so as not to hit the shutter button) and you'll be okay., This is a small lever right next to the large ASA dial on the left of the camera (if you're looking from the back). Turn it clockwise to uncover the white dot. This will turn on the display in your viewfinder (and you want this)., Uncommonly, the A-1 has a blind on the viewfinder to stop stray light entering the viewfinder on long, tripod-mounted exposures. It's a neat enough feature, but most of the time, you will not need this. If it hasn't been done already, turn the small lever to the left of the viewfinder window clockwise to open the blind., The A-1 is an electronically controlled camera that will not work with a low or dead battery; the shutter will refuse to fire if it is. Press the battery test button (illustrated). If the LED next to the shutter button doesn't blink at all then your battery is dead. If it does not blink very rapidly (several times per second), then it's low, and you should replace it. Pick up a few cheap 4LR44 (aka A544) cells and replace them., This is just like any other rear-loading SLR.







Pull your film rewind knob upwards to open the back of the camera.







Place your film in the film chamber, and draw the leader of the film over to sit in one of the slots, and so that the bottom of the leader is engaging the film transport sprocket.






Close the back of the camera, push the shutter and then wind the film on. Repeat until the frame counter shows that you're on the first frame. While you do that, watch the rewind knob on the left as you wind the film on on; this should turn as you wind it on, and if it doesn't it probably means your film isn't loaded correctly.

, This is necessary for automatic exposure to work accurately. The film speed dial sits around the rewind crank, and has a silver unlocking button on the side, as illustrated. Push this in, and then rotate the dial to the same as the ASA (same as the ISO) speed rating of your film., This will allow the aperture to be set by the camera; for the most part, this is what you want (it always is, unless you're doing fully manual exposures for some reason)., The next part of this guide will walk you through using the A-1."
"

Get yourself a camera.,

Get yourself some film.,
Get out there into the big blue room.,
Take photographs.,
Go home.,
Get your film developed and scanned.,
Pick out the best of your photos and put them online.",How to Shoot Film," This is the easy part; people are literally giving them away in the digital era. If you can't scavenge one for free, and don't have the time and inclination to research the many different kinds of film cameras, look for any 35mm film SLR from one of the major manufacturers (Nikon, Canon, Pentax and friends). Read the manual for the very basics of operation, like how to load and unload the film, how to focus, and so on.
, There's little point in economizing here by using the very-cheap-and-less-than-cheerful consumer films (even though these can get great results if you know what you're doing). Treat yourself to expensive professional film; if you feel bad about doing this, cheer yourself up by calculating how much film you could buy and process for the cost of a professional digital SLR.




 Colour negative films, like the Fujicolor C200 used here, can be developed and scanned almost anywhere.

Get a color negative (print) film if you are concerned about the availability and cost of developing and scanning. Even in the digital era, nearly every town of some size will have at least one place you can get this done. Also, colour negative film has enormous latitude for overexposure.




 This was shot on Fuji Velvia, a film renowned for its vivid colours.

Get a slide (reversal) film if you care about colour, and don't care too much about the cost and availability of developing and scanning. Slide films have much better and accurate colour rendition (if only because there is only one accurate way of rendering the colour in a particular slide). On the other hand, professional labs that run the E-6 process used for nearly all slide films are much less common, and tend to be more expensive. You'll also find that it's much, much easier to screw up exposure on a slide film.




 Black-and-white film, like this Tri-X 400, has a look all its own.

Go for black and white if you like the look of it. Traditional black-and-white film is, again, more difficult and expensive to get developed than colour negative film (but is easier to scan than slide film). On the other hand, you can develop it yourself if playing with fun chemicals is your thing.
There's a special subset of black-and-white films: those that can be developed in the same C-41 process used for color negatives. Alford XP2 and Kodak BW400CN are two of them.




 Try as many films as you can until you find one that fits your style.

Try as many different films as you can until you find one, or a few, that fit your style, and the kinds of pictures you take. You might even find yourself liking the cheaper films better than the expensive ones. This is fine.

, Shooting film should be liberating; a break from playing with digital camera settings and constantly second-guessing yourself by looking at your LCD all the time. Don't put yourself back in chains again by taking a whole lot of junk you don't need. This is the biggest disincentive to getting out there, and a huge disincentive to moving around if you do. Strip your kit down to the very bare essentials:




 A single, fast fixed 50mm lens like this 50mm f/1.8 is about the only lens you'll need most of the time.

Take a single lens with you. Even if you own many more, it's good practice to take a single lens and make the best of it. It doesn't even matter which lens you take, though a fixed, fast 50mm lens is about the only one you'll need most of the time.
Take a spare film in your pocket. Or don't bother if you're already loaded up with a fresh one. Put more thought into your shots rather than burning through your film as quickly as possible.
Leave everything else at home. Don't bother with other junk, like a bag (other than for drinks and snacks), or a tripod, or flash guns, or add-on motor winders, or a digital camera. If you've got your gear down to what fits over your shoulder and in your pockets, you've got the perfect setup.

, This is art, and nobody can tell you what to do here. You can, however, take a few steps to make your photographs less snapshot-ish and more like things other people would like to see. (for more, see How to Take Better Photographs and How to Develop Your Photography Skills).




 Shot with an Olympus Trip 35, a fully-automatic point-and shoot camera, loaded with Velvia.

Stick your camera in a fully-automatic mode, if you have one. Automate everything you can if you don't. Automation exists for a reason: it lets you concentrate on getting the important parts of your shot right rather than concentrating on technical trivia like exposure that cameras can guess more accurately than you can most of the time.






Move around all the time. Don't take boring pictures at your normal eye level. If you have to crawl on the ground to make it interesting, do that (it's what washing machines were made for). Always get as low and close to your subject as you can.




 Simplify your shot as much as you can.

Think before you shoot. Ask yourself: what can I remove from this shot to simplify it? What am I conveying here? (Think colour, texture, repetition, contrasts, etc.) ""Is this shot just a boring snapshot of nothing that anyone else would take?""

Don't second guess yourself. Don't worry about whether the shot you just took is exposed and focused properly. If it looked good through the viewfinder, and your camera thought your exposure was about right, move on to the next shot. You've got no LCD to nag you after each shot (although you may find yourself looking at the back of the camera out of habit). Chances are good that you got it right.

, Unload your film and stick it in the fridge, then kick back and relax. There's nothing else you need to do; that is another of the joys of shooting film., Nearly all labs will toast a CD for you with high-quality scans of your pictures for a small additional charge. Do this. There's no reason for you to scan them yourself. Not only does this put additional effort into the process (which is bad); it's also likely that their scans will be much better than what you could do with all but the most expensive of dedicated film scanners., Owing to the extra effort that you put in to making each shot worth the developing cost, you'll likely have many more great photographs than you did shooting digital, so show them off to the world!"
"
Change the batteries.,

Be paranoid and check your batteries even if they are new.,
Mount the lens.,

Make sure your aperture ring is set to ""A"".",How to Use a Canon T50 35mm Camera1," Even if your camera has batteries in it, change them with fresh ones, because you don't want to run out of battery power while you're out shooting.





  Push the latch to open the battery door.

Unlatch the battery door and open it. Do this gently because these are horribly flimsy and really easy to break. Drop out any batteries that were in there.
Check the battery terminals for corrosion if you just bought the camera. If they are covered in a white residue, spray on some electrical contact cleaner and carefully scrape away any residue with a sharp implement.




 Drop in a couple of alkaline or carbon-zinc batteries.

Drop in a couple of AA batteries. Never use rechargeable batteries--Canon warns against this (which either means that the metering will be wrong or your camera will explode). Do your part to destroy the environment by dropping in a pair of disposable batteries (""heavy duty"" carbon-zinc or alkalines).
Close the battery door; again, be as gentle as you can, to avoid breaking it.;
, It's good to get in the habit of doing this regularly. Spin the main dial around to ""B.C"" (for ""Battery Check""); if the camera beeps at you, the batteries are good., The lens will be of one of two styles of Canon FD lenses, both of which mount slightly differently:





 Old-school FD lenses have a chrome locking ring which you tighten to keep the lens in place.

Lenses with chrome locking rings, which is everything before about 1979 - Line up the red dots on the camera body and lens, then twist the chrome locking ring clockwise (looking from the front of the camera), until it's comfortably tight.




 ""New FD"" lenses, like this 28mm f/2.8, mount just like the bayonet lenses they pretend to be.

New FD lenses - These don't have a locking ring. Again, line up the two red dots. Then, rotate the body of the lens until it clicks into place, just like the bayonet-mount lenses for other cameras which these lenses pretend to be.

, Press the button to the right of the ""A"" in order to slide it so that the ""A"" is just below the vertical orange line. Taking it off ""A"" will lock the shutter speed to 1/60 second. This is only useful for shooting either manual flashes (if you must nuke subjects with direct flash, use Canon's Speedlite 244T, which works fine in ""A"") or for use with strobes in a studio. For everything else, you'll want to keep it on ""A"".
Of course, for the serious headbangers out there, this works as a very crude, limiting, unmetered fully-manual mode."

If you will be shooting all day or are unsure of the exact light, choose 400ISO;
,,,,,,,









You have now successfully opened the back of the camera and are ready to load film.

There should be roughly an inch of film hanging out of the roll of film. This is called the leader.
If there is not a leader, you will need a special tool. Consult your teacher for help.
If no teacher is available, use another roll of film.
You may assume that the top of the film is the end with the circle protruding from the main cylinder. However, this is not the case; this is actually the bottom.

, Ensure that the flange out of the roll of film that has the leader sticking out is to the right over the back of the camera. (It’s hard to mess this up if the roll of film is oriented properly in the cradle.)








, Push the roll of film down into the cradle.








,,









On the back of the camera on the right where the tip of the leader is, you will notice two spindles; one with sprockets and another to hold the tip of the leader.

On the top and bottom of the sprocket, (left) spindle are sprockets, and on the top and bottom of the film there are sprocket holes.

,, If the advancement mechanism does not move out, push down the shutter release, which is the silver button to the top of the advancement mechanism if looking from above.









The spindle will move clockwise, which will appear to be wrong because it takes the film and bends it around the spindle in what looks to be backwards. This however is correct, and the film is wound on the spindle in this manner to ensure it does not slide off.
The film should wrap around the spindle and move a short distance, once the advancement mechanism stops release the shutter and you will get another crank out of it.

Uncover your AT dial.,
Set your exposure mode.,

Look through the viewfinder and very gently half-press the shutter button.,
Focus.,

Set exposure compensation, if required.,
Press your shutter button.",How to Use a Canon A-1 35mm Camera2," This is a cover for the dial which sets your shutter speed or aperture. Slide it down to uncover the dial. This is the single most important control on the camera, so play with the dial a little to get the feel of it. (""AT dial"" is a hideous term from Canon's literature, borrowed here for lack of a better one, sorry.), The A-1 has three modes that you'll be interested in: fully-programmed AE (which is fully automatic), shutter-priority AE, aperture-priority AE and fully manual.




 Turn your mode dial to ""Tv"" and the shutter speed to ""P"" for program automatic.

Programmed AE will make the camera set both aperture and shutter speeds for you automatically. Turn your mode dial to ""Tv"" (""Time value"", which is Canon's silly name for ""shutter priority""), and use your AT dial to select the green ""P"" as the shutter speed. Most of the time, this will be what you want to use if you're not using your aperture for creative depth of field tricks, or if you're not using your shutter speed to creative effect; it generally does a good job of picking something that works for most photos most of the time. (Sorry, but this is 1978; you can't shift the program.)




 For shutter-priority auto-exposure, turn the mode dial to ""Tv"" and select your shutter speed (here, 1/125 sec).

Shutter-priority AE will allow you to select a shutter speed, and then the A-1 will pick an aperture for you. If you want either very fast or very slow shutter speeds for creative effect, then use this. Turn your mode dial to ""Tv"" and select a shutter speed. Remember that the speeds in yellow on the dial are shutter speeds in seconds, the white numbers are ones in fractions of a second.




 For aperture-priority auto-exposure, turn the mode dial to ""Av"" and select your aperture.

Aperture-priority AE will allow you to select an aperture, and then the A-1 will select a shutter speed for you. Use this if you want to use very wide or very small apertures (i.e. if you want creative control over depth of field). Turn your mode dial to ""Av"" and select an aperture with the AT dial to get aperture priority AE.
Note that this won't allow you to select apertures smaller than f/22, but you shouldn't be doing that anyway.
Fully manual exposure is a last resort for using in extremely dimor otherwise impossible lighting conditions. You can select fully manual mode by setting your mode dial to ""Tv"", selecting a shutter speed, and turning your aperture ring on your lens off ""A"" and to your preferred aperture. You'll need an external light meter for doing this; the A-1 shows no indication of over- and under-exposure in fully manual mode.

, Your shutter speed and your aperture (either the shutter or the aperture or both or none could be automatically selected) will be displayed in the viewfinder. If either the shutter speed or aperture readouts are blinking, it means you've selected a shutter speed that is either too fast or slow for the largest or smallest apertures on your camera, or an aperture that requires a shutter speed faster or slower than the camera has available.Select a different aperture or shutter speed if this is the case., The A-1 provides you with two useful focusing aids to ensure that your shots are sharp. One is a split image, right in the center, which splits the images into two pieces, which are aligned when the image is in focus.
The other (more useful) aid is a microprism ring around the outside of the the split screen. this will cause any defocus to be far more obvious than it would be otherwise; when it's out of focus, this area will flicker and display a very obvious ""cross-hatched"" pattern. Turn the focus ring until either the split image is no longer visibly split, or until the image in the microprism ring is visibly sharp., This feature of the A-1 forces the camera to either under- or over-expose your shot by a given amount. You'll need this in tricky, inconsistent lighting conditions. Press the button to unlock the exposure compensation dial and turn it to give you the desired amount (you can do this in 1/3 stop increments). Turning this clockwise will give you underexposure, and counter-clockwise will give you overexposure.
Actually, the A-1's exposure compensation dial is annoying and difficult to do one-handed, so you might not want to bother with this. The ASA dial, on the other hand, can be changed with a fingertip. Neither the ASA nor exposure compensation dials will give you any indication (other than by looking at them) that you're forcibly over- or under-exposing, and the ASA dial has the advantage of being much easier to use. It's up to you., The viewfinder will temporarily blank out and the shutter will fire. If you're using one of the optional power winders, the film will advance itself to the next frame, otherwise, wind it on yourself.
Keep photographing until you get to the last frame. Don't pay any attention to the frame counter; you're only at the end of the roll when the winder becomes difficult-to-impossible to wind on (don't force it!), or when your power winder (if you have one) refuses to wind it on any further."

Press the shutter button all the way down to shoot.,

Keep moving and shooting until you hit the end of the roll.",How to Use a Canon T50 35mm Camera3," Get out any time the light is good (which isn't the same thing as bright daylight; early mornings and late evenings are the best)., This is the camera's only exposure mode, which is fully automatic. You'll only need to turn this to L to lock the shutter while it's stowed away to prevent accidental shots; keep it around your neck and you won't need to bother doing this., This is covered in quite some detail in another article., Don't worry about this being a manual-focus camera; the T50's viewfinder is so enormous and bright that you'd have to try to get a shot out of focus. You also have two useful focusing aids to ensure that your shots are sharp. One is a split image, the circle right in the center, which splits the images into two pieces, and which are aligned when the image is in focus.
The other (more useful) aid is a microprism ring around the outside of the the split screen. This will cause any defocus to be far more obvious than it would be otherwise; when it's out of focus, this area will flicker and display a very obvious ""cross-hatched""-ish pattern. Turn the focus ring until either the split image is no longer visibly split, or until the image in the microprism ring is visibly sharp., This will wake the camera up and you'll see a little green P appear.,
A slowly-blinking P: If it blinks about twice a second, it's warning you that your picture might be blurred by camera shake (this happens if the shutter speed is down to 1/30 or slower). Use a tripod or brace yourself against a solid surface.If you find yourself down in this range quite a lot, you might want to consider shooting a faster film.
A rapidly-blinking P: You're dead; you're either trying to operate outside the T50's metering range or you're going to need a shutter speed longer than two seconds. The T50 simply cannot operate under extreme low-light conditions, sorry.

, The camera's noisy little motor drive will automatically advance the film to the next frame. Keeping it held down will make it shoot again just under a second later. This might be a good idea if you're down in the slowly-blinking-P range (since it increases the chance that one of the shots won't be blurred by camera shake), otherwise you're wasting film by doing this., The camera will beep loudly at you when you're out of film."
"
Understand the difference between the three main types of film.,



 Your options may be limited if you're shooting some weird format like 110 cartridges.,
Look at your processing options.,

Decide how much exposure latitude you want.,
Decide on a film speed.,

Decide what colors you like, and choose a film accordingly.,
Ignore all of this article and go try some films.",How to Choose a Film for Your Camera," Many people are only familiar with the first of these, but the other two have their place in photography (perhaps more so).




  Color negatives have their colors inverted, and are orange-tinted.

Color negative film, also called print film, is what most people are familiar with; the stuff you can still buy almost anywhere (and what non-specialists will generally assume you want if you ask for ""film""). The image you see on a developed negative is orange-tinted, and the colors are inverted. The process used to develop these is called C-41, and so these are sometimes called ""C-41 films"".




 Slide films, typically mounted in plastic or cardboard mounts, give a positive image that looks just like your photograph.

Slide film, more properly called reversal film, gives a positive image; in other words, when you look through it, it looks like a photograph. Nearly all slide films today use the E-6 process, which is a completely different process to that used for negative films.This was shot on Ilford XP2, one of the few black-and-white films that don't use the traditional black-and-white process.

Traditional black-and-white films are usually negative films, but (you guessed it) they're black-and-white. These, again, use a very different process (albeit a much simpler one) to all the other types of film.
There's a special subset of black-and-white films: those that can be developed in the same C-41 process used for color negatives. Ilford XP2 and Kodak BW400CN are two of them. These have all the properties of color negatives, except for the color part, so most of what is written below about the latter applies to these films as well.;
,

Consider the options for your film format. This article mostly assumes that you're shooting 35mm film. If you're using some weird or dead consumer format like 24mm, then you're probably stuck with color negative film. 35mm and larger formats usually have plenty of options available, so don't worry about this.,




 C-41 minilabs like these can be found almost anywhere.

Color negative films can be developed almost anywhere for very little expense; if you're not living in some Nowheresville with a population of you and your dog, you probably have a place nearby capable of developing them. If you're weird, don't mind messing up a lot of films and enjoy dealing with a lot of unpleasant and dangerous chemicals, you can develop it yourself, but this isn't altogether recommended.
E-6 slide films and traditional black-and-white films will normally need to be sent off to a professional lab for developing. Most large cities will have a lab of this kind; smaller labs will often be willing to handle this for you. On the other hand, you can develop traditional black and white films yourself without a great deal of expense, and with much less unpleasantness than you'd encounter with color negative film.

, Either metering error or bad technique will cause your photos to be either under- or over-exposed; exposure latitude is the degree to which a film can tolerate this and still return acceptable results. Slide film has almost no tolerance to either; if you're going to shoot slide film, it's a very good idea to shoot a test roll or two first. (Unless you want an unusual effect for artistic purposes, don't bother with slide film in a camera without manual settings or electronics; its one-size-fits-all settings will often give poor results.) Color negatives can tolerate huge amounts of over-exposure and usually a stop of underexposure; it's not a bad idea at all to shoot them at a stop over their rated speed all the time. Traditional black-and-white film also has a huge exposure latitude; any error in exposure can be corrected during developing or printing., The film speed is usually given according to its ASA (also known as ISO) speed index; this will be a number like 50, 100, 200, etc.The higher the number, the more sensitive the film is to light. More and less sensitive films are called ""faster"" and ""slower"", respectively. As usual, there's no one right film, but a trade-off:




 Faster films allow you to take photographs in almost no light, but are much grainier. This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Faster films will allow you to capture a subject in worse light. The trade-off is that you end up getting more grain in your pictures (think digital camera noise, but far less ugly). Some people might say that it's not worth bothering with the extremely fast (ASA 1600 upwards) films these days; if you need extremely fast shutter speeds for sports (for example), just shoot a good digital SLR, which will give great results at these fast speeds. On the other hand, photography is an art, not a science. Lots of film grain can look awesome on black-and-white photographs.Slow films, like the ASA 50 Velvia used for this shot, are good for landscapes, but forget hand-holding in darker conditions.

Slower films typically have less grain, but require longer shutter speeds. This isn't a problem for landscapes in daytime through to sunset, but it does become a problem indoors, or shooting things that move quickly.
Don't worry about any of this too much: if you want easy snapshots, go for ASA 200, 400 or 800 film; if you're shooting in daylight or can control your lighting, shoot the slowest film that you like the look of.
Unless you take many, many pictures, have a fancy professional-type camera with interchangeable film-holding backs, or keep multiple cameras on hand, you may often have to choose a film good for a variety of conditions. In this case, choose a print film (for increased tolerance of bad exposure), in color (you can always lose the color in a computer later if you like), with high speed (it will be a little grainier under bright light, but it will keep you from losing pictures entirely to slow shutter speed that will smear pictures by far more than the width of a few grains.

, This will depend on your subject. For example, super-saturated films like Velvia might be great for landscapes, but terrible for people (at least lighter-skinned ones). Subtle colors or black-and-white is often much better for this sort of thing. But again, remember, art, where using the ""wrong"" film in a certain situation often looks better than doing the technically ""right"" thing.
If you're shooting a negative film, remember that the colors you will get will depend far on how they are printed or scanned than on the film itself, since there is no standard way to represent colors on film. Unlike with slides, there is no such thing as printing or scanning without corrections, because all inverted color negatives have to be color-corrected to remove the base tint of the film. Which isn't to say that they can't look superb; they can, and often do, especially for photos of people. Just don't be surprised if you get unsatisfactory results, or very different results from film to film., None of this technical trivia is the same thing as art. There's no substitute for playing with a film and seeing if you like the results you get from it."
"
Acquire a camera.,
Look for film.,
Get out and take pictures.,
Accept the limitations of instant photography.,
Share your artwork.",How to Get Started With Instant Photography," The kind of camera you buy and how much you spend depends mostly on what kind of instant photography you choose to pursue. You can look for a real Polaroid camera, or you can look into newer attempts to bring back instant photography:


Old Polaroid cameras are fairly easy to come across at garage sales, antique shops, and websites like eBay, and can be very cheap if you know where to look. You or someone you know may even have one stashed in their garage somewhere that they'll be happy to give you for free. Just ask around. Don't worry too much about the age or model of of the camera... most likely, you can find film for it somewhere. Polaroid cameras tend to be tough and survive remarkably well even when left in storage for years (or decades), but if you're not sure if yours still works, try taking it to a reputable camera store... believe it or not, there are still places that can examine and/or fix Polaroid cameras.
Alternatively, you can explore more ""modern"" instant photography. In an effort to keep instant film alive after Polaroid stopped producing it, Fujifilm created the Fujifilm Instax and Instax mini, which take instant business card-sized photos in a similar manner to the older cameras. The cameras themselves are about the same size as the older cameras, but they have a much different look to them and are held more upright, like modern cameras.
Eventually, Polaroid realized the error of its ways and tried to compensate with the Polaroid 300, another newer instant camera. These cameras generally cost more than the older, traditional Polaroid cameras, but their smaller size and sleeker design makes them easier to use and carry with you.;
, Depending on the model of camera you ended up with, this can vary in difficulty and price. Be warned that serious Polaroid photographers often spend thousands of dollars a year on film. While well worth it, if this isn't an investment you're prepared for, you will want to proceed with caution.


Finding film for Fujifilm Instax and Polaroid 300 cameras is easy. It's fairly cheap and can easily be purchased from Fuji or Polaroid directly, or from other stores and websites. Large stores like Walmart even sell Fuji Instax, making the newer instant photography the much more convenient route.
For those willing to shell out a little more money and expend a little more effort to experience the real deal, real Polaroid film is still out there. Unfortunately, most of it is expired, as it was last manufactured in 2008, and it can be hard to find it for a good price. However, if the film has been stored well, it may still work even if it's a little outdated. If you know anyone who might've had a Polaroid camera at one point and could still have some film, it's best to ask around first. If that fails, try websites like eBay and Amazon. You may have to shell out a bit of money and take some risks to find some film that actually works, but when you do, it'll be worth it in the end. if you find a seller with a lot of usable film at a decent price, go ahead and buy them out. Deals like that can be hard to come by.
Alternatively, The Impossible Project is a great option for aspiring Polaroid photographers.Made up of a team of former Polaroid employees, the Impossible team set out to re-create instant film from scratch, and is currently producing black and white and color film for various types of cameras at an affordable price.

Load your camera. For most models of Polaroid cameras, this is a fairly simple procedure. Carefully open the film pack to remove the film cartridge, which contains the film and the battery. Open the camera's film compartment. Without touching or removing the dark slide (the black piece of paper/plastic on top of the cartridge that keeps the film underneath from being exposed to light), carefully push the film into the compartment. When it is in as far as it will go, close the film compartment. The darkslide should eject automatically. You are now ready to take pictures.

, Especially if you've been into shooting digital or even film SLRs, shooting a Polaroid camera should be a liberating experience. You press one button and a picture pops out... most cameras have an exposure compensation dial, but that's about it for controls to fiddle with. When taking Polaroid pictures, there are only a few things to keep in mind:


Polaroid film needs to shielded from light to develop well. This is especially true for Impossible Project films, which take about three minutes to develop completely instead of the 90 seconds or so of real Polaroid film. The first few seconds after the picture is ejected are crucial. As soon as the picture is ejected from the camera, turn it over and/or shield it with your hand and cover it with something or get it to a dark room. If you're shooting outside in bright sunlight, look into techniques for quickly covering the film with a darkslide to protect it when it's ejected.

If you're using Impossible Project film, make sure you check to see how long it takes to develop and how sensitive it is to light. Most of their older black and white films take around three minutes, but newer color films can take as long as 10. They also continue to develop and change slightly for days after the picture is initially developed, so don't be alarmed if your picture doesn't look like much at first.



, You shouldn't expect the sharpness and color quality that you're used to from other kinds of cameras. Remember, Polaroid cameras were mainly used to take quick, mediocre snapshots of people, mostly as cheap mementos, not works of art. The goal of good Polaroid photography is to use the varying fuzziness and color distortion of the photos to your advantage, shooting large, colorful, subjects with a lot of light contrast for best results.


In general, you want to be at least a few feet away from your subject when shooting. Even though many cameras have a ""close up lens"", it's still only effective within a foot or two of a subject, and your picture will probably be even blurrier than it would've been otherwise.

, Look for groups and photography websites devoted to Polaroid photography and get your work noticed. The Impossible Project also allows users who purchase their film to post example photos to their galleries. Good instant photography is still somewhat rare, but it always impressive. Share photos and tips with others, and be proud of yourself for being a pioneer in the movement to revive instant photography.

Get the film developed and scanned (don't bother doing the last part yourself).",How to Use a Canon T50 35mm Camera4,", Keep going. You'll feel the crank get stiffer for a bit, then there will be a very obvious release of tension as the camera lets go of the film. Turn it a few more times after that., Then drop the film out., Show the results off to the world. Thanks to its compatibility with some extraordinarily cheap lenses with great optics, the results you get from this camera will be every bit as good as the results from more complicated and expensive cameras like the Canon A-1, or even pro cameras like the F-1. The T50's lack of manual settings is loved by experienced photographers even as they curse it; it forces the photographer to think about nothing but how well they are composing the picture."

Arrange frames in a flexible grid.,
Jigsaw puzzle together same shape frames in patterns.,
Use a variety of frame sizes that are the same color.,
Contrast your frame color with your wall color.,
Create a sense of warmth on empty walls.",How to Display Your Family Photos1," A grid pattern normally displays pictures in orderly columns and rows. This may not be feasible if you have many different kinds of frames you want to use to display your pictures. In this case, you might allow some framed pictures to take up two rows or columns (or more), in a flexible grid pattern.


While using a flexible grid, try to preserve enough of the row/column structure so the grid pattern is still obvious. This will keep your hung pictures looking neatly arranged.;
, By orienting pictures with the same size and shape frames in different ways, you can create jigsaw puzzle effect to display your family photos. Some pictures may be oriented portrait style (up and down), and others landscape style (left to right). Put these together like Tetris pieces to create a unique design.


If you buy discount frames in bulk, this can be an inexpensive, visually appealing, and original way of displaying your pictures.
Your pictures don’t have to fit together perfectly. You could create interesting patterns by leaving some gaps between pictures in your jigsaw puzzle design., This is an excellent way of displaying pictures that are different sizes. Especially if you’re hanging your pictures on the same wall, using like-colored frames will unify your display even with frames of different sizes.


With an assortment of photo sizes, you may want to use thicker frames for smaller photos. The added boldness can bring prominence to smaller pictures that are surrounded by larger ones.
If you have a frame that you want to use but isn’t the right color, in many cases you can use a suitable spray paint to convert it to your desired color., In many cases, a bright red colored frame will draw eyes right to your hung pictures. But these kinds of bold, contrasting colored frames might be hard to find at typical general retailers or home goods stores like Target, Walmart, or Michael’s Craft Store. In this case, you might use a suitable spray paint on your frames before inserting your pictures.


Before you go to the hardware store or a general retailer to purchase spray paint, check your frames to see what they are made of. Wooden, plastic, and metal frames will require different kinds of spray paint.

, In unadorned spaces, like hallways, you can draw focus to your pictures while adding warmth to the display with wooden frames. Use a clean white mat background behind the pictures in the frame to create a visually unifying effect in your photographic arrangement.


To create a blending effect between your pictures and the wall color, you might want to choose a similar shade as the wall color for the mat background.
To give your photographs extra pop, you could choose a color that contrasts the color of your wall for the mat background of your photo.
Before cutting mat backgrounds for all your photos, try a single picture and see how it looks when hung on the wall. This way, it’s less likely that you’ll end up with a color scheme you dislike."

Attach family photos to a lampshade to display them.,
Create a wireframe for vintage pictures.,
Double frame pictures with an outer ornate frame.,
Change your photos into magnets.,
Install a picture frame shelf.",How to Display Your Family Photos2," Choose a plain, inexpensive lampshade. A lighter color lampshade will permit more light through, giving your photos a backlit appearance. Remove the shade from the lamp, if it hasn’t been already, and then:


Use a paintbrush to thickly layer a clear adhesive, like shellac or decoupage, onto the surface of the lampshade. Take your photos and stick them onto the adhesive in whatever arrangement you desire.
Take your paintbrush and apply another layer of adhesive to the surface of your pictures. This outer layer will protect your pictures from damage and will seal them between adhesive layers.
Allow the adhesive to dry. The time this takes may change depending on the kind of adhesive you’ve used. Follow your adhesive’s directions for best results., Vintage pictures attached to the frame with clothespins will give the impression of an old-time darkroom since pictures were often hung up on a line by clothespins in darkrooms. Suitable, widely spaced wire mesh can be bought at most hardware stores for use as a wireframe.


Choose a wire mesh that is somewhat thick. Wire mesh that is too thin will be flimsy, and may not support your family photos well.
After you’ve bought your wire mesh, hang it on a wall with wall hangers, small nails, or even adhesive hooks. Then clip your family pictures to the wireframe with clothespins.
You may want to buy extra wire mesh so you don’t run out. You can always trim the mesh down to size with a pair of wire snips., Ornate vintage frames can really add a sense of dignity to a picture. However, your pictures may not be large enough to fit overlarge frames without the composition becoming unbalanced. To maintain balance, hang pictures in simple frames inside of overlarge frames already hung on the wall.


In some cases, your ornate frames may be many different colors. Use a suitable spray paint to create a uniform color scheme in your frames so the color scheme pulls all your pictures on display together.
Overlarge vintage frames can often be found inexpensively in secondhand stores. These may have pictures in them already, but the pictures can removed, and your framed family photos hung inside of the larger frame once it’s attached to the wall., The refrigerator usually takes a prominent spot in the kitchen, which makes it a solid choice for a photo display. Additionally, if you have young children, guests might want to see your child’s accomplishments, like a good test grade or art, on display there. When looking at these accomplishments, if you have photo fridge magnets, they’ll see your family photos, too.


There may be companies that print and assemble magnets with your photos on them. However, if you have difficulty finding this service online, or if you want to save money, print your photos on paper with adhesive backing. Then attach the photo to a magnet bought from a hardware store or general retailer., The most common kind of picture frame shelf is called the gallery ledge. A gallery ledge is essentially a sill built into a wall or several walls in your home. Pictures can be placed on this sill, and displayed clearly for everyone to enjoy.


In many cases, you can buy the parts for a gallery ledge shelf at a local hardware store, or you could buy a pre-made one from a home furnishing store or general retailer, like Ikea, Target, or Walmart.
There are other varieties of picture frame shelf you might use to display your pictures. For example, you might make a hanging shelf or use one of these ideas to design your own wall shelf display.
You can create a greater sense of cohesion between your pictures and the frame shelf by painting your shelf or frames so they match."

Show off photos with digital frames.,
Set photo albums to devices as screensavers.,
Use a digital file to create a custom wallpaper.",How to Display Your Family Photos3," A digital frame is a kind of device that you can upload family photos onto. After that, the frame generally rotates through the photos uploaded to it. This kind of display can be especially convenient if you have a lot of digital pictures.


Digital frames can be bought at most general retailers, like Target, Walmart, and so on. You might also be able to find these devices at memorabilia stores, like the Hallmark Store, or stores that sell technology., If you have a few TVs, computers, tablets, or similar devices in your home, you may be able to set a photo album as the screensaver. You’ll have to check the user instructions for your devices to see if this is possible, but in many cases, you should be able display your family photos on most devices not currently being used.


You might set pictures you’re especially fond of as the wallpaper on your phone or other devices, or you might use a digital photo album to have your phone cycle through family pictures.

, You can turn your favorite photos into a mural that covers an entire wall. To do this, you’ll need to find a suitable company that prints custom wallpaper. Then send that company a high-quality copy of the photo you want turned into wallpaper.


You’ll likely have the best luck finding a suitable wallpaper printing company with an Internet keyword search for “custom wallpaper” or “custom wall murals.”
When submitting a photo to be changed into wallpaper, choose the highest quality/resolution photo you can. This will prevent the photo from becoming too distorted by the enlarging process.
Due to quality issues, it may be impossible to use some photos as a wall mural. Slight distortion can be hidden by printing the wallpaper in black and white or sepia tones."

Don't get prints.,

Go for a longer development time.",How to Get Into Film Photography on a Tight Budget," Check eBay or other online auction sites to find a used camera. There are several things you can do to find the best camera at a good price:





  A tiny plastic Nikon F55 film SLR camera, dwarfed by an enormous Nikon digital SLR.

Buy a cheap plastic autofocus SLR if you already have compatible lenses for it (if you have a digital SLR, for example). Plastic consumer cameras like the Nikon F55 and Canon EOS 300 sell for absurdly low prices. You may look silly shooting them, but the results you will get from these little cameras will be identical to those you would get from a much bigger and heavier professional SLR costing thirty times as much.
Beware, however, of lenses that are specifically designed for digital SLRs, which usually have smaller sensors than 35mm film. They either won't mount on your camera (like with Canon lenses marked EF-S), or they won't cover the full 36x24mm frame (Nikon's DX lenses).
Basic autofocus zoom lenses a few years old are also inexpensive used. They are not good for low light, and not great in the moderately low light their maximum apertures permit, but about as good as any others at f/8 to f/16 (past that, diffraction limits the resolution of all lenses) except in trivial cases such as with brick walls. Autofocus lenses can help you save money from wasted pictures if you have trouble focusing manually, and are much better for moving subjects (which autofocus film SLRs can track and predict, though digital SLRs are much better for capturing single decisive moments reliably through bursts of photos, such as in sports).




 Cameras and lenses from obsolete camera systems, like this Canon A-1 and 50mm f/1.8, sell for absurdly cheap prices.

Buy into an obsolete system. Demand for lenses from obsolete camera systems, meaning those completely incompatible with today's digital SLRs, is much lower, because nobody is buying them for use with digital. A couple of examples are Canon FD mount cameras (like the Canon A-1 and T90) and Minolta manual-focus cameras.




 Prime lenses in normal focal lengths are very cheap and sharper than lenses that cost several times as much.

Buy simple prime lenses. ""Prime"" means a lens of a fixed focal length (i.e. not a zoom). ""Simple"" means lenses that are easy to manufacture. Very wide, and/or very fast, lenses cost more because they need very complex optics; lenses of sensible speed in normal focal lengths don't require complex optics and, consequently, are much cheaper. Best of all, these will permit you to shoot in less light and get sharper pictures than you would with a slower, more expensive, and heavier zoom lens. Look around for a 28mm f/2.8, 50mm f/1.8 (or f/2 if you're looking at Pentax), and 135mm f/2.8.
Alternatively, don't buy a camera. You probably already know several people who have an old, unused film camera or two whom you might be able to convince to lend one to you, or even give it to you.;
, Colour negative film can be developed very cheaply just about anywhere; slide film requires a very different process called E-6, which only a very small number of photo labs do. You won't get the same punchy colours that you can get on slide film (though some negative films, like Kodak Ektar 100, come close), but then you won't need to take out a bank loan to pay for each roll to be developed, either. On the other hand, the slides only need processing and then can be directly seen on a projector but with film you might want prints, which can be expensive. (If you intend to scan to digital, you only need the negatives.)
If you like the look of black-and-white film, there are a couple of films that can be developed in the standard C-41 process used for colour negative films. Look for Kodak BW400CN (relatively low-contrast, great for people photos) and Ilford XP2 (high contrast).

Slide film has a much smaller exposure latitude and thus a much greater failure rate than print film except where one is consistently very precise, which doesn't suit many kinds of subjects. Projecting slide film destroys it in a matter of hours; regular slide shows do gradually consume the pictures' longevity.

, While other film formats will offer more surface area (and, consequently, more resolution, and less grain at a given enlargement), many minilabs will not be able to develop and/or scan it, which means you'll have to go to a much more expensive lab to get it developed.

Proper technique with a slow film such as Fuji Velvia or Kodak Ektar, correct exposure, a moderate aperture, and a moderate shutter speed or tripod, can produce very sharp, fine-grained photos with an old 35mm SLR or even a nice point-and-shoot (which should choose a moderate or small aperture and a moderate to high shutter speed on its own in bright light).

, Buy as much as you can afford. Like everything else, buying things in bulk works out much cheaper. Also, if you buy film that is close to the expiration date it's cheaper. Wrap it tight in plastic and throw it in the freezer. It will keep for years. Just make sure you defrost it in the plastic--otherwise you'll get condensation on the film.

Even kept in a freezer, film eventually deteriorates and high-speed film - ISO 400 and above -- deteriorates faster. Long-expired film isn't worth the trouble of shooting and the cost of developing unless one wants special effects technically poorer than a cheap digital camera's photos.

, Your lab owns some incredibly expensive equipment and nearly all of them will have a scanner built into their mini lab. Most labs will get great results with their automated scans. Shop around., Film is ill-suited to action (sports, moving wildlife, and so on) that require split-second timing and usually need several shots taken in a second. That gets expensive; get a digital SLR for that kind of thing. On the other hand, film is great for stills, like landscapes, statues, and plants., Meaning, don't shoot in boring midday sunlight. Great light happens in the early morning and late evening, within about a one-hour window before and after sunset and sunrise. The better the light, the fewer mediocre pictures you'll take, which means more winners per roll, which means you're not blindly shooting tons of film in the hope of getting one or two good ones, which saves you money!, Rather than blindly shooting, learn to see. Spend a few minutes refining and simplifying your composition. More winners per roll means you'll be spending less on film., If you've got a motor-driven camera, set it to its single-frame mode. If you've got an add-on motor drive, leave it at home (or keep it on your camera but turn it off, because they look seriously cool). You can easily find yourself taking several shots of the same thing if you have some film-burning motor-driven monster. Your roll won't go as far, which means you'll be wasting money., If you want a darker picture you can adjust it on a computer, but you can't add detail that isn't there. Two or three stops over shouldn't blow out most of the highlights badly. (You could bracket exposure, but this is an article about how to get decent results for cheap.), If you're looking to show off your work on the Internet, the following process usually works out quite a bit cheaper: Just get your scans toasted to a CD, and if there are some you really like you can always get them printed later at a very reasonable price. The pharmacy CVS, the warehouse store Costco, and the mail-order processor Dwayne's Photo will inexpensively process and scan film without printing it. Costco and Dwayne's Photo tend to have multiple knowledgeable staff at any given time and use higher resolution., Unless you're terminally impatient, rather than go for one-hour developing, get it developed next-day, or maybe over a few days if you're extremely patient.
On the other hand, some labs will give you a free film if you go for one-hour developing. Sometimes these give superb results, so take one for a spin."

Place your transfer paper image on the pad and begin to press the iron on the pad in back and forth motions.,
Peel the paper away starting at one corner, - Note that transfer papers vary in whether you should peel when they are hot or cold.,
Finished.

,, For best results try to work with an image of at least 100K. A 25K image will print but it will not be as sharp and crisp when blown up to 8x11 as a high resolution image.

, Make sure it prints the image on the entire 8x11 sheet, not just on 1/4 of the page.


Test on cheap (vs $2 transfer paper) blank white paper to make sure your image is correct and your printer is printing through all it's heads. Epsons especially are notorious for a few clogged heads in the middle of a print then the rest of the print has horizontal lines in it.

, Make sure you insert the paper with the printable side the correct way. If reversed there goes $2-$3. Once the paper is in the printer facing in the correct direction press print.

, The iron will not give as much pressure to the transfer paper as a heat press would. The downward pressure from a heat press is what burns the image into the pad making for a pad that lasts for years and years. The iron will create the right heat but not as much pressure so your pad may have present or future issues with bits of it flaking off.

, Note the temperature needed. Normally it's around 375 degrees but could vary with the manufacturer of your paper. Set the iron to that temp and let it heat up. Once heated up place your pad on a hard surface. An ironing board works well.

, Try to bear down on the pad with some pressure. A limp wrist ironing job with light pressure will make for a poor pad. Consult your transfer paper instructions for the length of time needed to iron the paper. Most times it's around 3-4 minutes.

, Follow instructions for the type you purchased.


Note:Once you begin to peel the paper away do not stop halfway through! It will leave a line on your pad. Try to pull off the paper in one steady evenly spaced movement. Normally you should peel paper off in about 3 seconds. One long even movement of peeling the paper across the pad.

Pick a theme.,
Decide on the content.,
Ask people to contribute.",How to Make a Memory Book1," Whether you're making a physical or digital memory book, the first thing you need to do is decide what you want your book to be about. Common memory book themes include:



Family members – Make a book about a specific loved one. In addition to photographs, you can also include things he or she wrote (like letters and postcards), drew (like pictures your child has made), or anything else that is flat enough to fit inside a book or to be scanned into a computer. You can also include documents associated with this person, such as a report card, a copy of a birth certificate or marriage license, or a birthday card he or she received. If your child is young, you can start a memory book now and add to it as he or she grows up.

Events – Weddings, birthdays, bar/bat mitzvahs, quinceañeras, graduations, and anniversaries are all popular choices when making a memory book. Holidays, like Christmas or Valentine's Day, are also common themes. If the event or special day happens annually, you can add a new page or chapter each year.

Vacations – Use your memory book to relive a fun vacation or share it with others. This is an especially good idea if you went to an exotic location and took a lot of pictures. You can also include things like your plane ticket stubs or even a pressed flower you brought home with you. If this is an annual family vacation, consider adding a new chapter each year.

More specific combinations – This option is especially popular for parents making a book of their child or children. They can be about one specific event, such as ""Duane & Derrick's First Halloween,"" or one that covers a longer period of time, such as ""Melissa's First Year of School"" or ""Becky's Birthdays from Six Through Ten."";
, There aren't many rules for what you can include in a memory book. Just make sure whatever you add fits your chosen theme and, if you're making a physical memory book, make sure that all of your items are relatively flat and can be attached to the pages with ease.


Physical memory books often include photographs, illustrations, poetry, quotations, ticket stubs, greeting cards, programs, postcards, stickers, and even small mementos like coins or tokens. Each item is often paired with a written explanation for its context.
In addition to photographs and other scannable documents, digital memory books can also feature sound and video.
Remember that a memory book is different from a general photo album. Don't include every related photo you've shot. Instead, choose only a handful that tell a story.

, Many memory books are made through collaboration. Consider asking other people to help make your memory book. They can help by either making a particular page or chapter or by simply submitting photos and other items they may have.

Attach your items.,
Write about your items.,
Decorate your memory book.",How to Make a Memory Book2," The book itself will be the foundation of your memory book, so choose wisely. Any type of notebook will do, as long as it contains acid-free paper.


In general, scrapbooks work best. These can be found in most general, stationary, grocery, craft, and even convenience stores.
If you plan on creating your memory book over time, consider picking a type of notebook where extra pages can be added as needed. Some scrapbooking albums allow you to attach new cardstock pages, while you can also always easily add new pages to a ""book"" made from a simple three-ring binder.
Many retailers, such as bookstores and hobby shops, sell ready-made memory books for particular occasions. These memory books typically contain fill-in-the-blank text and places to put your photos. They may be a good choice when making your first memory book if you are uncertain of how to format it.

, Once you have your book ready, you'll need things to put in it. Gather together all photographs and other elements you'd like to put in your book. The only other materials you must have are a pen and adhesive.Your adhesive may be any type of glue or tape. Make sure whatever you use is acid-free. Archival glues meant for books and paper projects will produce the best results. However, a simple glue stick will also work.
You may also choose to include small items related to your book's theme.
You may want to decorate your memory book with embellishments. These decorations may be directly related to your book's theme or content, such as die-cut snowflakes for a book about winter or pumpkin stickers for a Halloween chapter. You may also use purely decorative embellishments, such as glitter and rhinestones, that may not strictly match your book's theme.

, Once you have everything in one place, it may help you to sketch a layout or arrange your items before actually attaching them to the page. It's a good idea to figure out a layout before you glue your items permanently in place.


You may choose to arrange elements items in any way you think looks nice.
A common format for store-bought memory books is to include a place for a photograph on one page and fill-in-the-blank text on the page opposite.
Include large embellishments when determining your layout.

, Instead of using uncropped rectangular photographs, you may want to crop them into other shapes. This will help your memory book to have a more interesting, cohesive feel.


Crop photos for shape. You may choose to trim a photo so that it better fits in your page's layout. Thematic shapes, such as a heart for Valentine's Day, are another cropping option.
Crop photos for content. If a photo includes certain aspects that don't fit with your memory book, see if you can trim them away. For example, a picture of your friend at the beach may be cropped to remove strangers
Use a pair of sharp scissors to get crisp edges.
Cropping may be done before the layout step if you are planning to crop a photo a certain way regardless of page design.

, For most of your elements, you will likely use some form of acid-free glue. Simply spread a thin layer of adhesive on the back of each item and stick it in place. Use your fingers to smooth each piece flat and wait for each page to dry before turning to the next one.


Some three dimensional objects may require a different type of adhesive. Double-sided sticky tape or scotch tape may be good alternatives.
If your memory book pages are thick enough, you can sew items onto the paper.Because different glues can have very different set times, check your particular glue's packaging for how long they should take to dry.

, Describe your pictures and other elements. Explain what they depict and/or why they are important. These can be simple words (like ""Grandma Rose, September 28, 2015""), phrases (""This was dad's favorite song.""), sentences, or even whole paragraphs. You don't need to write a caption for each item, but it helps to flesh out your memory book and distinguish it from a photo album.If you are including poems, lyrics, or quotations, you may also choose to handwrite them instead of using a clipping or print-out.
If you are working with a pre-made memory book, simply fill in the blank spaces where appropriate. You may also choose to write more in the margins.

, Add any finishing touches to embellish your book's content. This is the time to add things like glitter, smaller stickers, stamps, and ornamental designs. Try to use your embellishments to reduce the amount of blank space.


If your memory book tells a story, lay them out in a way that draws the reader's eye across the page to each item in the correct chronological order. A simple trick for this is to connect each item in the desired order with a line or ribbon between them.Once you've finished decorating, your memory book is ready to share.

"
"
Find a template or program you like.,
Ready your content.,
Pick a consistent style.,
Design your memory book.,
Share your memory book.",How to Make a Memory Book3," Search the web for resources for digital memory books and scrapbooking. You have a couple general options when it comes to digital memory books:


Websites that allow you to put together your memory book for display online. These sites act as aggregators where you can add and arrange digital content into virtual albums. Some of these websites focus only on pictures and their captions, while others allow you to also share stand-alone text, videos, audio, and URLs. You can either upload your own content or add content already on the web to your digital memory book.
Programs, templates, and websites for building a more traditional memory book which may be published later as physical hard copies. These will allow you to select a size and format for your memory book and arrange pictures and text onto each page just as you would a traditional memory book. They are often paired with an integrated print service that will allow you to order a printed, professionally-bound copy of your book.Even if you decide to keep your book digital, these services can be used to create shareable files.

, Scan or download all elements you plan on including in your digital scrapbook. Make sure to optimize your content for your platform of choice.


If you intend on printing out your book, remember to scan and save your images and pages at 300 DPI (dots per inch) at minimum. Save as a TIFF for perfect image quality.
If you intend to keep your book entirely digital or publish on the web, compressing images to lower their file size is likely appropriate. JPEGs are generally good for photos but often introduce artifacts. GIFs are more appropriate for text or simple art but are limited to 256 colors and don't work well with photos.
PNG-formatted images can be of good enough quality for print while not being too big for the web.With modern high speed Internet and large hard drives able to handle larger files, this format is becoming more common.
Some digital memory book programs have their own built-in image editors. However, you will likely need to touch up your pictures with an image editor before importing them. Adjust contrast and brightness and correct colors as necessary. Crop your pictures digitally just as you would with scissors.

, Although not entirely necessary, choosing and sticking to a font (or set of fonts) and color scheme for use throughout your book will give it a much more professional look. You can use text with multiple fonts, colors, and sizes in the same project as long as long as each is used for a different purpose. For example, you could use large all caps purple lettering for titles with smaller black text for your captions.


Pick colors that match your theme. For example, a memory book of your college years may use your school's colors.

, If you're using a template, allow it or your software to guide you through the process, adding text and pictures where necessary. If you are creating your memory book free-form, it will be up to you to decide how each page should look. Just remember that memory books should include both pictures and text. Use picture captions to tell a story.

, If you want professionally bound digital hard copies of your memory book, either use your software's printing service or find one online that's compatible. You can also choose to do an inexpensive version of this at home by printing out your pages and assembling them in a notebook or with binder clips. You may also choose to store your book onto disks or flash drives to share with others. If the file is small enough, you can even simply email the file out. If you're using an online scrapbooking tool, make sure your privacy settings allow it to be viewable and share the link to you page.

Preparations
Ceremony
Family Portraits
Bridal Party Portraits
Reception;
, Once you have categorized your photos it will be easier to choose your favorites from each collection. Next you will need to pick your top 15-20 images from each group. Keep in mind that an average size album will require only 100-125 images.

, Once you have chosen your favorite from each folder, right click on the images and copy to a separate folder. Duplicating the file is best so that you can have the images retouched or have filters applied while keeping your original file intact.

, An album should tell your wedding day story. Balance your image choices between the categories you've decided to include.

Narrowing down your selections from the Preparations folder to around 5-10 will allow you to increase your selections in other categories. Typically an album should contain 5-10 images of the bride and groom getting ready, one or two images of the church or event location and 3-5 detail shots such as the program, rings, shoes or flowers.






The ceremony itself is one of the most important aspects of the album so reserving 10-15 images tells a more complete story.






Next, select your family photographs and the images of the bridal party that you would like to include. The Family and Bridal Party shots typically take up the most pages in an album so allow ample space for both sides of the family.






The reception should include everything from the introduction to departure and everything in between so you may find that this is your largest category.







, Remember to include plenty of bride and groom shots because those images make the album more personal and intimate.

It will be easier to add and remove photos if you use a cork bulletin board. You can use some type of fabric or wrapping paper to use as the background. Assemble related pictures you want to use for the board. You’ll also need these:


Stapler
Glue or double sided tape
Scissors;
, An easy way to create a personalized background is by using your favorite wrapping paper. You can either use it as the full background or cut it into small pieces or shapes.When you have enough shapes, glue the shapes anywhere on the board. Tape the corners with double sided tape to make sure they stay down.
Either use double sided tape or glue to attach the full wrapping paper onto the board.
If you choose to use fabric, you’ll need to wrap the fabric over the front of the board. Once it is in a secure place, staple the fabric from the back of the board.

, Typically people cut up photos in interesting ways for photo boards. Cut out people’s faces or cut the photos into shapes like a heart. You aren’t required to cut up your photos if you'd rather preserve them.


You could also try using craft scissors to create fun patterns and edges around the photos., Experiment with the arrangements of the photos on the board. Glue the pictures down hard to make sure they stays, and remember to tape down the corners with double sided tape., Think of the things you like and then cut them out from old magazines. Glue them down to the board and if you are having problems with the corners, use double tape. Also, you can write out words that express yourself onto the board.


Use glitter and gloss to add a sparkling effect to the board. You could also paint stuff onto the board using nail polish."

,
Post process the batch raw images into individual images.,
Store each photo in the same ""lossless"" format as the original raw image.

,
Use a naming scheme that is similar to the raw naming scheme but shows that this is an individually processed image.,
Many photos, especially older photos, are not of the ""modern"" dimensions of 4"" x 6"" or 5"" x 7"".,
Store the extra post-it note information as a ""text"" layer in your image file.,
Store your final images in multiple formats for maximum future compatibility.,
Store your raw and final images onto a CD or DVD.,

Send copies of the final CD/DVD to any interested family members.

,
Print your own versions of the photos, include them in your own photo album.,
Make your own copies of the final CD/DVD and store them in a safe location, like a safe deposit box.,
Keep your data stored in multiple locations and in multiple formats.",How to Digitally Preserve a Photo Album," Do you know all of the people in the photos? Do you know where or when the photos were taken? Is this information clearly shown in the album? Sit down with your relatives and have an ""album party"" where you go through each photo and record who is who and any other information they know. You will learn more about your family than you ever knew before. You'll want to record those family stories as well. Record the entire session using a tape recorder if you have one. I recommend using small post-it notes to record information about each photo. You can then place the note near the photo in the album. DO NOT write on the actual photos to record the information, it will damage them permanently. And be sure that the stickiness of the post-it note will not damage the photos as well. If you don't have post-it notes or don't want to chance damage to the photos, then record the information on index cards or a legal pad, carefully recording the information for each photo from each page. Make sure you record it in such a way that it will make sense to you later after all of your relatives have gone home.;
, Do the pictures come off or out of the pages easily? Can you replace them when you are done? Does the album come apart so that you can handle each page separately? Once it comes apart, can you put it back together again? Are you going to replace the old photo album with a new one? All of these are important factors in how you handle the processing of the album. If the photos cannot be removed, then you will probably be scanning the photo from the album page itself. If the photos can be removed and replaced, you will probably be scanning them off of the page directly.

, Accept it now and move on with the scanning. Yes, you want to get the best quality scans from your efforts, but there will always be some degradation from the original. The scans will never be as crisp or exactly the same colors. There are ways to deal with that later. But just having a decent digital version of the photo, especially older photos, is a big step in the right direction, so don't let desired perfection get in the way of your actual work.

, Scanning each photo individually would be ideal, but it will take much longer. Put as many photos as you can reasonably fit into each scan and call this a ""raw"" scan. You can go back later and pull out each photo individually.

, Doing this will ensure that the information you recorded will be associated with the photo permanently in the ""raw"" scan. This will help later when you go to process the raw scan into individual images.

, You could just use consecutive numbers for each scan, like ""000-raw"", ""001-raw"", ""002-raw"", etc. Or you could use a description for each page, like ""page-01-raw"", ""page-02-raw"", ""page-03-raw"", etc. Think ahead about this. If you cannot remove the photos from the album pages and the pages are 10"" x 12"", chances are that you will need to do more than just one scan per page to get all of the photos on the page. How will you name your files then? ""page01-1-raw"", ""page01-2-raw"", etc?

, Going higher in the resolution or scanning in more colors will take proportionately longer and is probably not worth the effort. 300 dpi and millions of colors is typically sufficient and should match images that you would take with a modern digital camera.

, If you are using Photoshop store them in Photoshop format (.psd). Otherwise, store them in TIFF (.tif) format with the ""no image compression"" option. DO NOT store your original scans in JPEG format (.jpg or .jpeg). JPEG is a ""lossy"" format which means that image information will be thrown away in order to compress the image to a smaller file size. You may not see a big difference when you look at the scanned images immediately, but later when you start to process and modify the images, more and more image information will be lost. So, start with a format that does not remove any image information to start with. Any modern image processing software should at least support TIFF format. The file sizes will be larger, but it will be worth it for long term storage.

, All of this will mean better scan quality.

,, Using your image software crop and copy each photo into its own file. Rotate and adjust the photos so that they are oriented correctly (sometimes when scanning it may be easier to scan a photo sideways or even upside down).

,, For example, ""001-1"", ""001-2"" or ""page01-01-1"", ""page01-01-2"". When looking at the files in the file system, the files will be ""grouped"" together by their file names and you will know which raw file the image came from originally.

, This means that your images will get expanded to fit if you decide to make your own photos. You may not want this as it may cause the image to be blurry or cause portions to be cropped out. In order to avoid this, use your image software to change the dimensions of your image canvas to 4"" x 6"" or 5"" x 7"" (whichever is appropriate for the image) without resizing the existing image. Have the original image centered in the new canvas size. Now when you send the image for photo processing, the image will be the same as the original and it will be surrounded by white space. You can cut off the extra white space and mount the photo into your own photo album.

, Most modern image software, like Photoshop, allows you to add ""text layer"" to the file. This layer is maintained separate from the image itself, so the image is not modified. But now you can put the information around the image (like in the extra white space you added when you resized the canvas) and you will know the information for the photo.

, Different software or services need certain image formats. Image formats come and go. Storing in multiple formats ensures that you have formats you need and formats that will probably be supported in the future. I recommend the following formats: JPEG, TIFF, and Photoshop. Scanned images should not be stored in JPEG, but processed images, when completed, should have a version stored in JPEG format. Most photo processors will only work with JPEG format when you want to print the images, so you will need to have JPEG versions. Just don't use the JPEG version for further image modification, instead use the TIFF or Photoshop versions. TIFF and Photoshop (if using Photoshop) versions are stored to maintain the lossless versions of the image and to allow for different formats to be available. Not all image software can read Photoshop format, but most can read TIFF format. Having them ensures future compatibility.

, Include a ""README"" text file that explains what it is (the photo album history) and what you did (how you organized the images and files).

, Tell them to include it in the photo album for future generations.

,, Use the photo information you recorded as labels for the photos in your album.

, If your original copy is destroyed, you have a backup.

, Remember when floppy disks were 8"", then 5 1/4"", then 3 1/2"" and then hard drives came along, then CD's, and now we have DVD's? What data is stored on changes over time and it can happen quickly. You don't want your data to be ""lost"" or ""trapped"" in a format that you can no longer read or access. So, be sure you keep it in a medium that is current and supported. If you can afford to store it in the ""internet cloud,"" that would be great and it makes it easier to share it with others.

Gather your supplies.,
Measure and cut the batting.,
Staple the batting.,
Measure and cut your fabric.,
Staple the fabric to the board.,
Arrange your ribbons.,
Pin and staple the ribbons.",How to Make a Photo Board2," A ribbon board is a photo board that secures photos and materials with ribbons instead of tacks or adhesives. You’ll need a bulletin board that has a cork base to make it easier to pin photos into. Go to a crafts store to get a roll of low loft batting which will give padding to the front of the board. You’ll also need the following:


Fabric of your choice
At least 10 yards of ribbon
Scissors
Stapler
Pins, Unwrap the batting from the roll and place it over the bulletin board. Leave about an inch or two of excess batting overlapping the board. Cut the batting with scissors. If the batting isn’t wide enough to cover the full board, cut out additional strips to fully cover the board.

, Use your stapler to secure the batting to the board. Fold the overlapping batting over the board and make all staples from the backside of the board. Stretch out the batting slightly to avoid an uneven distribution.


Use your scissors to trim off excess batting. Only trim batting that is loose from being stapled to the board.
The front of the photo board is the side with the batting exposed.

, In a similar fashion to the batting, drape the fabric you choose over the board. It is important that the fabric covers the entire board. If your fabric isn’t big enough, consider using a larger fabric. Leave about an inch or two of fabric overlapping the edge of the board.


Make the necessary cuts with your scissors to create an even sheet of fabric.
It might be easier to use fabric scissors for this job., Spend time folding the fabric over the board. Ensure there aren’t any visible folds on the front of the board. Use your stapler to secure the fabric to the board. Again, only staple to the back of the board. This creates a clean appearance on the front of the board.


Trim off any excess fabric using your scissors.

, Cut your ribbons to measure the length of one corner of the board to the opposite corner. You can now arrange the ribbons in whichever fashion you prefer. One of the most popular patterns is the criss cross pattern.


You can make this pattern by spreading out your ribbons evenly at an angle. Then place your remaining ribbons at the opposite angle on top of those ribbons.
A successful criss cross pattern looks like a series of diamonds.
Use anywhere from 8 to 16 strips to create a criss cross pattern.

, Keep your ribbons secure while you are arranging them by using pins. Place a pin at each end of the ribbon. Once you’re satisfied by your arrangement, staple the ribbons down in the same way you did for the batting and fabric.

Stock up on paper.,
Cut the 12x12 solid pieces of paper.,
Tape the album together.,
Glue the decorative sheets to the album.,
Add your photos.,
Cut a piece of ribbon for your bow.",How to Create a DIY Photo Album1," Go to your local craft store to purchase paper for your covers and the subsequent album pages. Create your covers with a decorative heavy paper. The cover sheets should be made of heavier paper like cardstock and should have distinguishing details like patterned paper.
Create the album pages with solid sheets of paper that are one color. Sheets should have measurements of 12x12.;
, Divide the 12x12 sheets evenly in half to create two sections of 6x12 pieces. On each 6x12 piece, use a ruler to measure 3 sections that are 4 inches in length. Fold the 6x12 piece against each of the three 4-inch lines and press it firmly to make the folds smooth.


Measure and cut the heavy cover pages into two 4x6 cut pieces.

, Take both of the 6x12 inch sections of paper at their short ends and secure with tape. Fold the paper up like an accordion to discern where the album’s front and back covers will be., The heavy decorative paper from earlier will act as the front and back covers of the album. Place glue at the corners and sides of the page and place them firmly at the front and back of the album pages.

, Arrange photos on the remaining open pages of the album, placing them on available sheet: front and back. Do not glue photos onto the pages. Instead use photo mount squares on each of the photo’s corners to ensure that they are secure on their respective pages.

, Make sure that the ribbon is long enough to wrap around the entire length of the album when tying it. Use super adhesive glue to secure the ribbon on the back cover of the album. Tie the ribbon’s ends into a simple bow.Use your creativity to add designs. Use a glitter marker or a gold permanent marker and fill the cover with different drawings or words that have to do with who you’re creating the album for. Add stickers to the front and back if you desire to or even additional photos.
As an added personal touch, glue a metal label holder to the front cover to write a name or date.

Have some 100 watt light bulbs.,
Get some shop lights.,
If you need stronger light, get a halogen work light.

Have some goose necked lamps.,
Have a few 'sticks in a can'.,
Provide your own light diffusion.,
If you are using the halogen work light, take the sheet and put it into some type of frame around the light.,
Find a way to diffuse the light that your onboard camera flash has.,
Make your own lightboxes.",How to Make Homemade Photography Lighting," Be sure that they are marked 'Full Spectrum' or 'Daylight'.;
, They are fairly inexpensive and come with their own reflector. By shop lights, you are getting the equipment that a light would go into. This shot has a shot light with a clamp in it. With a clamp you can attach it to just about anything.

,, This is particularly helpful with tabletop photography. Goose necked lamps are the ones that you can bend and position as needed.

, If you have them at varying heights and sizes, you can use them just about anywhere.

, You can use the sunlight or a higher power light and then diffuse it. Some diffuse types of material are:


Shower curtain liners that are not transparent.
White sheets
Wax paper

, Be sure that the sheet is a few feet (about 3) away from the light or you risk a fire.


If you use this type of setup, have your subject be a few feet away from the diffuse light for best effect.

, Holding your fingers in front of the flash is not recommended.

, Basically, you want a way of diffusing the light through the side of the box to display the item in the box to advantage.

Purchase brown lunch bags.,
Stack the 3-4 brown paper bags together.,
Fold the stacked bags in half.,
Fill the paper bag pages with photos.,
Decorate the front and back covers of the album.",How to Create a DIY Photo Album2," Brown paper bags can be bought at either your local grocery store or at a craft store. For the pages, be sure to have at least 3-4 bags to use.

, Place them so that the side facing up alternates: one side opened, the next side closed., Form the folded bags into a book. Use a hole puncher to punch two holes into the folded paper book: one at the top left corner and one at the bottom left corner.


Thread ribbon into each of the holes and bring the ends together in the front of the album. Tie a bow out of the ribbon.

, Tape or glue the 4x6 photos into place. One photo should fit squarely on each page, front and back. A great way to arrange them is chronologically, but you can also get creative and place photos together that are similar in color.

, Use leftover wrapping paper or decorative scrapbook paper to add design to the covers. Place dots of glue on the corners of the paper and place firmly and smoothly against the covers.


Write on the front of the book with a colorful marker to use cursive penmanship as a way to name it.
Place another photo on the front cover to give a hint of what the album will be about and the kinds of photos it holds.

Decide what pictures you want in your photo album.,
Decide how to approach adding the photos.,
Decide on order.,
Add a few notes about that picture.,
Arrange your pictures in the album according to the order you have chosen.,
Label and date the album once it is completed.",How to Complete a Photo Album," Since the event of digital photos, the choice is endless but make your selection from only the very best photos you have.


The one exception to ""only the best"" is where you have no other photo of a person, pet, or place you visited than a not-so-great one and it's really important to have that photo included; see if you can Photoshop it to improve it.;
, Perhaps use a theme, such as a road trip you took, or a special event. If it's family and friends, choose photos that show them at their best, and doing things that are truly representative of them.


Other themes might be nature, pet, craft, woodwork, backyard, renovation, makeovers, etc.

, Do you want to chronological order (by age/years) or choose specific special events (such as birthdays, Christmas/Diwali/Hanukkah/school vacation time, etc.).

, While you might remember now, down the years it is easy to forget and other people who don't know anything will appreciate a little information added to the photos. There are several ways to add them - on the back or slide a note card in when you put in your pictures, or scrapbook a special card piece and add it.

, In terms of how you arrange them, that is dependent on the album. If it already has pockets or slots, you'll have to use those. If you're using a blank album and your own sticky photo tabs, arrange them as wished, perhaps in a scrapbook style, or in neat lines.


If using a pocket or slot style, check that the photos are right side up.

, Once full, place it somewhere that is easy to access by any member of the family to look at whenever they want. Enjoy viewing your memories for years to come.

Remove the photos from the album.,
Gently dry the photos.,
Soak any photos that are stuck together.,
Soak any photos drenched with a sticky or other liquid.,
Consult a professional.",How to Save a Wet Photo Album," If possible, gently remove the photographs from mountings or sleeves. If the photograph threatens to tear, stop. Instead, dry the photographs in place keeping the leaves of the album as open as possible.;
, The first thing to do after getting them out of the album is to dry them. The preferred method is to hang them on a line - this allows gravity to work on them best. The water runs down on the page (hang them from a corner, one clip only) toward the point, and keeps the paper from warping as the water's weight allows the top part to dry first, keeping downward pressure on the drying paper.


If you can't hang them, they will dry fine on an absorbent material such as a kitchen or paper towel, although they may be more prone to buckling here and there (harmless).
Do not blot as it could damage the surface.

, Water will not harm most photographs, as exposure to water is actually part of the chemical development process for conventional photographs. If photographs have stuck together: soak the photographs for at least an hour in lukewarm water. Gently peel apart.

, If the album was wet by another liquid: You may be able to clean off the substance by soaking and gently drying the photograph as above. Some liquids, like coffee, tea, grape juice, wine, and the like, may not come off very easily, however.

, Nothing worked? The photographs were damaged? A professional photography restoration may be necessary. You can find these services through professional photographers, antique restoration professionals, and sometimes through colleges and universities."

Angle your face.,
Focus on the eyes.,
Choose your camera position.,
Use a natural smile.",How to Pose for Pictures1," It is best to avoid taking a photo of the face straight-on. This allows for no shadows, which makes the face look wider and adds the extra “ten pounds” cameras are known for.


Angle your face slightly away from the camera, so that shadows are created along the cheekbones and the nose.
Tilt your chin down. Having a high chin looks unnatural, but also position the camera to look up to your nose. Try extending your chin, too. Or think about bringing your ears forward as you pose. This helps avoid a double chin and creates a line below the jaw.Avoid severe angles. Move you head comfortably, so that your pose does not look forced.;
, The camera should literally be focused on the eyes, but the composition of the portrait should also draw the viewer to your eyes as well.


Keep your eyes wide open, without looking scared. Avoid droopy eyelids which give a sleepy appearance.
If you want to look to the side, avoid looking fully away from the camera. This will close the eyes more and make mostly only the whites visible. Instead, look to the side only slightly off-center. Have the nose follow the eyes.The eyebrows are equally as important as the eyes in conveying emotion, so make sure that both are relaxed and match what they are expressing.
Keep your eyes closed for the few seconds before the photo is taken, to help avoid blinking mid-shot.

, Because the focus of portraits is the face, the camera should be positioned in such a way as to accentuate it. Higher camera positions are most flattering, though eye-level works well for most situations.


For the most natural photo, have the camera shooting at eye-level.
To convey power or dominance, shoot with the camera slightly below eye-level looking up.
Position the camera slightly from above to create a slimming effect and a stronger jaw line., Nothing can ruin a photo faster than a fake smile. Forced emotion will make the photo look just that - forced. Ignore your possible insecurities and smile naturally.


Always smile with your teeth. People with crooked, yellowed, or somehow imperfect teeth can have the tendency to want to try to smile with their mouths closed to cover them up. Don’t do this - natural smiles always show teeth. For your portrait to look real, bare your teeth a bit, even if only through parted lips.
When possible, have someone make you laugh. Real laughter produces some of the most beautiful photos and keeps you from having to think about your smile.
Wet your lips before smiling, either by licking them or applying lip balm. This will prevent any unsightly cracks and will add a little more light to your face."

Set up your camera.,
Get the lighting right.,
Make your subject comfortable.,
Choose your lens and frame your shot.,
Get your subject to maintain eye contact with the camera.,
Focus and take your pictures.,

Post-process your photo.,
Ignore this article.",How to Take Portrait Photographs," Where circumstances permit, use a slow ISO speed (lower number). In natural light, use ""shade"" or ""cloudy"" white balance if you have it; this leads to much warmer colours.See How to Take Better Photographs for further elaboration and advice.
, Those fortunate enough to have a photo studio can precisely control their lighting. They also aren't reading this; the rest of us will have to go out and find the right light. What you're looking for is consistent, and diffused lighting.




  Direct, harsh sunlight will cause ugly shadows to be cast on the subject's face.

Avoid direct, harsh sunlight from any direction. Apart from a few hours of soft light in the early morning and afternoon, direct sunlight is largely unfavourable for taking portrait photos. Looking into the sunlight will cause your subject to squint, and harsh light from behind will make it more difficult to get a consistent exposure.From any other angle, it will cast harsh shadows on the face (including the horrid ""raccoon eye"" effect from direct overhead light). Overcast days are best, as clouds will diffuse the sunlight;although since making your own cloud isn't typically an option, head for the shade.
Fill the shadows. Sometimes you'll have no choice but to take photos in direct, harsh sunlight. If your camera has a flash sync speed fast enough, use your flash to fill the shadows. If not, get your subject or an assistant to hold a piece of white or colored card to bounce the sunlight into the shadows. You could use your self-timer and hold it yourself.Don't rely on your flash. That is to say, if you don't have a ton of studio lighting (and you probably don't, since you're reading this), don't count on your flash to illuminate your scene or your subject. Using it to fill in shadows is fine; depending on it as your only source of lighting is usually a bad thing. Go outside if weather permits, or get more natural light into your scene by getting closer to windows if it does not.

, A comfortable subject will feel happier, more relaxed and less ""posed"". This will make for much better shots.

Get to like your subject, and have them like you. If you have time, talk to your subject. Learn to be genuinely interested in other people. Or fake it). As one photographer writes about the famous photographer Elsa Dorfman,



Elsa has the same kind of studio, background, lights, and equipment as a lot of folks with more technical skill. Yet those folks aren't portrait photographers and Elsa is. What's the difference? Elsa cares about people. She is genuinely curious about people she has never met and can connect with them in just a few minutes. After a one-hour session, she knows more about her average subject's life than I do about my sister's.Get them comfortable with you having a camera around, time permitting. Many, probably most, people freeze up and feel awkward the moment you pull the camera out.




 Would you want to be on the other end of one of these?

Factor your subject's feelings in with your lens choices. This is not as strange as it might sound. A super-wide angle lens will require you to travel halfway up the nose of your subject in order to frame the photo properly. On the other hand, a subject might feel distinctly awkward at a monster Howitzer-sized telephoto pointing at them from 50 feet (15.2 m) away.
Give your subject something to play with. People with something in their hands will relax their shoulders more and feel less awkward than they would if they were standing around doing nothing.If you're taking body shots, have them hold something relevant to them as a person (for example, an executive might hold a book,a child might hold a teddy bear, a photographer might hold a camera, and so on). If you're not taking body shots, even better; find something to keep their hands occupied. Try a stress ball or something else that gives your subject something to do.

, There are three primary ways to frame a portrait; which you will choose is a matter of artistic judgment.
The head-and-shoulders shot. If you're starting out taking portraits, this is probably the best place to start. For this, use a telephoto lens. Ignore the myth of a ""portrait lens"". There is no optimal lens focal length for portraits.Longer lenses are good, because they force you to stand further back, and consequently, due to perspective, facial features like noses are de-emphasised (but see ""factor in your subject's feelings with your lens choices"" above). They also give the illusion of a shallower depth of field (i.e. blurring the background more).In accordance with the rule of thirds, have the subject's eyes one third of the way from the top of the frame. Set your camera to aperture-priority (Av) mode and use a large aperture to blur the background to make it less distracting (or if you have a ""Portrait"" mode on your camera, use that instead).
The body shot. All of the above applies. Have your subject stand at a slight angle to the camera; they will look slimmer and more relaxed.The ""environmental"" portrait, of people in action and in context. Compared to the above, this is difficult to get right and very easy to make into a mere snapshot, so tread carefully. Use a wider-angle lens for this sort of thing.




 Zooming in ""too close"" is one of many things which you can experiment with.

Everything else. The cost of experimentation with digital cameras is almost exactly zero. If you have time, try different and drastic angles, strange framing, zooming in ""too close"", and so on (see also ""ignore this article"", below).

, Eye contact can make or break a portrait. Unless you're looking for something a bit different, such as a soulful look off the edge of the photograph, then always make sure that the person you're photographing is looking at the camera and that you're focused on the eyes., If your camera has an auto-exposure and auto-focus lock, then meter and focus on the subject's face, lock, reframe, and then take your photo. Generally, the best place to focus your shot is on the person's eyes, which can be hard if you're taking the shot with a macro-lens and its' limited depth-of-field. To get sharp eyes, you may have to manually focus the camera on them, as most autofocus systems will typically focus on the nose instead., Use advanced photo editing software like GIMP or Photoshop. Correct the colour balance and remove any haziness. You might want to sharpen features like hair and clothing; smooth out lines and imperfections in faces (this latter part might not be necessary; the sharpening of other features in the photo will make skin look smoother, because our eyes perceive sharpness and softness relative to other things in the photo). Brighten the eyes using the ""Levels"" tool. Additionally, you can add makeup to your subjects digitally., Photography is an art, not a set of methods. You can follow all these steps and still take an uninteresting photograph that you dislike. Technically ""incorrect"" photos can be the most stunning, such as those which are hugely over-exposed, harshly lit, packed with ""distracting"" background detail, strangely composed, and so on.Know the rules, but know that you can, and should, break them whenever you see fit."
"
Angle your body.,
Get your correct footing.,
Find a place for your hands.,
Move your legs.,
Relax your shoulders.,
Add movement to your joints.",How to Pose for Pictures2," Taking a photo straight-on will add weight and make you appear disproportionate. Instead, turn at a ⅔ angle to give a slimming appearance to your body. Twist the shoulders away from the camera.Don’t slouch, make sure that your shoulders are back. Good posture will make you appear taller and thinner.
Focus on your thinnest parts. If you have a small waist, angle the camera to show off how small it is. If your legs are your best feature, then turn in such a way as to accentuate them. Make sure not to add bulk to the midsection by keeping your arm close to your torso. Instead, place your arm in a way that gives space between your waist and arm. Your photographer should be able to direct you.Pose in diagonal lines. This means that you position your body so that your arms, legs, and torso avoid being directly vertical.

, Don’t keep both your feet straight forward, as this will stiffen the rest of your body and make you look less comfortable.


Try angling one foot away from the other at about 90 degrees.
Place one foot on a taller surface to create depth to the shot.
Lean your weight on one foot. For females, shift your weight onto your back foot. This can help give you a flattering angle. For males, shift your weight onto your front foot to give you a more masculine pose., It may seem easiest to let your hands hang at your sides, but this can give a lifeless look to a photo. Instead, try different ways of posing your hands. Think about your arms, too. Guys who want larger arms may want to keep them closer to their bodies, while women who want thinner arms should make sure the arms are away from the body.Create movement with your hands as you put them into the position instead of just placing the hand. Placing the hand through movement helps create a more natural pose.Have your hands near your pockets. Pockets act as a natural resting stop for our hands, so pose with them resting over or slightly inserted into your pockets. For males, slipping your hand inside your pocket creates a nice pose.Put one hand on your hip. This pose is primarily used for women, but works wonder for highlighting your waist - the thinnest part of your body. It also helps avoid making your arm appear larger.Always bend your fingers and wrists. You will rarely stand or sit without either of these things occurring naturally, so recreate them in your photos. Guys can pose like they're holding small rocks, while girls can pose with longer, elegantly curved hands.Avoid having your hands open near your face. They are roughly the same size, and will make you seem out of proportion. If you keep your hands next to your face, close them slightly or tuck them partially in your hair.Avoid clasping your hands. Holding your own hand doesn’t seem natural unless you are in a sitting position., As with all posing, avoid stiffness. Keeping your legs relaxed and bent will make a photo feel more natural. Try crossing your legs at the ankles or calves if you are female.For males, try spreading your legs slightly.


Bend one knee slightly and place it in front of the other to make your legs appear thinner.
Avoid too wide of a stance, as this will look posed and unnatural. A wide stance can also show aggression, which is typically something to steer clear from in photos.
Shooting the photo with the camera from below will give the illusion of very long legs, a definite plus if you happen to be on the shorter side., Stiff shoulders can throw off the movement of the rest of your body. Your shoulders should never be directly facing the camera, but should always be turned at an angle.


Try shooting a photo from behind the shoulders, with your head turned back. This is an interesting new perspective and can make your body seem smaller.
Placing your shoulders on different planes can add depth to your photo. If you can manage, drop one shoulder so it is comfortably lower than the other., The saying for portraits goes, “if it can bend, bend it.” Bent joints are more natural looking than stiff ones. This includes your elbows, wrists, knees, hips, and ankles."
"
Focus on your assets.,
Get creative.,
Consider candids.",How to Pose for Pictures3," Because you are posing alone, you don’t have to worry about the way anyone else looks in your photo. Pose in such a way as to accentuate the best that you have to offer.

, Instead of a standard portrait, take photos that are idiosyncratic. There is no need for you to take a photo that looks just like the ones all your friends take. Instead, find a pose, background, lighting, or outfit that helps you to stand out as an individual.


Take a self portrait while doing something you love. Whether that be playing a sport, reading a book, or walking through nature, find something that people can identify as being something you enjoy.
Dress for your photos so that you can show off your unique style.
Feel free to use props to make your photo unique, but be careful of looking like you are acting with them., Candid photos catch you while you are doing something naturally, rather than being entirely posed. Although the best candids are taken while you are unaware of the photographer, good candids can be recreated through posing.

"
"
Keep things natural.,
Use different poses.,
Use different angles.,
Avoid a busy background.",How to Pose for Pictures4," The same rules apply to couples shots as with individual. If you are posing with someone else, try to avoid stiffness and inequality between the two of you. Make sure you and anyone else in the photo is acting equally relaxed so that no one stands out with an unnatural pose.


Don't take photos head on, make sure to angle your body., Instead of having a group of people all mimicking the same pose, allow everyone to stand comfortably in their own way or pose each person differently.


Having everyone pose differently gives the photo a natural look. It also helps avoid someone standing out as the best or worst if everyone is posing the same way., The tendency for group photos is to take them all from the front and center. Instead, try taking group and couples photos from different sides and directions to place the focus on different people in the group.


Instead of having everyone look at the camera, have people look at each other. This is a great way to pose if you are taking a couples photo. Look at each other or have one of you look at the other., Because a group or couples photo has more than one subject, having too much happening in the background can be distracting to the eye. Instead, use a shallow depth of field or a quiet background to place the focus on the people.

Pick your photos.,
Select the person.,
Copy and paste the figure.,
Resize the figure.,
Erase the extra background.,
Finish isolating the figure.,
Move the layer.,
Change the lighting.,
Match the color.",How to Add People to a Photo," When you are trying to add a person to a picture, you want to make sure that you have a picture of the absent person that matches the photo you want to add them to. For example, if you want to add your best friend to a picture of a group of friends on the beach, don't try to use a picture of her in a Christmas sweater. It won't look right and people will be able to tell that you manipulated the photo.


If you can find a picture where your friend is on a simple or uncomplicated background, that would be ideal. The busier the background, the more work you'll have to do when you erase it later.
You want the picture of the person you are adding to be as big or bigger than the one you want to add them to. If you have to enlarge the person you are adding, they will become pixelated and give away your hard work to make them look like they belong in the picture.
Also try to match color tone and lighting. If you are all on a beach, try to find one of your friend in the sun. You can manipulate the colors later, but it will be harder for you to work with later.;
, You need to open up the photo of the figure you are cutting out in Photoshop. Pick the lasso tool from your toolbar. It will be the icon that looks like a lassoed rope that is the third icon down from the top of the side toolbar. Start from a place near your figure and, holding down your left mouse key, loop around your figure. Once you get all the way around the person, the lines you drew will become highlight lines, which are dashed, moving lines around the edges you drew.


You don't have to be super precise, just make sure you don't accidentally cut off part of their body. The extra background that you grab will be erased later. , Now that your figure is highlighted, you need to copy the figure so you can paste it over into the group photo. Click on the Edit menu option at the top of the screen. From the pull down menu, click Copy. Now, you need to open your group photo. Once it is open, click on the picture. Then, go back up to the Edit menu and choose Paste from the pull down menu. This will paste your highlighted figured from the original image into the group image.


Instead of using the menu bar, you can also hit the control (or command on a Mac) button and the C button. This will copy the image as well. To paste, just click control (or command) and V., Now that your figure is in your image, you need to resize it to make it match the people in the group. To do this, you will use the Free Transform tool. Make sure the figure layer is selected, which you can do from the Layer window, which is typically on the right side of your work space. Once the figure layer is chosen, go to the Edit menu option and choose Free Transform. A box will appear on the outside of your layer. Holding down the shift key, click your mouse on the corner of the box and pull the box in, making the figure smaller. Keep shrinking until the figure looks about the same size as the people in the group photograph.


Make sure you hold down the shift key. It will prevent you from changing the proportions of the figure in the picture.
Instead of clicking the menu bar, you can click control (or command) and the T button to use the Free Transform tool., To make the figure look like she belongs in the image, you need to erase the original background from around the figure. To do this, you will need the eraser tool. To begin, click on the figure layer from the layer window. At the bottom of the layer window, there is a button with a grey rectangle with a white circle in the middle called the mask layer button. Click on this to isolate the image from the other layers. Now, click on the eraser tool on the toolbar on the left, which is about halfway down the bar and has a rectangular eraser on it. From the top of the screen, there are eraser options. Click the down arrow and change the size of the brush to something around 60 or 70 pixels by sliding the arrow over or typing in the new size. Also change the hardness at the bottom of the menu to 0. Now you can erase most of the extra background around your figure.


Get close to the figure but don't erase any part of the figure. The extra bits left around their body will be erased with a smaller brush.
If they are on a white or solid color background, you can use the magic wand tool to isolate the background and delete it. Just click the magic wand tool, select the color of the background, and then press delete once it is all highlighted., Now that the majority of the background is erased, you need finish removing all the excess background to isolate the figure. In your eraser options as the top, change the size of your brush to something between 20 and 30 pixels. You also need to change the hardness to at least 50. Once your eraser is done, zoom in on the picture by hitting the plus sign or changing the percentage on the bottom of your window. Get as close as you can, making the edges of the figure easy to see. Erase the rest of the background from the figure.If you mess up or accidentally erase part of the figure, you can simply press the undo button under Edit on the menu bar.

, Now that your figure is the same size as the rest of the group and is isolated, you need to move the layer to the position you want them to be in. To do this, make sure the figure layer is selected. Click the move tool, which is the one on the top of the toolbar on the left side of the screen. Once you click it, grab your figure layer and hold down the left mouse button while you drag it to the place you want it., Now that the figure is the same size as the others, you need to match the color of them. With the figure layer selected, click on the icon beside the mask button on the bottom of the layer screen. It has a bi-color circle on it. When you click it, a menu screen will pop up. Click on the Curves option, which will make a dialog window pop up. It will have a square with a diagonal line through the middle of it. Click on the line in the middle, halfway up from the middle, and halfway down from the middle. Each of the dots that appear will allow you to move the line. Now you need to play with the levels in this option. You can move the lines up and down, adding and subtracting light and contrast as you go. Play around with the layer until it matches the group layer.


If there is only a bit of a different between the layers, you can just change the brightness and contrast from the Image menu bar. Simply adjust the lines back and forth.
You may have a dialog box pop up with you try to make a Curves layer on your figure. When it pops up, press OK to make the Curves mask layer.
You can also change the lighting of the original group photo as well. If you want to change it, click on the background layer and pick the same icon on the bottom of the screen and follow the same steps as with the figure layer until the two layers are close to each other., Now that the lighting is right on your figure, you need to make the hues of their skin match. To do this, make sure your figure layer is selected. Press the same bi-color circle at the bottom of the layer screen and choose Hue/Saturation from the menu. From the screen, you can change Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. Hue will change the color the highlight and low light colors to a different color. Saturation will change the concentration of the colors on your, making them brighter or duller. The brightness will change the overall lightness of the figure. You should play around with the dials until the figure matches the color of the group."

Wait for the mixture to dry completely before using it.

",How to Make a Stick in a Can," You will want to have all of the supplies that you need handy. The time to realize you don't have the stick is not when you have mixed the cement.


Since cement is so heavy, you will want to take that into account. Two to three liter cans are a good size to start with. Additionally, low, wide cans are better than tall, thin ones because they have a broader base for balance.;
, Make it as straight as possible. If you have a right angle, you can be sure that it is completely perpendicular.

Avoid crowds.,
Do some research.,
Make your pictures tell a unique story.,
Connect with someone who will buy your photos.,
Sell your photos as quickly as possible.,
Establish ownership of your photos before sending them out.,
Negotiate a sale.,
Make sure you understand the sale contract.,
Verify that your photos are being used only as agreed to in the contract.",How to Take and Sell Celebrity Photos," Pictures of celebrities at events, such as the Oscars or movie premiers, where all the paparazzi are present, will generally be worthless because so many people have the same pictures. The really valuable pictures are the ones that no one else has--pictures of the celebrity in casual or intimate settings--and you'll need to get away from the crowds to get those.;
, Find out where celebrities hang out, what their daily routine is, and where they stay while on vacation. Reading the tabloids or entertainment news is a good start, but to get the rare shots, you'll need to do some extra investigation. Ask taxi drivers, nightclub personnel, and others who might have valuable information. Stake out the celebrity but keep a low profile.

, If you catch a celebrity in a compromising situation (cheating on a spouse, doing drugs, shoplifting, etc.), you've got pure gold. Photos of less damning activities can also be valuable. Getting the first picture of a celebrity baby, or simply catching a celebrity behaving in a way that is out of the ordinary, could earn you some big bucks when selling the photos.

, If your photos are big news, sell them directly to tabloids and entertainment publications. Look up their contact information on the Internet or inside a copy of the publication. If your photos are rare, but not necessarily earthshaking, you may not have much luck going directly to the publications, so try going through one of many agencies that act as middlemen between photographers and magazines. These agencies can also be found with an Internet search. Keep in mind that they will take a commission for finding a buyer.

, The longer you sit on a photograph the less valuable it becomes, because either others will have taken similar photos or it becomes ""old news."" Develop the photos immediately and get them onto the market immediately. In many cases, you are better off working with a professional photo marketplace that specializes in marking of celebrity images, e.g. paparazzle.com, SellCelebPhotos.com.

, It's a tough business out there, and unscrupulous agencies and publications may attempt to steal your photos. Develop your photos and add a highly visible watermark or use a knife to score them obviously down the middle. Then scan them into your computer and e-mail them to the buyer. Once you've signed a contract, give the publisher the original photos without the watermark or score marks.

, If you sell your photos through an agency, the agents will attempt to sell them to several different publications in order to get the best price. If you want to sell the photos directly to a publication, you should follow the same approach and contact several publications to start a bidding war.

, What rights of publication are you selling to the publisher, and what rights do you retain? Will you be paid royalties and an advance, or just a flat fee? Read the fine print and make sure you know how much you'll be paid, when you'll be paid, and how your photos will be used. You may want to hire an attorney to get clarification, especially if you are selling very valuable photos or if you sell a lot of them.

, Don't let the publisher or agent cheat you out of money by reselling your photos. Check the tabloids and other such publications to make sure your photos aren't being used where they shouldn't be.

Coordinate your outfits.,
Choose one outfit.,
Wear springtime colors.,
Pick clothes that represent who you are.",How to Take Springtime Engagement Photos1," Plan what you’ll wear ahead of time. You don’t need to be match perfectly, but wear outfits that complement each other’s. Wear a solid that shows up in your partner’s prints or plaids. Choose bright solids for spring. Decide if you’ll both be formal or casual.Try matching your shirts to each other’s shoes for a whimsical look.
Add a colorful accessory that highlights the colors your partner is wearing. For example opt for a tie or scarf that pops with a bright color in their outfit.;
, Keep it simple with a single outfit so you can focus on taking good photos without worrying about multiple clothing changes. If you want more than one outfit, choose one formal and one casual outfit. Mix it up by wearing a sweater or jacket that you can take off for a different look., Go for light colored clothes in pastels, whites, beiges, and grays. Bold, bright colors are also popular in the spring. Wear floral prints, light plaids, sundresses with a light sweater, blue suits, chambray, and khaki.Choose neutral colors if you’re posing in front of a vibrant background, like a field of flowers.
Spring is a great time to pick clothes that flow. Wear something that moves with you for a dynamic look in your photos., Capture a look that shows who you are as a couple. For example, wear more casual clothing if you’re laid back. Make sure that your clothes are flattering for your best look, especially because you’re creating a keepsake of your engagement.Engage a stylist or a free personal shopper from a major department store if you need help choosing flattering pieces that reflect your style as a couple.

Go to a garden.,
Take your photos on the water.,
Head to a farm or vineyard.,
Pose in your home.",How to Take Springtime Engagement Photos2," In the spring, look to gardens and other venues with flowers and greenery that showcases the beauty of the season. Try a botanical garden, zoo, or public park. In the city, find budding trees or other spots of green to highlight the season, even if the focus is on you near a favorite landmark.If you have a favorite location, take some shots outside to take advantage of the spring weather. For example, if you love the theater, stand near the marquee on the street.

, Go to the beach or a lake, especially if you love being on the water together. Try shooting some photos in a boat or barefoot on the sand. Take advantage of the spring weather being cool enough that beaches and lakes won’t be overcrowded.

, Use the new growth in these locations to add interest and a springtime look to your photos. For example, take some photos with young farm animals in the background to symbolize spring and new growth. Pose around some lush vines at your local vineyard, especially if you love wine.

, Take the photos at home, where you’re most comfortable. You’ll look your best in your comfort zone. Pick a sunny location to highlight the beauty of spring. Also emphasize the season by posing on your front porch, balcony, or in your garden."

Use vintage props.,
Hold a bouquet.,
Choose accessories and props that will complement your photo.",How to Take Springtime Engagement Photos3," Use a vintage car, old bicycle, or other antiques for a vintage theme. An outdoors photo with vintage props works really well in the spring. Combine flowers with your prop to emphasize the season.Accessorize with vintage jewelry, especially pieces that feature light gemstones or pearls.

, Gather some flowers for a small bouquet of spring flowers. Or wear a floral crown to show off springtime blooms. Add flowers or other greenery to shots inside or out. Look for brightly colored flowers to emphasize a springtime look.


Add springlike accessories, like scarves or ties with flowers.

, Find props that are appropriate to your setting, like an oar if you’re taking photos near the water. Also keep the background and any props and accessories low-key so the primary focus is on the two of you. Avoid anything that might distract from your faces, like clothes with patterns that overwhelm you, or overlarge accessories or props."

Get your reflectors.,
Keep it with you in your camera bag at all times.

",How to Use a Reflector in Travel Portraiture1," The best kind to get are the ones that will fold up very small with multiple colors of reflectors. There are several brands. Get what works best for you. You can bring larger ones that fold up in the same way for more elaborate shots, but you won't be carrying all of that gear while being a tourist!

"
Clarify your skin.,
Focus on what makes you unique.,
Show your emotions.,
Don’t look the camera straight on.,
Adjust the angle of your face.",How to Be Photogenic1," The focus of most portraits is the face, so make sure that yours is in tip top condition. Modern cameras are able to capture the smallest of changes and textures of skin, which is both a blessing and a curse. Keep your skin clean and smooth by washing, toning, and moisturizing your face before having your photo taken. Doing this should be a daily morning/evening ritual but is especially important before a photoshoot.

If you wear makeup, make sure that your concealer and foundation are smoothly applied and match your skin tone correctly. Blend them slightly down your neck and near your ear lobes to create the most natural look.
Oily skin can ruin a photo by reflecting too much light. Use oil blotting sheets or tissue paper (actual tissue paper, not Kleenex) to dab off excess oil on the T-zone of your face.
Use an exfoliator on your face to slough off any dead skin cells which make your skin appear dull and lackluster in photos.;
, One of the characteristics of photogenic people is their confidence in their appearance. Many times we get concerned about something wrong with our face; our freckles, the gap in your teeth, how squinty your eyes get when you smile. Instead of trying to hide those things, embrace them! You will look much more photogenic in your photos that way.

, It is easy to spot someone who is photogenic from someone who is posing; the former doesn’t have to fake their emotions. Although getting your photo taken can be nerve-wrecking, don’t let it get in the way of your true feelings. Don’t create the smile you think you need, use your regular smile. The same goes with the shape of your eyes and the curve of your cheeks. The more you allow your natural emotions to show on your face, the better your pictures will look.


Always smile with your teeth, because you would never laugh at a funny joke with your lips together. True smiles show off a toothy grin, not tightly pressed lips. Keep your face natural by allowing a real smile to peak through.When you are showing emotions your entire face is affected. Although many people associate a look of happiness with just a smile, your eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and forehead are all affected equally as much. Make sure that you are allowing freedom of movement in your entire face.

, As the old saying goes, “the camera adds ten pounds.” But it doesn’t have to! Because the camera is using reflected light to convert a 3D object into a 2D image, the shapes of things are flattened and compressed. Looking straight ahead at the camera will show the fullness of your face and remove/reduce any natural shadows. Instead, turn your face slightly to the side to create natural highlights and shadows and slim the shape of your face.

, The angle of your face is tied to the direction you are looking at the camera. Just as how you shouldn’t look at the camera straight on, you also should not tilt your head up when taking photos. This will make your face look larger and get a good shot up the inside of your nose. Tilt your head slightly down and to the side for the most photogenic of looks.

If you are in a darkened room or house and don't want to use your flash, position your subject appropriately.,
Position the reflector under the chin, about chest height or so, and make sure the reflector is reflecting any available light.

,
Open your lens as far as it will go.,
Make sure that your shutter speed is set high enough that you won't have to worry about camera shake, unless you are using a tripod.,
Set your ISO as low as you can get it.",How to Use a Reflector in Travel Portraiture2," You want him facing a direction that you will be able to utilize existing light.;
,, You want as much light to get in as possible.

, You will probably have to experiment with the different speeds. Too fast, the scene will be dark, too slow, your subject will move or blink, or any of a hundred different things.

, You probably don't want grain, so you don't want it high. Start out at about 200 and go from there.

"
"
Put your subject where you need them to be.

,
Expose for the background.,
Have your Fstop at about F8 or so.,
Take your ISO as low as it will go.

,
Again, have your speed where it needs to be to hand held and still get a picture.,
Holding your reflector (or having your VALS (Voice Activated Light Stand) hold it, reflect the light coming from the background back into your subject's face.

",How to Use a Reflector in Travel Portraiture3,", If you try to expose for the subject, then the background will be very blown out.

, Experiment with that.

,, It will probably need to be at over 1/200 or so.

,"
"
Sometimes, you will just have a darker location where the only light is from an open door.,
Use your school geometry to figure out the angles that you need to get a photo.,
Take the smaller reflector (if you are using various sizes) and direct the final light to where you need it on your subject's face.

,
Open your lens as wide as you can to get the shot you want.

,
Unless you want a grainy look, set the aperture as low as you can.,
Unless you are using a tripod (which wouldn't be a bad idea), be sure that the speed is going to get you an image.

",How to Use a Reflector in Travel Portraiture4," You might need to use multiple reflectors.

, There have been photographers that have used 4 or more reflectors for an image.

,,, 100 - 400 are good places to start.

Set your aperture depending on whether or not you want the background to show.,
Take your reflector and, while holding it, move it around so that the light is reflected back on the subject's face.

",How to Use a Reflector in Travel Portraiture5," A wide aperture will probably allow too much light, so you are better off with a narrower aperture.,"
"
Work your assets.,
Turn away from the camera.,
Bend your joints.,
Lean towards the camera.,
Do what’s comfortable.",How to Be Photogenic2," Photogenic people have the magnificent ability of knowing what their assets are and the best way to work them. This goes hand in hand with knowing your physical weaknesses. What parts of your body are the most attractive, and which might be a tad more unflattering in photos? Do what you can to play up your best parts while turning those more negative aspects of your body away from the camera.

, Facing a camera straight on does the same thing to your body as it does to your face. Your body will become flattened in a photograph, so a shot from the front will show you from the widest angle and make you look extra round. Turn ¾ to show your body from an angle and create shadows and depth in your pose.


To slim your arms, put one on your hip and angle your elbow back and away from your body. Although you may feel silly doing it, there is a reason many celebrities adopt this pose - it is ultra flattering!
If you are sitting for the photo, turn so that the camera is at your side rather than directly in front of you. Bend your knees and stagger your legs slightly. If you choose to cross your legs, cross the leg closest to the camera over the top of the other.

, How often do you find yourself standing or sitting perfectly straight, with all your joints in line? Probably very rarely or never. Add both movement and a sense of natural poise to your photos by allowing your joints to bend slightly. This means that your elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles should all be comfortably bent. If it can bend, bend it!

, The way we see things works so that things that are closer are larger while things that are further away are smaller. In order to create the illusion of a small, sleek body, lean into photos slightly with your head first., All the posing advice in the world can’t make you more photogenic if you aren’t comfortable with the changes. In the end, it is helpful to keep all the posing tricks in mind, but it is best to do whatever comes naturally to your body. Being photogenic means walking the thin line between acting incredibly natural like the camera is not there, and perfectly posing every inch of your body. The best way to reach this happy medium is simply to allow your body to fall naturally into its most comfortable positions.

"
"
Dress to impress.,
Find the light source.,
Choose a great location.,
Don’t be afraid of props.,
Act confident.",How to Be Photogenic3," It is truly hard to be photogenic if you are wearing your dirty sweatpants and torn-up sneakers. If you know you’re going to have your picture taken, choose outfits that photograph well. Neutral tones and muted colors work best because they simultaneously enhance your natural characteristics without distracting from you in a photo.


Avoid anything that hangs or drapes very loosely on your body, as this will look bulky and large in a photograph. On the other hand, don’t wear anything too tight as the flash from the camera will highlight every little flaw hiding under your clothing.
Don’t wear anything for photos that you wouldn't normally wear in real life. Your goal is to look like yourself at your very best; you can’t look like yourself if you’re wearing something totally out of your comfort zone or style range., The source of light in your photo will greatly dictate the quality of your appearance in the end shot. A light source directly above you will give you dark shadows under your eyes, while one from the side will create bold background lines. Work so that your light source is in front of you and slightly above you. Whenever you can, take your photos in natural light near a window or outside.


The best lighting for photos occurs in the hour after sunrise and the hour before sunset. When you can, try to take your pictures during these times.
Although some photographers can use light metering to add brightness to a dark foreground, it is best to avoid taking pictures with your light source behind you. A light source coming from behind will darken your entire body and ruin a great picture.

, Although the seat in your car or in front of your mirror may be the easiest places to perfect your pose and get good lighting, they don’t allow for the most scenic of backgrounds. Being photogenic has a lot to do with working your surroundings in addition to showing off your facial and bodily posing skills. Take photos in a comfortable environment where you are the focus.


Busy restaurants and bars add a lot of noise to the background of a photo, taking the eye off you as the subject. If you must pose in a crowded area, blur the background to keep the viewers eye on you in the foreground.
If you are taking a group photo, try to insert yourself in the center of the group and away from the ends. The two people in the ends of a group shot will always appear the largest and are not often the focus of a picture.

, Although you don’t necessarily want to be tossing around a football or holding eating utensils, adding fun and interesting props to your photo can add interest and highlight your idiosyncrasies. Hold something in your hands, lean against a prop, or incorporate something related to a hobby or activity you enjoy into your photo.


If you love reading, try holding a book casually in your hands. It will force your body into a more natural position and add detail to your portrait.
Don’t use large props or anything that is too distracting in your photos. The goal is for you to appear photogenic with the aid of something small and related. Adding in big props or anything brightly colored will do more harm than good.

, Confidence will show in a photo, and is the key to being photogenic. Even if you don’t feel confident, act like it for the camera. The quality of your appearance in photos will greatly improve with a bit of personal knowledge that you look good, and that your photos will turn out great because of it.

Check that you have everything you need before leaving.,
Arrive early.,
Try to select a background that is not going to overwhelm the parade action.,
Find a stable position.,
Be aware that timing of moving objects is critical.,
Focus on the detail and depth.,
Avoid leaving out the spectators.,
Adjust the camera to account for the contrasts of colors and light.,
Be ruthless in post-production.",How to Photograph a Parade," You will take many photos and the last worry you need is to discover the memory card is full from last week's party photos. Format all memory cards and charge all batteries before leaving. Make sure that you have spares of anything you need packed in the camera pouch. There is no going back for missed items once you have your great spot in the parade.


Take as little as needed. You do not want to be wearing a huge camera bag that sticks into spectators or makes you worry about thieves. One large, freshly formatted memory card already in the camera also means you do not have to fiddle with changing cards over midstream.
Only take a lens if needed. The aim is to get up as close as possible; is your camera capable at such close range? If so, try leaving the lens at home. That said, a ""moderate"" lens is useful for wide angles for bands, floats, and marching groups. A ""moderate"" telephoto is useful for candid close-ups of individuals within the crowd.You need to be the judge of your camera's flexibility with or without an additional lens.;
, Position is one hundred percent important for parade photographs because you need to be where you will get full shots of the parade rather than heads of people in the crowd. Decide in advance if the front row (a great place for candid, expressive, and larger-than-life captures) or higher up, such as on a balcony or stand is convenient for you. The abilities of your camera to zoom in might also affect your choice of where to position yourself. Also, be aware the angles from higher up may not be as interesting or detailed as being able to crouch down low and shoot up at floats and parade participants and to capture smaller participants, such as children and animals.


You may need to check out your position the day before; give yourself plenty of time to do so.
If it is raining or snowing, select a covered spot.

, Highlight the parade's characteristics, not the busy buildings and too much crowd behind.


Colors are important. Try to find neutral colors in the background, to let the colorful display of the parade elements and participants stand out more.






Consider the sun's position. Avoid any position where you are pointing your camera direct into the sun. If the day is sunny, use buildings to help block too much sun.







, People are likely to be excited at a parade and push for a desirable view. Should this happen to you while taking an image, obviously the image will appear blurred. There are ways to try to prevent too many blurred images:


Find a spot free of people. Settle in near seated parents and children or people whom are keeping careful tabs on a front row place. Parents are unlikely to leave in a hurry or bump around because they are keen to keep spots and the parade will captivate the kids' attention.
Use street objects as barriers or leaning spots, such as lampposts, mailboxes, fire hydrants, and fence barriers. Just be sure not to lean on anything that security will move you away from, or you will lose your coveted spot.
Control your own excitement. It is common to feel excitement seeing parade features come toward you in a parade and you may be keen to get that perfect moment that you cannot stop bouncing. Of course, this will cause your photos to blur. Have a little jump of glee first, and then take the photo. Sasha Gitin suggests presetting the exposure first and keeping the shutter speed above 1/250 seconds for action, in the hope this will counteract your own excitability.If you are going to use a tripod, you will need a position that is not at risk of being bumped or toppled by members of the crowd. This might need to be up higher than them.

, Floats and participants in a parade continue to move. Time photos to get them at the right moment, not after the float or people have past. It is easy to miss a great shot when the objects and subjects keep moving, especially if you camera is slow to take the next image. Learn quickly from your first errors and adjust your click timing accordingly.

Walk backward to take your photos if you are moving with the parade. This takes practice; have a spotter to point when you're about to trip over someone or something.







, Close out the crowd and extraneous features by zooming right in on a favorite parade character or features. Zoom right up to the queen of the little ballerinas is sitting high atop her throne, even at the expense of the other float participants. This is a method to capture her joy in a moment.


Be aware of keeping all relevant items in the frame of your image. Too much zooming can sometimes leave out important parts, like a person's head.







, They can make wonderful shots in and of themselves, rather than just as background. Try to capture their joy and excitement, especially when key elements of the parade arrive such as football stars, Santa or someone famous.


For many photographers, it is the spectators who make the parade what it is, not the parade itself. Watch carefully for spectator reactions and capture these as they happen. Having a good combination of both elements is important.






Look to see if there are great photo opportunities of people from windows or on balconies.
Take photos before and after the parade. People look forward to parades before the event, while after it; they will be happily chatting about a happy parade or appearing thoughtful after a more somber one (such as a war memorial parade).
Look for quirky actions, such as someone running into the parade or a streaker. These can happen quickly, so prepare for anything, and click away.

, Depending on the weather and light conditions, knowing how to change settings on your camera can make the photos better. For example:


Use the zone metering to adjust dull clothing in the crowd during cloudy and gray weather. Do not use the spot meter. Photographer Steve Philipp recommends doing a -0.3 –– -0.7 EV exposure compensation if you find that your photos of the crowd look dark and spotty.Again for cloudy days, use vivid colors and reduced contrast, enhanced sharpness with normal noise control, to help improve the overall colors.For sunny days, consider using a flash to cancel any intense glare or sunlight. Use a lens head or your hand to shade from the glare., Cut images that do not have a sparkle or element of interest in them. Crop them to remove clutter and to get to the heart of each shot. Put together at least a dozen of the best photos and you'll be able to enjoy the parade that day for years to come.


Be aware that if you don't cull all the less-than-satisfactory shots, you risk never looking at any of them again because it will feel overwhelming. Being ruthless with removing the bad photos while you are still caught up by the occasion is the best way to keep an uncluttered photo album.

Use polarized lens filters to minimize reflections on water.,
Apply your polarized filter to take pictures of the sky.,
Attach your polarized filter to your lens to make the colors of your subject more vibrant.,
Utilize your polarized filter to cut out reflections and glare.",How to Use Filters in Photography1,"


Polarized filters are like putting polarized sunglasses on your camera.
Minimizing reflections may enhance your photos by reducing glare and changing the hue of the body of water.;
,


Polarized filters can be turned, or rotated by hand, which changes the polarization effect on your camera lens.
When using a photography filter to take a picture of the sky, you can rotate the polarized filter to change the hue or block out fog or haze.

, For instance, when using filters in photography, you can make the leaves on trees stand out by turning the polarized filter until the leaves appear greener. Your view through the camera lens is the image that is projected onto the film or electronic sensor.

, For example, when taking a photo of a metallic object, your polarized filter may change the appearance of the reflections, just as polarized sunglasses do.

Use UV filters to sharpen an image by reducing haziness.,
Fasten an ultraviolet lens to all your lenses.,
Connect an ultraviolet filter to guard your lenses from dust.",How to Use Filters in Photography2," Ultraviolet light is invisible to the human eye, but a UV lens filter can access this light, which will eliminate some haziness.

, When using filters in photography, the UV lens will protect the surface of your lenses from scratches.

, The UV lens filter provides another layer of protection between your camera and your lens.

"
Employ color filters to change the contrast in black and white photography.,
Apply a red enhancing photography filter to make brighter reds, browns and oranges.,
Put a blue filter on your lens for use with indoor tungsten lighting.",How to Use Filters in Photography3," Apply a red, yellow or orange lens filter to sharpen the contrast of clouds. A color filter may make the clouds appear more bold or sharp.

, This lens increases hue saturation, and may work well with sunsets and red flowers.

, Tungsten lighting is produced by light bulbs, and cameras lose the array of blues. When using filters in photography, you may apply them to increase colors the camera does not record.

"
"
Utilize a neutral density (ND) filter to decrease the light that goes to the light sensor when taking pictures with a slow shutter speed.,
Employ a graduated ND filter to create gradual effects, such as a darkened sky and a bright foreground, when shooting photos with a slow shutter speed.,
Place a macro filter on your lens for close up shots.",How to Use Filters in Photography4," Sometimes, a slow shutter speed allows in too much light, which may create photos that are literally whited out.


The shutter speed is how long the shutter, or doors, to your film or electronic sensor are opened. The longer the shutter is open, the more light the film or electronic sensor is exposed to.
ND filters act like sunglasses that diminish the amount of light that gets to your eyes, so that your film or electronic sensor does not become over exposed.

, Graduated ND lens filters are expensive, and if you are on a budget, you may decide to stick with a regular ND filter.

, These filters are actually like putting an additional lens on your camera. A macro filter may distort the image, causing a reduction in image quality.

Pick a contest.,
Read all the rules.,
Prepare your equipment.",How to Win Photo Contests1," Lots of magazines hold photography contests, or ask your friends if they know of any. Try to choose a contest that suits you and your surroundings. For example, if the theme of the contest is ""Ocean Life"", and you live nowhere near an ocean or aquarium, don't decide to enter it.;
, Are you allowed to use a digital camera? Is there an age limit? How many times can you enter? Photocopy or write out a copy of the rules to carry with you when you are taking photos.

, Make sure you have enough film or digital disks and extra camera and flash batteries. If you're planning on using a special lens or tripod, make sure you know where it is.

When going somewhere to take photos, know what to expect.,
Move around.,
Look for unusual angles.,
Fill the frame.,
Take a risk.,
Don't be afraid to get on the ground or lay on your back while getting your shot.",How to Use Angles Effectively in Photography," Have some idea of what there is to see and think ahead.;
, Don't just shoot from one position and think that will do it. Try one angle or location, and move a few steps or yards and try it again. Don't expect one shot to do it.

, Look at photo ops and try to figure out how to enhance it with a different angle.

, If you put your 'cool shot' in the vastness of a bunch of other stuff, it won't be seen. Fill up your frame with what you are shooting.

, No, not with yourself, but with the composition of your shot. Just because you don't think it should work, doesn't mean it won't.

, You would be amazed at the different perspectives that can be found that way.

Candid Shots.",How to Win Photo Contests2," Taking the photo from above will create a much different effect than if you take the photo head-on. Be prepared to bend down, or stand on top of something to get to the right height.

, Do you want your background to be distracting or iconic? Depending on the contest's theme you may want a simple background or a complex one. Why not try taking photos in a few places?

, If you're taking photos outside, consider if you want your photo to be taken in the middle of the day, when it is brightest, or at night when the only light comes from streetlights. If taking photos inside, do you want the windows open or closed?

, Do you need to use a flash. If you do, be careful how far away your subject is. A flash will only work about 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) ahead. Also be careful not to stand to close to your subject as this will result in a whiteout. If you're taking photos of people or animals, consider using a camera with a ""red eye double flash"" feature, to prevent red eyes.

, Which direction should they be pointing? Do you even want them in your photo? Also be careful that your subject's face isn't blacked out (unless you want it that way). This can happen when you are pointing the camera into the sun.

, Do you want your whole subject in the photo? Should they be off to the side or centered? Be creative with these as they can distinguish a forgettable photo into a memorable one.

, Generally, zoomed in photos give more impact. Again it depends on what the judges will be looking for. You may consider using a telephoto or other special lens, depending on what your subject is.

, Try looking at a color wheel for creative ideas. For example: If you are photographing some blue flowers, you may want to mix them with orange flowers for contrast, as the two are opposites on the color wheel. Consider the following: Complimentary, Split Complimentary, Triad, Analogous, Monochromatic, Sepia, Black and White.

, Sometimes the best shots are the unplanned ones. Keep your camera with you at all times. If the contest rules allow it, look for old photos to submit.

Understand the concept of shutter speed.,
Trick your camera's shutter.,
Obtain a strobe light or flash.,
Get used to being in the dark.,
Set up the shot.,
Take the picture.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Try keeping your aperture open for a few seconds and then using a laser pointer to ""draw"" on surfaces during the duration of the exposure.",How to Take Extremely High Speed Photographs With an Inexpensive Camera," When you push the button on a camera, this causes the shutter to open and close very quickly. All of the light that goes through the shutter hits a sensor in DSLRs, or film in film cameras. The light is then transferred into an image. All of the light from the time the shutter opens to the time it closes gets stored as one picture. This is how you get a blurry photo from moving objects. If an object significantly moves between when the shutter opens and when the shutter closes, each point of that object's path is recorded as a single image. The faster your shutter opens and closes, the more accurate and in focus objects will be, despite how quickly they are moving. If your shutter speed is 1/1000th of a second, and you take a picture of a person throwing a punch, you may get some blur. If your camera's shutter speed is 1/52,000th of a second, that same picture will show someone throwing a punch with perfect focus. Of course, a camera with a shutter speed of 1/52,000th of a second is extremely expensive.;
, If your camera's shutter were to be open for several minutes in pitch black, there would be no image, since the sensor or film would not register any light. This means we can be very sneaky and trick our camera into taking high speed shots by leaving the shutter open in a pitch-black environment, and then using a flash of light that only lasts 1/52,000th of a second. You can buy a decent camera with adjustable shutter speed and a remote-activated strobe light for a fraction of the cost of a high-speed capable camera.

, You can buy strobe lights and flashes for very reasonable prices. Shop around and look for the following features: Remote operation, single flash, high strobe/flash speed (some are as fast as 1/62,000th of a second!), and the ability to strobe or flash only once at the push of a button.

, You will need to block a room of ALL light. This room needs to be absolutely pitch black. Have a light that you can turn off and on so you can set up your shot before turning off the light. To shield your eyes from the sudden intense light, it is advisable to wear dark sunglasses and look away from the light source as it flashes.

, Put your camera in position, and set up your subject. A tripod is ideal. At first, use a stationary subject until you get used to the process. Adjust your shutter speed so that the aperture will remain open for as long as possible when you take a picture. Set up your strobe light in position to light your subject.

, Turn off the light, then push the button to take a photo, and with the aperture still open, flash the strobe once. Wait until the aperture closes again, and turn the lights back on.

, Once you are comfortable with the routine; timing the strobe properly, and are getting decent results with your stationary subject, try taking a picture of a fast-moving object. Try things that spin, since they will remain in one spot while still allowing you to see the effects of high-speed photographs on objects in motion. Some things that look really cool-but may require more precise timing- are; dropping food coloring into water, lighting a match, opening a soda can that was shaken vigorously (protect your equipment from getting wet first), and any other sudden events that intrigue you. Experiment and have fun with it.

, A clear vase full of water and a couple clicks with a laser pointer in pitch-black during a five second exposure can look really amazing! Let your imagination run wild, be safe, and try whatever you think would be fun. Don't resign yourself to the myth that you need fancy expensive equipment to obtain great results.

Get an 18% gray card.,
Before taking photographs, take a shot of the gray card in the light conditions that you will be photographing in.,
While processing the photos, go to the gray card photo first.,
Use those adjustments on all of the photographs taken in that session.

,
Remember to re-photograph the gray card if the lighting or location changes.

",How to Use an 18% Gray Card," You can get one at a photography store or you can create one on your computer. Even if your printer isn't calibrated just right, your results will still be better than without using a gray card. You can make one by:Open up your graphic software and creating an image.






Fill the image with black.






Reduce the opacity by 50%. This will give you that 18% gray.






Print it out.





;
,


If taking portraits, have your subject hold the gray card by their face (assuming you will be photographing their face).







, Set your software to adjust exposure according to that gray card image.

Invest in a good lens.",How to Take a Cityscape Photograph," Also, have something interesting as a point of interest in the cityscape. Place it in the middle part of the photo or in the foreground.;
, Have some foreground and some background. Be sure not to have to much of either.

, Since you can't have exact control of everything in the photo, you will want the ability to crop it to be exactly how you want it.

, Most tripods have a level on them. Use it. You don't want to have to fix the horizon later. Save yourself the trouble by getting it right in the camera.

, This will help light the scene to its best. Having it overhead will flatten the scene and make it very unremarkable.

, Take them earlier or later in the day. The angle of the sun will introduce more texture and interest to your photographs.

, Set your exposure reading on the brightest part of the photograph. This will keep you from overexposing your shot.

, Hedge your bets by bracketing your photographs. This will allow you to create an HDR photograph, if you desire, later.

, Either of these will prevent your camera from being shaken when you push the button to take the picture. Even on a tripod, you will have to worry about camera shake.

, This limits hot spots and light reflections off of windows and metal objects.

, A good lens can make a huge difference in the results. Especially in a shot like this.

, Use your body, someone else, cardstock, or anything that will work.

, You will need to learn how to do that with your own camera, but using a flash when you are outside, will help counter the bright sun and the unfortunate shadows that it creates.

,, Shoot straight down or straight up. This changes the angle of the bright sun that you are dealing with.

, This helps protect your lens from the brightness of the sun.

, Polarizing and neutral density filters are some good ones that help with your photography.

, If you set it, then all of your shots will have identical white balance. That way, even if you have to adjust settings, you can apply the same ones to all of the photographs.

, This allows you to have more to work with. With today's software, you can still do a lot with your JPG images, but RAW gives you a little more to work with.

, This will help your camera 'focus' on what it needs to.

, Instead of going out there at noon, try going during the 'golden hour'. This is the hour right before the sun sets and rises.

Create a ""Selection,"" the moving dotted line, around your image to remove it from the background.,
Use the Quick Selection Tool for images with well-defined edges.,
Use the Pen Tool to draw complex, precise borders around the object you're separating.,
Use the Magic Wand to separate simple, mostly one-color objects.,
Use the ""Content Aware Fill"" to remove the image and automatically fill in a realistic background.,
Right-click on your selected area to remove it from the image.,
Use layer masks for less destructive separation.,
Separate layers by clicking and dragging them into a new Photoshop window.,
Use the stamp tool to try and fill in the background where the object was.",How to Separate an Image from Its Background (Photoshop)," Photoshop selections are your bread and butter. Anything within the moving dotted line can be edited, cut, or separated. If you're comfortable selecting the image you want to separate, you can move on to the section of separating the image. You have a variety of different selection tools available, each with pros and cons. The most commonly used tools include:Shaped Selections: The icon looks like a dotted box. Click and hold the icon for more shapes, which allow you to cover any basic item.

The Lasso Tools: You have a lot of options here, each of which requires you click the mouse, then trace out the object with your mouse. Clicking again creates an anchor point, then complete the shape to end the selection.

Quick Selection: The icon looks like a paintbrush with a circular dotted line around the brush. This shape automatically creates selections following the edges of shapes in the image.

Magic Wand: Hidden behind Quick Selection, or vice versa, click and hold on the ""Quick Selection"" button to find it. The Wand selects all pixels in a similar color range to the place you just clicked.

Pen Tool: Icon looks like a regular fountain pen. This is the most powerful tool you've got, but also the most time consuming to use. The pen tool creates ""paths"" with anchor points that can b be adjusted on the fly, giving you more control than basic selections.;
, Quick selection finds well-differentiated lines, like places where the color changes quickly and dramatically, to make your selection easily. To use it, simply click each section you want to add to the selection.


To remove an area from your selection, hold the Alt or ⌥ Opt keys and click.

, Make sure you have the ""Paths"" option selected from the menu in the top left of the screen selected, then click around the object to surround it. Use Ctrl+Click to manipulate the points if you mess one up, and drag the points ""arms"" around to change the curve. To insert a new point, just click on the line. When you've finished, right-click the line, and click Make Selection. This turns your line into a selection.


Use the ""Free Form Pen,"" found by clicking and holding the pen icon, to work with curved lines.

, The Wand will find similar pixels and select them, letting your quickly grab large, similar areas on the image. You can, like the other tools, use Ctrl/Cmd to add to your selection and Alt/Opt to remove areas of your selection.


Change the tolerance to make the Wand more or less precise. A high number (75-100) selects more diverse pixels while a number under ten is much more specific in selections., This powerful tool takes your selection, finds the pixels surrounding it, then duplicates them to make a seamless cut. To use it:


Use ""Select"" → ""Expand"" to expand the selection by 5-10 pixels to every side.
Click ""Edit"" → ""Fill"" to open the Fill Window.
Select ""Content Aware"" from the drop-down menu at the top of the window.
Hit ""Okay"" to fill your item in.
Re-use the feature to get new effects, changing the opacity as necessary. Every time you use Content Aware Fills, the computer selects pixels randomly -- so keep trying until it looks good., Selecting the image is the hard part. Once you have your dotted line around the image, simply right-click and choose how to isolate the image. You can:



Layer Via Copy: Duplicates the selection, then creates a copy of it right on top of the original. The background image is not affected at all.

Layer Via Cut: Removes the image from the background, turning the selection into a new, unique layer. The background image will have a hole in it., A layer mask lets you adjust the background layer, even remove it, without actually destroying the information in the background. Simply put, it lets you toggle the background on and off with the click of a button, separating your image whenever you want. To make one:


Select the area you want to remove.
In the layers menu, click ""Add a Mask."" It is at the very bottom and looks like a rectangle with a circle in it.
Click on the black and white thumbnail that appears. You can now use the Paintbrush or Pencil to revise the selection by drawing over the layer mask-- anything black is ""erased."" Draw over the mask in white to make the image ""reappear."", If you want to make a new composition through a layer, all you have to do is click and drag. If the layer is already separated, you can just click and drag it off the background. You can bring it into Illustrator or pull it into its own Photoshop layer. You can also delete the rest of the layers, then use ""Save As.""

, If you want to remove an image from the background, but you don't want a giant hole where the image used to be, you'll have to find a way to replace the space where the image was. This can be easier said than done, depending on the background. If you've got a basic, simple background like grass or the ocean, the stamp tool will copy some section of the image and use it to paint over the hole.

, Place documents face down on the printer or scanner surface. Align photo within the arrows or grids on the device. Close the lid if there is one. Press scan on the scanner or use the scanning program on your computer

, You'll have the choice of scanning in color, black and white, gray or custom. You can also choose the digital format in which you want to save your picture (jpg, jpeg or tiff).

, Clicking preview allows you to review your selection before continuing and make necessary changes to the settings. Use the preview to decide on the type of format, orientation and resolution before continuing. ""Orientation"" allows the user to select portrait or landscape and ""Resolution"" determines the sharpness of the image.


A higher resolution will make the details of the picture more noticeable. To make a sharper image, increase the resolution. Note: This will also increase the size of the image, and dramatically increase the size of the file. You may not be able to send it as an email attachment without making it smaller. Above 300 dpi is unnecessary.

, Some programs will automatically save your images to a cache within the program itself but for most programs you will need to save the images somewhere on your computer or upload them directly to the internet. Look for the save button or use the save prompt when it comes up. Save the pictures somewhere where you won't lose them.


You don't have have to worry about renaming every photo. If you have a large number of photos that can take a long time!

, If you really want your photos to look amazing when they're scanned in, you'll need to employ some special tricks but the most important part is that you'll really have to spend time working on the project. Each photo needs to be scanned and edited individually, so don't try to save time by scanning them all at once if you want them to really look good., If you have the option to, scanning the original film using a film scanner will give you a much higher quality image. Film scanners aren't inexpensive, but if you have a lot of pictures to preserve it might be a good idea.

, When you turn the photos in the scanning program's preview window (or even turn them afterwards in a photo editor), you can lose some image quality. Scan them in the correct orientation to begin with and you'll help preserve the quality of your image.

, In the list of options that includes black and white scanning, color scanning, etc., you will sometimes have the option to scan in 24 bit. This is the best choice for quality scans and you should take it whenever you can., If your scanning program has options for adjusting the levels and saturation before scanning, take that option. Adjusting these within a photo program later can damage the image and lose a lot of detail. Levels and saturation settings change the colors, darks, and brights in an image, helping you restore a faded picture.

, If you want compact files, save in png or jpg (also called jpeg) format.

, Generally, automatic settings will not do as good a job at fixing things as a person can. You can learn to use a program like Photoshop or you can actually hire professionals to do quick touch-ups on photos that are very important to you.

A DSLR digital camera is a good choice for beginners because it takes good quality shots, you can swap out lenses quickly, and it’s affordable.You don’t need to worry about how many frames per second it can shoot, or how many megapixels it has. What’s more important is the quality of the lenses you use.DSLR cameras can cost anywhere from $400 for an entry-level model to $3000 for a model with a full-frame sensor.Review ConsumerReports or other online sources with camera reviews to see which brands and models people are having success with.;
, If you have some experience and are looking to upgrade, a mirrorless digital camera provides the best clarity and focus speeds. Shutter lag is virtually eliminated in these models, they have built-in viewfinders, and they’re smaller and more compact than DSLRs.Prices for mirrorless cameras range from $500 to $5000., The lens kits that come with most cameras will not have a wide enough aperture to take sports shots at night. You’ll need a lens that takes in as much light as possible, so look for a low “f” number associated with the aperture. For example, an f/2.8 is faster than an f/5.6. And be sure that the aperture stays low when the lens zooms., You’ll need a long telephoto lens to shoot games like football, where the action is far away from where you’ll be. Look for a lens that’s 200 or 300mm. If you need more depth later on you can add a teleconverter., It's always a good idea to have a main memory card and a backup card in each camera bag you own, just in case you forget one or run out of storage during a game. Look for cards with a minimum of 32GB of storage and a speed that's labelled either Class 10 or UHS-1., Most of the lenses you’ll be using are too heavy to hold in your hand and take stable shots at the same time. A tripod is too bulky to have with you on the field, so opt for a monopod with a good ball head to get a good combination of stability and flexibility., You need to understand the sport you’re photographing to know when you’ll get the best shots. Become familiar with the rules, the timing, and the players themselves. This will help you develop judgment about which shots are worth keeping., Don’t take a few shots and then look down at the LCD to review them – you might miss another opportunity for a good shot. You also risk getting injured if you’re close to the action. Review your shots later during timeouts or halftime., You don’t want your photos to look like everyone else’s. To make yours stand out, try getting down on the ground and shooting the players from there, or going to a different side of the field from everyone else. They might have the best vantage point from where they are, but you could catch a great moment from an angle that no one else will have., Take a few test shots at a shutter speed of 1/500 of a second. If the photos still look blurry, increase the speed. You can go as high as 1/1000 of a second to properly capture sports like motor racing.You may need to open your aperture as wide as it will go or increase your camera’s ISO (its sensitivity to light) to reach these high shutter speeds.

, Things can happen so quickly during a sporting event that it’s easy to miss the perfect shot. Using your camera’s burst mode, or continuous mode, will let you take 4 or 5 photos at once. Just be sure your memory card has tons of capacity, since this mode will fill it up faster., If you’re shooting a basketball or volleyball game, you’ll likely be under fluorescent lighting, which can give your shots a yellow or green tint. Change your light balance to Fluorescent or Tungsten/Incandescent to improve the color., Taking photography or photojournalism classes will help you learn the best techniques and latest trends in the business. It will also be an opportunity to network and make contacts in the industry. Look into classes offered at local community centers, colleges, and art centers., If you have no experience, volunteer your time to take photos at local youth soccer or baseball games. You’ll need to coordinate this with the coaches and parents since they likely won’t want the children photographed by a stranger. But offering them free team photos may sway them toward agreeing to be your test subjects.

, Assisting a professional photographer is a great way to get your foot in the door and gain experience. Find local sports photographers whose work you admire and give them a call. They may already have an assistant, in which case you should offer to help out around their studio in any small way you can. That way you're around when they do need extra help on a shoot., Gather the best shots you’ve taken and compile them to create a portfolio that will serve as your resume. While you want to showcase several shots that feature athletes and action, you can also include a few shots that show another side of you.Many articles about athletes include photos of them at home or doing normal things, so show potential employers that you can take interesting portraits as well.

, The easiest way to showcase your work is to start a photography blog on a site like WordPress, Tumblr, or FotoJournal. Here you can post your latest and best photos to show off to prospective employers or clients. Also, blogs tend to have better SEO success than portfolio websites since you’re frequently updating the content., Browse the websites of your favorite newspapers and magazines to see if they’re calling for any photo submissions. Even if you don’t find anything, that doesn’t mean you can’t reach out to people. Look up the email addresses of the photography directors at publications like Sports Illustrated, Golf Digest, or Runner’s World, and email them your work.Include one or two of your best photos and a brief explanation of what you’re sending them. And don’t be afraid to pitch a story if you think the photo displays something original that’s worth writing about.

, All modern photographers need to know how to edit their images after taking them. The most common software you'll need to know how to use on the job is Photoshop and Lightroom. You can find classes that teach these programs at local community centers or colleges.You can also use online tutorials and Youtube videos to learn about many of the features of these programs.

After you've mastered the basics of getting well-composed, non-blurry shots, start getting creative.",How to Photograph Motor Racing," You can get great shots without buying stuff; after all, any great motorsports photo taken before about 1988 would have been done with a manual-focus film camera! But you will make a lot less work for yourself if you get the right kit.


Camera: No compact or bridge camera can match the high-ISO performance and brutally fast auto focus of a real SLR. So get any Canon or Nikon digital SLR camera, even an obsolete used one if that's all your budget will stretch to (remember, professional photographers shot with the obsolete cameras too, back when they were new). Don't bother with other brands; just about all professional sports photographers use Nikon or Canon for very good reasons. The more expensive SLR's are nice; they'll generally give you faster frame rates and better high-ISO performance. But they are not essential.

Lenses: If your budget will stretch to it, then of course you should get a top-line professional 70-200 f/2.8 zoom. But remember that fast auto focus is much more important than anything else; indeed, some older professional f/2.8 telephotos have slower autofocus than newer, cheaper lenses.
If your budget won't stretch to a fast-focusing telephoto, and you know you can get close enough to the action to use one, get yourself a fixed 50mm f/1.8 lens. These are the cheapest lenses in the Nikon and Canon systems. They're also among the sharpest lenses you can buy, they autofocus as quickly as any professional $1000+ f/2.8 zoom, and they'll let you shoot in less than half as much light. Even photographers who own the big professional telephotos will often carry a fast 50mm as well for these reasons. And of course, if you can't do that, shoot with your kit lens. Learn its limitations and work around them.

Storage: Get as much as you can afford. Getting at least 16GB of storage is a good idea for high-resolution cameras; your ""keep rate"" will be low at the start.;
, If it's a road course, look for the most dramatic corner. Then find a straightaway where there's a lot of passing and drafting. Don't worry about covering the whole track - it's better to get quality shots from a couple of locations than junk from everywhere. Oval tracks are a cinch: you can usually see half the track from one location. Above all, go where the cars appear to be battling it out in wheel-to-wheel combat.

, Let them know you are a well-intentioned photographer who will behave during a race and obey the rules of the track. They may have suggestions as to where the action will most likely be dramatic. They may share stories of significance about a driver or team., You would be amazed at how much people will share about their experiences and what works best. Be a good learner and later, when you are asked by a novice, pass on honest advice as well. Fellow shutterbugs are not the competition., Be sensible and set up in a safe location. If a car comes at you, all of those great shots you got will be published posthumously.



Know where you will go in the event of an emergency. A car out of control comes fast. Real fast. You won't be running out of the way, so you had better be within a step of a pole or barrier that can shield you. Make yourself visible. A struggling driver will not have time to assess what he is seeing, so don't hunker down and make it hard for him to decide whether he needs to avoid hitting you. Make that choice easy.

Keep alert. Your view of the action may be limited to what you see through the eyepiece, but keep alert to the track as a whole. Even with earplugs, you can usually hear variations in the drone of engines and tell when someone is having trouble. Find out where it is coming from without delay. If it is coming at you, this may save your life. If it is not, it may present a great shooting opportunity.

Always obey track rules and track marshals. They are there for your safety. Ask them if it is OK to go out to this point or that point. Do what they say. Never do what they say not to.

, If you don't know some basics about camera exposure, white balance and ISO, learn them now; see How to Adjust Your Digital Camera's White Balance, How to Understand Camera Exposure and How to Use Your Digital Camera's ISO Setting.

, Professional photographers will use any of the PSAM modes (program, shutter-priority, aperture-priority, manual), or even all of them on the same day. Use whatever fits your shooting style. Don't use your camera's ""sports"" mode, though; this is an ""idiot mode"" that locks out some critical controls, such as ISO.

, You'll want to be shooting in continuous autofocus mode. Nikon cameras call this AF-C, Canon cameras call this SERVO. This autofocus mode works continuously; it will track subjects after focus has been acquired.

, You'd think that faster would be better, but this is not always the case. Remember, your SLR camera cannot find focus while the mirror is up, and you can't track the action through the viewfinder either, so having your viewfinder blacked out a lot is one way to get worse photographs. Professionals know how to get great results at the 8-frames-a-second or more of high-end SLRs, but if you're starting out, you might want to dial it back a little. Experiment to find what works best for you and with your equipment.
, While RAW is great for its post-processing flexibility, using JPEG will allow you to shoot many more pictures (you will need this when you're first starting out), and the buffer will be much larger. You don't even necessarily need to shoot your camera at its highest resolution (especially with the insanely high pixel count of modern cameras); this, too, will allow you to shoot many more photos and make your buffer much bigger. Once you start getting consistently great results, then by all means shoot RAW if you like., Focus on the ""face"" of the car. Just like one always focuses on the eyes of a portrait subject, focus on the closest headlight or the front grille of the car. Otherwise, focus on the closest thing to you, like a door (if you're shooting from the side) or a tail-light (if you're shooting from the rear).



Practice following cars while zooming in and out to keep them in frame. If you have time, do this for a few minutes without taking any photographs just to get used to following fast-moving subjects.

Shoot hand-held. A monopod or tripod severely restricts your ability to react to events on the track, which makes you less safe and results in worse photographs. You may have to use a faster shutter speed than you'd like (although the VR of most modern telephotos helps you out there), but you'll get the shots the ""monopod mob"" will miss.

Start off with a shutter speed of 1/250. This will minimize camera shake while showing some wheel spin. If you have rock-steady hands you may be able to shoot slower. Don't be afraid to crank up your ISO as high as you need to get the shutter speed you need; today's digital SLRs look great at ISO 1600 and up, and a noisy sharp photograph is always better than a clean blurry one.

Shoot from as low a position as you can. Cars look much more dramatic if they're at eye level.

Anticipate. If you see one particular car drifting dangerously at a sharp corner, be prepared for the spin-out.

Shoot lots. At first, 90 per cent of your shots will be blurry, badly composed or have some other flaw. Much of the time you'll be pointing the camera at something and praying. Don't be disheartened if your first time out results in only one or two keepers; stick at it and your keep rate will rise dramatically.

,



Try some panning shots at slow shutter speeds. Shoot as slow as you can using hand-held without getting shots blurred from camera shake. If you've gotten good at tracking motion through your viewfinder then this will result in much more exciting shots; the background will be blurred and, if you have planned it right, the subject should remain sharp.

Zoom in ""too far"" to get some get semi-abstract shots. See the photo above.

Shoot into the sun in the late afternoon to get great silhouettes and lens flare.

Shoot at last light when the light is at its most beautiful..

Acquire a Nikon or Canon DSLR.,
Acquire a lens.,
Learn how to use your digital SLR.,
Find a place to take pictures.",How to Photograph Sports1," DSLRs have many advantages over point and shoot cameras that are crucial in sports photography, including: high ISO capability, fast shutter speeds, no shutter lag, faster auto-focus, interchangeable lenses, increased battery power, and higher frame rates. Professionals almost invariably shoot Canon or Nikon cameras, but this is not an excuse to wait until you buy new gear before getting out there and shooting if you have a digital SLR from some other brand.;
, There are many factors you'll want to consider, detailed below, and probably some compromises you'll want to make depending on your budget.



Focal length: Obviously, a larger zoom range is better, all else being equal; if your zoom range doesn't cover a good part of the track or field and you are limited as to where you can stand, it'll mean there are some shots that you just can't get. Of course, they're also more expensive (once again, all else being equal), so depending on your budget you may think this is a worthwhile tradeoff.
The following figures will tell you at what distance you will be able to fill a 1.8-metre (6 foot) high subject using a lens of common telephoto focal lengths, while holding your camera horizontally. Adjust them accordingly for what you think your shooting scenario will be.These numbers are for cropped-sensor digital SLRs, so multiply them by about 1.5 to get a figure for a full-frame digital SLR. You'll also want to multiply them by about 1.5 if you're holding the camera in the vertical position.


85mm: 8.5 metres (28 feet)

200mm: 20 metres (65 feet)

300mm: 30 metres (100 feet)

400mm: 40 metres (130 feet)

600mm: 60 metres (200 feet)



Maximum aperture: If you're planning on shooting in daylight, then don't worry about this; a lens that is f/5.6 at the long end will allow you to get a shutter speed of 1/250 on even a heavily overcast day, at ISO 200.If you want to be able to shoot in any light at all, though, you probably want a professional f/2.8 telephoto lens, for much more money.

Vibration reduction (Nikon)/image stabilisation (Canon): The fast shutter speeds you'll be using for sports will allow you to hand-hold reasonably-long telephoto lenses, which renders VR partly unnecessary. On the other hand, as Nikon and Canon's vibration reduction is built into the lens, it helps stabilise the image in your viewfinder while you are composing a shot, which is very useful for telephoto lenses. So VR is a nice feature to have, but if you're shooting from a monopod, or if buying a non-VR version of a lens will get the lens you need within your budget, then you can live without it.

, You can have the best camera in the world and all it would be is an expensive paperweight if you don't know how to use it. In order to increase your knowledge of cameras, you can attend classes or workshops that teach about cameras, or you can spend time online looking at different tutorials, tips, and examples of people's work for free. Understanding camera exposure is the most important thing to learn. The internet is a valuable resource when learning about photography or solving problems.

Set up your camera.,
Start with a fast shutter speed, like 1/250 or faster, until you get used to tracking action with your camera.,
Keep using slower and slower shutter speeds.,
Learn to pan.,
Keep shooting at slower and slower speeds until you hit the limits of your technique.,
Learn to time the shot for the perfect moment in the drift.,
Keep your wits about you and your eyes and ears open.",How to Photograph Drift Racing," In time, you'll learn all sorts of tricks that will contradict these instructions, such as trap-focusing in manual-focus mode, but to get you started these setting suggestions will help:



Autofocus: Set this to continuous (C or AF-C on Nikon cameras, SERVO on Canon cameras).

Frame rate: Faster is not always better! Remember, with your SLR, the faster your frame rate, the greater time is spent with your SLR's mirror in the up position, and consequently, you might have problems tracking the action with your viewfinder blacked out for so much of the time. On the other hand, faster frame rates give you an opportunity to catch the action at exactly the right moment, which is why professional sports photographers love them.

Image stabilisation: Nikon calls this VR (vibration reduction). You probably want this on, even for panning shots (which this article will cover later).Exposure mode: Start out with shutter-priority mode (S on Nikon cameras, Tv on Canon cameras); this mode lets you pick a shutter speed and the camera will pick an aperture to match. It's more likely that you'll need to control your shutter speed than control your depth of field while photographing drifting. Of course, you can just use Program and shift the program to your desired combination of shutter speed and aperture.Don't use the ""Sports"" mode on your camera if you have one; this locks out several of your controls and forces fast shutter speeds that result in boring photographs (which will be covered later).

Image quality: Most motor racing photographers shoot raw. Some people prefer shooting JPEGs. This is a religious subject which won't be touched on here; use whatever works for you.;
, You'll notice that at these fast shutter speeds the photographs will be boring, with little sense of movement. Sometimes you'll need these shutter speeds to get a certain shot, but for now, just shoot at these speeds to get used to shooting your camera.
, You want to use a speed such that it's obvious wheels are turning, at the least. Slow shutter speeds can't freeze action (more on that in a second), but it'll be more obvious that something is actually moving.
, Panning is a technique where you keep moving the camera with the action, even after the shutter has closed and the mirror is up. In this case, you smoothly move your camera with the car, keeping it in a constant place in the frame; shoot at a slow enough shutter speed and the background will be motion-blurred, while the car will be sharp.
Thom Hogan recommendsthis: Pan with your subject and take a picture. Your viewfinder (on an SLR) will temporarily black out. If the subject isn't in the same place in the viewfinder when the mirror returns, you are not panning smoothly enough. Try again until you get it right; it takes tons of practice.
, If you don't have the shooting opportunities to practice, then just shoot between 1/60 to 1/100; it's fast enough that you don't have to be a superhero to hand-hold and pan the shot at moderate focal lengths, but still more than fast enough to give an obvious sense of motion. Nikon's VR and Canon's IS are huge helps here if you have them; it means you can hand-hold lenses at shutter speeds way below the traditional safe speed of 1/focal length. They also help to stabilise the pan, dampening up-and-down camera shake without trying to counter panning.
, Fast frame rates from high-end SLRs help here, but even if you have one of these you'll learn a lot if you slow your camera down and try firing off one or two, rather than a dozen, shots for each pass.
The easiest way to get a dramatic shot is right as the car has stopped rotating, as it is attempting to recover to turn the other way, and is travelling sideways with front wheels rotated; if you combine this with a slow pan it will make it very obvious that a car is travelling sideways. But there is another perfect moment: if a car is rotating along the axis of its front wheels, you will be able to catch a moment where the rear of the car is visibly motion blurred and the front of the car is not. Remember your high school trigonometry lessons: while both ends of the cars turn by the same degree, if a thing rotates around a certain axis, for certain observers things closer to that axis will appear to have moved less than things further from that axis.
Every driver is different; plenty of practice will teach you the perfect moment to shoot a certain driver.
, Not only will this keep you safe, but it'll also result in some much better shots. This is another way of saying shoot drifting as much as possible. You'll learn to recognise the sound of tyres about to explode, for example; you'll either catch them while they explode or get some spectacular shots (especially in the dark) of sparks spraying from the tyre as it wears through the metal carcass.

Set your exposure mode.,
Set your shutter speed.,
Set your ISO.,
Set your auto-focus to continuous.",How to Photograph Sports2," You can use any of the four PSAM (Program, Shutter-priority, Aperture-priority, Manual) modes, detailed below. Whichever mode you choose, don't use the ""sports"" mode (present on some cheaper cameras); this will lock out some critical controls like ISO and white balance.



Shutter priority (S on Nikon, Tv on Canon): This will allow you to set your shutter speed and the camera will choose an appropriate aperture to get a correct exposure.

Aperture priority (A on Nikon, Av on Canon): If you're shooting under fading light and just want to grab the fastest shutter speed you have available, then use this mode and set the largest aperture you have available (which is to say the smallest f/ number, e.g. f/2.8). Your camera will then select the fastest shutter speed possible.

Manual mode: Many professionals prefer to set a manual exposure for consistency (for shooting in high-contrast lighting, for example). If you know better than your camera then by all means use manual mode if you have to.

P(rogram): Many professionals avoid using this mode, which sets both your aperture and shutter speed automatically. But if you're not comfortable using one of the semi-automatic modes, you can always use this and shift the program towards faster shutter speeds and smaller apertures (see below).

, This is needed when using (M) manual mode. A fast shutter speed is what actually stops the motion; speeds above 1/200 of a second begin to stop a lot of action, but for sports it is recommended that you shoot with a speed of 1/1000 of a second or higher. This is your goal, unless you are using your shutter speed to accomplish more artistic effects.

, ISO (the sensor's sensitivity to light) will directly affect how fast the shutter speed on your camera can be set while maintaining the correct exposure. The higher ISO (ex. 3200 or 6400) allows for a faster shutter speed. High ISOs come with a trade-off; the higher the ISO, the more noise will be present in the image.


With modern SLRs, don't be afraid to crank up your ISO as high as you need it to get the shutter speed you want. A noisy sharp photograph is always better than a clean blurry one, and recent digital SLRs look great at ISOs that film shooters could only dream of.

, In this mode, the camera will track and predict subject motion, as opposed to locking the focus as soon as it acquired (which will result in most of your photos being out of focus). Canon cameras call this AI Servo, and Nikon cameras call this C or AF-C.

Make a light table.,
Make a light reflector with the foamcore.,
If you have lost a lens cap, make your own!

",How to Make a Foamcore and Duct Tape Photo Studio3," There are several different types of softbox that you can make with foamcore.

, You can make this easily using simply a box; or, follow the same concept as the box but use foamcore to make it instead, assembling the box walls together with tape.

, You could use reflective duct tape on the side of the foamcore or you could use something shiny, like aluminum foil and use double sided tape to attack it to the board.

,"
"
Get the lens that you will be putting the custom bokeh on.

,
Find a font that you like.,
Use the character map to insert the graphic and then size it at about 60.,
Decide on the way you are going to make your bokeh.,
Make a template for each lens.,
Put the design in the exact center of the circle that you have cut out.",How to Make a Custom Bokeh1,", Wingdings and Dingbats are good sources. If you don't have anything you like, do a search for them on the Internet.


Alternatively, if you are good at freehand, you can draw or cut it out without any type of assistance.

, That should be about the right size of symbol.

, If you have a UV filter, you can use that and put the bokeh into it.

, You want them to be the right size to block out as much superfluous light as possible. Some suggestions for creating a circle are:

Use a string and measure half the width of the lens. Using a pen or pencil on one end of the string and stick a pin in the other end of the string, draw a circle. Using this image as an example, imagine a straight pin holding one end of the string, a pen on the other end, and drawing a circle.
Find a lid of some type that matches the size of your target circle.







,

Your lens will be having to shoot through the cutout, so the closer to exact center that you are at, the better.
Depending on the size of your lens, your finished design/shape will be about 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) in size.
The size of the bokeh needs to be smaller than the aperture you are using. For example, If you use 5.6, then the bokeh shape needs to be 8 or less.

"
"
Get some type of somewhat stiff white cardboard or foamcore type of material.,
Take your transparent tape and tape one side of the bubble wrap to the base of your 'studio'.

,
Decide on the exact arch that you want your bubble wrap to take and then tape the other side down.,
Put in your item that you wish to photograph, set up the lighting and take your picture!

",How to Make a Mini Studio Using Bubble Wrap," Decide the size you want and cut it out.;
,, It should look like this.

,"
"
Cut a window in the base of the box.,
Place the document protector over the hole in the box that you just created.

,
Using clear packing tape, fasten it securely to the box.,
Set up your flash about 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) from the diffusion screen.",How to Make a Diffusion Screen," Since the document protector will go in there, keep that in mind when you cut it.


Be sure to leave an edge around it. You will use those edges to fasten the protector to it.
Use a ruler or something similar to ensure that you have a straight, precise cut.
Be sure that the hole in the box is slightly smaller than 8 1/2 X 11 (the size of paper).;
,, Be sure to leave the open part of the protector open.


It's a good idea to do something like putting in a sheet of paper into the plastic while you are fastening it to the box. This will help keep it flat and retain its appearance.

, Experiment with it to get the right results.


If you have trouble getting it to stand up, place something small and heavy (and preferably clear) in the corner of the box.

"
"
Get the things you'll need.,
Using the tape, tape both sides of the paper.,
Take your filter and wrap the taped paper around it.,
Trim off the 'top' of the case, (the part without the paper only) so that it is straight.

,
Flip your case over and fold over the paper, like you are wrapping a present.

,
Tape it secured with the same tape as before.

,
Write the particulars of the filter on the tape so that you know what is in that particular case.,
Tape up more paper like you did for the case.,
Turn your case over so the back is facing you.,
Trim the flap to be able to easily fit into the case.

,
Finished.

",How to Make a Recycled Paper Filter Case," They are listed below.;
, Make sure the tape edges overlap to improve durability.


When taping this, leave a small amount of the paper untaped. It will help form the bottom of the case. In the image above, it is at the bottom.

, You don't want it to go around multiple times because it would be too bulky. Cut it to the appropriate size and then tape it closed.

,,,,


You can leave it like this or make a flap to secure it in the case.







, Cut it to match the width.

, Place the taped paper so that it covers most, or all, of your case. This will help it be more secure.

Make a collar for your shop light.,
Find a translucent bowl that is the same circumference as your shoplight.,
Set the bowl into the collar that you made.,
Take photographs.

",How to Make a Foamcore Diffuser for a Shoplight," If you have the foam-core and tape, it can be done in about an hour.;
, These can be found quite cheaply at a dollar store if you don't have one.

, Be sure that it fits somewhat snugly. You don't want it too tight or loose. One will break the collar and the other one, it will fall out.

,"
"
If using a filter, measure the inside circumference of the filter.,
Once you have the measurements, make a template.",How to Make a Custom Bokeh2," This example traces the outside of the filter which is actually too large.


If you have a compass, once you know the size that it needs to be, that will simplify the matter greatly.;
, You will probably want one for each different size lens that you have.


Keep in mind that the template for fitting inside of a filter and going onto a 'hood' for your lens will be two different sizes.

"
"
Measure the outside circumference of your lens.,
Cut a rectangular piece of whatever you are using, (thin plastic, poster board) with enough left over so that you can fasten it somehow.

,
Measure the circumference of the bokeh after assembled for the 'end cap'.

,
Fasten it together with some type of tape.

,
Put the pieces together.,
Measure all the parts.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Custom Bokeh3," One way of doing this, if you don't have a tape measure is to take a string and measure around the lens and then add an inch to an inch and a half. If it is too long, you can always trim it.

,,,, Note that there is a very small gap. It might indicate that your end cap needs to be slightly larger.

, If you are just starting out making your own bokehs, you will want to have the measurements so that you can make a collection. The lens measurements for this example were 10 and 1/2 inches x 2 and 1/4 inches. The end cap's circumference was 2 and 3/4 inches. A wingding about the size 48 is a good size for the center piece.

Take a look at your camera and ascertain the approximate size that you will need and what you have to work with.,
Have a piece of tissue paper or thin paper towel large enough to cover your flash and be fastened by a rubber band.

,
Place the paper over the flash and the rubber band over the paper.",How to Make a Diffuser for Any Camera With a Pop up Flash,";
,, In this screenshot, a very large twist tie was used.

"
Get your foam board.,
Get a pencil and start measuring on the board.,
On the 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) side, measure out another 2.5 inch (6.4 cm), but only do it at the very edge.

,
On the straight line that you drew that was 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) from the bottom, measure out 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).,
At the top of foam board (where the 3 inch line is), measure inward 2 inches (5.1 cm).,
Put a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) circle of Velcro in the indicated spots in the previous screenshot.,
Consider where you will add the Velcro circles the front.

,
Add a couple more of the Velcro circles on the back.,
Assemble your reflector and test it out.",How to Make a Basic Template for Creating a DIY Reflector," You can usually find that at a nearby dollar store or a craft store. Measure out a 9"" X 12"" inch 'sheet'.;
, Draw a line 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) from one short side and another one 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the other short side.

,, Check and recheck. The actual cut in the screenshot was made with the measurements backwards. You want the 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) to be the height of the triangle and 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) as the base of the triangle.

, In this screenshot, this is indicated by the two black lines. This is where you will draw a line in the material you use to create a 'cup' type of shape for your reflector.

, This will help you to form a type of bowl to keep your reflector from losing the light.

,, This template will give you rough ideas of where you want things.


Remember that one side (like the front) will be the hook side of the Velcro and the other (the back) will be the loop side of the Velcro.

, In this screenshot, the one on the left used the reflector, the one on the right, did not. Other than that, there was no change made in how the two photos were shot.

Re-appropriate a 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) jug from the recycle bin.,
Cut a side from the jug.,
Trim it down to the size that you want it.,
Apply some type of glue or double-sided tape to the inside of the jug.,
Apply your reflective surface.,
Smooth the edges with tape.,
Fasten it to your flash.,
Fasten the flash to your camera and have it bent to 90 degrees.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Flash Reflector for Macro Photography," Be sure that it has been rinsed out pretty well.;
, You want it to be bigger than its final shape so that you can trim it down. Be sure that the corners are included in the cut.

, You want it to be able to be fastened to your flash and extend well past it. The actual length of a milk jug is about right.

, (What would be the inside of the container.)

, This can be:


Mylar from wrapping paper
Mylar gift balloons
Inside of a dry food bag
Aluminum foil

, You can use pretty much whatever type of tape you have that you believe is sturdy enough.


Chrome tape is recommended. Any kind of colored tape can reflect in shiny objects that are photographed.

, A rubber band would probably work best, but use what you have.

, This can be adapted for your purposes.

Get foamcore.,
Choose a width.,
Start measuring out lines about a half inch apart.,





Start cutting the foamcore.,Do this to the two lengths of foamcore and then fasten them together with duct tape.,
On the non-serrated side of the foamcore, apply duct tape.

,
Set the shoplight on a flat surface and wrap the foamcore around it.,
After taping the outside of the collar, use scissors to cut it to the correct length to go around the light.

",How to Make a Collar for a Shoplight," You can find it at most stores that sell arts and crafts and you can also find it at many dollar stores.
, Two inches is a good width to start with. Here, the selected width is the width of the level. Another good choice of a width would be the width of your duct tape.

, If you have something that is a little more (or less), like a deck of cards, use it., Do not cut through it. That is why a scrolling tool that will serrate the foamcore is a better tool.

You will probably need to have two lengths of foamcore to have enough to go around the circumference of a 10 inch (25.4 cm) shoplight.







,,, Use scissors or a sharp edge to trip it to the correct length.

Examine the photography.,
Decipher what you like and dislike about the photograph.,
Describe the photograph in terms of your general feeling or impression.,
Address the technical components.,
Assess the artistic elements of the photo.,
Explain what you like about the photograph, and why.,
Elaborate on elements of the photograph that could be improved upon.,
Summarize your general perception of the photograph.",How to Write a Photography Critique," Note your first impression upon visually taking the entire photo in, then study all of the details of the photo, being sure to view every component both singularly and in relation to the overall composition.;
, A photo critique generally begins with a basic impression of what you feel works for the photo and doesn't work for the photo. You don't have to share these perceptions; they are, rather starting points for further analysis.

, This is a subjective part of critiquing photography, and is necessary to relaying the aesthetic impact of the photo to the photographer. For example, a gritty black and white headshot may prompt this sort of description: ""This portrait evokes a raw and intimate feeling, and gives a sense of the subject's humility and strength.""

, Try to be as objective as possible when covering the technical elements of a photograph.


Focus. Determine whether the photo is properly focused, or if it is unintentionally blurred by way of technical error. Common examples of unwanted blur to cite in your photo critique are: focus on the wrong element of the composition, action blur and zoom blur.
Dust and other technical distractions. If the photographer captured unwanted dust or glare in the photo, then you should point it out in your photography critique.
Color. Not all photos need to represent colors as they would appear to the unaided eye, but the photograph's use of color should be intentional and relevant to the photo. Faded, dull or ruddy color tones may be the product of technical error.
Lighting. Too much or too little lighting may result in a number of technically sub-par photography results.
Exposure. This pertains to the length of time the camera was enabled to take in the image and affects the lighting and contrast. A higher exposure allows more light to filter in, and may result in too-white highlights, while a lower exposure may result in a too-dark photo with muddled contrast lines.

, Cover each of the following elements when critiquing photography:


Subject matter. Note the photographer's choice of image, and determine whether or not it seems to be purposeful, or haphazardly chosen. For example, a photo of a busy street market is more artistically interesting when it depicts a single vendor in negotiations with customers, as opposed to the less interesting composition of a congested crowd of people with no focal point.
Color. In addition to the technical execution of color, a photography critique should also address the artistic effect of the photographer's chosen color scheme. Determine if the colors add to or detract from the feeling of the photograph, and if a black and white treatment would be more or less effective.
Composition. Note the content and layout of the photograph in regards to subject positioning, symmetry, clutter, sparseness and cropping. Moreover, determine if the photograph is directed in a way that best highlights its intended subject, feeling and message.

, A photo critique should point out a photo's strong points, as well as the technical and artistic aspects that contribute to those strengths, so you should be specific. For example, saying that you ""like the lighting"" is not nearly as helpful as saying, ""I like the use of overhead lighting because it accentuates the shadows of the subject's face, lending to the intimate feeling.""

, Your goal is to provide the photographer with a thorough and accurate analysis of the photograph's effectiveness. Be specific, as in this example: ""Adjusting the exposure time would create more crispness in the contrast, which would add to the raw grit of the photograph.""

, Rather than repeat what you already said in your photography critique, provide a brief description of your overall feeling about the photograph, after taking into consideration its technical and artistic aspects, strength and weaknesses.

Decide on how long you need your track to be for the shots you need.,
Decide on the length of the separate pieces of the track.,
Measure the distance between the legs of the tripod.,
Add everything up and add a bit for testing purposes.,
Look at your tubes.,
Put two tubes aside.,
Take the two tubes you put aside earlier.,
Take what’s left of the two tubes.,
Take what’s left and cut off tracks parts of the same length as the other parts.,
You should have a few bits left.,
Take all of the joints and saw open from one end to the other.,
Take your plywood and choose a platform size for your dolly cart.,
Take your test tube and two wheels with their bolts, screws and washers.,
Before you start drilling for the wheels, keep in mind:

,
Put them a few cm’s away from the tube opening.,
Don’t drill the holes opposite to each other.,
Both of your wheels need to touch the track underneath, while keeping a good contact surface with the dolly cart tube.

,
When you’re happy with how your wheels roll, draw a straight line across the tube crossing through the good holes on your test tube.,
Draw drill marks on this line a few cm’s from the (small!),
Take the tube parts of the dolly cart, the 2 T-section tubes and two dolly track parts.,
Test on the tracks with your tripod, until you’re satisfied that all the wheels touch the tracks and roll as intended.

,
Glue the tubes together.,
Put your cart aside and take the dolly track parts and the joints.,
Take your plywood and make the platform.,
From the rest of the plywood, make a narrow T-shape fitting the shape of the dolly.,
Glue the plywood platform on top of the shock absorbing material.

,
Test and make adjustments if needed, before the whole dries up completely.,
Decide on how many rails you can make.,
Saw off pieces wood of 2x4 of about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) each.,
Place the tracks and the dolly cart in position.,
Use tape to temporary keep the pieces of 2x4 in place, or ask a friend for help.,
Glue the 2x4 on the plywood.",How to Make a Camera Tube Dolly With Extendable Track," Double that amount. We bought 18m of tubes based on our tripod and track needs. This is how we measured. If you’re using the same length as we did, you can skip this part. Example: I need a dolly of 6m:I need 12m of tube);
, For transport, you’d probably want them to be 1m or 1m50. How many individual tubes will you have? Multiply this number by 30 centimeter (11.8 in) and add to the first number. These will be the joints locking the tubes together. Example: 12m of tube divided by 1m50 pieces, is 8. 8 x 30 cm= 2m40

, Round up and add. Example: a = 75 centimeter (29.5 in), rounded up to 80 centimeter (31.5 in); b = 66 centimeter (26.0 in), rounded up to 70 centimeter (27.6 in); Total: 1m50.

, Example: 12m + 2m40 + 1m50 = 15m90 + a bit of extra: 18m

, Ours had one thick and one smaller ending, so we had to adapt ourselves. If your tubes have both endings the same, some steps will be much easier for you. Some hardware stores might sell tubes with two small ends, but our stores in Venezuela only sold these. Same applies to your T-sections: ours had to connect on two sides to the small end and on one end to the big tube end, which made a difference in the sawing and measuring.
, Cut the other larger tubes in the lengths you want for your track part. Example: 4 tubes of 3m, cut in pieces of 1m50 = 8 track parts

, Take one and saw off a piece with a big end, equal to the top of the T of your dolly. Take the other tube, and saw off a piece of about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) with a big end. This will be the lower part of your dolly cart. You should have two tubes, each with a big end and a small end. Now, saw those two in half, mark them as dolly cart parts and put them aside.

, Saw off the centerpiece of the cart with two small endings. Mark it and put it aside with the other dolly parts. Example: Our tripod measured, rounded up, 70 centimeter (27.6 in) in between. That’s the length of the centerpiece.

, Mark and put aside with the other tracks parts.

, Cut them in pieces. Put these aside for the joints (amount of track parts minus 2). The rest will be used for testing. Mark and put aside. Example: 8 track parts, require 6 joints of about 20 centimeter (7.9 in). We should have 60 centimeter (23.6 in) of tubing left for tests.

, Mark and put aside.

, This is where the tripod will actually stand on. Saw the pieces, mark them and put them aside.

, Choose a drill head corresponding to the size of the screw. Take a track tube from the pile.

,, It’ll be easier to handle.

, Leave some space, so the screws won’t touch each other in the tubes.

,, Take the pieces of your dolly that require wheels and place them next to the test tube. Draw the first line over the complete length of your dolly cart tube. Keep the lines aligned, and draw the second line. Do this for all the 4 dolly cart tubes.

, opening. Drill on this mark and add the wheels.

, Put your dolly cart together. Align the wheel lines you made earlier with each other, over the T-sections.

,, Give the whole some time to dry to make sure they’re fixed.

, Mark the middle of the joint, and put one line of glue on the opposite side of the opening, from the rim to the center you just marked. Place this half inside the tube. Repeat this for the other track parts until you’re out of joints. You might have two tubes without joints, which is fine. Put the tracks aside.

, Put it aside. Example: We taped two pieces of 80 centimeter (31.5 in) to each other in a T-shape.

, Line it with foam or some other soft material to serve as shock absorber. Example: We used a yoga mat.

,, Your dolly is ready, and you can now think of a cool way of painting your dolly. We chose not to paint, so none would attempt at stealing our equipment.

, Example: We decided on 6 rails, because that was the amount of useful wood we received for free. Rails will give the dolly track more stability and keep the tracks more evenly aligned. Think about building these when filming on uneven streets or in nature.

, These will keep the dolly track tubes in place on the plywood.

, Put the pieces of plywood and 2x4 under the track, where you want them to be. The tubes should be tightly nestled in between the 2x4 bits, but you should still be able to take the tracks easily.

, Drive your dolly cart of the tracks and check if the wheels aren’t touching the wood. Adjust until they fit.

, Your rails are ready.

Understand how layers work, and what they can do for you.,
Know your way around the layers window or box in your favourite program.,
Experiment!,
Try out some tutorials that need layers.,
Start thinking in layers when you work digitally.",How to Use Layers for Digital Art," Picture drawing on two sheets of glass or clear plastic. You draw a background on one, and a person on the other. When you put them together, you have a person standing in front of a background, but you can paint more in the background without worrying about affecting the person too. Layers are like layers of glass, you can see them all combined together but you work on each one separately, and a top layer will conceal parts of the layers beneath it. You can also use them to paint or draw on top of a rough sketch, combine different parts of a photo together, colour a picture underneath the outlines, or add special effects with digital art magic!;
, This article contains a diagram for GIMP, but almost any art program will have all or most of these functions, and potentially more, in their layers interface. Experiment or look at a help file to find out what does what!


Your selected layer (1) should be highlighted or marked somehow, it's the one you are currently editing and changing. Any drawing, erasing or colouring you do to your image will affect only the layer you've selected. If you edit the layer's mode or opacity, it will also only affect the selected layer.






Your layers window should also show thumbnails of every layer (2) so you can switch between them, usually by left clicking on them. Right clicking might bring up further, advanced options. Looking at your little thumbnails or naming your layers will help you keep track of which is which.






Mode (3) and opacity (4) let you choose how your layers interact with other layers. Using mode, for example, you can set one layer to define the colours for an image while the layer beneath it defines the lights and darks. This is a good way to quickly sepia tone an image, for example. Opacity controls how see-through your layer is. At 100%, any drawing you do on a top later will completely obscure those beneath it. At lower percents, you can see through that top layer to what's beneath. This can be helpful in seeing a rough sketch beneath your digital painting, combining two photos seamlessly, and many other situations.






The new layer button (5) makes a new layer and adds it to your list of layers. Make sure you make your new layer ""transparent"" if you don't want it to be filled with a colour already, and thus obscure your lower layers. Transparency is often shown as a grey-on-grey checkerboard pattern.






The up (6) and down (7) buttons let you shuffle the order of your layers, by moving them up or down on your list. A layer that was mostly hidden by other layers because it was on the bottom will be fully visible if you move it to the top.






Duplicate or clone layer (8) makes a second, identical copy of your selected layer. This is very helpful if you want to experiment with something new but don't want to have to undo a whole bunch of steps if you mess up. If it doesn't work, just delete your copy and try again with the original (or another copy!)






Delete (9) deletes your current layer completely.






Finally, and importantly, hide (10) is usually shown by an eye symbol. Clicking it will hide your layer- it still exists, but it's no longer being shown in the picture. Use this when you want to see what your image would look like without one layer, but don't want to get rid of it for good!







, The best way to really get your head around layers is just to open a new image and experiment a bit. Try adding new layers and drawing on them with different colours, or putting one photo above another and changing the opacity or the layer mode.

, You could add lightning to your photo on a new layer, or Create a mock magazine image. Never again will you be put off by the instruction ""make a new layer""!

, Think about tasks you used to do with traditional mediums, or things you've always wanted to do but couldn't. Have trouble staying in the lines in a colouring book? It's easier if the lines are on another layer! Do you draw your sketches in pencil, then have trouble erasing some of the lines you don't need? Draw lines you'll need to erase later on a different layer! When you know what you can do with the layers tool,

Grab a mug.,
Find a photo to use.,
Check the size of the photo.,
Print the photo using transfer paper.,
Spray the paper with clear acrylic coating.,
Cut the image out and soak it in water.,
Apply the image and let it dry.,
Wash the mug.",How to Make Photo Mugs1," Your first step in creating a photo mug is to find a mug you would like to customize. You can use any mug that you would like. However, you might want to consider the color, texture and shape of the mug. Generally, smooth mugs with a regular shape will work best. Mugs with a solid color that match the colors in your photo will also work better.


Mugs with a bumpy or rough surface may be difficult to attach an image to.
Mugs with unusual shapes can warp an image.;
, Once you've selected a mug that you want to customize, you can pick out one of your favorite photos to use. You can choose any photo you'd like to print out and apply to your mug. Have fun picking out a picture that you think would be a good fit.It's likely that your photo will need to be in a digital format to allow for easy printing.
Your photo will need to be printed out.

, Before you print your photo out and apply it to the mug, you should check the print size of the image. You will want to make sure that the image will fit in the area of the mug you've selected. Any image that is too big or too small may end up making your mug look differently than you had planned.


It can be useful to measure the planned image space on your mug before printing.
Before you print, most printers will give you a “print preview”. This will likely tell you the dimensions of the printed image.
If the image is too large or small, you will have to resize the image.

, Now that you have an image ready to print, you should load up your printer with transfer paper. Transfer paper is special printing paper that will allow you to permanently stick the image onto your mug. Make sure your printer is loaded with transfer paper and not regular paper before printing.Transfer paper can be easily purchased on-line.
Large chain stores will likely have transfer paper in stock. Check in the craft or printing paper sections.

, Some transfer printing papers are already coated with an outside seal. However, if your transfer paper is not, you will need to apply a clear acrylic coat to the image once it has been printed. This will help make the image last longer and will make your mug dishwasher safe.You can find clear acrylic coating in most hardware or home improvement stores.
Large chain stores will likely carry acrylic coating.
Make sure you fully coat the entire image you are using.
Allow the coating plenty of time to dry before continuing. The amount of time it takes for your acrylic coating to dry will vary depending on the type you've used. Some take only a few minutes, while others take hours.

, After your coating has dried, you can cut the image out, trimming away the rest of the paper sheet. Once the image is the size and shape you want, you will need to soak it in water for a few minutes. This will prepare the image for application to the mug. Fill a small bowl up with water.
Put the images you want to apply into the water after you've cut them out.
Make sure the images are fully submerged.
The images will need to soak for around one minute before you can apply them to the mug.

, Once your image has soaked in water, it is ready to be applied to the mug. Take the image out of the water, remove any backing from the paper, and stick it on the mug. You can make some adjustments to the positioning of the image before it dries, so don't worry about getting it perfect at first.Once you have the image where you want it, allow it plenty of time to dry.
Some images will take longer to dry than others, depending on the type of transfer paper you used.
Read the instructions on your transfer paper to learn exactly how long your mug needs to dry.

, After the image has dried in place, you'll want to wash the mug before using it. This will clean away any residue from the application process. Once your mug is clean, you can start using it and enjoying your newly decorated mug."

Order your mug.",How to Make Photo Mugs2," There are many services that will print images on mugs for you to enjoy. However, not all of them offer similar prices. You may find that some services will cost less than others. Take some time to compare the quality and price of different printing services before choosing one.


Many printing services can be found on-line.
Make sure there aren't any hidden costs. For example, a service might display the cost of the mug and keep the printing cost separate.
You might be able to find promotional codes or coupons.

, Almost every printing service will require you to have the image you want to use in a digital format. These services will require you to upload the image you want to use before they can create the mug for you. Keep in mind that there may be additional requirements for your image file. Take some time to review what the printing service needs before they can make your photo mug.


Your image will need to be in a digital format.
Some services have image size requirements. Your image will need to fit within the printer's specifications for image size.
Some printing services only use certain file types. Make sure your image is an acceptable file type before uploading.

, Once you have a photo ready and have found a printing service you like, you can make an account and select the mug you want.

Most on-line printing services will have a clearly labeled button or option to upload the photo you want to use. Your image will usually be applied to create a preview image of what the completed mug will look like.


You may want to resize or edit your image if it doesn't fit the mug correctly.
Always review the preview image before ordering to ensure that your mug is exactly how you want it.
If you are having trouble, most printing services have a help department that you can contact with your questions.

, If you've uploaded your photo and are happy with how the mug will look, all that's left to do is finalize your order.

Find square, rectangular or round glass pieces to cover your magnets.,
Select the photos that you would like to use as magnets.,
Buy a sheet of neodymium magnets online or at a craft store.,
Trace the shape of your glass piece over your photograph with a pencil.

,
Cut out the shape with a pair of sharp scissors.

,
Trace and cut out the same sized shape on your magnet sheet, if you are using an adhesive magnet sheet.,
Place some newspaper or cardboard over your work surface, so that you don't get any glue on the table.

,
Clean your glass with vinegar.,
Choose a strong, clear glue, such as Diamond Glaze, to affix your glass to your photograph.,
Set the textured side of the glass down on top of the glue.,
Flip the glass around so the back of the photograph is exposed.,
Affix the photograph to the magnet.",How to Make Photo Magnets," The size and shape will determine the shape of your magnets. Glass pieces with 1 textured side and 1 smooth side are available at craft stores or online.;
, Size them up on your computer so that they are small enough to fit on your magnet shape. Print them out on your computer or order them in the correct size from a photo shop.

, Look for magnet sheets with an adhesive side. If you cannot find this, then you can also buy individual button magnets.


Neodymium magnets are stronger than traditional fridge magnets. Many magnet sheets that are sold in craft stores are not strong enough to hold up items, and can only be used for decoration.

,,, If you are using button magnets, ignore this step.

,, Wipe it clean with a lint-free cloth.

, Place a thick strip of glue across the image of your cut photograph.

, Slide it around to create a complete covering of the photograph. Wipe the excess glue from all the edges and allow it to dry.

, Paint a layer of clear glue on the back of the photograph to seal it in. Allow it to dry.

, Depending upon the magnet you chose, you can do this in a few different ways.


If you chose a magnet sheet with adhesive on 1 side, cut out the correct size according to your glass shape. Remove the tape from the adhesive side and carefully place it on the back of your photograph. Press on it firmly.
If you chose a button magnet, then apply a dot of superglue onto the back of your photograph. Place it on the center, or place 2 dots, if it is a large photograph. Press button magnets onto the points of glue. Remove excess with a toothpick. Allow it to dry.

Understand the full potential of all your photography equipment.,
Practice quick and effective shooting.,
Scout locations.,
Google the locations before you go on your recce and see what other photographers have done there in the past.,
Write a shot list of exactly what you’re going to do at every location.,
Write the following info down the day before every wedding:


Groom Coverage Shot List: Details, Flower, Tie, Cufflinks, Rings, Cologne, Watch, Ask the groom if there is anything else he wants?,
Bring a pen and paper with you when you’re doing your recce.,
Start trying to find someone to assist as soon as you book your first wedding or even before that.,
try to put yourself in their shoes and guess what shots they are going to do next.,
Ask questions.,
Get some friends together or a couple that you know to act as your guinea pigs.,
Go on location to the actual spots you are going to use for your first wedding.",How to Prepare to Photograph Your First Wedding," Pick up your camera and make sure you know all the settings, understand the modes, get to know the settings that are available on your lenses (image stabiliser for example), work out all the options available on your speedlite, etc.;
, Once you think you know your stuff, grab a friend or partner and practice getting perfectly exposed images, quickly and in a lot of different locations.


Go into a room, position your subject where you would position your bridal party (ideally photographer back to a window) and take a photo of him/her as quickly as possible with perfect exposure. Then walk outside to the backyard and do the same, find the best spot, either in the shade or with the sun behind the subject and shoot. Then head to the front yard, then the kitchen, study, whatever! Use your flash, practice in a darker room with little window light as this would be similar to the conditions you will be up against in the reception. Bounce the flash off the roof, or the wall, or turn it off and crank your ISO to see what happens. Practice all these options and see what works best, so that on the day, you’ll be prepared.

, This is another must-do before the wedding so you can be prepared. You most likely won’t get a chance to see the groom's house or bride's house before the day but you can assume it would be like any average home. As long as there is light in the lounge room and master bedroom, you will be okay.


Apart from the groom and bride coverage you should definitely scope out the scenes at the church / ceremony location, as well as the locations you intend to go to and even pop into the reception venue and see what you’re up against.

, Then head over, use their shots as inspiration and work out your own ideas. Walk around everywhere, find the best spots and use your camera! Take photos pretending the couple is standing there so you can work out your compositions.

, Feel free to be as specific as possible and then try to memorize it. Many people feel that writing it with pen and paper actually helps you to remember everything a lot more than just typing it out.

,
Boys Getting Ready: Boys helping groom with cufflinks, Boys helping groom with tie, All boys putting vests on, All boys helping adjust the back of each others vests, Slap each other in the ass shot! All boys grab jackets and do the Roger David shot, All boys put on jackets, Hero shot of all the boys fully dressed looking awesome, Serious and gangster! Big smiles, Hugging and ruffing up the groom! etc, etc.
This may seem overly detailed, and all weddings are different, and things happen and you can’t always do all these shots, but at least you have all your shots memorised so whatever happens, you'll be prepared and always have ideas up your sleeve!
Do this for the bride coverage and definitely the locations too.

, As you're finding spots, write stuff down.

, The sooner you start assisting the more prepared you will be. This will give you first hand experience from a pro (hopefully) of exactly what goes on behind the scenes of a wedding.

, Imagine what settings you would use on your camera as you go from location to location.

, Best of all, you get a decent amount of one on one time with the photographer while driving around so you can ask plenty of questions (without being annoying!!). Pick their brains, most of the time they should be more than happy to help you and divulge their knowledge as they know that once upon a time they started out just like you.

, try to mimic some of the shots that you are actually going to do on the wedding day.


Shoot the groom coverage in a lounge room, try to memories the shots you need and practice getting the images perfect in camera. Same as the bride coverage, don’t worry about the dress, just try to get the shots.

, Shoot all the images you would for the real day. Practice getting it right in camera. There is no pressure doing it this way, so take your time and get it right, until it becomes almost second nature!

Use natural light as much as possible.,
Stage gatherings or events for the photos.,
Make a list of images you’d like to take at events or gatherings.,
Use the viewfinder.,
Zoom in and fill the frame.,
Pick attractive backgrounds.,
Play around with different angles and perspectives.,
Apply filters to the photos before you print them.,
Make copies of the original photos.,
Use very little adhesive on the photos in the scrapbook.,
Arrange the photos chronologically.",How to Take Photos for Scrapbooking," When you are setting up photos for your scrapbook, try to shoot outdoors and use natural lighting. Aim to shoot in the morning or late afternoon, when outdoor light tends to be best. Using natural light will give your photos a more golden hue and often produce nice background settings for your photos.Cloudy or overcast days are often best for shooting people. Try not to shoot people outdoors when the sun is high in the sky without clouds, as this can create harsh lighting that is not flattering for your subjects.;
, To make taking photos of your loved ones easier, you may stage a gathering at your home to then take photos. This may be useful if you want to capture loved ones all together as a group or for a special occasion, such as someone’s birthday or anniversary. Arrange gatherings in a location with nice background settings. Hold events at your home and use them as a photo opportunity for your scrapbook.


For example, you may host your daughter’s birthday party and use it as an opportunity to take photos for a scrapbook page on her birthday.

, To help you prepare for taking photos, make a list of images that you’d like to get at events or gatherings with loved ones. This way, you can make sure you get as many photos as you need to fill up the pages of your scrapbook.


For example, if you are making a page in your scrapbook on your siblings, you may make sure you get individual images of each sibling at a family gathering.

, When taking photos for the scrapbook, always use the viewfinder to make sure you are capturing a good picture of a landscape or a person. Check that there are no obstructions over the person’s face or any things from the landscape that may appear to be coming out of the person’s head, such as trees or poles. The viewfinder can help you make sure every image you capture looks good.You should also use the viewfinder to make sure you are capturing a setting or a person in good light. Check that the image is in focus and not blurry or grainy in the viewfinder before you snap the picture.

, Get the most out of the images you take by filling the frame with a landscape or a person. If you are photographing a group of people, focus on the top half of their bodies and do not worry about getting their legs or feet in the photo. Zoom in on faces and scenes so the frame is full and does not have a lot of empty space.When you are zooming into faces, make sure the person’s eyes are in focus. This will make the image more clear and ensure the subject looks engaged in the photo.

, When taking photos of subjects, make sure the backgrounds are attractive and interesting. Use the viewfinder on the camera to confirm the background is nice before you snap the photo. Ask a subject to move or gather in a spot with a nice background so the photo looks good.For example, if you are photographing a big group of people in a park, you may ask everyone to stand in front of trees in the park or a fountain, rather than by the trashcans in the park.

, Move around when you take photographs so you can get different angles and perspectives on your subjects. If you are shooting a big group, stand on a chair above the group so you can get everyone in the photo. If you are shooting one person, stand in front of them and make sure you are at their level when you take their picture.When you are taking photos of children for your scrapbook, shoot them at a low angle. This may mean squatting or sitting down so you are at the same level as the child or just a below them.
If you want to get a shot of a person standing in front of a nice background, step back from them so you can get the person and some of the background in the photo.

, If you are using a digital camera, you can try applying filters to the photos before you print them out. Upload the photos to your computer and then apply filters to the photos using the filter options in a photo editing program like iPhoto. You can also change images from color to black and white and vice versa in the photo editing program.If you are using a film camera to take photos, you may try using black and white film as well as color film so you can have options when you place the photos in your scrapbook.
You can also resize the photos to your liking in the photo editing program.

, Have more than one copy of the original photo on hand so you do not have to worry about only having access to the original when you scrapbook. It can be good to have backup copies, especially if you are going to be cutting or decorating the photos in your scrapbook.You may also try laying out the photos on a page in your scrapbook to make sure they are what you want. Having a few copies of the same photo in different sizes can give you options as you scrapbook.

, To ensure the photos look their best in the scrapbook, try to use very little glue or tape on the photos. Use small dots of wet glue on the back of the photo so the photos do not get warped when you attach them to the pages in the scrapbook.You can also use inserts or photo corners instead to attach the photos to the pages, as this will require no adhesive and ensure the photos lay flat on the page.

, As you lay the photos out in your scrapbook, consider doing so chronologically, starting with the older photos first. You may arrange photos on one page chronologically or organize the scrapbook as a whole chronologically. This will make the scrapbook feel like a chronicle of your time with your loved ones.


For example, if you are making a scrapbook about your daughter, you may start with photos from when she was born. Then, you may continue with photos of her birthdays and other landmark moments like her first step or her first bath. You may then end the scrapbook with current photos of her now.

Understand that images are comprised of different, individual layers, which contain the various colors, effects, design, and text.,
Open Photoshop from the Start Menu.,
Press Command+J (Mac) or Ctrl+J (Win) to first create a copy of your image.,
Give the copy a name.,
Select the Layers tab from the toolbar section on the right side located on the interface.",How to Remove Text from a Photo in Photoshop1," All of these layers create the final image in Photoshop. Not only do these layers consist of your final JPEG file, they also give you a final PSD file. If you’re not familiar with it, PSD is an acronym that simply stands for Photoshop documents.The different layers can either be made invisible or visible on your image. They can also be rasterized to remove a segment of the layers. When you rasterize an image, you are basically turning it into a graphic so that you can manipulate it.;
, On the interface that appears, select File from the Menu. Click Open on the drop-down list. Find and open your image on the Open window.

, This is so you don’t make any changes to the original. If you look in the Layers panel, you’ll see that you now have two layers with the same image. The original stays safe on the Background layer, and the editing work you’re about to do will be on the copy on Layer 1 above it., It’s a good idea to adjust the name. Otherwise, you could easily get it mixed up with the original. So that you know which image it is, however, you may want to keep the same name but at the end in all caps, add “WITH TEXT REMOVED.”


To do this, right-click directly on Layer 1. The Rename option will appear. Change the name. Press Return (Mac) and Enter (Win) to accept the name change.

, Inside the toolbox, right-click on layer and choose Rasterize layer from the options. Select the Lasso tool from the toolbar option. Then select part of the image that you want to remove. Hit Delete. From the Menu, select File and Save to save the changes you made.Of all the tools in Photoshop, the Lasso Tool is probably the easiest to understand. With it selected, your cursor will appear as a small lasso icon, and you click somewhere along the side of the text that you want to delete. Continue holding the mouse button and drag to draw an outline around it. When you’re finished, hit delete to remove the text.To better understand layers, you can look at them as simply one image on top of another. Imagine you have a piece of paper and you paint it red. Then you take a piece of clear cellophane and paint a yellow circle on it; lay it over the paper. Now you take another piece of cellophane and paint a word written in blue on it; lay that on top of the yellow circle. So now, you have a red background with 2 layers on that are yellow and blue. Each one is referred to as a layer. This is what Photoshop means when it refers to layers. It’s basically all the separate parts of the whole.

Decide how many photos you want to place on display.,

Cut the wire.,
Fit the hair clip to the end of the wire.,
Push the wires into the covered dome.,
Place photos into the clips.,
Place on display.",How to Make a Tree Photo Holder," Anywhere from one to six photos will work well with this design.


Note that the amount of photos will determine how much wire and hair clips you'll need for this project.;
, Some hints include:


If you're using sequins or small beads, stick a sequin pin in the middle of each sequin or through the bead hole. Move around the dome from base to top, following a row all the way and overlapping the layer already added with the next layer. Keep it as neat as possible.
For larger beads, beads without holes, glitter or any other sort of decoration, glue in place. Dab a little glue on the surface of the dome and on the back of each item being added, and work your way around the dome methodically in rows, from base to top. For glitter, simply slather the glue over the dome and sprinkle on glitter generously.
Allow all work to dry before proceeding. If using glitter, shake off any excess once dried.

, Each photo added will need to be on a different length of wire. This ensures that you can see the photos when placed on display. In each case, don't make the length so long that the dome will topple over. If this happens, simply cut the wire down a little more.


If only using one photo, cut it to the length desired.

, Push the wire up through the opening of the spring (at the back of the hair clip). If this proves too tricky, wrap the wire around the clip instead. Glue in place to be sure it won't shift.

, Push in between joins of the chosen decorations, if needed.


Put short wires at the front and to the sides.
Put long wires toward the back of the dome.

, Simply open the clips and squeeze the photo in. Rearrange the wires, including bending them any which way, if needed; keep playing with the arrangement until the photos can all be seen with ease.

, This looks great on a desk or shelf. Photos can be changed as often as you'd like, to keep the display fresh and interesting.

There are many options of board mounts to choose from, including but not limited to, Fotoflat, Foamex, Foamcore, Gatorboard and Colormount.;
, Use a ruler to measure the dimensions of your print. Remember that if you want to leave a border, your photo needs to be slightly smaller than the mounting board. Cut your photo to size accordingly., Dry mount tissue is a special adhesive paper designed to attach photos to mounting boards. Cut the tissue slightly smaller than the photo, about 1/8 inch (3 mm) smaller than the print on all sides, so the edges aren't visible beneath it.Using an acid-free dry mount tissue is recommended as an acid-based tissue might cause visible damage to your mounted photos in the years to come.

, Using small pieces of clear tape, attach the dry mount tissue to the back of your photograph at each corner. This will hold it in place while you start adhering the tissue at the center.

, Too hot of an iron will damage your photo. You can also invest in a dry mounting press, although they tend to be more expensive., Clean the backside of your photograph leaving no traces of dust so it will stick to your board without fuss. Be sure the tissue is attached, and center the print on the mounting board., This is an important step as blotter paper will absorb excess moisture from the iron and will keep your photo from getting damp. The blotter paper should be the same size as the print and it goes right over your photo when you're ironing.

, Press the iron down firmly in the center of the photo. Hold your iron or dry mount press there for about 5 minutes so the heat warms up the photo, dry mount tissue and mounting board. Pull the corners of the photo up carefully after the middle is firmly attached to the mounting board and remove the tape before adhering the edges to the board.

, Practicing this step first with an old print may help you get used to the process to ensure no mistakes are made. Make sure your iron stays in contact with the blotter paper to avoid getting bubbles in the mounted photo. Press the iron firmly down on the edges of the photo under even pressure for 5 minutes at each location., Place your mounted photo on top of a cutting board, and use a box cutter or X-Acto knife to trim the edges of your mount board. Lay your ruler over an edge of the photo while cutting so you cut in a straight line. Smooth the edges of your photo with a nail file when you're finished trimming."

Gently smooth any bubbles or wrinkles.,
Wipe away any glue.",How to Mount Photographs2," Adhesive options include roll-on, brush-on or even spray-on glues that are specifically designed for mounting photos. For spray-on glues, it's a good idea to use a respirator mask to avoid inhalation of fumes.You can mount the photo on a typical mount board, or use cloth if you're mounting something like a map and plan on rolling it up.

, When wet mounting a photo or print, you'll want to cover your entire work area with a tablecloth, newspapers or a piece of plywood so you don't damage the furniture underneath. You wouldn't want your adhesive sticking to your table or desk and peeling the surface off., Position the photo on the mounting board where you want it to be using a ruler to make sure the bordering edges are the same size, and make small pencil marks just inside each corner on the front of the mounting board. The marks will be used as guides when you turn your photo over after applying the mounting adhesive.


If you don't want a border on your mount board, then you won't have to worry about the bordering edges being even.

, Lay your photo upside down on a flat surface. Spray, rub or brush the glue on the photo in an even coat making sure to cover the corners and edges. Spread the adhesive evenly on the entire backside of the photograph ensuring that there are no lumps or dry spots., Flip the photo over onto the mounting board using the guide marks where you first measured to line it up evenly. Make sure it is centered on the mounting board before pressing down.

, Work your way from the center of the photo to the edges — first to one end, then the other and so on. Then gently lift the corners to get rid of any bubbles, and press from the center to each corner. You can use certain tools such as a rolling pin, round bottle or brayer to smooth the surface and to guarantee an even-textured finish.Because glue can seep out from underneath the print, place strips of paper over the edges and corners of the photo so the tool you're using doesn't get glue on it.

, In the likely occurrence that adhesive seeps from the edges of the photo, wipe it away with a damp cloth. Wring out the towel so you don't soak your finished product. Cover your mounted print with a heavy flat object (like a book) to keep it in place while it dries, and read the directions on the adhesive you used for the recommended dry time."

Decide on size.,
Gather your materials.,
Cut your box.,
Turn your box and add paper.,
Add the backing sheet.,
Light the box.",How to Make a Lightbox1," The fist thing you'll need to do before you build your light box is choose what size box is right for your needs. This is because most light boxes are made from actual boxes. If you plan to mostly photograph small items such as flowers, collectible porcelain, or toys, your box can be relatively small (around 1' cubed); for larger items like kitchen appliances, a proportionally larger box will be needed.


Generally speaking, make sure the box you choose will be roughly twice the size or more of the objects you plan to photograph. This means a bigger box is usually a safer bet, but a bigger box will also take up more space. Plan according o your needs and limitations.;
, By far the easiest way to make a light box at home is to start with a heavy corrugated cardboard box. You can construct a light box from more durable materials, but unless you plan to pack it up and haul it around a lot, there isn't much of a point to doing so. In addition to your box, you'll need a box cutter, a ruler, tape, and bright white printer paper.


If your box is significantly larger on each side than two pieces of printer paper set side by side, you'll need bigger material for making the box white. A thin, clean white cloth, such as a crisp new bedsheet, will work; bright paper in a specialty size or projector screen material can also be used.

, Begin by cutting the lid flaps off the top of your box.


Use your ruler's width to define a margin of space along every edge of one side of your box.






Then cut out that side of the box, leaving your margin intact.






Leave the other three sides and the bottom of the box uncut.







, Turn the box so that the side you just cut open faces the ceiling, and the top of the box faces you. This is the proper orientation for your light box. Lay sheets of printer paper, slightly overlapping, on every inside surface of the box and tape them securely using rolled tape pressed underneath them. The inside of the box should be completely white.

, To hide the back bottom corner and create a seamless, featureless background for your photographs, you'll need to add a curved sheet of paper over it. For smaller boxes, just set a sheet of printer paper in the back so that it goes partway up the back wall and partway across the floor of the box, as though it was “sitting.” Don't fold it; let it bend naturally. Tape it loosely at the top.


For larger boxes, bright white posterboard or a similar material at your preferred level of gloss is ideal.






If you'd prefer a non-white background, the backing sheet can be whatever color you want. It won't be securely attached to the box, so you can change it out whenever you like.







, Now that the box is constructed, it needs to be brightly lit. Smaller boxes can use flexible desk lamps; larger boxes may need clip lamps or larger flexible lamps. Angle two lamps so that they're shining directly down into the light box, one from each side, each facing its opposite wall. Turn both lights on and set an item into the box for a test photo.


Use the brightest bulbs available to ensure the brightest possible light for your shots. Adjust the lamps so that there are no shadows on the ground around your test object.






For larger boxes, a third overhead lamp may be added. Be sure to experiment and make sure it doesn't cast harsh shadows.

Make more cuts.,
Evenly cover the sides.,
Add internal coverage.,
Light the box.",How to Make a Lightbox2," To make a three-lamp box that uses more diffused light, you'll need to cut out three sides of your box instead of just one. Be sure to leave the edge margins so that the box maintains its shape.

, Using a bright, fresh sheet or a roll of bright white paper, cover all three sides tautly and evenly, securing your coverage to the fourth side with duct tape or a similar adhesive. Make sure there are no wrinkles or snags in your coverage.

, Turn the box so it's resting on the uncut side, with the top facing you and the bottom at the back. Using your box cutter, cut a thin slit at the top of the back of the box, in the edge margin. Make it nearly as wide as the box itself. Use a long piece of stiff paper as a backing sheet by sliding it through the slot, allowing it to curve naturally towards you once it hits the bottom of the box.


If the paper doesn't adequately cover the bottom of the box where you'll be photographing, lay a second piece flat underneath it.

, Use one lamp on each side and one lamp above the top of the box. The empty sides will allow the light to diffuse through your translucent coverage and create a bright, even light inside the box.


Be sure to keep the lights a little ways away from the sides of the box, to avoid overheating it.

Get a lot of space.,
Acquire materials.,
Set up your lights.,
Set up your white coverage.,
Light and shoot.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Lightbox3," Continuing with the theme of “make it bigger than what you're photographing,” a blank white “light box” for photographing people is quite large by necessity. At the very least, you'll need an entire room of your house; if you can find a space that's 20' by 20' by 10' high or larger, that's even better.


A clean and empty garage might do the trick.

, To start with, you can't expect paper to hold up with people walking all over it, so for the floor, you'll need white tile board instead. Buy enough to cover 10' by 10' or more of the floor. Next, buy a roll of 9' seamless paper, available at specialty stores, and some sturdy stands and A-clamps for holding it high and in place. Purchase three bright lights, all of the same type, on tall stands (at least 10' adjustable). Finally, purchase some white-backed bi-fold doors from a place like Home Depot.

You can also buy bi-fold doors and attach white tile board to one side.
This setup is for a professional-quality photograph. It isn't cheap or quick. If you just want ordinary photos of people, you can hang seamless paper with a couple bright lights and play with positioning until you get a decent-quality shot.

, Put your main light high and centered on where your seamless paper will be hanging. Put a screen over it to diffuse the light slightly. Set the other two lights on stands ahead and to either side of the main lamp, angled somewhat towards the center. Use a bi-fold door inside and ahead of each side lamp to prevent direct light from reaching the subject area from the side lamps. Fold them so their corners point inward and their white backs face the lamps. Leave 9' of space between them, through which the main light should be shining., Lay down two sections of white tile board on the ground, from the camera position to where the seamless paper will hang. Overlay them very slightly, with the camera-side layer above the seamless-side layer so that the lip won't show up in photographs. Set your seamless paper roll up on stands and pull it down and partway over the tile board, allowing it to bend naturally as it turns onto the floor towards the camera. Hold the paper in place with A-clamps at the top., There are many other considerations that go into getting a perfect shot from this setup, but from this point, the basics are taken care of. Set your subject ahead of and between the bi-fold doors, close to the seamless paper. Turn on all three lights and start shooting from between and behind the bi-fold doors.,"

Drop your shoulders.,
Position your head in a flattering way.,
Arch your back.,
Position your arms in a flattering manner.",How to Pose for Engagement Photos1," When you're posing in a still photograph, consciously drop your shoulders down slightly. When nervous, people often hunch their shoulders. Lowering your shoulders will both make you look more relaxed and elongate your body, creating a leaner look.Try to be aware of your shoulders throughout the shoot. You may find yourself unconsciously hunching them again if you get nervous during the shoot.
Try taking a few deep breaths from time to time. This may help you relax and lower your shoulders.;
, Try to position your head in a way that accents your best features. Turn your head slightly towards the camera. Do not look directly at the camera, as this may look awkward, but you have your head turned just a little towards the lens.Tilt your head down slightly as well. This will make you look upward with your eyes, making them look bigger.

, You do not want to be slouching in your engagement photos. This can make you look nervous and contribute to the hunched shoulder look. Be aware of your back throughout the shoot and try to arch it slightly the entire time. This will make you look tall and confident throughout the photos., Arms can be tricky, as people are often self conscious of their arms. If you do not want your arms to look too big during the photo shoot, hold them away from your body. If you're nervous about your arms, you may hold them closer to your body. This can actually spread out your skin, causing your arms to look bigger. Try to hold your arms at least six inches away from your body at all times. While this may feel awkward, it will look better on camera.Place your weight on your feet in leaning photos. If you're, say, leaning against a wall, do not place your weight against your arms. This may flatten out your arms, which can look awkward.You can also try posing with your arms if you don't want them just held out at your sides. You can hold your partner's hand or place your hands on your hips, curving your arms. Ask the photographer for suggestions on how to position your arms.

Kiss slowly.,
Try walking.,
Interact with each other throughout the session.,
Take some action photos at home.",How to Pose for Engagement Photos2," Kissing photos are a classic pose for engagement pictures. However, kissing too quickly may cause your faces to look awkward or smushed together. You want to give the photographer time to capture the best angles during kissing shots, so kiss slowly.Kissing slowly may feel awkward. However, it will produce better photos. Try for slow, precise kissing throughout the photo shoot.

, A great pose can be a walking pose. You and your partner can walk somewhere together arm-in-arm or holding hands. You can walk in an area that's special to you. For example, try taking a walk through the neighborhood where you first met.You should try to walk slowly to give the photograph a chance to capture your movements.
You can try doing romantic poses when walking. For example, walk hand in hand or link your arms when you walk.

, Try to give the photographer a chance to capture some candid photos. You do not want to look stiff and posed for all your photos. Try interacting as you normally would. Talk, laugh, and snuggle while the camera is on. This way, you will have a few candid photos to choose from when you're done taking engagement photos.Look into each other's eyes while the photos are being taken. This helps the photos look natural.

, You don't always have to pose on a beach or somewhere out in nature. It may be nice to have a few engagement photos of you and your partner simply interacting at home.For example, have the photographer come over and take some photos of the two of you cooking dinner. You can still do romantic things, like kissing, and showcase engagement rings, but you'll be able to choose a few photos that capture aspects of your real life.
You can also try a photo of the two of you curled up on the couch watching television or snuggling.

Choose a setting where you're comfortable.,
Highlight emotion with your eyes.,
Make use of the natural environment.,
Relax your hands and limbs.,
Use your natural smile.",How to Pose for Engagement Photos3," You want to make sure you look natural in your engagement photos. You don't want a photo that feels too posed. Therefore, opt for settings where you personally feel comfortable.If you and your partner aren't the outdoor types, do not opt to take a picture of the two of you enjoying a picnic in the woods. This is unlikely to look natural.
Instead, go for a setting where the two of you feel genuinely comfortable. For example, if you both love seeing movies together, take some engagement photos standing outside a movie theater.

, Your eyes can convey a lot of emotion. Even in pictures where you're not flashing a big smiles, your eyes can reveal happiness. Be aware of your eyes and try to use them to convey emotion while being photographed.Try to relax your facial muscles during the photo shoot. You should also look upward with your eyes, as this can make them bigger and brighter.
Try to think happy, relaxing thoughts. These can shine through in your expression.

, Try to make use of any props around you that would naturally fit into a scene. These can make photos look less posed. For example, if you're shooting in a field, have the photographer take a photo of you through the grass. If you're taking pictures while walking through a busy city street, try sitting together and snuggling on a bench near a bus stop., Remember to have fun. Taking your engagement photos should be a fun experience. Try to relax and let your hands and limbs lie loose. This will make for a more natural feel.Try to get your partner to help with feeling relaxed. Make jokes with them to encourage both of you to laugh and have fun.

, Many people are self-conscious about their smiles. However, you probably have a smile your friends, family members, and loved ones want to see. Allow yourself to showcase your natural smile while taking engagement photos.If you're struggling to smile, think of something that makes you happy or something that makes you laugh.

Realise Sharpness.,
Realise Clarity.,
Be aware of Noise.,
Use layers.,
Use masks.,
Combine images.,
Realise High Dynamic Range imaging (HDR).",How to Increase the Sharpness of a Photograph," Sharpness setting is found in any good retouching software. Depending on the software you use, it may include further settings or just simple one single setting.Further settings in Lightroom are radius, details and amount.Basically sharpness is a global un-sharp mask, which will globally accentuates the details of a picture. The further settings enable you to have more control over the sharpness.;
, Clarity is an option found in Lightroom, it is very useful when you want to give strength to a picture. It makes the edges surrealistic if you over-use it though. Best used for male portraits, landscape and items photography. Combined with the sharpness setting in Lightroom, it turns this software into a very powerful retouching tool.

, Noise may seem quite odd when talking about sharpness. One would mostly try to reduce noise as much as possible when taking a picture. Why would we add noise during post processing then? It is not only the noise we are trying to keep to the minimum when taking a photograph. But it is also about retaining the maximum details available and a good dynamic of colors. This way one has more flexibility in post treatment. Adding noise is about the perception of a picture. Noise gives a photograph some texture, this perception of texture can lead to sharpness. It is a risky mix though, and should be carefully considered.

, This technique requires a powerful retouching software, such as Photoshop.The idea is to create a new layer in which one will just accentuate some edges of a picture (the high pass filter is a good start). Then the layer is mixed with other layers (you would mostly use overlay or soft light). This technique is very powerful. Not only does it bring sharpness, but it also gives the photograph some texture. The flexibility offered by the layer system is priceless.

, The idea of using masks is to give sharpness by contrasts, sharpening only a small part of a picture to make it pop better. You may want to use it to emphasize one element of a photograph.

, The idea of combining images is to reduce the overall noise and to increase the overall resolution.One can combine images through a panorama software or using Photoshop.

, HDR is very controversial, It is about shooting several pictures and then mixing them together to get the most dynamic. The idea is to overcome the sensor limit, which is to capture only a specific range.HDR offers great possibilities, which can also result in very unreal picture look. It is to be used carefully, as a tool to reach a goal.HDR can also be applied without giving an unreal look to pictures, it really depends on your vision and your mastering of the process. Most HDR combining software give you great control over how the pictures will mix. You can use them to obtain great sharpness.

Macro photography: Table top tripod, bean bag tripod, a convenient box or book, etc. There are also types of tripods that you can wrap around a pole or sit on a table, and so on.

Long exposure photography: The most solid tripod you can find;
, If you are shooting wildlife, and you have a very long lens, it will need a T-mount for your lens and the tripod. The tripod will be supporting your lens, not your actual camera.

, There is almost always an alternative method that could serve your purposes. Obviously, if you are going to be doing any type of photography regularly, you will want to have the appropriate camera support.

Determine your need.,
Set your budget.,
Look for user-friendly software.,
Evaluate the software by using free trials.",How to Buy a Green Screen Software for Chroma Key Photography," Standalone green screen photography software are always a better option, as they are specially designed for this purpose. However, the standard photo editing software have many exclusive options that you may not need for background replacement but will need for improving the quality of the picture. If you are not looking for any cutting-edge technology for your studio, simple software would work the best but if you are into making professional videos or a Hollywood movie, you must buy the ones that can help you do multiple tasks.;
, As with anything, set a budget for your green screen software. Don’t be dependent on the free software, since they may not produce as good quality as the paid ones can. Even though you have to spend a little more, buy the professional ones. The image quality that you will get makes it a worthy investment.

, A good background replacement software should be easy to learn and easy to use. A user-friendly interface will save a lot of your time. Always buy a green screen photography software that comes with complete instructions and tutorials so that you don’t have to struggle for using it.

, This is strongly recommended as it will give you an idea of what exactly the green screen photography software offers. Try more than one software to determine which one would fit your needs. Make sure you evaluate how all the important features work and the level of processing they offer. This will help you to choose the best one. A reliable software can help you to become creative and generate convincing pictures and videos using the Chroma keying technology.

Develop a theme.,
Once a theme has been finalized, plan how the photo should look.,
Proceed with shooting the photo.

,
Understand what a trick photo involves.,
Make sure you take all the essential photos at the same time (same lighting, location, etc.).,
Select the best images.,
Make the trick photo.,
Follow the steps required in your respective method of photo.,
Refer to online tutorials for post processing techniques to create trick images.

,
Fix such things as brightness, contrast, toning, color, shadows, etc.,
Remember that on viewing a good trick photo, the person should not be able to tell where the manipulations start and end; he/she should not be able to tell how it was done and should be totally amused if you have used the correct techniques and proper composition.

,Keep practicing and you'll have some new ideas to shoot on and create more wonderful trick photos.",How to Get Started in Doing Trick Photography," Photos with a theme are always better than random clicks. Thus, it's important that you have a clear idea of what message you'd like to convey to your audience. The theme can be anything from abstract daily life, current issues, to love and emotions. Make you sure you have something in mind before you begin the planning for the shoot.;
, This is one of the most important steps in making a trick photo. Just make a mental image of the photo; or, if the image is complex, take a piece of paper and draw whatever you think your final image should look like.

,, A trick photo usually contains more than one photo. Each photo is then either blended together, or parts of it are placed smartly to give the look of a single original photo. This means that you have to take as many photos as it takes to get your final image to look as realistic as possible.

, Once you finish the shoot, you cannot go back later and do it again because the light, location and mood will change and it won't match the previously taken shots.

, You may have taken a lot of pictures; from these, select the ones which you are going to use to make the final image.

, There are several ways to do this, including:


Long exposure (single photo)
Photo manipulation (a group of photos)
Photo stitching, etc.

, For example, to create the image of a man flying:


Take a photo with a man pretending to fly, supported by a stool under him.
Take another picture with no man or stool, just the background.
While editing the images, place the first image on top of the second.
Carefully erase the stool; the background from the second image will fill the erased spot, resulting in it seeming as if you have taken a photo of a man flying.
Similarly you can also add parts from other images into this image and make it even trickier, like adding clouds, a bird or an aeroplane to its background to give a feel of flying in the sky.

,, This is very important so as to present the right mood, and bring the focus on the subject.

Contrazoom.",How to Understand Camera Movements," This is the simplest camera set up, but it is also restricting, presenting what is happening in frame like a play and making it impersonal for the observer. In Barry Lyndon, Kubrick predominantly used static frames to connote the static structure of society.


Spectator focuses more on changes.
Composition essential. Often shot symmetrically;
, Pans are used to reveal new information such as an important clue or hidden character without cutting, so it is more fluid. Speed- Pans 'must' be slow, a common rule is it should take 5 seconds for an object to pan from one side of the frame to the other. Pans and Tilts are commonly used at the beginning and ending of a scene.

, Like a pan tilts are used to reveal new information and are best done slowly.Tilts are effectively used to emphasize the height of something or as a moving close up revealing the details of a character.

, If used too often it can look appalling and make the viewer feel sick. Nevertheless it can be used to great effect w with it connoting honesty, immediacy, and energy, and since it is the closest move to how we see the world it encourages viewer participation. It can be used effectively if juxtaposed against static shots. The camera operator can achieve more stability if the rehearse handheld moves and hold the camera close to their body.

, Steadicams were revolutionary as they offered the freedom of handheld cameras, yet offer a stable picture. This meant that not longer was it a problem to film smooth tracking shots on stairs, rough ground or sand, while its fluid floating quality connotes the story being told from 3rd person NPOV (neutral point of view), dreams and fantasies., If done too often or too quickly it detracts from your film, this is usually because it is unmotivated. Yet a slow hidden(During movement in scene) zoom used at the right moment can be very powerful.

,


Track vs zoom. Tracks are generally better to use as they perform a more natural movement.
A track in focuses the audience attention on the object or person.
A track out makes the protagonist look, less powerful, vulnerable isolated.
A circular track helps to externalise thematic ideas such as conspiracy.

, Where you zoom out while pushing in which makes the subject appear still, but the background appears to stretch . This was effectively used in jaws and goodfellas."

Consider your reasons for starting a photography blog.,
Upload 5-10 photos right when you make your site.,
Make sure your photos are the main attraction.,
Add basic contact information to your page.,
Consider adding a Creative Commons license.",How to Start a Photography Blog1," Are you looking to make a professional site to sell photos or are you just looking to share your work with others? This will make a big difference on your overall blog, as there are many different blogging sites depending on your needs. In general:



Professional Photographers should strongly consider buying their own domain name (www.NicksPhotos.com, for example), so that they look like a reputable business. Most major blogging sites, like Weebly or Wordpress, allow you to buy your own domain name and customize your photos.

Recreational Photographers often find success on larger photo sharing sites, like tumblr, where it is easy to market your work to others with similar interests. These are free and easy to set up and get running.;
, This lets people see that you have content available right from the get go, which makes them more likely to follow your blog. It also gives you a chance to see your template (the style of your blog) in action and tweak it to fit your vision.


Once you've chosen your blogging site, search online for ""Free photography templates for ________"", where the blank is Wordpress, Tumblr, etc. They are easy to copy to your own blog and many are customizable.

, You want your reader's first impression to be your photography, not big blurbs of text, titles, or pleas to buy some work. Some ways to do this include:


Choose 4-5 of your favorite photos and feature them on the top of the screen in a slideshow or photo strip.
Make the center of your page your most recent photo or post.
Make your home page a tiled collection of all your posts (available in certain blogging templates)., Often this is in a little section labeled ""About,"" but you can also delineate a ""Contact Me"" page on many blogging sites like Tumblr. This is important if anyone wants to use the rights to your photos or hire you for a gig.

, These free licenses tell people what you will allow them to do with your photos. You can choose from a variety of options on their website, from ""Everyone can use freely"" to ""May only be used or reproduced with permission from me."" This simple addition is a great step to take in case of copyright infringement.


You can ask people to request permission to reuse, let them know that they cannot, or can use only for non-profit reasons.
Creative Commons has a small but helpful legal team to help you deal with disputes as well."
"
Decide on a theme.,
Post a picture every single day.,
Add captions, stories, and personality.,
Consider grouping shots into ""photo essays"" or collections.,
Avoid any photos that will bring down the overall quality of your blog.,
Engage in the online photo community.",How to Start a Photography Blog2," Having a theme for your blog makes it easier to find, easier to market, and more likely to hit it big. There are a lot of photo blogs out there, but being able to tell people specifically the types of photos they will see helps them find the photos they want to see, meaning your viewers will be more interested in your content. Themes don't have to be complex -- ""landscapes,"" ""portraits,"" and ""Urban life"" are all better than a random collection of photos.


Humans of NY is one of the biggest photo blogs on the planet, and the theme is surprisingly simple and easy., In order to get viewers and build a following, you need to be constantly providing content. If you don't someone else will be there to provide a new photo for your viewers to look at.


All blogs have scheduling features, meaning you can take 20 photos on Sunday and then schedule the blog to automatically post a new one each day of the week.

, The best blogs are infused with the personality of the photographer. Let people know why you're interested in the shot, the weird story that happened on the way to get it, the history of the subject, or the technical feats used to make the shot look great. There are very few ""wrong"" ways to do this. Simply write about what interests you about the shots.

, This is a great way to bring viewers into your blog and work on your photo skills. Every few weeks, give yourself a specific challenge -- 10 photos in black and white, portraits of the neighborhood, hiking photos -- and then group those challenges into smaller sub-folders. You can even make a ""tag"" for the photos so that your viewers can see your many photo talents. You could have a page or group of ""Nature"" photos alongside your normal abstract photography, or you could try to tell the story of a day in a 10 photo ""story.""

, While some photos might have incredible emotional appeal to you, it is not worth adding bad shots just because of your own emotions or because you didn't post yesterday. People will not respond to them as positively as you. This means using your head, not your heart, to select the images you add to your blog. Exceptions include explaining how not to take a shot, or an exceptional moment (such as a famous person spotted in a blur) but make sure you back it up with an incredible explanation!


Avoid blurry images.
Avoid boring images.
Avoid poorly exposed images.
Avoid commonplace images. You are aiming to be different so that people will want to follow your blog rather than someone else's., A big part of blogging is meeting other photographers who share your interests. Follow other photographers for inspiration and take them time to let them know when you like a shot they took. Swap information on social media and re-blog someone's work if you think it is particularly impressive. This not only increases your viewership, it can lead to collaborations and future projects if you make friends with nearby photographers.

Understand the importance of lighting.,
Arrange the body positioning of your subjects.,
Develop a good eye for composition.",How to Sell Photos,"

Photograph happy people whose faces you can readily see. They'll never tell you this at a photography workshop, seminar, or photography institute, but this is what people want to buy.
Use soft lighting such as from a flash umbrella or a sunset. Make sure there is enough light to eliminate any shadows and produce a clear photo. You may not win any competitions or awards this way, but if you get plenty of light on the faces, you'll create salable prints.
Create bright faces in low-light situations outdoors by using a fill flash. Use a setting on your flash unit that is one less than what is recommended for the current conditions. That will provide just enough light to fill in the shadows without over-exposing your subjects.



 

;
,

Avoid photographing your subjects straight on. The exception to this rule will be for families and large groups, for reasons of body placement. The narrower the body area, the more focus will be on the face of your subject. Regardless of whether people are standing, seated, or reclining on the ground, notice the body angle, hands, and feet positions.
Turn hands sideways with the fingers together, so that they are less visible. You can also hide them behind someone else in the portrait, if possible.
Minimize the amount of leg area seen by crossing at the ankles, if the legs will be visible. This blends the two legs together, and tapers them nicely. If standing, have the person place one foot in front of the other in such a way that the legs are seen as tapering into one general area. Have them place their weight on the back leg (remember, they are at a slight 3/4 angle) and bring the front leg forward, tilting the foot slightly to face out towards the camera.
Have subjects tilt their head slightly. A woman alone should tilt her head just slightly in either direction, while men can stay straight up or tilt slightly away in the opposite direction from the most forward shoulder.







,

Keep everybody's head at a different level. In some cases, you will recognize that it's not possible, but if you do your best to stagger head height from individual to individual, you will create professional-looking images.
Have people stand, sit in chairs, on the arms of chairs, or on the floor. Get others to kneel, crouch, and even lay down.
Tip heads inward toward one another for unity when photographing a family group, and note that men are usually positioned higher than women. Believe it or not, the images where mom is sitting higher than dad don't sell as well as the reverse.

",How to Create a Photography Backdrop," Muslin fabric is a low-priced cotton found at most fabric shops.


Muslin comes in a selection of widths. Purchase 4 yards (3.66 m) to 5 yards (4.57 m) of the widest material possible.
Muslin material comes in shades of white, and can be dyed any color.;
, The material may shrink when you first wash it, but should not get any smaller with subsequent washings.

, Adding different colors will give you a selection of backdrops to work with.


Work outside when dying muslin material, in case of spills.
Follow the directions on the dye, adding the correct amount of dye to a large bucket of hot water.
Put rubber gloves on to protect your hands from the dye, and place the muslin material into the bucket of hot water and dye.
Move the fabric in the bucket to make sure the dye covers the entire piece.
Keeping the fabric in the dye for a longer period of time will produce a darker color.
Bunch up the material and submerge it for only a few minutes to obtain a tie-dyed look.
Take the muslin material out of the bucket when you have obtained the hue you desire. Rinse the fabric with warm water until the water runs clear, and then set the color with cold water.

,,,, When you create backdrops for photography, you want exact edges.

, When you are making photography backdrops, taping the edges will prevent them from fraying.


Fold the end of the material over the tape, maintaining a straight line.
Place the muslin material on an ironing board, and iron the edges with a hot iron.

, Insert double-edged iron-on sewing tape at the edge of the fold and iron it on.

",How to Take Sharper Photographs," If not, use automatic focus but make sure your camera is not tricked by any difficult contrast or very dark areas etc.;
, If you can choose the aperture manually, take it to the higher range of the possible aperture range, in other words a little more than the average setting. Usually around f8-f12 is good. Otherwise, if you choose the maximum aperture (f16 - f22) you will face diffraction, and if you choose the minimum aperture (f1.2 - f2.8) your photograph will not be sharp everywhere.

, For example, if your focal length is 50mm, try to have a shutter speed of about 1/100. You can lower it when you feel more comfortable. Also adapt it to your subject, sport for example, requires higher shutter speed to freeze the action.

,,,,, The action of pressing the button of your camera will most likely shake it a little, using the burst mode, the second or the third picture have higher chance of being sharper, since you just keep the button pressed.

To make your life easier, find a curtain rod and hang it on the wall. Then, instead of buying all that expensive hanging equipment, you have your own inexpensive way of hanging and changing your backdrops.

, There really aren't many loopholes when it comes to having the proper lighting for taking shots of people and/or pets. You must have bright, white light when you take pictures. However, an easy way to make light go where you want or reflect it, you can put aluminum foil over cardboard to direct the light where you wish. Have at least two big lights and two small ones, and at least three reflectors. The place of your light source is significantly important, and can reflect, highlight or ignore certain pre-planned areas.

, You are going to want a nice camera with lots of features to please all your customers. You may even have to spend up to $500 for a great camera. Usually though, it's worth it because you get great shots and a camera that lasts. You don't want shaky footage or blurry pictures either from your new, nice camera, so buy a tripod. You can change the height, angle, and prevent bad pictures just by turning a few knobs! Especially consider a tripod if you plan on taking family pictures with YOU in them.

, When you take someone's picture, they may want to sit down. You will need several different types of stools and chairs in an assortment of colors and materials. For a toddler or baby picture, their parents might want a teddy bear or some of those giant building blocks. Build up your accessory inventory-you won't regret it.

, Your customers may want to have their photos digitally framed, cropped, or changed with a colored filter. Many computer programs can do this which you can find for less than $30.

, Good ideas include:

Central air conditioning units. They can provide a strong turbine that is more natural and not shooting only in one direction.
Some common household appliances that provide a weak blow in a single direction include hair dryers and/or fans.

, What's the point of having your picture taken if you can't take them home to put on the table?

, Pass them out at social gatherings, ask your family to give them out to friends, and have fun with them.

Find a room in your home that can be made totally dark.,
Ensure the room is well-ventilated.,
Have a table or countertop in your darkroom.,
Get your space completely dark.,
Split your darkroom in two halves; a ""wet"" side and a ""dry"" side.,
Buy used supplies.,
Choose your enlarger carefully.,
Acquire your printing kit.,
Acquire and arrange your chemicals.,
Get a safelight.,
Set up your equipment in the wet side of the darkroom.,
Equip the dry side of your darkroom.,
Get the necessary safety equipment.",How to Build A Darkroom," A room with no windows is usually best, otherwise try to find a room with few small windows. A bathroom or basement room are usually best for this purpose. This room doesn’t have to be particularly big; a 25 square foot space is sufficient.Make sure this room has an outlet for your equipment.
Running water can also be useful but isn’t required.;
, If you situate your darkroom in a bathroom, you usually have a bathroom fan which can help keep the room ventilated. However, this is not ideal in the long run; chemicals are heavier than air, and most bathroom fans will struggle to completely clear the air. You’ll eventually want to invest in more powerful fans to preserve your health., If space permits, this surface will make setting up your equipment and developing photos much easier. A desk with drawers will allow you to store some of your supplies, especially important if your darkroom has other purposes. Make sure your photo paper is stored in a drawer that doesn’t let light in.

, If your future darkroom has windows, you’ll need more than curtains or blinds to make it completely dark. Take some black fabric, cut slightly larger than the windows, and tape it around the edges of the windows. Alternatively, you can use cardboard or thin plywood to block of windows, with fabric and tape around the edges to completely seal out light. If light leaks in around the door, affix a strip of fabric along its edge in the same manner.


You’ll have an easier time spotting encroaching light by turning off the room’s lights. As your eyes adjust to the dark, you’ll have an easier time spotting places where the light leaks in., You’ll want to establish this separation before you start setting up your equipment. This will protect your photos from costly mistakes, as well as make sure you don’t damage your equipment. The dry side will include your electronic equipment and should be close to the outlet. Having running water near the wet side of your darkroom will make the development process much simpler.


Make sure to check the water quality in your darkroom; errant particles can negatively impact the development process. Run the water over a tray for 15 minutes. If there are visible particles at the bottom of the tray, you’ll need a water filter., If you’re particularly knowledgeable, you can save quite a bit of money buying used. Check with friends or family in the hobby for hand me downs; knowing the previous owner means you’re more likely to get a good deal. You can also find used photo development gear on eBay and Craigslist. Make sure to check the condition of the equipment before buying.


If you live near a college, check campus bulletin boards near the end of semesters for ads from students looking to offload supplies.

, The enlarger is the centerpiece of the darkroom, as well as the most expensive piece of equipment you’ll need to acquire. If you’re new to the hobby, look for an entry level enlarger that’s easy to use and store. Beseler has a line of enlargers aimed at newbies, made for developing 35mm film.These models also come with lenses. Not all enlargers come with a lens, especially at higher price ranges.

, You’ll get the best deal picking and choosing each article, but this requires a minimum of knowledge. Several companies have complete darkroom kits available; these give you all the equipment you need without having to shop around.Keep in mind that some of these don’t include an enlarger, but will provide you with most of the equipment you’ll need.

, Developing photographs requires three specific chemical solutions. You’ll need developer, fixer and stop bath. The first two of these can be purchased from photography speciality store, while there are more options for your stop bath. You can either purchase acetic acid, pickling vinegar or a specialized premixed stop bath solution.Make sure your trays and tongs are clearly marked, as putting chemicals in the wrong tray can contaminate your materials.
You’ll also need a water tray close at hand to rinse your developed pictures.

, These lights provide just enough light to allow you to see your workspace, without compromising your photo paper or chemicals. These lights can get quite expensive, but many photography stores have safelight bulbs available for purchase.

, This is where the chemical processes involved in photo development takes place. The equipment in this area will include:


Funnel
Trays
Tongs
Film clips (for drying processed film)
Graduated Cylinder
Chemicals (in their storage bottles), This side of the room will house your enlarger and photo paper. The rest of the equipment here will include:


Film tank and reels
Safelight
Easel
Timer
Grain magnifier
Optional: Paper cutter used to trim your photo paper., The chemicals used in the development process can be harmful for your skin, especially if you’re planning to spend several hours in your darkroom at a time. As such, make sure to wear latex gloves when handling chemicals. Additionally, a face mask will help protect your respiratory system from the fumes created when you develop your pictures.

Get a cooler.,
Get a source of light.,
Be sure that the bulb is right.,
Put the cooler on its side.,
Be sure that the handle is in front of the cooler.,
Fasten the lamp to the handle and point it upwards.,
Consider some sort of tissue paper covering of the lamp, if necessary.,
Turn on your light and start photographing!

",How to Create a Lightbox Using a Cooler," If you don't have one in the garage, you might need to get one. You want a cooler because of the white interior.


Be sure that the handle is the square kind that goes around it. The source article has a perfect example.

Note: This particular ice chest is pretty small. You might want something a little larger.


If the cooler isn't as pristine as you would like it, it is very easy, because of its size and shape, to put in some poster paper in it.;
, You want something that is maneuverable. The best kind is a shot lamp with a clamp. Alternatively, try using a flexible neck desk lamp. The inside of the light cover should be reflective or white.

, You will want a bright bulb. Experiment with different types. There are cooler lightbulbs that you can get, but you might have to alter the white balance of your shots. Figure out what works.

, If you need to, put in the posterboard in it.

, It will need to be in front of it, so you can fasten the lamp.

, You are wanting to light the box, not blind it.

, Depending on the heat of the bulb, you will only want to use this for short periods of time at most.

Wire the LEDs.,
Mark and cut the hat.,
Attach the LEDs.,
Secure wires with tape.,
Power up.,
Finished.

",How to Make an Invisible Mask for Video Cameras," Make sure your wires are long enough (around 15cm / 6 in each) depending on how big your hat is. Start wiring up the LEDs one by one, making sure to note the positive and negative terminals. (Color-coding the wires is highly recommended: for example, you can use a white wire for each positive terminal and a color wires for each negative terminal.) Wrap the wires tightly to each LED so they won't fall apart. You can even solder the connections, though it's probably not necessary.;
, This part is also crucial, as you need to pick logical (but inconspicuous) spots to place the LEDs: if you place them too far apart from each other, the light beam won't be strong enough to blind a camera, but if you place them too close, they will hide your face from a certain angle but not others. Think this out and position them well. Mark each spot with a marker, then cut a few holes with a pair of small scissors in the middle of the front of the hat as well as a few on the sides.

, Turn the hat inside out. Take each LED and place it tight in its hole. For extra stability, secure each LED with a dab of glue so that it won't fall out; however, try not to cover the bulb, focusing instead on holding the wire in place. Hot glue will work well for this purpose. When you’re done, flip the hat right-side-out.

, Tape all the wires together using electrical tape and secure them to the inside of the hat.

, Connect a small 9v battery to the wires and secure it with electrical tape. (This is where having color-coded wires will really come in handy, as they will tell you which wires to connect to the positive and negative terminal of the battery.) You can even add a little on/off switch if you want. In this example, the battery is placed on the inside back of the hat.

Select a cast.,
Combine the concrete mix and water.,
Mix the concrete.,
Pour the concrete into the cast.,
Remove the cast.",How to Sculpt With Concrete1," Before you mix your concrete, you must first secure a cast. A cast can be homemade cast made from plastic or styrofoam or purchased at a hardware store. You can also find a wide array of concrete casts to purchase online.
, Empty a bag of concrete mix into a large bucket or wheelbarrow. Carefully measure out the recommended amount of water. For example, an 80 pound (36 kg) bag of concrete typically requires about three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. Add approximately two-thirds of the water to the concrete mixture.Set aside two cups (0.5 liters) of concrete mix. This mix can be added to the concrete if the consistency is too runny.
Read the mixing instructions on the bag of concrete to ensure that you have the correct ratio of water to concrete mix.

, Use a concrete mixing tool, hoe, or drill bit to mix the concrete together. Continue to add the water that you have set aside until you reach a thick, oatmeal-like consistency. The wet concrete should hold its form if you squeeze a fistful.Concrete that is too runny is easier to pour but less durable and more likely to break over time.
Add more water to your concrete mixture if the mixture is solid and crumbly., Slowly pour the concrete mix into the cast until it is completely full. Use a metal trough to smooth the top of the concrete.You can apply a small amount of engine oil to the cast before pouring the concrete to ensure that the concrete is removed from the cast easily without damaging the sculpture.

, Once the concrete is completely dry, remove the cast. Most casts are removed after one day. Sometimes, the sculpture is removed from the cast and the cast remains intact. Sometimes, the cast is cut away to reveal the sculpture.Allow the cement to cure for at least one week before use.
Read the instructions that come with the cast. These instructions will give you specific information about when and how to remove the cast. Each project will be different.

Ensure adequate exposure time.,
Enjoy and have fun experimenting with your new Pintoid Camera.

,
Process the images.",How to Make a Pintoid Camera,";
,,,,, These are: an acupuncture needle and a sewing needle glued into a clothespin.,, This creates a round groove in preparation for the next step.

,, If the hole isn't perfectly round, chuck it and make a new one.,,, Gaffer's tape is black, cloth-like tape. It's flat black unlike most electrical tape, which is shiny.

, You can also use black cardboard, especially for Multitoids, as these multiple-holed Pintoids need to have all of the holes opened and closed simultaneously.

, These will hold the film inside the camera.

,,,, The emulsion side should face the pinhole.

, Close the tin and if you want wrap it with black electrical tape to prevent light leaks. Electrical tape is cheaper than Gaffer's tape.

, Sewing-needle holes need about four seconds on a sunny day. Indoors, anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours may be necessary, depending on the amount of light and the desired effect. Acupuncture needles require longer exposure - generally use about one minute on a sunny day.


Exposure times of one half hour to many hours aren't unusual for indoor images.

,, Load the negative strips (in complete darkness) onto plastic reels for tank processing. Continue to slide the strips onto the reel, keeping spaces between each strip. You can generally get five to seven strips onto one reel.

Strips of 35mm negs. These negatives are 125 speed.

Locate carving tools.,
Lay out your design.,
Mix and pour the concrete.,
Carve the design.",How to Sculpt With Concrete2," Carving tools, such as knives, scrapers, and hammers, that are typically used for ceramic sculpting work best to carve concrete. You can find these tools at most craft or art shops., Freehand or stencil your desired design onto the concrete with a pencil or chalk. This will give you a guide to work off of., Using the directions on the bag of concrete, mix the concrete in a large bucket or wheelbarrow. Most 80 pound (36 kg) bags of concrete require three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. Pour the concrete into the desired concrete mold and allow it to partially dry before beginning the carving.Pour the concrete in small, workable sections to prevent the concrete from drying before you finish the sculpting.
Concrete that is too runny is easier to pour but less durable and more likely to break over time.
Add more water to your concrete mixture if the mixture is solid and crumbly.The amount of time that you need to wait will depend on the thickness of the concrete mold. The concrete is ready to carve when it is still malleable and holds it’s shape.

, Before the concrete is completely dry, begin to carve out your design using the sculpting tools. Begin at the top of the sculpture and work your way down. You will have to work quickly in order to finish the carving before the concrete dries. Try to finish a section of concrete within one hour of pouring.Coat your hands in petroleum jelly to prevent the concrete from damaging your skin.
Avoid touching the surface of the sculpture until it is completely dry to prevent any smudging. The concrete should be dry within 24 hours but should be left to cure for seven days.

Get a cheap picture frame, whatever size will suit your purpose.,
Remove everything from the frame.,
Lay down your diffuser material on the cleared frame.,
Put the glass back into the frame.,
Be sure to bend the prongs in the back of the glass to hold the glass onto the frame.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Light Diffuser for Macro Photography," The one in this article is an 8.5 X 11 inch (21.5cm x 28cm) picture frame from a dollar store.;
, In the case of this frame, that means removing the plastic cover, the glass and the fake certificate.

, Some of the things that you can use for the diffuser include wax paper, tissue paper, a shower curtain liner, etc. You might even like to try different objects to see whether it's possible to get different effects.

, It's a good idea at this stage to make sure that it is clean before you put it back into place. The glass will help hold your diffuser material in place.


If you have some creative ability, you could make an insert to go inside of the frame. If it fits exactly, it will hold the material tightly and then you don't have to worry about broken glass should the diffuser accidentally topple over when taking photos.

, Once done, the micro diffuser is ready for use or travel. Done:

Cut the mesh.,
Wrap the mesh around something hard.,
Mix the concrete.,
Apply the concrete to the mesh.,
Let the concrete dry.",How to Sculpt With Concrete3," Cut the metal mesh into the desired shape using wire cutters. This mesh will serve as the framework for your sculpture. It will hold the wet concrete in place until it dries.Use a metal mesh that is heavy enough to hold its own shape.

, If you are unable to manipulate the mesh into your desired shape, try wrapping the mesh around something hard, like cardboard or styrofoam, to form the desired shape of the sculpture., Mix the concrete mix and water in a large bucket or wheelbarrow. Use a concrete stirrer, hoe, or drill bit to stir the concrete until it is thoroughly mixed. Most 80 pound (36 kg) bags of concrete require three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. The mixture should be a thick, oatmeal-like consistency.Read the instructions on the bag of concrete before mixing the concrete and water. The instructions will provide clear ratios of water to concrete.
Concrete that is too runny is easier to pour but less durable and more likely to break over time.
Add more water to your concrete mixture if the mixture is solid and crumbly., Using a metal trowel, or another hand tool, apply the concrete to the wire mesh. Apply the concrete in thin layers. Add more layers until you achieve your desired shape., The concrete will be dry to the touch within 24 hours. However, you should allow the concrete to cure for seven days. Avoid touching or moving the sculpture during this time."

Moisten the play sand with a few drops of water at a time until the sand becomes the texture similar to that used for creating a beach sculpture.,
Shape a mound of that sand to be the same size of the leaf and cover it with plastic wrap making sure that it's veins are facing you.

,
Mix the cement by measuring an equal amount of Portland cement with the silica sand and then adding the cement bonding agent by using about 1/4 to 3/8th of a cup per quart of the cement and sand mixture.,
Use either a trowel or if more comfortable, your gloved hand, and place a small amount of the cement mixture into the center of the leaf.

,
Keep the center of the veins thicker, while tapering the cement mixture towards the edges.,
Place plastic wrap over the entire leaf, and allow it to set about 36 to 72 hours.,

Make something fun.,
Make a frog.,
Make a bowl.,
Try something more adventurous.",How to Sculpt Using Polymer Clay1," You can make some really fantastic sculptures using polymer clay, but if you're just getting started, have some fun with simple shapes and easy projects. That way, you'll get familiar with how the clay feels, how to work it, and how to bake it.






;
, For example, a simple, smiling frog takes just a few little pieces of clay, and will be a toy might have in your keepsake box years and years from now!

Take a piece of green clay that will fit in your closed fist. Shape it like a football, flatten it out, and then curl up the ends, like cheeks.













Roll out a thin strip of red clay, like a little red worm. Wet the bottom of the strip, and press it into place as the mouth.













Roll two bits of white clay into balls. Flatten them down, and use them for eyeballs.













Add two smaller dots of blue clay into the center of the eyeballs.













Bake it in the oven as directed by the manufacturer of the clay. Presto, you have a happy frog!














,

Start with a round piece of plain, uncolored clay about three or four inches around—about the size of a Magic 8 Ball.













Use a wire or clay knife to cut off the top part. Set it aside for later. You should now have a little round sphere with a flat top.













Using your thumbs, make a dent in the clay, and working around the inside of the bowl and pressing towards the outside, work the clay to hollow out the bowl.













Keep working around and around, till the bowl is nice and deep, and the sides are about 1/4-inch thick near the top, and about 1/2-inch thick at the bottom.













Work the top part that you cut off earlier so that it will rest on top of the bowl like a lid.













Decorate your pot with paint, then bake it in the oven till done.














, Once you're used to working with clay, you can try something a little more artistic or adventurous, like the cat pictured below.

Roll out one ball of clay about the size of your fist. Flatten it out so that it's about 1/2-inch thick. Use a toothpick to rough it up a little, and give it some texture.













Roll out another ball of clay, a little smaller, and set it towards the back of the first, flattened lump of clay. This will be the body and butt of the cat.













Roll a third piece of clay, smaller than the cat butt. Put that in the front—that's the cat head.













Using smaller pieces of clay, make little ears, legs, and tail. Wet them, press them onto the clay, and smooth into the original parts.













Use a toothpick to draw little lines for whiskers and mouth, and use a fork to rough up the rest of the body so that it looks like fur.













Add finishing touches like the fish bones, if you like.













Bake in the oven, and when done, you have a pet cat you never have to feed!

Conceptualize and size up your project.,
Make a wire skeleton for your sculpture.,
Bulk out with tinfoil.,
Apply an initial coating of polymer clay.,
Refine your sculpture.,
Optional: attach to base.,
Finalize your work.,
Fire up your oven.,
That's it!,
After-treatments.",How to Sculpt Using Polymer Clay2," You may want to make a few sketches to work out proportions.

, This will provide support for the clay and allow it to be a bendable, poseable armature.


Double-twist wire in any weight-bearing limbs. It is also a good idea to leave loops of wire on the ends of weight-bearing limbs. For example, a U shape at the end of a foot will hold weight better than the sharp point of cut wire.
Try to use as few pieces of wire as possible to keep it sturdy. Major areas to be bulked out, such as the rib cage, may require loops of wire to later fill with tinfoil.
You will also want to put wire in any thin bits that will be standing on their own, such as long ears. For fingers, you can probably get away with just using tinfoil for support.

, Once you are happy with the proportions of your skeleton, start bulking things out by crinkling tinfoil over the wire.


When applied in large wrinkled sheets it sticks quite well, and provides a textured surface that the clay can really hold onto.
Think about mass and musculature- you can use tinfoil both to provide a surface for clay to stick to, and also to keep your project as light as possible by filling bulky areas with tinfoil.
After this step, your sculpture should be beginning to take shape, but just require more definition.

, Breaking off chunks and working the clay between your fingers until you can press it into about ¼ thick sheets, which you press onto the tinfoil and smooth together.


Continue until all the surfaces that need to be covered with clay, are. If the clay seems hard, don't worry, it will loosen up with the heat of your hands. If you are having a lot of trouble just start with smaller pieces.
Feel free to keep it simple at this stage, such as leaving a nub of clay on the face for a nose, or a clump on the arm to remind yourself to add more bicep.

, After the armature is covered with a rudimentary layer of polymer clay, go back into areas that seem to need more detail and refine them.


Add muscle, remove excess clay, smooth lumps and shape the figure into what you envision.
Take breaks to look at the sculpture from several angles until it looks correct from all sides.

, Usually in the above steps, it is a good idea to have the sculpture unattached to any base, to permit easy turning in your hands, good anchorage points for smoothing, access those hard-to-reach places, etc.


You will get to a point in refinement that the pressure of holding it in your hands is squishing detail. At this point it is time to put it down. If it is not a sitting or self-supporting figure you will want to staple it to a wood base. This can be later be sculpted over to make it a setting.

, Once your sculpture is sitting in its final position, get out your sculpting tools and go detail crazy! Smooth out the skin, make facial features, skin creases, wrinkles, fingernails, scales, hair, fabric folds; all of the wonderful textures that make a sculpture look really impressive.


Take your time and enjoy yourself; the clay won't dry out.

, Once you are happy with your sculpture's shape and detail, preheat your oven to 275° F (135°C).


Place the sculpture on a baking sheet, and bake for 15-25 minutes. You should take it out when it looks darker in the thinner parts, but before those thinner parts turn dark brown.
When you first remove it you may notice it is not totally hard. Don't worry—it will set after it has cooled.

, 20+ hours of work and it is all hardened in 15min.

, There are many wonderful things that you can do with your sculpture after you bake it.


If you left something out you can sculpt something on and bake it again, or bake it separately and glue it on.
Paint it using oils or acrylics. For best results, use acrylics applied in many thin washes. You can also glue on hair, feathers, fur, jewels or fabric. Be creative!

Be prepared properly in advance.,
Try to choose the cooler weather days, or cooler times of day, for photographing ice cream.,
Work on the appropriate setting.,
Choose the ice cream.,
Find a suitable background.",How to Photograph Ice Cream1," Ice cream won't wait for you and melts fast, making it hard to photograph.. To avoid losing those precious moments when the ice cream still looks fantastic, it is important to prepare all of your equipment and props in advance for still food photography.


Have all of your camera equipment in place, including tripod (if using), special lenses, filters, etc. A tripod can be an excellent piece of equipment for indoor ice cream photography; you can set the camera in place at the angle that pleases the eye best, relying on props (such as yogurt containers, etc.) to serve as mock ice cream until you've adjusted the camera to the exact settings desired.Once done, grab your ice cream, remove the props and arrange the ice cream in the predetermined positions, and shoot away for the next few minutes.
Check that the lighting is just as you want it (see below for tips).
For ice cream that will be sitting in a bowl or other prop, place the prop into the freezer for at least 20 minutes prior to taking the shot. That way, you will have a very cold prop for the ice cream to sit on, providing you with extra time to make adjustments before the ice cream melts.This is especially important for warm locations or if you're taking the ice cream outside in the sun.
For photography on the go, simply have your camera ready for those candid moments of people with their ice creams.;
, Early morning and the evenings are suitable times, out of the sun's glare.For indoor photography, choose cool, air-conditioned rooms. Naturally, the fact that you might want different, brighter light on your ice cream subject will impact your decision on the time of day to shoot.

, Are you setting up the photo of a specific ice cream after making or purchasing it, or are you simply hoping to come across ice creams being held by people outdoors as you walk about? Obviously, if you're setting up the ice cream shoot from scratch, there is a bit more effort involved.


Do you want the ice cream in a bowl, in a cone, on a plate? Perhaps its original packaging is interesting enough to use as well.
Do you want someone holding the ice cream, a pet licking it, or some other action shot? Will you need to set the shots up, or are you looking for candid shots on a beach, at a park, or at a special event?
Do you want the ice cream to be the main feature or to form part of a set-up with other food? If so, the other food will need to be prepared and arranged in place before adding the ice cream at the last moment (see arranging props above).
Do you want to photograph the ice cream in a kitchen, a dining room, or perhaps al fresco in your garden? Each option has its own challenges of light, background, temperature, and accessibility that need to be worked out in advance.
If photographing people with their ice cream, consider whether you want to take photographs of children (always delightful but can be hard work to have them stand still) or adults, individuals or groups, and so on. Is the situation appropriate to take photos on the fly or will you need to ask for permission?

At a bare minimum, it is polite to ask ""Do you mind if I take a photo of you/your kids eating that ice cream?"" If the potential subjects ask why, you can explain in greater detail.



, If you're setting up the shoot, what kind of ice cream are you photographing?


Is the ice cream scooped, sandwiched, curled, whipped, soft serve, or coated?
Is it a sorbet, an ice lolly, a popsicle, a cone, or a sundae?
Is it coated in exciting and tasty sprinkles, chocolate, or other ice cream toppers?

, The background may be determined by the reason for the photo shoot. If you're being paid to do a food shoot, you might be obliged to use their choice of dinnerware and such, but if you have a choice, there are some backgrounds that look great with ice cream. Here are some ideas:


A wood texture background will evoke home and comfort.
White background. White is a good stand-by background for many food types, as it doesn't crowd out the food and it provides plenty of background light to set off the food.A garden with green colors, or flowers as the backdrop.
A dark background can set off the ice cream subject perfectly, especially when you see nothing but the ice cream.

Mix media as necessary.",How to Sculpt," You should always draw out your design before you start. It doesn't have to be a good drawing, but it does need to give you a solid road-map for what you're going to do. Draw the sculpture from several different angles, so that you can understand how different areas meet up, the height at which different pieces need to be, actual scale, etc.


Sketching the sculpture to scale can be extremely useful. If it is very large, don't sweat it but if you can draw the sculpture to scale, do it.;
, Armature is a fancy word sculptors use for ""support structure"". Think of your armature as your sculpture's bones. The armature is important, as it will keep the piece from becoming too delicate and easily broken.


Usually the armature is made from wire, the gauge of which will depend on the size of your sculpture. You can use other materials though, if your sculpture is small or wire is unavailable. Toothpicks can work, as can sticks. For larger sculptures, PVC pipe or plumping pipes can be useful.
Using your sketch, identify the main ""pieces"" of the sculpture. Look at the lines that define those pieces and how they connect to the other pieces. Again, imagine a skeleton. Form your armature to these lines.

, The filler is a bit like the muscles of your sculpture. Generally it's made out of a cheap, light-weight, plentiful material. It's important because it will help you save on materials costs, as well as keep down the weight of your sculpture (making it less prone to breaking and easier to move).


Common filler materials include masking or painter's tape, tin foil, newspaper, or cheaper clay (not encouraged).

, Once your armature and filler material are in place, you can start adding your sculpting material. For the purposes of this tutorial, we're using polymer clay (Super Sculpey or similar). Start with getting the broadest strokes in terms of the shape. You just want the foundation to work with. If you're sculpting an organic creature (such as a person or an animal), then it's best to make these chunks resemble the large muscle groups for that creature.

, Begin to more carefully define the shape of your sculpture. You should still be adding clay or other sculpting material at this point. These additions should, like the larger chunks, define the general shape of the sculpture, but cover the smaller areas. In the example of the organic creature, these would be the small muscle groups, but also additional items like the basic forms of long hair(not things like fur).

, With the basic form in place, you can begin to take your material away or shift it into place. This is the sculpting stage, in the traditional sense. Move and smooth larger pieces into their final shape, and begin to carve out smaller details (the angle of a cheek bone, the knuckles of a hand, etc).


For the previous two steps, you will largely be relying on your hands, unless your sculpture is very small. For this step, however, you may need to begin to use some tools. You can use sculpture tools or you can improvise tools. See the section below for a longer discussion of tools.

, Look over your sculpture and think about the different materials that would make up that object in real life (flesh, hair, fabric, stone, grass, fur, etc). On your original sketch or on an entirely new one, map out what textures go where.


Do some research. Look at lots of pictures of those types of textures to figure out how they work. You'd be surprised how complex it can be. Fur, for example, grows in chunks and you'll have to pay attention to the length, organization, and direction of every chunk.

, Begin to texture your sculpture, one section at a time, using traditional or improvised tools. Only a very limited number of sculpting tools are needed and most can be improvised from common household objects. You will have to experiment to find out what works best for you, as almost every sculptor uses their tools differently.


Generally with sculpting tools, large tips are used to create the broad details, while finer tips are used to create details. Scoop-like tools create rounded areas. Tools with a loop are used to scrape away the material. Anything with a sharp edge can be used to cut.
Tools can be improvised from: balls of tin foil, black peppercorn, toothpicks, x-acto knives, a toothbrush, a steel ball chain necklace, a comb, knitting needles, crochet hooks, large and small sewing needles, cookie cutters, melon ballers, etc.

, Once you're done with all of the major clay work, you'll need to cure your sculpture to make it hard (if you want it hard...if not, ignore). Different clays need to be cured in different ways (air dry, bake, etc), so follow the manufacturer's instructions for the clay you use.


It is generally better to under-bake (use a low temperature for longer periods of time, if you can), to avoid burning.

, If you want your sculpture to have color and your sculpting material was not itself colored, you may want to paint your sculpture. What type of paints you use will depend on what type of material you used, but for most materials, you want to use some type of acrylic paint. Model enamel paints will be necessary (or at least recommended) if using polymer clays.


Prepare the sculpture for painting by washing it with soap and water or giving it a quick wipe down with some rubbing alcohol.
If your paint goes down very streaky, a base coat or multiple coats may be necessary.

, Glosses and glazes can be used to make areas that should look wet, like eyes or open mouths, more realistic. Use an appropriate gloss or glaze for whatever material you are working with. A good basic option is Modge Podge.

, To create an even more realistic look, you can mix media as needed to get the look you want. This can mean using real hair for a sculpture of a person, real fabric for clothes, or actual dirt, rocks, or moss for your sculpture's base.

Each clay is different, so choose the clay that best suits your purposes.Ceramic clays are water-based and easy to work with right out of the bag. It needs to stay moist while being worked, as it can dry out and crack. Ceramic clay can also be fire hardened to make a permanent sculpture.Plasteline clay is an oil-based clay that doesn't dry out, and can't be fire hardened. It is popular with special effects crews for its ability to hold high levels of detail.Polymer clays require an armature, or a wire skeleton, for support. They are weaker than other clays, but are good for painting. Polymer clays can be fire hardened, though they are not as hard as ceramic clays.;
, Aside from the clay, you'll need a few other things before you can start sculpting. A good, clean working area is necessary, as are a few tools to help you add detail to your sculpture. You can buy sculpting tools from most craft stores.


You don't have to buy specialized tools for sculpting. It may be possible to find other utensils that serve the same purpose. The main functions of your tools are to cut, scrape, and shape the clay.You can use sewing needles to draw fine lines in your clay, and add detail., If you know the person whose face you are sculpting, take pictures of them from all angles. Try to get some good straight shots of your subject looking straight at the camera. Take some from the side as well to get a good profile.If you're basing your sculpture on a famous person, find photos on the internet and print them out. Make sure you have a variety of angles to get a good idea of the person's proportions.It may help to draw some grid lines on some of your photos to help you see the relationship between facial features., Think about how you want the person to look in your sculpture. Think about who they are, what they do, and why you want to sculpt them. Use these questions to add emotion to your sculpture. Do a rough drawing of different expressions to get some ideas for how you want your sculpture to look.The drawing doesn't have to be perfect. It's just a tool to help you plot out your sculpture.

, Roll out an oval and smooth the clay. The smoother you can make your clay in the beginning, the easier it will be to form your face.Depending on the size of your sculpture, it may be difficult to roll out a ball. If you're making a small sculpture, it shouldn't be a problem. However, if you're making a larger sculpture, you may need to sculpt out a neck as well.Keep in mind the proportions of your subject as you form the oval. You'll be adding clay to make the other facial features, but the oval should resemble the basic shape of your subject's head., An alternate method to making the basic shape of a face is to create a silhouette based on your subject's profile.Print out a profile photo of your subject. Make sure the photo is the size you want your sculpture to be.Roll out some clay about as wide as you'd like the nose on your sculpture to be. Lay it flat on a clean surface. Make sure you have enough clay make a full profile.Take the profile cut out and lay it on your slab of clay. Trace the profile onto the clay and cut away any excess clay.This should leave you with a slab of clay that is a silhouette of your subject. Start adding some clay to thicken the neck so you can stand your sculpture up as you add width to form the face., Using a needle or a rubber-tipped tool, draw a fine vertical line down the middle of the face. This is your line of symmetry. Draw a horizontal line halfway down your line of symmetry to mark where the eyes will be.Halfway between the eye-line and the bottom of the face, make a second horizontal line. This is where you will place the nose.Make one last line halfway between the nose-line and the bottom of the face to mark where the mouth will go., Using a small spoon or rounded tool, start forming the eye sockets just under the eye-line. Take care not to gouge the clay.Work carefully and take your time. Try to keep your tool flat on the clay and use small circular movements. Smooth the clay out as you work. The sockets should be deep enough so that the eyes do not protrude from the sculpture.Add brow bones by rolling two small cylinders of clay and attaching them just above the eye sockets. Make sure the clay is workable so you can blend it onto the face. Using a small spatula, slowly work the brow bone into the forehead creating a small ridge. Work until you can't see any creases between the forehead and the brow bone.Form eyelids in much the same way as you made brow bones. Take two small cylinders of clay and place them just under the brow bone and into the eye sockets. Smooth out any seam lines to blend the eyelids into the rest of the face. Repeat the process to form the bottom eyelids.Roll small balls of clay to place into the eye sockets to act as the eyes. Round off the ball and form each eye in its socket. Try to keep the eyes symmetrical as you form them., Form a pyramid from a separate piece of clay and attach it between the eyes. Blend the clay into the face, paying special attention to the bridge of the nose. The bridge should blend evenly with the brow-bones.As you make the nose check the profile of your sculpture. Some noses stick out further than others, and some turn up slightly. Refer to your photo reference to make sure you get the nose just right.The shape of a nose lends character to a face. Play around with different types of noses to see what effects you can create., To make a mouth on your sculpture, scoop out a little clay below the nose. Only take enough clay to form the inside of the mouth. You'll be adding lips to your face with separate pieces of clay.Using the same technique as you did to form the brow bone and the nose, add some clay to form the lips. Roll out a small cylinder and blend it into the face to form the upper lip.
Forming a mouth takes a lot of practice. Keep referring to your photo reference and don't be afraid to start over if you need to.To form the bottom lip, leave some excess clay from the upper lip and bend it down, forming a horseshoe shape. Roll another cylinder of clay and attach it beneath the upper lip. Leave a little space between the two lips to make it appear as though the mouth is slightly open. Blend the clay until all the seams are gone., Once you've added eyes, a nose, and a mouth, you might need to go back and build out the rest of the face. Add clay to make a chin, cheeks, hair, or even bulk up the forehead if you need to.When adding clay to your face, make sure you keep blending to make a seamless sculpture. It helps to work the clay a little to warm it up. This way it's easier to mold when you add it.Add ears by making small flat circles and attaching them to the side of the face. Keep the earlobe above the jawline, and connect the top part of the ear on the same path as the eye-line. Sculpt the details of the ear with a small spatula or needle., Before you finish your sculpture, compare it to your photo reference. If you find anything you aren't happy with, go back and re-work it. Stay patient and think of your mistakes as opportunities to improve your skill.Once you're happy with everything, do a final blending pass over your sculpted face. Smooth out any seams, remove any excess clay, and clean up the sculpture., Depending on the clay you used, you can either bake it off to finish your sculpture, or form a mold.Feel free to paint your sculpture, or add decorations to bring your art to life."

Consider which lighting will best enhance the ice cream subject.,
Aim to capture the ice cream's texture.,
Take care with colors.,
Use macro if focusing principally on the ice cream as the subject.,
Take your picture.,
Remember too, that if you can't beat the melt, make the most of it.",How to Photograph Ice Cream2," Food photographers often prefer a single light source – it's cooler and quick to work with.Aim for natural light wherever possible. If you can position the ice cream near a large window with a white gauze curtain or thin white sheet across it, this will create suitable, adequate indoor natural lighting.Dappled light (sun filtering through trees) can be an effective look but you will need to work quickly as the sun will move, as well as melt the ice cream.Avoid using a flash unless you are really sure about what you're doing. A flash will often be too harsh for the delicacy of ice cream and can cast unflattering shadows.Try off-camera flash with a diffuser or reflector, balancing flash with ambient light (preferably sunlight to avoid color balance problems), or multiple flashes.
Avoid having too little light (or too little exposure). Underexposed ice cream will appear insipid, failing to capture the delicious subtleties of the ice cream flavors.Set the white balance setting on your camera, particularly if not using natural light. The ice cream can take on yellow or blue hues otherwise.Automatic white balance rarely gets things quite right.
Consider using a reflector to bounce back light and increase the brilliance of the ice cream.Plain mirrors or white card can also do the trick.Practice the positioning until you get a sense for good placement (perhaps try with a prop to give yourself time!). Reflectors, white card, or mirrors can be held in place with clamps and supported against any item that is solid and able to be covered by a background cloth.

, Look to see how the light and shade fall across the ice cream to find the best angle for bringing out its texture and color to the best advantage. You might need to shift the positioning of the ice cream, or more likely, the position in which you are standing.

, Getting the color right matters with ice cream, to accurately portray the wide array of ice cream colors from the brightest to the most subtle, each color conveying the flavor and taste of the ice cream to the viewer. Some of the things to think about with color include:


If you are photographing a trio of ice cream flavors, be sure to select colors that match well. Scale them according to their contrast. Be careful that no color will simply fade into the background or be overwhelming against the other colors.
Use asymmetry. Angle the photo so that the darkest color resides in the most illuminated area, and the brightest color resides in the least illuminated area.
Check that accompanying props or food are neither stealing the limelight from the ice cream nor creating an overall dullness. For example, accompanying fruit, plates, packaging, and backdrops should be a good contrasting or compatible color.
A cheat that you can consider is recoloring or touching up the ice cream post photography. Use a good digital photo program for coloring in the ice cream shades differently until you're satisfied with the end result. This is a trick often used with plain vanilla, to provide a more exciting array of colors!

, Macro is ideal for food shots because it captures the appealing nature of the food by zooming right into the detail. If your ice cream has a lot of special features, such as chocolate chips, sprinkles, or glistening crystals, using macro will ensure that these details are brought out clearly.


Note that the current fashion in food photography (2010) is to use minimum focus; namely, to only have part of the food appearing sharp, and then the rest blurs off gently. To achieve this, use a wide aperture or long lens (with an extension tube if needed). As with all styles, this camera angle style for food may well come and go., Take a lot of pictures of the ice cream within the few minutes you have. Try it from various angles and heights to be sure of getting the best angle in the limited time that you have.

, There is always room for the ice cream disaster shot!

Be sure that everything is taped in the back.

,
Stand the reflector up.",How to Make a Small Tabletop Light Reflector," You'll need a piece of cardboard of a decent size, reflective material and tape. There's no need to go looking for expensive reflective material – as you can see from the photos in this tutorial, a cleaned-up potato chip packet was recycled as reflective material.;
, Face the reflective side away from you.

, Center it so that what is taped isn't too bulky on one side or the other.


Tape the long sides down.

, This will help it tape flatter when you tape it completely.

,, Obviously, it won't stand up by itself, so find something sturdy to prop it up against that is able to be hidden behind the reflector. It's now ready to be used in your tabletop photography projects.

,
Pour clean, lukewarm water into an empty, flexible mixing container.,
Add dry plaster and silica to the water.,
Continue sifting plaster/silica into the water.,
Stop adding plaster/silica when there is no more standing water in the bucket.,
Let the bucket sit for a few minutes.,
NEVER mix the plaster with your hands.,
Try to eliminate any lumps and break them up.",How to Mix Plaster for Sculpture," Remember it is 1/3 plaster, 1/3 silica flour and 1/3 water. Experience is the best guide here, so as a beginner you will just have to make your best guess, then mix extra to be sure you have enough. Use commonsense.;
,, A a standard two-gallon (7.5 liter) plastic bucket is a good container. The amount of water should be approximately one third the total amount of mixed plaster/silica you estimated in Step 1.

, Gradually pick up handfuls and sift the powder through your fingers. This will break up any clumps, letting the powder fall into the water. Work quickly, but avoid dumping the plaster into the water. Don't stir or mix the combined water and plaster/silica.

, Watch for it to start sinking slowly. Eventually some of the powder will stay on top of the water. As you add more plaster, distribute it to areas that still have water on top.

, The surface of the combined water and plaster/silica should be mostly grayish in color, with some areas of white dry powder. Don't mix it yet!

, Let it stand during the time that you make any final preparations for your project. If you are molding or casting with the plaster, this is a good time to double-check that you have applied the proper release agent to your pattern or mold.

, Plaster reaches a high temperature as it reacts chemically with the water and can cause serious burns!. Use a wooden spoon or similar instrument as one would use an egg beater: Reach down to the bottom of the container and use a side-to-side movement like an exaggerated ""hello"" wave.

, When thoroughly mixed, the plaster is ready to use in your project.

If the wax does ignite, extinguish the fire with baking soda or a chemical fire extinguisher. Never add water or a water-based fire extinguisher to a wax fire, as this causes an explosion.;
, You only need about 2 inches (5 centimeters) of water. This will be the lower half of a makeshift double boiler.


If you already have a double boiler, fill the lower pan with water and skip ahead to ""Add the wax.""

, Find a metal cookie cutter or metal jar lid, and place it on the base of the pan, underneath the water.

, Choose an aluminum or steel pan, and place it on top of the metal stand. Avoid other metals, which can discolor or react with the wax, and non-stick pans, which are very difficult to clean wax from.Don't use this pan for food again, unless you're using food-grade paraffin wax or beeswax. Even a food-safe wax may leave residue that affects the taste of your food, but it won't harm you.

, You can use beeswax or paraffin wax from a hobby retailer, or remove the wick from used candles and use them. Crumble or cut the wax into small pieces so they melt faster, then throw them into the smaller pan.


Make sure there's enough wax to cover your hands.

, You can shave crayon wax into the mix to add color, or purchase wax dye or candle dye from a hobby store. If you're using a dye product, follow the instructions on the label.


It's best to assume that any color addition is not safe for food, even if it is labeled non-toxic. In other words, if you add color here, don't use this pan for cooking.

, Before you begin heating the wax, read over one of the two methods below and gather any materials you need. There are two types of wax hands you can make:


Hollow wax hands are easy to make, and the only additional material you need is a container of water.
To make a solid wax hand you can use as a candle, you'll need a bucket of damp sand, a dowel, and a candle wick. Read the instructions below for preparation before you start heating the wax.

, Place the double boiler set up on the stovetop and heat over medium heat. Stir slowly and constantly using a steel or aluminum utensil. If the wax is not food-grade, this utensil will also not be suitable for cooking.


This can take quite a while, especially if the wax is in large chunks.
Never leave wax unattended while it's being heated.

, Take the pan off the heat and continue on to one of the methods below.

, A bucket works well, since you'll need to dip your whole hand into it. Fill it up most of the way, but leave room at the top to avoid spilling.


You can add food coloring to the water to color your wax hands. This only has a minor effect, but may be a better coloring option if you don't want to use non-food-safe dyes or crayons in your wax-heating pan.

, Follow the instructions above to melt the wax, then wait for it to cool. Touching hot wax can cause serious burns, so it's best to use a candy thermometer or candle-making thermometer to be sure the wax is safe. The wax is ready once it has cooled to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43ºC) or slightly lower.If a solid film has formed over the wax, return the pan to heat again to melt it, then let it cool again.

, Cover your hand and wrist with the lotion, but do not rub it into your skin. You should still be covered with white smears of lotion. This will make it easy to slip the wax hands off without breaking them.

, Dip one hand in the bucket of water up to your wrist. Shake the excess water off your hand.

, Briefly dip the same hand in the warm wax and pull it out again. To make removal easy, only dip up to the base of your hand, before it starts narrowing to your wrist.Choose a hand shape before dipping and keep your hand in that position for the rest of this method.

, Dip your hand back and forth between the water and wax. Each time, you'll add another layer of wax to your hand. An average-sized wax hand is ready after eight dips, but a small child's hand may be ready after three to four.End with a water dip. This will help adhere the final layer of wax to the layers beneath it., Gently loosen the wax hand by sliding your un-waxed pinky finger under the wrist. Once it starts to loosen, dip it under the water level to help it glide off.If the hand is stuck, poke a hole in the wax fingertips with a pencil tip to release the suction.

, Dip it in water one last time to help the wax harden. While the wax is still soft, use your fingers to smooth out any bumps or tears. Once the wax is air-dried, the job is done.


Optionally, you can dip the wrist end of the hand into the warm wax, then fold the edges inward to make a sturdy base for the hand to stand on.This may not work if the wax wrist is torn or short.

, Mix water into sand bit by bit, until it is damp but firm. It should stick together enough to hold shapes.You can purchase sand at a hardware store or home improvement store.

, Press your fingers and hand into the sand in the hand shape of your choice. Carefully pull your hand out again, without making any extra holes. You should be left with a hollow in the sand that holds the shape of your hand.

, Tie a candle wick or braided cotton string onto a dowel, and lay the dowel over the bucket. Adjust the wick so it hangs down into the hollow left by your hand.


If you want the candle to burn with the fingers pointing upward, the candle wick needs to touch the bottom of the hole.

, Follow the instructions above to melt the wax. As soon as it has melted completely, carefully pour the wax into the hollow left by the sand.


Wear gloves when pouring hot wax.

, Depending on the type of wax and the size of your hand, this can take anywhere from 2 to 8 hours, but leaving it overnight is a good idea just in case., Once the wax is set, you can dig out the sand around it, or place a plastic bag over the mouth of the bucket and slowly tip the whole thing over.You may need to trim the wax hand if it's seeped out of the original hollow, or scrape it slightly to uncover the wick. Once that's done, your hand candle is complete.

Buy a Styrofoam mannequin head.,
Choose a paper that you would like to use to decoupage your foam mannequin head.,
Decoupage your mannequin head using strips of paper, such as specialty craft papers, musical scores or magazine pages.

,
Rip your paper into strips of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less, until you have a large pile.

,
Use a foam brush to wet the top of the mannequin head with decoupage glue.,
Place another layer of decoupage glue over the top of the paper pieces, flattening all edges with the brush to ensure a smooth coating of paper.,
Continue to wet the Styrofoam, attach the paper and glue over the top, using the smaller pieces of paper to fit over the nose, eyes and mouth.

,
Stop and allow the top of your mannequin head to dry according to the directions on the decoupage glue.,
Choose a base.,
Connect the base to your newly decorated mannequin head with hot glue.",How to Make Mannequin Heads2," These heads are white, with features, and they are available at most arts and crafts stores. Many of them are already sized to fit hats or headbands. Miniature versions are also available.

, Decoupage is the art of decorating something by gluing small pieces of paper to it. It is commonly used on small objects, boxes and furniture.

,,, Place pieces of paper on to of the wet portions, making sure they overlap and there isn't any white space.

, Once the glue and paper dry, you will be unable to flatten any edges, so it is important to take time to smooth it with the glue and brush now.

,, When it is dry, balance the top of the mannequin head in a large sturdy cup, so you can glue pieces of paper around the edges, and leave it to dry.

, You can use an antique plate, a wooden base from an arts and crafts shop, or any sturdy object that will hold your mannequin head steady when you place hats or accessories on it. Foam mannequin heads are very light and unsteady, so it is important to have a base if you intend to use it in a store.

, Allow to dry and then use for decoration or accessories.

Oil the axe handle to prevent damage.",How to Make a Stone Axe," Look for a large rock on the edge of a stream or a river, also known as slab rocks. Avoid porous rocks that have holes or cavities in them, as well as rocks that have cracks. A solid rock with no visible flaws, preferably long and thick, is what you want to use for your axe. This will make it easier to pound at the edges of the rock without injuring your fingers, hands, or other body parts.You will also need to find a large hammering rock, which you will use to shape the source rock. Look for a hammering rock that you can hold comfortably in your hand, with an even rock face. Using this method will create a knapped axe head, where the axe head is shaped by hitting it with another rock.;
, Another option is to use a river rock that is hard and contains fine grained stone. Many river rocks are rounded in shape and smooth to the touch, unlike slab rocks, which are often jagged and square shaped. You can find river rocks at the bottom of the river or lining a stream. Look for a river rock that is relatively close to the size you’d like to have for your axe.You will also need a hammering rock to slowly peck away at the river rock until it is shaped into a suitable axe. A quartzite rock would make an ideal hammering rock for your river rock axe head. This will create a pecked stone axe head, where the river rock is chipped at very slowly, or pecked, with another rock.

, The handle for your stone axe will need to be made of freshly harvested wood, or wood that is from a young tree. This will ensure the wood can be bent and shaped without breaking. Privet stem is ideal, if available. You can also use wood from a small, young tree.You will need a piece of “green” wood that is at least two to three feet long. Look for a piece of wood that is not too wide or too narrow. The handle should be wide enough to accommodate the axe head, but narrow enough to hold in your hand.
You can try out the length of the wood by holding it in your hand. You want the axe to be long enough to hold comfortably and swing behind you.

, You will need strong cord to secure the stone axe head to the axe handle. You can find cord made of bark at outdoor supply stores. Wet rawhide can also be found in outdoor supply stores.

, Before you can shape the axe head, you will need to hit off a piece of the source rock that will become your axe head. Strike the upper edge of the source rock with the large hammer. Focus on striking off flakes and slabs of rock as you hit the source rock. Use short, swift hits against the source rock, lifting your arm a few feet from the source rock and coming down steadily with the hammering rock.You can attempt to hit off a large slab that can be used as your axe head or hit down the source rock until it becomes the right size for the axe head. Be careful as you hit the source rock, as shards of rock will likely fly around. It is better to work slow and steady here so you do not have chunks of rock flying around you.
For safety purposes, you may want to wear safety gloves and safety googles to protect yourself from flying rock shards.
The goal is to have an axe head that is the size of your palm or a bit larger. Be patient, as it may take several hours to hit down the source rock until it is the ideal size for the axe head.

, If you are using a river rock, you will need to take your time when pecking it down with the hammering rock. The grains of the river rock must be removed slowly as you can damage or split the rock if you are not careful. Work on one small area of the rock at a time and use short, swift strokes to carefully peck away at the river rock.It can take several hours to peck away at the river rock. You should work outdoors in a comfortable area.
Be careful of small pieces of river rock flying toward you as you peck the rock. If you work slow and steady, they should not be a major hazard.

, Once you have hit or pecked down the rock until it is about the size of your palm, you will need to form the cutting edge of the axe head so it is sharp. The axe head should taper down toward the cutting edge. The cutting edge should be a similar thickness to a steel axe, with a narrow edge.Hold the axe head so it is vertical, resting on the wide side of the rock. Use the hammering rock to form a narrow end of the axe head by hitting the rock in small, short movements. You want this end to dip down so it forms a narrow edge. This edge will become the cutting edge of the axe head.

, Polishing the rock will help it to stay durable and sharp. You can use the leftover source rock if there is a slab that is thick enough and wide enough to rub the axe head against it. Alternatively, you can look for a large flat piece of rock that has an even surface, as this will act as your polishing rock.Pour a handful of water on the stone and start to rub the wide, flat side of the axe head against the stone. Use both hands to rub the stone back and forth, making sure to keep the polish rock wet with water.
Polish down all sides of the axe head so it appears even and smooth on all sides. This could take a couple of hours so be patient and take your time.
You may also want to use a smaller rock to polish the cutting edge of the rock. Make sure the axe head is wet as you use the small rock along the cutting edge of the rock, rubbing until the cutting edge appears smooth and even. This will mean it is also sharp enough to chop through wood and other plant matter.

, One method of attaching the axe head to the handle is to split the handle down the middle, forming a gap large enough to fit the axe head. You should try to create a split that is symmetrical and not leaning to one side. You can do this using a knife or using a sharp stone.You may want to try to knock or hit away at the top of the handle slowly with the sharp stone, making sure the wood is soft and “green” so it does not break.
If you are using a knife, you can carve out a symmetrical split in the handle, making sure the width of one both sides of the handle are the same.
Once the split is large enough to fit the axe head, gently slide the axe head into the split.

, Another method is to soak the top of the handle in water so it is soft and pliable. Then, you can bend the wood around the axe head so it is attached to the handle.If the top of the handle is very thick, you may want to thin it out using a knife or a sharp stone. This can then make it easier to bend the wood.
You will need to ensure the wood is very soft and flexible to use this method of attachment. You may want to work slowly and bend the top of the handle in increments so it does not break.

, Whether you use the split method or the wrap method, you will need to secure the axe head to the handle so it does not fall out when you use the axe. You can use cord made of bark, such as hibiscus bark, or wet rawhide, if you have access to rawhide.You should twist the cord so it is strong and durable. Do this by looping one piece of cord over the other to form a twisted cord. The twisted cord should be long enough to wrap around the axe head several times.
Wrap the cord tightly around the axe head, crossing the cord over so it forms an “X” shape on the axe head. Do this twice and then tie the cord around the handle several times.

, This method requires access to a fire, but it does not involve cord and can be a useful way to secure the axe head well in the axe handle.To use this method, you will need to use a sharp rock and a piece of wood to hammer in a hole a few inches from the top of the handle. You can also use a knife if you have access to one. You want a hole that is wide enough to fit the axe head. You can measure this by holding the axe head against the side of the handle and marking the width of the axe head on the handle.
You will then need to heat up a long piece of wood in a fire until it is burning and smoking. Blow on it until you have a hot point on the wood. Run the hot point around the hole on the handle to smooth out the hole and shape it so it fits the axe head well.
Once you have a well shaped hole, place the axe head into the hole, sharpened edge facing upward. Use a piece of wood to knock the axe head into the handle. Hold the axe head with one hand and make a few swift knocks on the axe head with the piece of wood until the axe head is in place.
You should check that there are small gaps of space between the sides of the axe head and the hole in the handle. Small gaps are good, as this will prevent the handle from splitting when you use the axe.

, Stone axes are not like steel axes and cannot be struck at the same angle. Chop a few degrees off of 90º degrees of the wood. This steeper angle prevents side-slap, which can break your stone head.If the piece of wood that you are striking is sitting horizontal, swing the axe slightly off of a direct vertical drop. You may use an anvil, which is a wooden block, underneath the object that you are striking. This will help keep the object from bouncing and increase the efficiency of your axe.

, Stone axes cause debris to fly further than their steel counterparts. A stone axe wedges into the initial cut with a lot of force and can cause material to fly, either left or right, nearly 40 feet. Keep any bystanders behind you or in front of you at a safe distance of at least 10 feet or more.Depending on how large your stone axe and how forceful your swing, debris can fly with enough velocity to seriously injure someone.

, Transport your stone axe with a protective leather sheath. A leather sheath works well in preventing nicks. The sheath can be custom made at a local leather goods store.You never know what may fall against your axe so always keep it protected.

, The stone axe head must remain tight against the handle. If it becomes loose, the axe head will hit against axe handle and object and may break from the dual impact. This is known as a “side-slap”.If you need to remove the axe head, replace it exactly as it was because you may break the handle if you put it in backwards. You may create a crease to easily find the front of the axe. A crease is a small scratch mark near the front of the axe stone. If you can’t see it, it may be easier to feel. Make sure you create a crease that’s easy to distinguish. You will need to be able to find it if your axe head is knocked out or removed.

, If you use the axe on a rocky surface, there is a high chance of you nicking or gouging the axe head against that surface. Unlike steel axes, stone axes need to be pecked or grounded down to remove the nick or gouge and to preserve the cutting angle.You must maintain the correct angle edge on a stone axe because it will break if it’s too low. If the angle is too high, your stone axe won’t cut.

, Use fine oil to keep your handle from drying too fast. Extra virgin oil works well. You may also oil your handles twice before storing.You want to oil your handle to help prevent any damage.

Find something that you wish to mold Could be a pine cone that you wish to make into candles, an animal that you've sculpted and want to duplicate to give as a gift, anything that you want.,
Look for mold making material.,
Build your mold box.,
Determine if you need to seal model.,
Apply proper release agent.,
Mix and pour your mold rubber.,
Demold.,
Inspect.",How to Make a Rubber Mold,";
, There are a number of companies that sell rubber for making molds. Type ""mold making materials"" into Google for a list of suppliers.If you are making a small mold, you can always buy a small tube of silicone to save some money.

, You will need to surround your model with some sort of wall to contain the liquid mold rubber. Generally you should leave 1/2"" between the walls and your model, use a yogurt container, or make a custom form out of foam core and hot melt glue.

, In order to make sure your model will release from the mold rubber you must first seal your model if it is porous, and you may also need to apply a release agent. If your model is made of wood, plaster, unglazed ceramic, stone, concrete etc. it is porous and needs to be sealed with Krylon clear acrylic spray or with a sealer available from the mold rubber supplier.

, If you are using a urethane mold rubber and your model is anything other than silicone, you will need to apply a silicone based release agent. If you are using a silicone mold rubber and your model is anything other than silicone, you do not need a release agent. If you are using silicone mold rubber and your model is made of silicone you need to use a non-silicone based release agent.

, There should be instructions with the material. Be sure to mix both sides first before measuring out how much you need, (Some suppliers have tools to estimate how much you will need.) Thoroughly mix both sides together and pour at the bottom next to your model. Don't pour directly onto your model or you may trap air and lose surface detail in the mold.

, After waiting the proper time, usually overnight, poke the rubber to make sure it is fully cured and not sticky. Remove the walls of your mold box first, using a razor blade if necessary. Hopefully you will now be able to push with your thumbs down in the center to break the air seal and remove your model from the mold rubber. Depending on your model you may have to use a sharp knife to create a seam and cut the rubber to release it.

, You are done! Congratulations you have just made your first mold. Visually inspect the inside to verify that it captured all the detail you wanted. If you find imperfections make a note so that you can correct it in the future. You are now ready to cast anything you like! Try Plastic, plaster, Ice (Water swells when it freezes), chocolate (some mold rubber is food safe, most are not) jell-o, wax, Foam, etc.

Choose a cylindrical or rectangular can or box.,
Paint your container black inside and out.,
Determine the size of your pinhole.,
Make the pinhole in the bottom end of the container.",How to Make a Pinhole Camera1," Pick a container that is about the size of a normal camera and is clean. For instance, you could use an old paint can, an oatmeal container, a shoebox, or a coffee can. Be sure that your container has a tight-fitting top.






;
, You can also cover your container completely with aluminum, but be sure to avoid any tearing. Covering your camera prevents any light reflection from occurring on the inside of the can.


Make sure you paint the entire lid of your container.
Allow the paint to dry completely before moving on to the next step.
If any paint chips off before your use your camera, make sure to repaint it before taking any photos.

, The distance between the film and the pinhole will affect the outcome of your photos. The film will be on the opposite side of the container from the pinhole, so most likely on the lid if you are using a can.









The size of the pinhole is important because it determines how sharp or blurry your final photo will be.
For a container with a 3 to 6-inch distance between each end, use a No. 10 sewing needle pushed about halfway up the needle shaft to make your pinhole.
Try to make the pinhole as clean of a circle as possible. Twisting the needle as you poke it through helps to make a cleaner hole.

, You can either poke a hole directly through the bottom of your container using a pin, or you can cut a larger hole about 1/2-inch by 1/2-inch out of the bottom of your container and poke a pin through a separate piece of paper or thin metal. The second method is usually preferred as it allows you to make a more perfect circle and start over if you mess up the first time.









If you choose the second method, take heavy black paper or thin metal and poke the pin through the center of the 1/2-inch square. Then secure the piece over the larger hole using strong tape such as electrical tape.
Sturdy aluminum foil, malleable metal from a food product container, or cardstock all work well for the second method.
Check that your pinhole is circular by looking through the back of the camera where the film will be and peering through the hole. Make sure that you can see whatever is on the other side of the pinhole clearly. A page of printed words works well for determining clarity.

Cut a shutter out of dark paper.,
Put a piece of tape on the bottom of the shutter flap.,
Create a viewfinder out of cardboard.",How to Make a Pinhole Camera2," Opaque cardstock that does not allow any light through works best for this step. Make sure that the paper is thick enough not to fold as it is used.









Cut a square about two inches by two inches out of the dark cardstock. Make sure that the square is large enough to entirely cover the hole you cut in the bottom of your container.
Tape the square to the body of the camera along one edge above the pinhole. This piece of tape will act as a hinge that allows you to open and close the shutter when you want to filter light.
Use any type of sturdy tape such as electrical or duct tape.

, Use a less-sticky tape for this side, (electrical tape works great, duct is too strong) and tape down the opposite end of the shutter underneath the pinhole when you are not taking a photo to prevent light from entering the inside of the camera.








, The viewfinder allows you to replicate the geometric relationship of the pinhole to the film and helps you visualize what your final photo will look like.


The front viewfinder should imitate the shape of the film and be constructed directly above the pinhole. Secure it with strong tape or hot glue.
The rear viewfinder should sit on top of the camera and act as a peephole that allows you to visualize your photo. You can make a peephole out of a metal washer or cut a perfect circle out of cardboard and attach it to the rear viewfinder. Again, secure it with strong tape or hot glue.
For taking photos of subjects closer than five feet away, position your subject low in the viewfinder to account for the difference between your perception and the angle of the pinhole.

"
"
Choose photographic paper or film.,
Determine the size of your light-sensitive material.,
Load your camera.,
Close up your camera.",How to Make a Pinhole Camera3," If you choose to use photographic paper, you can load it into your camera under specific lighting conditions.


For photographic paper, you have to load it either under a safelight, or a flashlight filtered through at least three layers of red cellophane attached to the lighted end.
The flashlight must be six to eight feet away, so hanging it from a ceiling and working underneath it is a good way to accomplish this distance.
Unlike photographic paper, film must be loaded under completely dark conditions. Practice loading your camera with a simple piece of paper in lighted conditions, and then with your eyes closed to get the feel of loading the film before you attempt to do so in complete darkness.

, You will have to cut the film down into smaller frames. The size of the frame will depend on the overall size of your camera's body.


For most moderately-sized cans, you can use a strip of film cut into 2 3/8 to 3 1/2-inch pieces. For a camera made from a one-gallon paint can, cut a 4 by 5-inch piece of film. A camera made from a 2-pound coffee can will take a 2 1/4 by 3 1/4-inch piece of film. These measurements apply to the use of photographic paper as well.
Use sheet film if possible, which is easier to manipulate as it is completely flat.
Make sure to cut down your paper or film in complete darkness. A closet should work fine as long as no cracks allow light to seep through.
If you are unsure about the ratio between the size of your film and the size of the camera body, err on the side of cutting too large of a strip of light-sensitive material. You can always trim down the edges of your photo after you develop it.

, Place the photographic paper or film on the inside of the camera, opposite the pinhole.









In total darkness, secure the film or paper from the back using a piece of tape rolled into a loop. You may need to place tape in each corner of the film in order to prevent it from rolling up. Do not place any tape on the front side of the film or paper, as this may cause damage and obstruct the image formation.
Make sure that the emulsion side of the paper is facing the pinhole. You can tell which side is the emulsion side of photographic paper from its shiny appearance. The emulsion side of film is the side rolled up on the inside of the spiral as you unfurl it.
If you are having trouble determining the emulsion side, wet your finger and touch either side of your paper or film in the corners. The side which feels sticky to the touch is the emulsion side.

, Make your camera completely light-proof by ensuring that any cracks or openings are completely covered by black paint, aluminum foil, or black tape. Any unwanted light that gets through could ruin your picture.

Place the camera on a flat surface.,
Determine the exposure time.,
Point the camera at your subject.,
Open the shutter flap.,
Close the shutter.",How to Make a Pinhole Camera4," You can either simply set it on a table, counter, any other completely flat surface, or attach it to a tripod using rubber bands or tape. Because of the sensitivity of the shutter, you need the camera to be extremely still as you take photos.

, For film, you only need to expose the camera to light for a few seconds, but photographic film can take up to a few minutes.


If using film, the duration of exposure depends on the ISO of the film. The higher the ISO, the shorter the exposure time. For 400 ISO film, you will expose it to light for between 2 and 12 seconds depending on the brightness of the external light. For 100 ISO film, the exposure time can range between 8 and 48 seconds, and for 50 ISO film, the exposure time may range between 16 seconds and 1 minute and 36 seconds.If using photographic paper, the exposure time will most likely range from one minute to several minutes, though there are photo paper products made specifically for longer exposures, even up to several months!
You will have to practice to determine the exposure time that works for you, but remember the general rule of thumb for exposure time: the brighter the external light, the shorter the exposure time.

, Remember to account for the distance between the pinhole and the viewfinder by aiming a bit lower than you might perceive.

, Pull the bottom tape up to allow light to stream through the pinhole. Do so very carefully so as not to shake the rest of the camera.









If your exposure time is several minutes or hours, you can carefully tape the shutter open so that you don't have to hold it open manually.
You can also place some sort of weight such as a rock or a shoe on top of the camera if it is windy where you are photographing.

, Once you've held the shutter open for the desired exposure time, retape the flap down to prevent any more light from entering through the pinhole. During the time that the shutter was open, an image was created on the film or photographic paper. All that's left to do is develop your photo.

,
Remove the photo and rinse over running water for two minutes.",How to Make a Pinhole Camera5," Developing your own photos takes a considerable amount of resources, including several chemicals and solutions, a darkroom, and (if using film) an enlarger. Film and photo paper from a pinhole camera can be taken in to a photography store and developed just like any other type of film. If you choose to develop your film yourself, however, read on to find out what you'll need., The basics of film developing include three solutions: developer, stop bath, and fixer.

, In addition to a darkroom, you will need developer solution, fixer solution, water, tongs, towels, a sheet of glass, and a safe light in you dark room. Your darkroom must be completely black other than having the safe light on.


You can also use orange LED halloween bulbs as safe lights.
You will also need three plastic dish washing tubs. Fill one with about two inches of developer, the second with about two inches of water (called a stop bath) to stop the developing process, and the third with fixer solution.

, Only do so once you are in a darkroom lit only by a safelight. White light will destroy your photo.

, If you used photo paper in your camera instead of film, skip this step. Otherwise, place your negative on the negative slide, turn the enlarger on, and choose the appropriate f/stop for your photo.


You may want to create a contact sheet to test out different f/stops before settling on an f/stop. Do so by covering the paper with a piece of black cardstock and gradually uncovering it while changing the f/stop in order to create strips of different brightness.

, Once you have transferred the negative image to photo paper, place it in the developer using a pair of tongs. Watch as the image appears on the paper and take the image out of the solution using tongs as soon as it is as dark as you want it to be.


Gently rock the tray back and forth to spread the solution over the photo paper.
Keep in mind that the image will appear a bit darker in white light once you are outside of the darkroom.

, The stop bath should consist of room temperature water.

,, Allow the photo to hang dry completely or dry with a hair dryer."

, White cardboard cut to the appropriate size for what you are shooting. Be sure to have some aluminum foil also. This is great for a different type of reflector. You will also want something black for when shooting glass.

, If you are going very small, you might want to use a macro setup, but otherwise, just use something like a 50mm lens or something that will allow you to shoot in a small space. A telephoto lens wouldn't work very well for this.

, Again, they don't need to be that big, but big enough to diffuse light for your small subject. This image was shot with and without diffused light and nothing else.

, These images both have used a reflector (aluminum) on the left. The bottle on the left had a light through a diffuser and the one on the right had the LED light pointed straight onto it.


This is shot using the LED light pointed at the reflector. You can see that the image is a bit too far away. Also, do to the lack of another reflector on the other side of the bird, his back is unlit.

Pick out a photo.,
Cut the photo and cardstock to the right specifications.,
Layer the cardstock together.,
Attach the photo to the cardstock.,
Punch holes and thread ribbon to hang.",How to Make a Photo Ornament1," Start by choosing a picture that you want to display on the ornament. The photo you pick should capture a favorite memory of a friend or loved one. Look for photos of moderate size and good quality where the subject’s face and body are in clear view.


Photos printed on traditional cardstock will work better for crafting projects like this one, since they will be sturdier and easier to work with.;
, Use your scissors to trim the photo down to about 2.5” wide and 3.75” long. This will result in a frameable portrait of just the right size. To create the backing layers, cut the plain white sheet to 3.25”x5.5” and the printed or colored sheet to 3”x5” even. You’ll be layering each of these pieces to create dimension.You can adjust these measurements as you see fit, as long as you stick with the staggered sizing—the white piece of cardstock should be big enough to frame the patterned piece, which should be big enough to frame the photo.
Make sure you don’t cut out any of the photo’s important details, like the top of the subject’s head.
The printed piece of cardstock can be any color or design you want, from a simple solid color to sparkling glitter to contrasting chevron zig-zags.

, Apply a strip of double-sided tape or a small dot of glue to one side of the printed piece of cardstock and attach it to the large white piece. Leave a bit of space near the bottom if you want to add a name tag or other message; otherwise, align the layers evenly. Press the pieces of cardstock flat to make sure they stick together.As a substitute for double-sided tape, you could also use adhesive foam dots. These will give the ornament the appearance of more depth.
To create a name tag, cut a thin strip of leftover white cardstock, spell out a name or custom message using stick-on craft letters and leave a little space beneath the photo to attach it.

, Tear off another strip of double-sided tape or squeeze a little of glue onto the back of your photo. Arrange the photo in the center of the printed cardstock layer and stick it down. Smooth all three pieces to secure them.If your photo came from a regular inkjet printer, the ink will be more delicate. Be careful not to smudge it while smoothing down the photo.
Use a minimal amount of glue so that it doesn’t oversaturate the photo paper., Use your hole punch to make a small hole in both of the ornament’s upper corners. Guide a strand of ribbon through the front of one hole, around the back side of the cardstock, then out the front of the other hole. Tie the ribbon into a neat bow. It’s now ready to be the centerpiece of your tree or mantle!For an alternative to ribbon, use butcher’s twine, yarn or colored fishing line. Playing around with different materials will allow you to further customize your ornament.

Cut your photo and cardstock into circles.,
Apply a strip of double-side tape to the back of the photo.,
Press a loop of fishing line between both circular pieces.,
Roll and lower the photo into the bulb.,
Smooth out the photo.,
Replace the cap and hang the ornament.",How to Make a Photo Ornament2," Cut the photo you’ve chosen into a circle 2” to 2.5” in diameter. Do the same for the sheet of cardstock, which will act as a backing to make the photo more durable. Cut out the photo and cardstock slowly and carefully, making sure the edges are clean and even and both pieces are the same size.To make the circular photo more precise, trace the outline with a pencil or the rim of a drinking glass roughly the same size as the ornament.
If you want, you can have the cardstock printed with a personalized caption or greeting, such as “Christmas 2016” or “Happy Holidays from the Smith Family.” This message will then be displayed on the opposite side of the ornament.

, Tear a strip of tape and stick it to the back side of the photo. The tape should be vertical, stretching from the top edge of the photo to the bottom.


Stretch the tape before pressing it down to eliminate any bubbles or wrinkles.

, Snip off a few inches of fishing line and fold it in half so that it forms a thin loop. Stick the looped end to the tape on the back of the photo with the entire length lying flat. Then, take the circular piece of cardstock you cut and sandwich the fishing line between the cardstock and photo. You’ll now have a photo of the right size complete with backing and a way to lower the photo into the glass bulb.Line up the edges of the photo and cardstock before pressing them together.
Don’t use glue to attach the photo to the cardstock. It could wrinkle or bleed through the photo.

, Remove the small metal cap from the ornament bulb. Gently roll the photo and cardstock into a loose tube, picture side out. Be careful not to use too much pressure, or the photo could crease. Slide the rolled photo into the bulb with the fishing line coming out of the top. This will give you a way to pull the photo out if you make a mistake, and it will also act to fix the photo in place inside the ornament.Hold on tight to the fishing line as you drop the photo in. If you lose it, it could be a pain to get out.

, Find a slender, blunted tool that will fit inside the opening of the bulb. Reach one end in side and use it to smooth out the edges of the rolled picture. Rather than being perfectly flat, the photo will now have a slight curve to it, matching the rounded contours of the ornament.The shaft of a pencil, ink pen or paint brush will work well for this purpose.
Make sure whatever implement you use doesn’t scratch or damage the photo.

, Guide either end of the fishing line through the holes in the top of the cap. Slide the cap down the fishing line and press it firmly into place. Tie off the fishing line and use it to hang the ornament, or attach a separate piece of ribbon or twine to make it more visually interesting. It’s that easy!Adjust the length of the fishing line inside the ornament so that the photo is suspended in just the right place.
If you decide to use ribbon to hang the ornament, secure it by laying it across the top of the ornament before you tie down the ends of the fishing line.

Select multiple photos.,
Decorate the wooden block.,
Glue the photos to each side of the block.,
Finish the block with a coat of acrylic.,
Screw in the hook and hang.",How to Make a Photo Ornament3," For a wooden block ornament, you have the freedom to use up to 6 different pictures. Sort through your photos and set aside your favorites. Trim each photo so that it will fit squarely on the face of the block with a small portion of the block visible around the edges.These can all be recent images, or you could select one photo from throughout the years for each side of the block to show how the subject has grown and matured.
Making a wooden block ornament is like a unique form of scrapbooking that you can show off during the holidays.

, Paint the faces of the block with an array of colors and patterns, or glue a square of patterned paper onto each side for a stylish collage effect. Or, if you prefer, you can leave the wooden surface plain or finished with a thin coat of stain to preserve the more rustic, down-home look. The block base is a blank canvas for this project, which means you’re free to be as imaginative as you want.Shop around for dazzling glitter and metallic paints, instead of ordinary solid colors. These will stand out more beneath the photos.
Get creative decorating the block. Use found materials like newspaper or eye-catching bits of fabric in place of ordinary paint, or to create stylish borders for each photo.

, Apply a thin layer of craft glue (a glue stick could also work well for this purpose) to the back of each photo and line them up with the faces of the block. Press down firmly on the picture to stick it in place. Run the pad of your finger over the surface of the photo to make sure it holds.


Work with a craft glue that isn’t too thick or runny and only use a small amount to keep from ruining the photo.

, Dab a little acrylic sealant onto each face of the block and use a thin paintbrush or sponge to spread a thin coat over the photo and wooden edges. Not only will this guarantee that the photo will stay right where you want it, it will also provide a permanent glossy finish. Let the acrylic sealant dry completely before hanging or handling the ornament.Applying a sealant will preserve and protect the ornament, ensuring that you get years and years of use out of it.
Brush the acrylic sealant thinly and evenly on each side.

, Finally, take the screw-in hook and drill it by hand into the flat part of one corner of the block. Test the hook to see if it’s firm and secure. You can now tie on a length of ribbon or fishing line and use it to hang the ornament, or simply slide the hook directly over a thin tree branch or nail. You’re finished!Find a place to screw in the hook where it won’t damage one of the photos.
If you’re feeling particularly crafty, add other embellishments like lace, beads or tassels to the ornament.

Make two parallel cuts of the same length into the fold of the photo.,
Fold the tabs between the cuts back and forth, pressing them flat.,
Open the photo halfway to 90 degrees.,
Glue your cutout photos to the front of each pop-up box to create a pop-up scene.",How to Make a Pop up Photograph1," It doesn't necessarily have to be in focus (the objects popping out will draw the eye instead), but it should be fairly plain and not super attention-grabbing. A street, a park, or a natural setting (forest, woods, etc.) are all good choices.






;
, Try to get as close to the actual shapes of the objects as you can without cutting into them.









Think about the size of your background. Will your objects fit into it without looking strangely big or small?
You can either work with several copies of the same image (producing a ""normal"" photo that becomes alive with depth) or different images, playing with contrasts between the subjects and the background.

, The photo should be on the inside. Press along the fold to get a sturdy crease. Keep the photo folded.








, Position them behind where your object will be. Depending on the size of your object, you'll want the cuts to be about 1/2"" to 1"" apart (1.3 to 2.5 cm). The longer these cuts, the further the image will sit from the background.









Make another set of cuts for each additional cutout that you're adding to the background.

Before you cut, keep in mind that you'll be pasting your cutouts to the front of these boxes you're cutting. The cuts should not be longer than the height of your cutout photo and the width between them should not be wider than your cutout photo, either.
The closer together you make the cuts, the smaller your tab will be. The smaller the better (to a point) -- that way, more background is left as is, better seen from different angles.



, Your crease should run horizontally between your two vertical cuts. Fold to the front, then flip the folded image over and fold the tabs to the back. Return the tabs to the flat position.








, Your ""floor"" or ground should be horizontal, and your ""backdrop"" should be vertical. Use your finger to push each tab forward into the center of the photo, creating pop-up boxes.








, Use a glue stick (instead of white school glue) to avoid any mess or over-gluing. Voila! Now where to put it?









If you don't have glue, transparent tape will also work -- just make sure it's flat and not visible from most angles.

",How to Make a Pop up Photograph2," They don't have to match at all, really. All you need is one of scenery and one of a subject (or two). If you'd like a photo of a dinosaur crashing into your kitchen, all the more power to you. The more absurd the combination, the less emphasis there will be on the popping. So if you'd like to keep your friends' reactions to, ""Wow! A 3D photo!"" keep your two images similar.









Make sure your object is smaller than your scenery. If T-Rex is 10"" tall and the photo you have of your kitchen is 4x6, there's a problem there. Luckily, resizing photos is a piece of cake (if cake isn't what you're looking for, you could always make the Walgreen's employees do it for you).
Your subject should be whole. The torso of T-Rex dragging through your kitchen (trying to reach your cabinets?) just doesn't make sense. For the subject you choose, make sure you have a complete image, top to bottom.

, For an 8x10, 2"" (5 cm) from the bottom, make a fold, with the new flap facing toward you, image side up. For smaller or larger photos, adjust accordingly. Your photo should now be able to stand up.









This flap is what your subject will stand on. That way, they're in all of the photo, not just in front of it.

, The fewer intricate cuts you have to make the better, so if you have an image that's fairly straight and to the point, great. You want your cuts to be as close to the edge of the shape as possible.









If you have more than one subject, just make sure they both fit!

, Grab a piece of photo paper (photo paper is a lot sturdier than regular paper) and cut a strip about 1/2"" (1.25 cm) wide and 8"" (long). Each subject will need one -- so if you've two subjects, cut two strips.









Again, these are proportions for a decent-sized object on an 8x10. If your subject is bigger or smaller, you may need a different sized stability strip.

, You need it to be bent into a geometric U-shape. The sides should be 3"" (7.5 cm) long and the middle (bottom of the ""U"") should be 2"" (5 cm) long.








, Taking one of the longer sections of the strip, glue it to the back of your subject, preferably centered. The more centered it is, the more stable your subject will be. Glue the other longer section to the background. The 2"" in between is how your subject pops.









Repeat for each object you have. If anything seems to be leaning, use a bit of transparent tape to solve the problem.

, Now that you have an awesome pop up photograph to your name, what to do with it? The only trick here is positioning it where it can't really be seen from the sides. Place it where you'd like, but stand at different points in the room to see what it looks like from all angles.









Higher works better than lower. If viewed from below, the photograph stays intact; if viewed from above, it loses its dimensions and depth.

Familiarize yourself with your camera.,
Hold your camera properly.,
Steady your camera with a tripod.,
Set the camera's resolution as high as possible.,
Use one of your camera’s automatic modes.",How to Take Better Photographs1," Take the time to get to know your camera and ensure that you are using it properly. Read the manual to learn what each control, switch, button, and menu item does.Learn the basic actions, such as using the flash (on, off, and auto), zooming in and out, and using the shutter button.


If you can find an online tutorial for your camera or a video, then this might be helpful as well.;
, The way that you hold your camera may make a difference in the quality of your shots. It is important to hold your camera with both hands to have the most control over it. Hold it so that you are supporting the lens with your left hand and holding the camera body with your right hand.This position will make it easier to keep your camera steady, take pictures quickly, and adjust your settings if necessary.
You can also try holding your elbows close to your body to help steady the camera.

, If you have a hard time keeping your camera steady enough to photograph your subjects, then you might find it helpful to get a tripod. A tripod will keep your camera steady while still allowing you to adjust it to different angles.


You might consider getting a low-cost tripod to start out with. You can also get mini-tripods that adjust so that you can place them on table tops and photograph from lower angles.

, Low-resolution images are more difficult to alter later and they don’t look as good. To ensure that you are getting the best quality photos possible, change your camera’s settings so that you are taking high-resolution photos.


Keep in mind that higher resolution photos take up a lot of memory, so you may need to get a larger memory card to accommodate this change.

, Most digital cameras have an easy automatic mode that will change your camera’s settings based on the type of subject you are photographing. For example, the camera may detect that you are taking a portrait of someone in low light and adjust the settings to get the best image. Try using your camera’s automatic setting to make it easier to take better photos.


If your photos come out poorly focused or poorly exposed, then start operating certain functions manually.
For portraits, using an anti-red eye mode may be helpful.

Find your light source.,
Take photos during the golden hour whenever possible.,
Use a shaded area if the light is too harsh.,
Put up the flash.,
Prevent red eye in portraits.",How to Take Better Photographs2," Identifying where your light is coming from is an important part of ensuring the best lighting for your subject. The light needs to be on your subject to illuminate it properly. Before you take a photo, take a moment to look around you and determine which direction the light is coming from.For example, if you are outdoors, figure out where the sun is at and observe how it is casting light on your subject. Consider what angle might be the most flattering or interesting for photographing your subject.
Avoid taking pictures with the light source directly behind you. This can make your photos look somewhat boring and flat. Instead, always try to position yourself so that you are shooting your subject at an angle to the light.

, The golden hour happens twice per day—in the hour before sunrise and in the hour after sunset. During this time, you will notice that your subjects will have a warm light cast on them. There will also be some shadows that may result in interesting details.Try taking outdoor photographs during the golden hour to reap the benefits of this pleasing light. You will notice that shadows are longer during this time as well, which can also add visual interest to your photos.

, Sometimes natural light from the sun can be too harsh for portraits. It may cause your subject to look washed out or cast harsh shadows and make it hard to see the details of a person’s face. One way to adapt when your light is too harsh is to photograph your subject in the shade.Keep in mind that photographing your subject in the shade may create a cooler effect than photographing your subject in an unshaded area.

, Many people only use the flash in dim light. However, if you only use the flash in low light, then you may not be getting the best possible pictures. Your flash can be especially useful when the sun is shining brightly, such as around midday. This may result in harsh shadows and unappealing photos.By using your flash when the light is harsh, you can direct extra light at the shadows and bathe your subject in more light. This may result in more pleasing photos.
Keep in mind that you do not always need to use the flash, especially if the natural lighting is good. However, you might want to try taking photos with and without the flash to see what works best for the light you have available.

, Red eye is caused by the camera’s flash reflecting off of your retinas. This usually happens when you are taking photos in low light and your eyes don’t have enough time to constrict.To avoid getting a red eye effect, you can try:


Turning on more lights. If you are taking pictures indoors, then you can prevent the red eye effect by turning on as many lights as you can and making the environment brighter.
Telling your subjects to look away from the camera. If your subjects are not looking directly at the camera, then you can avoid the red-eye reflection.
Turning on the red-eye function. Most digital cameras have this feature and it can help to prevent red-eye shots.

"
Identify the story you want to tell.,
Choose a focus.,
Look for pleasing shapes and lines.,
Add dimension to your shot by placing something in the foreground.,
Get closer to your subject.",How to Take Better Photographs3," Taking time to think about the composition of your shot is also important. This means thinking about the story that you want to tell about your subject or subjects.For example, if you are photographing a man sitting on a bench in a park, what is his story? Is he waiting for someone? Is he sad? Happy? Concerned? What else is happening that is relevant to this man? How can you frame your subject to tell this story?
If you want to portray the man as lonely, then you might choose to frame him in a way that no other people will be in the shot. You might also look for interesting things in the background or foreground to help tell your story about the man. For example, framing the shot so that a statue of woman is in the background might help to make him seem like he is lonely.
Investigate your surroundings and experiment with different angles and ranges to frame your shot and tell your story.

, It is important to have a central focus for your photo. This item or person should be at the center of the photograph or highlighted in some way. One way to do this is to use a physical object as a frame.For example, you might use an archway or window as a frame for your subject. Taking the photo so that the subject is within the archway or window, either in the foreground or background, will help to place emphasis on this subject.
You can also use people as a frame. Once you have chosen your central focus, frame your shot so that the subject is surrounded by people from all sides.
You can also emphasize your focus by using the rule of thirds. This is when you divide your shot into three vertical sections and three horizontal sections and then take the shot with your focal point in the center of this grid.

, Incorporating pleasing shapes and lines can also help you frame your subject and enhance the visual quality of your photo. You can use buildings, structural aspects within buildings, or other physical objects to incorporate pleasing shapes and lines.For example, you might find the exterior of a building visually pleasing and photograph your subject in front of it. The building will add a backdrop and help to frame your subject.
You can also use architectural elements within buildings to your benefit, such as a stairwell, a doorway, or a window.

, Shooting with something in the foreground or background can help to add dimension to your photos. If you want your subject to seem small, then you might place something in the foreground of the shot. If you want your subject to look large, then you might place something in the background.For example, you might take a picture of someone standing on a beach, but photograph the person from far away with a seashell in the foreground. Or, you might photograph the person from a closer vantage point, but capture a seemingly endless white beach in the background.

, Sometimes photos do not look as good as they could because you are too far away from your subject. If you notice that the details of your subject are hard to make out, then try moving a little closer.For example, if you took your first shot while standing 10 feet away, then take the next one from five feet away. Keep checking your shots and adjusting your distance until you have captured the desired amount of detail in your shot.

Pan with a moving target.",How to Blur the Background of a Photograph1," You will find a circular dial, usually on the top of your camera, that has several shooting options such as “Auto”. Turn the dial so that the aperture priority setting is selected.


The aperture setting is identified by an “A” and sometimes an “Av” on certain Canon models.
Aperture is the size of the hole in the lens through which light travels, similar to the pupil of an eye.Aperture is measured in f-numbers (Ex: f/1.4), known as “f-stops”. And while it may sound confusing, the larger the f-stop, the smaller the f-stop. So a f/1.4 will have a larger aperture (hole) than a f/2. A smaller f-stop will create a larger depth of field and be able to separate the foreground and background better, blurring the background.;
,


To better blur the background of your photograph you want to create enough distance between the camera and the subject so that you can zoom on your camera to better focus it on your foreground.
In addition, the further your subject is from the background, the easier it will be to get a nice blurred look. Depending on your lens, play with this distance having your subject stand 5, 10, or 15 feet away from the background.

, This is a shot that has your subject in the frame from about the waist up. For a great portrait photo you may then want to get a bit closer, or zoom on your camera so you can really focus on the shoulders and head. But starting further out can help you adjust at the beginning.


Focus directly on the eyes.
Note: The nose, ears and hair will be in varying degrees of focus. At smaller apertures, the background of a shot will be in focus. At larger apertures, the background will be blurred.

, Narrow the depth of field further by zooming in. To make as shallow a depth of field as possible, use a long/telephoto lens set on maximum zoom. Stand as close to the subject as possible.


If you have a very long lens, this might still be quite far away from your subject.
If you only have the lens your camera came with, you may have to stand closer to the subject. You should still try and get a fair amount of zoom on your camera, and in general, you will be closer to your subject than your subject is from the background.
Play around with zoom and snap a couple of test photos to see if you’re getting close to the desired results.

, If the subject is moving, move your camera to follow the subject and keep it sharp while blurring the background.


Try different shutter speeds to balance the background blur you want against the subject blur you don't want.
Try a 1/125 second shutter speed to begin.
Keep your body and the camera as steady as possible. Track the subject through the viewfinder and ensure your camera is focusing properly on the subject. Take the photo with confidence.
This technique uses the blurred background to highlight the motion of the subject, whereas background blurred solely through a shallow depth of field is used to make the subject stand out from its surroundings.

Set your camera to the auto setting and use portrait mode.,
Adjust your auto focus settings in the menu.,
Place your subject as far away from the background as possible.,
Zoom in as far as you can.If you are using a kit lens (the default lens that comes with your camera) then you want to zoom to get a longer focal length, or the distance between the lens and the subject.",How to Blur the Background of a Photograph2," If you don’t have a particularly advanced camera you can still blur the background of a photograph by using your camera’s other settings like portrait mode which will adjust the camera automatically to help you with the desired effect.The portrait mode is found on the dial usually under the “P” or the little image of a woman. Switch your dial to Portrait mode to have your camera automatically adjust your aperture and shutter speed.

, You can hit the “Menu” button on your camera and navigate to the focus selection. In a lot of cameras you will see several boxes with the center one filled in.


Move your cursor to fill in one of the other boxes that will be closest to where your subject’s eyes are.
This will allow the camera to automatically focus the most on your selected area, blurring the rest out the further away from the focus area an object is.

, You can manually narrow your depth of field if you don’t have a lens that will easily do it for you by creating a large distance between the foreground and background.


If you are taking a photo of your subject in front of say, a wall, then try and move them 10 or so feet away from the wall. With your portrait mode set, your camera should be able to blur the background on its own.

,


You’ll have to play with distance here depending on how far your lens can zoom. You want to be able to zoom in as far as possible while still getting both your subject and some background in the shot.This method will mean that there will be less background in your photo, but it will help you get the desired effect. Your subject will remain the same and only the background will shrink if you zoom correctly. But it will help to blur the background.

Employ Photoshop’s Blur tool to blur the background of a photograph.,
Blur using layers.,
Blur the background of your photograph by making your image a “Smart Object”.,
Use the Quick Selection tool to blur a background.,
If you are using an updated version of Photoshop, try using the ""smart blur"" option.",How to Blur the Background of a Photograph3," Select the raindrop looking icon from the toolbar, this is the blur tool.


At the top of your screen will see options for brush size, and strength of your stroke. You can adjust these to your liking. For a portrait style photo with a fair amount of background you can select a larger brush size.
Hold down your mouse and move it over the background of your photo to blur it.
Keep in mind that this technique does not create true depth - it blurs everything in the background uniformly rather than independently based on distance from the lens. An image blurred ""in camera"" collects visual information from a scene that a Photoshop blurred image can never obtain because the data is not there in a Photoshop file. The ""in camera"" image is a much truer and organic image/record.

, For this option you’ll want to create a duplicate layer going to Layers > Duplicate layers. With your duplicate layer, click Filters > Blur > Gaussian Blur.


Now your entire image will be blurred out. But because you have the original image as a layer under this one, you can use the erase tool to erase the blur over the part of your photo you want in focus.
Once you have done that, go to Layer > Flatten Image. This will flatten the two layers into one, with your blurred background.

, This will allow you to use an iris blur to keep your subject in focus while blurring the background.In your Layers panel right-click on your background layer, the image, and select “Convert to Smart Object”.
From your top menu click Filter > Blur Gallery > Iris Blur. Now drag your iris over your subject. You can adjust the size and shape of the iris by clicking and dragging on the different boxes you see. You can also hold shift while you drag to convert the rectangular iris into a circle, adjusting it to the proper size.

, Find the Quick Selection tool in your toolbar, it looks like a paintbrush with a dashed oval shape next to it.


Hold and drag it around your subject that you want to remain in focus. This tool uses distinctive edges to select your image, and is much easier to use if you were able to blur your background on your camera even slightly when taking your photo.
Use the Refine Edge button in the “Options” bar to further refine your selection to make sure everything you want is selected.From your top bar menu go to Select > Inverse. Now everything that is not your subject will be selected. From here you want to go to Filter > Gaussian Blur. Simply adjust the Radius slider to your preferred blur setting and click “OK”.

, This filter evaluates the range of pixels in the background and foreground, and gives you more control over the image. The filter is also adjustable which enables the photographer to manipulate the photo even more.

Be mindful of the background.,
To add some depth, take your photos at an angle to the poser.,
When looking at photos, notice the visual path that you naturally follow, based on how the photographer composed the picture.,
Have one center of interest, where possible.,
Do not clutter your photo.",How to Compose Your Center of Interest1," Notice the objects, shapes and lines in the background when taking pictures and when editing your pictures. Avoid including any distractions above the person's head. Steer clear of things like tree trunks, posts, narrow buildings, vertical lines, etc.;
, At the same time, aim to have an interesting background. Read up on landscape art composition; this will help you to appreciate the art of composing more. There are many good books and websites available on the topic of landscape art composition.

, In the photo shown here, the photographer has carefully composed everything:


The poser in the foreground is what you notice first.
We then notice the other people in the photo. The path also guides on along the visual path.
In the background, a distance away, you finally see a nice landscape with the high building.

, If you have two centers of interest, you must compose your photo carefully. For example, in this image, you can see that the boat blends in with the building in the background––the photo could have been composed better.


Selective focus with the background remaining blurry is an option where there is more than one center of interest. A different camera angle horizontal or vertical could help too; take many photos and choose from the best among them.

, Anything involving a scene, such as a beach scene, can be all too easy to clutter, especially if you're a novice at composition.


This scene has a lot of potential. The beach is obviously the center of interest but the white building in the upper left corner and the other building draws attention away from the beach. Crop this type of distraction by including just a portion of the white building.

Notice the simplicity of professional photos and frames of scenes in well made movies, and imitate this simplicity in your photos. Learn from the graphic design of products like beer ads. When composing your photo, think how a professional photographer would take the picture, and take your photo like a professional photographer. Move a bit, move a lot and use the different setting in your camera to arrange the elements in your photo.

Seek legal help if you are sued.",How to Avoid Privacy Violations As a Photographer," You cannot sneak onto someone’s property in order to take a photograph. Also, if you are invited onto someone’s property, you don’t necessarily have permission to start taking photographs.


If you want to photograph something, then find the property owner and ask permission to enter. Also explain what you want to take a photograph of and get permission.;
, You also generally cannot use long-distance lenses to peer into someone’s house and photograph them. This is called “intrusion upon seclusion” and is a civil wrong which you can be sued for.You can be sued even if none of your photographs are published.


Generally, however, you can take pictures of anything plainly visible in public space.If people are on the sidewalk, in a public square, or on the road, then they are in public space.

, Although you can take pictures of someone in public, you should avoid constant surveillance or stalking. In particular, you should stop taking someone’s picture if they ask you to stop. Failure to stop could be harassment.


In a famous case, Jackie Kennedy sued photographer Ron Galella for constantly taking pictures of her point-blank in public. The court found that Galella had engaged in “systematic public surveillance” which intruded on Kennedy’s privacy., You have no general right as a photographer to enter and take pictures of a crime scene when the general public is also excluded.Instead, at a minimum, you must get permission to enter from the police or fire chief in charge of the crime scene.


A homeowner might still object if you take pictures even after being invited into a crime scene. You need to be careful in this area. You do not have a clear right to take pictures of dead bodies or injured people even if you have been invited to enter a crime scene.
You should use your best judgment. Exercise caution and consideration for the feelings of family members who might see the picture of an injured loved one. If your goal is to avoid a lawsuit, then you should err on the side of caution and not take the photograph.

, You can always avoid liability if you get the subject’s consent. You will need to draft a valid consent form (called a ""release form"") that covers two things: (1) the subject’s consent to have their picture taken and (2) your right to publish the picture. These are not the same two rights, and you need to get permission for both if you intend to distribute the photograph in any way.


Consent also must be given by someone who can validly give it. For example, a minor cannot give consent. Instead, you would need consent from a parent or guardian.You can also get oral consent. However, you must be careful. Someone might turn around and claim not to have given it. It is always better to have written consent.

, There are additional legal considerations you must take into account if you are involved in selecting images to publish. For example, you cannot use a celebrity’s photograph in such a way that it implies the celebrity’s endorsement of a product. This is an example of invasion of privacy.Always be careful when using identifiable people in a commercial manner. As a general rule, you can nevertheless use someone’s likeness if they are the subject of the story. For example, you can use a celebrity’s photograph to illustrate a story about her—even without her permission.

, There are good sample release forms on the Internet. You can copy and use them. For example, the American Society of Media Photographers publishes four different release forms you can use.


The language you use on the release form will differ depending on the context. For example, if you are taking photographs of professional models, then your form will be different than if you are taking pictures of people out on the street.
The sample release form in this section would be appropriate for people you approach in public places or as part of your work as a journalist.

, To draft your own consent form, you should open a blank work processing document and set the font to a comfortable size and style. Most people can read Times New Roman 12 point.

, Include the words “Permission for Photography” in large, bold letters, centered between the left- and right-hand margins.

, The body of the release will explicitly grant you the ability to take the photograph and to publish it. Make sure to also include a release of liability. This release will protect you from lawsuits.


Sample language could read: “For valuable consideration received, I grant to (“Photographer”) and his/her legal representatives and assigns, the unrestricted right to use and publish photographs of me, or photographs in which I may be included, for editorial, trade, advertising, and any other purpose, regardless of manner and medium. I also grant the right to alter and compose the pictures without restriction and without my approval or inspection. I hereby release Photographer and Photographer’s legal representatives and assigns from all claims and liability relating to said photographs.”

, You want a line for the subject’s signature. If your subject is a child, get the child’s parent’s signature. You also want other identifying information from the subject, which you should include blank lines for:


printed name
date of birth
the date the photograph is taken
phone number
street address
city, state, and zip code

, In order for the release to be a valid contract, each side has to offer the other something of value. This is called the “consideration.” The subject letting you take their picture is something of value. However, as the photographer, you also need to provide something of value.


The consideration you offer can be as simple as giving someone your business card and offering to send them a print of the photograph in exchange for them signing the release.

, Each state has its own privacy laws, which continue to evolve.In fact, this is an area of law where there are few bright-line rules. Instead the law develops piece by piece, as new cases emerge.


A general introduction to each state’s privacy law as it applies to photographers is available from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press website.Click on your state on the left-hand column to read a general introduction to your state’s law.
To fully protect yourself, you should always contact an attorney with questions. If you practice as a photographer in more than one state, then you should contact an attorney in each state that you practice.

, If you want to ask questions or have a lawyer help you draft a release form, then you should contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.Once you have the name of an attorney, you should schedule a half-hour consultation.


Try to get a referral to an attorney who specializes in media or First Amendment issues. You can ask the person at the bar association for someone who specializes in these areas.
You also might want to get referrals from other photographers.

, Several non-profit organizations exist to help people in the media with legal issues. For example, the Reporter’s Committee for the Freedom of the Press runs a legal defense hotline, 1-800-336-4243, which is available during regular office hours (9:00 am to 6:00 pm Eastern Standard Time).


Other legal aid organizations might also provide free legal assistance to photographers who work as photojournalists. You can find a local legal aid organization by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website., Defending yourself from an invasion of privacy claim is very difficult, and you would benefit from professional legal assistance. If you are sued, you will receive a copy of a “complaint,” which is the legal document the person suing you files with the court to start the lawsuit.Read the complaint and then schedule a consultation with a lawyer.

Provide contrast.",How to Compose Your Center of Interest2," First straighten your photo, then make it look attractive with exposure adjustments, starting with contrast. Crop to simplify. Use Windows Live Photo Gallery or Microsoft Office Picture Manager (Windows Live Photo Gallery is free), or whatever photo program you usually use.

, When you have two people in a photo, eyeball a center between them, and place this center according to the golden mean.

Look at the photo below and notice the dead space at the bottom. The interesting part of this photo is the area where the two men are looking (besides what is in their mouth and their facial expressions) and there should be more space there.


, In this image, notice how the space to the lady's right, even with the lines, does not balance the rest of the photo. Asymmetry is many times vertical in Asian art and in this photo the asymmetry is horizontal.
Again, take many photos and ask the person to pose differently. Your photo must be pleasing to look at––trust your instincts on what is pleasing, even if you cannot explain why exactly.







, For a peaceful composition, use a horizontal line. With objects of the same size, arrange them so they appear different, such as in this photo:
, The approximate ratio of the golden mean is 6/10, so a vertical placement of a subject would be 6/10 in height on your frame.
If your subject matter is the moon, imagine a dot at the center of the moon, and place it there, according to the golden mean.






When you have two or more objects, find the center of those objects and place this center according to the golden mean.

, In the image shown here, the people in the bottom section and the plants frame this photo; this enhances the speaker who is the center of interest. The bottom, left corner should be cropped a bit in this graduation picture, and the bottom left corner in the previous step's picture could do with having a bit more space.
, The visual path is from left to right, just as we read from left to right. The lines from the building converge at the sunset.

, Contrast will ensure that the viewer's attention is on the center of interest. Take pictures from different heights––you do not have to be looking at the preview directly. Take some pictures with the camera held above your head and held low, below eye level.


The contrast in this photo is with light. In this scene, if the camera was held lower (perhaps the top part of the photo), it would look less compacted. The top part of the photo has a science fiction look–-okay if that is what you want, but not if you want a professional-looking photo.

Understand what a digital camera sensor is, and how it works.,
Understand what digital ""noise"" is and what causes it.,
Purchase higher-end, newer camera equipment.,
Switch your camera's exposure to manual mode and adjust the settings which may introduce noise.,
Turn the camera's noise reduction setting on, if it has one.,
Make your image as bright as possible.,
Avoid using digital zoom, such as those frequently found on lower-end cameras or ""point-and-click"" varieties.,
Keep your camera stored in a cool place before you use it.,
Take further steps to combat noise in post production, such as the aforementioned ""dark frame subtraction"" or noise reduction software.",How to Avoid Noise in Your Digital Photography," Unlike analog cameras, digital cameras work with a sensor instead of film. Sensors receive light and process it into electric charges via tiny photo diodes, whose outputs are reflected as pixels in your final digital image.These electrical charges tell the sensor what colour each corresponding pixel is meant to be and other information which will create the digital image.;
, When light hits the sensor's photo diodes, a signal of electrons are produced in order to convey the light to the camera sensor. Electronic ""noise"" is the unwanted fluctuations in this signal.In a digital camera, noise manifests itself as speckles, usually colored and without pattern. These are generally caused by unwanted electron flow in and around the sensor adding to the desired electron flow. Noise can be caused by imperfections in the sensor itself such as ""hot pixels"", randomness in the distribution of the limited numbers of photons available at low light levels,and the sensor or camera overheating.

, The most convenient, but expensive, way to combat noise is to buy a newer camera if yours is a few years old, with more expensive cameras being able to deliver better performance. Newer cameras have sensors that are developed to collect more light with less noise than those in older cameras, making them a good choice if you are struggling to control noise in your images and your gear is outdated.


Choose a camera with a larger sensor. The problem with smaller sensors is that the light sensors are closer together than in a larger sensor, and that means the electrons overheating corrupt them faster due to their closer proximity. A larger sensor means that electrons will have to travel farther before corrupting their neighbouring light sensors. Full frame sensors are perfect for reducing noise in your images. A DSLR or large-sensor compact camera such as one in ""Four Thirds"" format is much better than a compact camera, even one a few years newer, although a full-frame DSLR is better still, as fast wide-angle and prime lenses for it are more widely available and cheaper.
Pick a camera with fewer megapixels, or a lower resolution, in a given class. The more pixels there are on a camera's sensor, the closer they are together and the more likely overheating electrons will corrupt the light sensors. Although higher-end cameras generally have larger sensors with a high resolution or megapixel count, there are those which have larger sensors but still retain lower megapixel counts, making them perfect for dealing with digital noise.
Pick a wide-aperture lens to maximize light intake. Some compact cameras have f/2.0 or f/2.8 lenses; a 50mm f/1.8 lens is inexpensive and excellent for a DSLR. These will allow the same shutter speed at one-half to one-quarter the ISO setting of a common f/3.5 or f/4.5 maximum aperture zoom lens (At the same f/ratio, the bigger camera is still better: it's collecting equally intense light into bigger photography sites, for far more photons to process. The absolute size of the aperture for a given angle of view matters more). Lenses are a much more mature technology than cameras, so an interchangeable wide-aperture lens will improve your photography through many camera upgrades. Image stabilization allows faster shutter speeds but tends not to be built into wide aperture lenses, making those better overall as they stop subject motion too; a fast lens and compatible in-body image stabilization is a great combination.

, When the camera is on automatic, or in program mode, as is the case with most lower-end cameras of the ""point-and-click variety"", your images are more likely to have noise as the camera changes the exposure by itself, and quite often it will introduce factors that introduce noise to your images. Taking control of your camera and exposure settings will help you eliminate factors which could contribute to digital noise in your photographs. Your camera's instruction manual will contain all instructions on how to adjust the various settings on your camera.


It's OK to use a semi-automated exposure mode, but be sure to manually set a low ISO if possible. For instance, you could use aperture-priority mode with a wide aperture, which will allow a relatively short shutter speed with any given ISO. You could use your camera's exposure-compensation or bracketing function to try different exposures near the one the camera thinks is right.
Reduce your ISO. ISO is the setting which controls how light sensitive your camera's sensor is. A lower ISO (for example ISO 200) means your sensor is less sensitive to light, but is also less likely to create digital noise, while a higher ISO (for example ISO 400, or ISO 800) makes your camera sensor more sensitive to available light, but also increases the chance your images will have noise. Check your camera's manual on how to adjust the ISO setting.

If you need a higher ISO for a correct exposure with a fast-enough shutter speed to avoid blur from a lack of camera support or moving subject, use it. Adding a few speckles of high-ISO noise is better than smearing the picture with blur or wiping out its shadow detail with underexposure.


Use a faster shutter speed, or rather, avoid long exposures. Long shutter speeds (for example, exposures of 5 seconds, or 30 seconds or longer) create more noise as they make the camera's sensor overheat faster. Faster shutter speeds give less chance for the sensor to overheat. So consider adding more light to your image to reduce the exposure time, and reduce the chance of noise: turn on some lamps, or use a flash. If you can't add more light, or it would spoil the picture (like one of lights outdoors at night), a slightly slower shutter speed and a lower ISO will provide the best results, as described below.
Increase your signal-to-noise ratio with a low ISO and generous exposure.If you let a lot of light into your camera, preferably quickly, it will overpower the noise and give you an acceptable image. Use a low ISO setting, which amplifies the sensor's signals relatively little, and exposure to go with it (Some kinds of noise can accumulate over time, and even accrue more rapidly as the sensor warms through use, but a longer exposure is still generally better than a higher ISO). The lowest setting is usually best, but you'll usually have to look for noise to notice it up to ISO 400 with a compact camera or old DSLR, and up to ISO 1600 with a modern (2011) DSLR.

, This feature is usually found in higher-end cameras. In-camera noise reduction is usually helpful in combating noise in your images, especially those of a longer exposure or in low light conditions. However be aware, it does smooth the fine detail in your images, making them softer to the eye, which can be problematic, so only use this setting if you feel that noise will a serious problem while shooting. PC software can often smooth noise in post production, while preserving detail better than that supplied in the camera's internal computer, and you can revert to your original image if you decide you didn't want so much smoothing, or even any at all.


You can use ""dark frame subtraction"" – making a preliminary or subsequent ""exposure"" of the same length as the actual exposure but with the lens capped to detect noise to delete from the final image to compensate for ""hot pixel"" and other camera imperfection noise.Some cameras can do it automatically, not bothering to open the shutter for the dark exposure, but you can perform it yourself, even with a compact camera.This technique does not smooth your image, so is a suitable option for those who are worried about other noise reduction methods.

, It may seem obvious, but the less shadow there is in your image, the less chance noise will have together there. Noise generally appears in darker areas of your images (where there's less light to overpower it), so whether you introduce a new light source, such as a lamp or flash, move to a better-lit area, change your exposure settings to allow more light or photograph lighter subjects, reducing the amount of shadow in your image will reduce the amount of noise.


Night pictures can be tricky because the highlights are actually the light sources. Like the sun during the day, they're much brighter than the surrounding areas which receive and reflect back to the camera only a little of their light. A camera's light meter averaging their brightness with their surroundings as if they were ordinary highlights will underexpose them for one big, noisy over-dark shadow. Try increasing the exposure significantly over what it suggests.
Very bright lights can cause streaking or ""bloom"" with the CCD sensors usually found in cheaper cameras. Try to avoid having them close-by in the image.

, Digital zoom is technically not zooming at all; it is in fact cropping and enlarging from a small area of the sensor. It should especially be avoided when that small area is clouded by noise.

, The cause of most noise is a thermal reaction. The warmer your camera is, the more likely the sensor will overheat in a shorter period of time. Making sure your camera is cool, especially when in hot conditions, can greatly improve your camera's performance and reduce the likelihood of digital noise. Excessive heat such as that in uninsulated areas of a car in the sun, will be harmful for cameras regardless.

, Sometimes, no matter what actions you take to reduce noise, it may still occur in your photos. In these cases you should take the time to learn and implement noise reduction in post processing.

Get the right equipment for digital restoration.,
Scan the photograph.,
Crop the image.,
Correct the photograph’s tone.,
Fix scratches and dust marks.,
Fill in tears or missing portions.,
Print the image.",How to Restore Old Photographs1," Purchasing a high-quality scanner and photo editing software for your home computer can help make digital restoration at home possible. Invest in a photo editing program like Photoshop and a high-quality scanner that can scan images at a high dpi, or dots per square inch. The greater the dpi, the more detail the scanner will be able to capture. A dpi of 300 is recommended for most photographs.;
, Gently place the photograph in the scanner, and select to scan the image at a high-resolution to capture as much detail as possible. When prompted, save the image as a TIFF instead of a JPEG. A TIFF is a larger file, but it will retain the detail and quality of the photograph.Once you have saved the image, open it in your photo editing software.

, Use the cropping tool to remove any evidence of damage around the edges of the photograph. Edges of old photographs often curl when exposed to water or humidity. If your photograph has damage around the perimeter, cropping the image will quickly correct this problem.

, Repair the color, brightness, and contrast issues before attempting to change any other imperfections or signs of damage. These can be adjusted by opening editing tools in Photoshop or another photo editing software. These levels can be altered by sliding your cursor along a scale until you produce your desired effects.


Increasing the brightness level can help brighten up a dark photo, or intensifying the contrast can bring out a washed-out, faded photo.
Play with the color sliders to help remove unwanted tints.
Save each version you create under a different file name so you can compare each version later and select the best restoration.

, Using the Dust and Scratches filter or the Spot Healing Brush in Photoshop or a similar tool in other photo editing programs makes removing imperfections straightforward and simple.Magnify the photograph, and use the cursor to touch up the damaged marks. Work slowly and be sure to zoom out to check your progress as you work. This filter works by removing some of the details, so you will want to be sure that you are not overusing this feature.


Keep a window open of the whole photo so you can observe the changes as you make them.

, If there are tears, rips, or missing sections of the photograph, you can use the Clone Stamp tool to recreate a portion of the image and fill in the damaged sections.

Seek the help of a professional.",How to Restore Old Photographs2," If your old photograph has dirt, sand, or residue on it, you may be able to clean the image by hand. Wear rubber gloves, and gently remove the dirt with a soft brush or soft-bristled toothbrush. If there is a large amount of dirt, the photograph can be gently rinsed under lukewarm running water. Use your finger to softly wipe away dirt, but take care not scratch the photo. Let the photograph dry in a dark place where it will not be disturbed. You can clip the image on a wire with a clothespin to dry, or you can place the image face-up on a newspaper or towel.If the photo turns red, yellow, or white while cleaning, this could be an indication that professional care is needed. The image may be too badly damaged to fix at home.

, If you find a stack of photographs that have stuck together, do not pull them apart. Instead, soak them in distilled water. Photographs are coated with gelatin. When they are placed in water, the gelatin softens and the photographs can be separated more easily.Purchase a bottle of distilled water from your local grocery store or pharmacy. Keep the water at room temperature, and pour it into a container that is large enough to submerge your photos. Place them with the image facing upward and let them soak in the water for 20 to 30 minutes. Use your fingers to gently slide the photographs apart, or use a rubber spatula to separate the images. Let them dry on a towel image-side up. Place a book or magazine along the edges so they do not curl as they dry., Before trying to remove the glass, be sure you make a copy of the image. You can remove the glass by heating up the image. Hold a hair dryer 4 to 5 inches away from the back of a print. After a few minutes, try to lift up one of the corners of the image, and slowly peel back the image., You can secure a tear or fix a torn photograph by using an acid-free tape. Regular tape with an acidic adhesive can damage the photograph over time. Look for an archival tape or tape with an acrylic adhesive at an office supply or stationary store to repair and protect your photographs. Cut small pieces of tape and secure the tear on the back of the photograph., A torn photograph can also be repaired by using a strip of acid-free paper that is secured with acid-free glue. These can be purchased at an arts and crafts store or an office supply shop. Apply a small amount of the glue to the strip of paper, and press the strip over the tear on the back of the photograph. Remove any excessive glue with a cotton swab. Let the image dry face down on a towel, and place a weight, like a small book, on top of the image to prevent the edges from curling., If you have an old photograph that was rolled up or if the edges are curling, you can release the curls by placing the photo in a homemade humidification chamber. This chamber will reintroduce water into the dry, brittle photograph which will allow the curled edges to relax and release.


Fill a plastic storage bin with a couple of inches of room temperature water. Place a wire rack in the container, making sure that the top is not submerged. Place the photo on top of the rack, and close the chamber with the lid. Let it sit for several hours. Check on the photograph periodically and wipe away any beads of water on the photo. After a few hours, if the curls have relaxed, remove the photograph and let it dry face-up on a towel. Cover the image with blotting paper or parchment paper, and weigh the photograph down with a book as it dries.

, If the photograph is heavily damaged, very old, or extremely delicate, consider having the photo professionally restored. Professionals can not only restore photographs that have been ripped, stained, or damaged by water or sunlight, but they can also digitally enhance the photo’s overall quality and color. Many services are available online. A professional will assess your photo and offer you a quote depending on the damage and the amount of work required.Most professional services will work from a digital copy of the photograph, leaving the original untouched and safe. The restored photo and the original image will be returned to you.

Store photos in a climate-controlled environment.,
Keep photos in archival boxes and albums.,
Properly store the photographs in a bin or album.",How to Restore Old Photographs3," Photographs can be damaged from exposure to water, sunlight, heat, and moisture in the air. Humidity can cause photographs to stick together, while high temperatures cause photographs to become very brittle. Store your photographs in an environment that has low humidity, is not exposed to direct sunlight, and does not experience extreme temperature fluctuations. Ideally, the temperature should be below 75° Fahrenheit.Do not store photos in a hot attic or in a garage or basement where the images may come into contact with water. Keep your photographs in a temperature-controlled section of the house, like a bedroom or hallway closet.

, Archival boxes and albums provide a safe environment for your photographs that keep out humidity, pests, and dust. You can find these items from online vendors and from a stationery or office supply shop. When browsing for archival boxes or albums, be sure that they are intended for photo storage and are free from acid and PVC, or polyvinyl chloride.Place a silica gel packet in the box to help offset any excess moisture.

, If an album or storage box is packed to the brim with photos, it may not close properly, leaving the photos susceptible to environmental damage. A box that is not filled enough may also cause damage to the photographs. When there are only a few items in the container, the images may slide around, causing damage to the edges. Be sure that the photographs are secure and that the storage bin can properly close."

Use a craft knife to cut Styrofoam.,
Use a hand saw to cut Styrofoam.,
Cut Styrofoam with power saws.,
Utilize a hot wire cutter.",How to Cut Styrofoam,"


Use a sharp, thin object to penetrate the foam in order to create a straight cutting line. Using even pressure, make a groove in the Styrofoam with a credit card, key, butter knife or any other sharp, thin object.
Break the Styrofoam along the scored cutting line. For best results, situate the foam on a table or counter top with the scored line along the edge of the surface. Press down gently along the scored line to create a clean break. If necessary, remove any excess foam with a serrated kitchen knife or craft knife.;
,


Wax the knife by running the entire knife blade several times over a candle. To avoid getting colored candle wax on your foam, use a white candle.
Cut the polystyrene foam with the serrated knife using long, sawing motions. Keep steady, even pressure on the knife throughout the sawing motions to reduce the chances of breaking or crushing the Styrofoam.

, Use an electric kitchen knife, such as a carving knife or a fish fillet knife, to create clean cuts in Styrofoam.


Place the electric knife on the foam along the desired cutting line. Do not exert pressure on the electric knife, but allow the serrated blades to gently cut through the Styrofoam.

, A craft knife is ideal for cutting small, thin pieces of foam, but is not recommended for pieces with a thickness of more than 1 inch (2.54 cm). Unlike serrated blades that tear through foam, the sharp blades in craft knives tend to flatten or compress the Styrofoam. This could result in malformed or uneven cuts in thick pieces of foam.


Use a craft knife for small, precise cuts. Craft knives also can be used to create bevel cuts and v-cuts in foam.
Cut into the Styrofoam with the craft knife using small, steady movements. Create a shallow cut mark in the foam. After the initial cut, run the craft knife through the foam several times, creating deeper cuts each time until the Styrofoam is completely cut through from top to bottom.
Change the blades in craft knives frequently when cutting Styrofoam. Dull blades will create rough, uneven slices in the foam.

, Compass saws, coping saws and hacksaws create straight cuts in polystyrene foam. Avoid using a saw with a flexible blade because the blade can easily wobble in the soft foam, which may result in uneven cuts.


Cut the Styrofoam using long, sawing motions. Keep even pressure on the saw to reduce the chances of crushing the Styrofoam.

, Jigsaws, band saws and scroll saws, which are traditionally used for cutting wood, can be used to create clean cuts in Styrofoam. Power saws are particularly effective in cutting large, bulky pieces of foam.


Follow the directions for the particular type of saw you are using. When using power saws to cut Styrofoam, always wear safety goggles.

, Hot wire cutters, which are available at home improvement or craft stores, melt through the foam with a heated wire, creating a smooth edge. Hot wire cutters are especially effective for creating shapes out of Styrofoam.


Apply consistent pressure with the hot wire cutter along the desired cutting line. Use extreme caution when operating a hot wire cutter because the wires are extremely hot and can cause severe burns.

Be aware of what is really important in terms of photography equipment.,
Consider what situations you subject your photography equipment to.,
When considering the number of photos over which a purchase is likely to be amortized, bear in mind that some photos require contrasting factors:


Modest appearance to avoid damage (to camera or photographer) from rough people.,
Look for compensatory possibilities.,
Consider inter-compatibility.,
Don't generally consider camera equipment an investment, though lenses and, in particular, non-automated lenses (being a mature technology with less to become incompatible over time) do tend to retain much of their value.,
Judge the value of the equipment by its returns relevant to your needs.,
Think about economy of scale.,
Given the foregoing information, here is a suggested upgrade path:


Start with moderately-priced compact digital camera with some manual setting capability.,
Finished.

",How to Choose Upgrades for Your Photography System," Several largely independent factors are necessary to a good photo:



Lighting, for pleasingly-defined shapes and colors. (You can compensate for tint and intensity.)

Focus (You may need special equipment for very close ""macro"" photos. Some autofocus systems don't work well for moving subjects or low light).

Speed of operation. Close-up photos of unpredictable moving objects requires fast autofocus. Fast-cycling exposure and flash are helpful to capturing a ""critical moment"" in action photography. Automatic or at least metered focus and exposure, and a zoom lens to avoid swapping too often, help avoid frustrating the subject and operator.

Adequate lens angle of view, for getting enough into the photo and interesting front-to-back perspective. (Often, you can compensate by backing up.)

Adequate magnification, the reverse of adequate angle of view. If too much is in the picture, and everything else is not just perfect for extreme resolution, there will not be much to crop and enlarge.

Proper depth of field. Large depth of field is rarely difficult unless it needs to go along with extreme picture quality (just set a small aperture and use adequately fast film or ISO setting); small depth of field requires a wide aperture or long focal length.

Adequate sensitivity, for photos involving motion or where a tripod is unavailable (including due to inconvenience or neglect). Sensitivity is better than aperture to upgrade for low-light photos where depth of field is desirable. Image stabilization helps too as a substitute for a tripod without reducing depth of field.

Adequate shutter speed (this is rarely a problem with an adjustable camera; speeds over 1/500 second are more for using wide apertures in daylight for small depth of field; high flash-sync speeds are mostly for using fill-flash of modest power in daylight by limiting the amount of ambient light against which the very fast electric flash must balance).

Freedom from excessive lens distortion. This is annoying in pictures of objects with straight lines, and can be fixed on a computer or automatically by some digital cameras. Distortion primarily affects zoom lenses that can cover a wide angle (including wide-to-tele zooms, going away and reversing direction toward the middle of the zoom range). Note that markedly stretched appearance of objects in wide-angle pictures is not considered distortion but merely an essentially unavoidable by-product of projecting the three-dimensional world onto a rectangle. It is interesting with objects, but generally just weird with people – unless a special effect is desired avoid close-ups and people near the edge of the frame with wide-angle lenses.

Sensitivity, resolution, and ""dynamic range"". A sensor (such as a film, or a digital sensor system – or, basically, its amplification of reduced light it collects – so adjusted) with high sensitivity will function with few photons, allowing a small aperture and/or high shutter speed in relatively low light. Film has great ""dynamic range"", which is the ability to have detail rather than pure white or black in highlights and shadows. More expensive and more recent digital cameras generally are better for dynamic range; check reviews.


""High dynamic range"" software, such as Luminance HDR and some cameras' built-in software, can take multiple photos taken with different exposures in quick succession and merge them for very great dynamic range, often with arguably-attractive distorting ""tonemapping"" to display this range in apparently correct relation on the limited brightness range of a monitor or paper. Some cameras' built-in software, such as that on Pentax, combines the images automatically and stretches them to compensate for a little camera movement so a tripod is unnecessary. HDR exposures are generally not compatible with moving subjects. (Some point-and-shoots can use different sensitivity for alternating pixels and merge them for reduced-resolution HDR images from single exposures.)



Lens quality. This is generally the least important factor. A cheap lens properly used will smear fine details by at most a few pixels or a few film-grains, or create subtle though often annoying color fringes (largely correctable on a computer or automatically by some digital cameras) or flare when the sun is in the picture. Poor lighting gives a bad picture to begin with. Lack of adequate angle of view makes it impossible to fit that picture into the camera (aside from stitching and other generally poor substitutes). Poor focus speed misses an action photo entirely. Poor focus, depth of field, inadequate shutter speed, or grossly inadequate magnification will smear out a photo by many, many pixels. Stopped down to f/8 or so, a decent lens will give as good image quality as a great lens (better than either wide open), and a poor lens will give image quality more than acceptable for snapshots.

Clear or ""UV"" filters are good for protecting lenses, but uncoated ones can cause horrible ghosting and flare spots. Since the 1950s, all good camera lenses have been coated or, a little better, multi-coated to much reduce creating these within themselves. You need not buy an expensive brand of filter but make sure it is at least single-coated and preferably multi-coated and that the threads engage smoothly rather than chewing up the lens threads. Protect the rear elements when the lenses are not in use with a rear lens cap.

Lens cleanliness is not critical – a few bits of dirt or smudges won't be in focus and will only block and scatter an insignificant amount of light. Scratches from cleaning them wrong can scatter light more, but more relevantly will bother you and lower their resale value with their presence. Clean your lenses only properly with first a blower then cleaner solution and tissue if necessary. Or, best, keep UV filters on them and don't clean them; replace the filter if it becomes grossly damaged. Some recommend uncoated filters for ease of cleaning, but even a coating slightly damaged from repeated cleaning with paper towels, a breath and a sleeve, etc., is much more effective in reducing flare than a lack of coating.;
, Some kinds of photos require additional factors:


Weather, water, abrasion, or drop-proofing to avoid likely or certain damage from rough environments.
A hot car can do all kinds of bad things to cameras. Keeping them in a cooler (with no ice, but maybe bottles of water to moderate temperature) in the trunk may protect them.
Marine environments can cause water and salt damage; dry-bags and water resistant or waterproof cases are useful additions to prolong the life of the camera.

, Try protecting them with a bag that though padded, does not look like a camera bag – for instance, some coolers including soft-sided ones. The bag should not look like trash, to avoid nice people throwing it away inadvertently.
Modest size for extensive carrying and for candid photography and reducing stress on subjects. The weight of equipment suited to extreme conditions does not go away on a sunny day.
Modest cost in case something happens to the camera at any time.

, Some of these factors can compensate for one another such that the quality of photos depends, and can best be increased by spending money on, the weakest link in the chain. For instance, in sports photography, if night or indoor pictures are blurred, they can be fixed basically for free by taking them with a fast shutter speed and moderate aperture during outdoor day games instead (which involves a different game, and less background blur), by increasing the film or sensor ISO at the cost of a little more grain and noise (and perhaps a few dollars more per roll or a few hundred dollars more on the camera to mitigate that with a better film or sensor), or by upgrading the maximum aperture of the lens for thousands of dollars.

, Some equipment works with a wide range of other equipment (such as a tripod and flashes with manual and built-in non-TTL automatic modes); others are inherently somewhat limited (such as compact, inexpensive lenses for small-sensor digital cameras only), or limited through a lack of care or deliberate rent-seeking (""misfeatures"") for instance through incompatible lens mounts (not too serious in a versatile system), incompatible flash-triggering and autofocus systems within a brand, and obstruction of compatibility of one's digital files with third-party editing software.


In-body image stabilization is one nice feature that can be purchased once and give a benefit with a lot of other equipment (whatever other lenses are attached).
Some digital camera features require substantially more money to make, such as super-high-quality sensors, and others such as mirror lockup or distortion correction don't (the parts of the camera are electronically controlled so they can operate in whatever sequence one chooses, and the algorithms for many kinds of processing are very simple). Consider whether a camera maker tends to deliberately cripple its products to extract more money, and whether they should be encouraged to do that, when choosing a brand of automatic cameras and lenses. Pentax enables many, many features on even its cheaper cameras; free third-party software has been developed to enable more features on Canon point-and-shoots.

, More conventional investments are much less troublesome to sell at a good price and less likely to break. Buy what seems likely to pay itself off through income or enjoyment over a few years at most.

, Much equipment has diminishing though still worthwhile returns, and a point of greatly diminishing returns. Unless there is an extremely good reason to, buy something coming before that point. For instance, an average photographer might reasonably spend $200 on an off-brand 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 zoom lens weighing a pound, a rich or particularly enthusiastic one might reasonably spend $1000 on a brand-name 70-200mm f/2.8 lens weighing three pounds, but a 300mm f/2.8 lens costing $3000 and weighing several pounds would for most be a ""white elephant."" Similarly, an f/1.8 or f/2 normal lens is cheap; an f/1.4 normal lens is moderately priced, and an f/1.2 or 1.0 normal lens is extremely expensive though only marginally better for some things. (With digital, sensor size helps increase maximum usable ISO, and decreases depth of field for a given angle of view, at an often-moderate price. A moderately-wide-aperture lens on an APS-C or full-frame DSLR is often more cost-effective than an ultra-fast lens on a smaller-sensor digital camera).


One reason for this is that if something is unlikely to be producible in quantity to sell at a price likely to appeal to many, it has to be sold at a much higher price to a few to amortize development and production costs and with reduced often-desirable features not easily adapted from other systems (such as a lack of autofocus on medium and large-format cameras) to keep this phenomenon from making the price even more disproportionately high. It follows that mass-market or ""enthusiast"" level products are generally the best value by far.
Exotic equipment whose market has shrunk is often enjoyable by hobbyists for cheap prices. For instance, fancy medium-format equipment that professionals have replaced with high-end digital for greater cost effectiveness in high-volume use.

, For some items, increasing effectiveness largely involves increasing size. For instance, a flash basically makes a burst of light, consistent to within a third as much or so (only relatively large changes in overall exposure being noticeable) for other equipment to deal with. This is cheap and even may involve an economy of scale (for instance, only one case to make and device for the salesman to explain). For instance, a big flash. For others, increasing effectiveness largely involves increasing design and precision. This tends to be expensive and involve costs largely allocatable to only the one unusual item. For expensive, a very wide-aperture lens with good quality.


It follows that in this example, adding a flash (perhaps with bounce capability or diffuser) is often a better way than upgrading a lens to improve low-light and action photography.

, This enables learning from mistakes for free and will always be available as a backup. Some are ruggedized and waterproofed, at a much lower marginal cost than other digital cameras.
Next choose a brand of digital SLR. You might choose one that shares lenses with film SLRs, such as Canon, Nikon or Pentax. These have much better low-light performance and faster operation than compact cameras. If you are already an experienced photographer feel free to get only the film SLR, but the digital camera greatly speeds up the learning-from-mistakes process. (If you don't care about film compatibility, and want to avoid vendor-lock-in, choose a Four-Thirds or Micro-Four-Thirds camera, but check reviews for adequate focusing speed because some of them use a greatly – though not always sufficiently – improved version of the ""contrast"" focusing system common in point and shoots rather than the ""phase detection"" system common in SLRs.)

Some cameras, such as Canon, can control multiple flashes at variable ratios from the camera with a very high degree of automation, often with accessories required. This is nice if you contemplate doing a lot of studio-style photography.


The mid-range zoom lens sold with the DSLR is not only adequate for most situations but actually superior due to lightness and cheapness (enabling the camera to be taken out more due to lack of fear of its loss or damage). Buy a cheap but multi-coated UV filter for it (Vivitar Series 1 is a good variety), and a polarizing filter, also coated or multi-coated, for better colors in sunlight and avoiding or accentuating glare from it on glass and water (a ""circular"" polarizer is needed for heavily electronic cameras and is most common; one good variety is Vivitar Series 1 CPL). Make sure it has a lens cap and a lens cap leash so that the cap is likely to be used. The best lens caps are the pinch type with a little hole so that a lens cap leash string can be tied through it. The best leashes are compatible with this tying-on and cling to the lens body (don't put them on a part that moves, so as not to stress it) with elastic.
A flash, particularly one that can be adjusted for bounce flash, greatly improves lighting in many situations by filling in shadows enough to show some detail but not enough to obscure form. One that works with the camera's TTL flash system and exposure compensation is very convenient; one with basic ""thyristor"" automation can serve the same purpose less conveniently for very little money (for fill-flash, set the camera to aperture priority, check that the shutter speed is not too slow or too fast for flash sync, and set the flash to automatically expose for an aperture or two larger than that being used. Bounce flash wastes most of the light so in that case make sure you are well within the maximum automatic flash distance specified for the aperture.)
A tripod is essential for sharp very-low-light photography (as is subject non-motion). Use a self-timer or remote control to avoid bumping the camera. Feel free to use a small aperture and low ISO for good quality. (If using film, avoid settings that would require exposures of more than a few seconds or give a stop or two extra exposure for – or up how to best adjust for--""reciprocity failure"".)
If you often can't back up enough, or like dramatic stretched perspective or broad background views, buy an ultra-wide-angle lens. The widest of these have an angle of view that is rarely filled with something interesting, so there is rarely a need for those with bulging, easily damaged front elements that can't take a filter. (Everything, including lens scratches, is basically somewhat in focus with these, so scratches are not only more likely but more problematic). Protect all your lenses with a UV filter, cap and leash, but polarizers are often not so relevant for wide-angle lenses because the angle of polarization changes across the sky and will give it an odd mottled appearance, and not great for telephoto lenses because they block a lot of light and a high shutter speed is critical for sharpness.
If you often can't get nearly close enough, as is common with sports and wildlife, get a telephoto lens. Focusing speed is important with these subjects and quite variable; check reviews. An extreme telephoto basically requires a tripod for any better sharpness than one would get cropping from a moderate telephoto (since camera shake is magnified); consider whether you want to carry one about before buying.
If you regularly take photos in low light, buy a wide-aperture lens. 50mm f/1.8 lenses are very inexpensive (and good as a ""portrait"" lens on DSLRs); 35mm f/1.8 lenses for crop-sensor DSLRs only are not very expensive; Sigma makes some wider-angle wide-aperture lenses that are not very expensive. If you haven't done so already, buy a flash. Low light is often also such that it leaves a lot of shadows. Also, a flash matched to your camera system will generally have an focus-assist beam built in (it basically projects a red or infrared grid on the subject before the exposure).
If you regularly take photos where extreme detail is important, and are unsatisfied with your DSLR using a decent lens, moderate aperture, and tripod, use a slow film in a film SLR compatible with your lenses, or get a full-frame DSLR or medium-format camera. (If your technique is smearing the DSLR picture by even a single pixel's width, the fancier camera will not improve the picture.) Extreme detail is actually undesirable in pictures of people (they pay a lot to obscure the wrinkles), not very important in most photos due to the type of subject or its overall form and layout being interesting, but nice for subjects such as landscapes where there is both a lot of fine detail, such as leaves, and the detail is pleasurable to look at.
Whatever else you determine to cost-effectively address a recurring deficiency that can't otherwise practically be fixed well enough.

, Put a dab of hot glue on the front of the yellow pipe cleaner right at the cleft in the lily bloom. Take the two sides of the lily bloom (right where you made the slit) and pinch them together in front of the pipe cleaner, pressing them down so that they stick to the hot glue dab. You can add an extra dab of hot glue between the sides to help them stay in place.

, Wrap the top of the pipe cleaner around the base of the yellow pipe cleaner, so that the yellow is completely obscured. Leave the tail of the green pipe cleaner straight, so it resembles a stem.

, Buy a large block of sculpting foam (from a craft shop) or, alternatively, build up the base using pieces of recycled styrofoam that you glue and pin together as described below.



Join the pieces. Use PVA glue (polyvinyl acetate) or Liquid Nails® together with bamboo skewers and fencing wire. Make sure to use a water based glue because other solvents will probably dissolve the styrofoam. Test your glue before proceeding.

, Make sure that the glue has dried and the base is stable before you carve. Remove any skewers and wire. Note that the styrofoam will be covered by 5 cm (2"") or so of concrete, so try not to carve too much detail-- it will most likely be lost.
There are two main ways of carving foam-- heated carver and sharp knife:


The heated carver will give off toxic fumes so please make sure you are in a well ventilated area.
The sharp knife (or box cutter) will make an enormous mess, so be prepared to sweep and vacuum.

, Mix the concrete and sand in a 1:1 ratio-- one part cement to one part sand (by volume). Add a generous squirt of dish washing detergent. (This will make the concrete sticky.) Add water until you have the consistency of mud pies-- a ball will flatten in your hand but not drip through your fingers.

, Take handfuls of the mixture and pat it gently on to the foam base. This may take a little practise, but you will soon get the feel of it.

, After an hour or so, the concrete mixture will start to set and become unworkable.

, Make sure that the sculpture is out of direct sunlight. (Perhaps you could fashion an umbrella shade or hang a shade cloth.) Keep the emerging sculpture moist by squirting with water every hour or so, more often if the weather is hot and dry. This will help the cement cure uniformly and will minimize cracking.

, The concrete will stick better if the previous layer is wet, so use a squirt bottle to moisten each section as you go. You can add commercially available oxides (for colour) to the concrete used for the final coat. As you apply the final layer you can also add little features and details. Objects such as tiles, rocks and marbles can be pressed into the final coat before it sets.

, Allow at least 24 hours and make sure to keep it moist.

, After the sculpture has fully cured, you can further shape it and add detail with a high-speed rotary tool. Make sure that you do not go through the colored layer. (Or have a backup plan just in case you do.) Optionally, the sculpture can either be painted with exterior paint or sealed with clear polyurethane.

Set up your camera on your tripod and get as close as you possibly can to get your subject to fill your frame.
,
Take your pictures and check for correct exposure (things not being lost in shadow, no blown highlights) on your LCD.,
Get the pictures onto your computer and check for focus problems (if you get them, focus manually, or use an even smaller aperture).",How to Photograph Small Things," If you're shooting a digital SLR and you've got the money, go and buy a dedicated macro (1:1) lens for your camera and forget about the rest of this. If you don't, there are other, cheaper options which give pretty reasonable results if you're not looking too hard. Several options exist to shift the lens further from the film plane (which means that you can focus to much closer distances, letting you get closer to your subject than you would otherwise).
All of these cheapskate methods are imperfect; they effectively increase your focal length (which means less light hitting your film or sensor for the same aperture setting on the lens, meaning longer shutter speeds, making it harder to freeze motion and making camera shake a problem). They usually require your lens to be operated fully manually (an old, cheap, manual-focus lens with a manual aperture, such as many M42 lenses, are just about ideal for this). It means operating your lens far outside of the conditions for which it was designed, which will usually mean some optical degradation. You also won't be able to focus to infinity with any of these combinations. Nevertheless, it will result in infinitely better photos than you'll get with a lens you don't own.
(If you're using a compact (point-and-shoot) camera, you can happily ignore all of this; the very short focal lengths and generous depth-of-field of such cameras make them ideal for close-up work, right out of the box.)

A bellows is more useful than any of the improvised methods for moving the lens further forward because it allows you much more precise control over how far you're shifting your lens forward. It also, typically, costs more money. Almost any bellows will be usable on almost any SLR, regardless of lens mount (just use a cheap, glassless adapter), so go for whatever is cheapest.

Some big cameras have built-in bellows.






  An old teleconverter with the optical components removed works fine as a ghetto extension tube.

Extension tubes are a very cheap, though less flexible, way of doing this. You don't even need proper extension tubes to do this; you can, for example, rip the optics out of a bunch of cheap teleconverters and stack these as needed.Alternatively, you can roll your own extension tubes if you're really cheap.

A reversal ring might be sillier than the other methods -- it means working your lens backwards, which may have weird results.
One or more of a set of ""close-up lenses"" can screw in to the filter thread. These are convenient but optically poor (get a cheap used set, which probably won't be any worse than a new set), even compared to lens extensions. If you're stacking them, put the most powerful (biggest number) one on first.;
, This will allow you to use slower shutter speeds, and consequently, lower ISOs (for less noise) and smaller apertures (for more depth of field) The cheapest, plastic tripod will be fine for a compact camera., A few important adjustments will make for much better close-up photos. Don't sweat it if your camera doesn't have any of the settings mentioned. Check your manual (or experiment) if you don't know where to find these settings.




 Macro mode is usually indicated by a flower symbol on the mode dial or elsewhere.

Switch your camera to macro mode if you're using a compact camera. This is usually indicated by a flower icon on your mode dial. Don't use this mode if you're using a digital SLR; on at least some Canon digital SLRs, for example, this will be worse than useless, in that it's more-or-less equivalent to point-and-shoot noob-mode -- disallowing changing the aperture, popping the flash without asking, and so on. Instead, switch it to aperture priority (Av on Canon, A on Nikon) on such cameras (which you'll need to do if you're using any of the improvised-macro-lens methods). If you've got a dedicated macro lens designed for your camera, programmed automatic (P) works fine, too, if it allows you to shift the program.
Kick up the ISO as far as you dare if you're hand-holding. It was said earlier, but don't hand-hold unless you have no choice in the matter. If you have to, a higher ISO will allow you to use smaller apertures than you would otherwise (giving you more depth of field). Set it to the lowest ISO you have if you're photographing things that don't move from a tripod.
A built-in flash isn't usable as-is. The best solution is to use a macro ring flash (and if you're the kind of person that has one, you probably don't need to read any of this). The simplest solution is to turn off the flash. Other things you can try are one or more regular flashes off-camera, connected with cords or wirelessly, aimed at the subject from a distance to avoid overexposure from even their minimum power setting, bouncing flash off a ceiling or card, or even trying to bounce the built-in flash off a card down toward the subject.




 This photo illustrates the extremely shallow depth of field in the macro world.

Set a small aperture on your camera (or lens). Depth-of-field is very shallow, often a few millimeters or less, as you get very close to things. More than likely, you'll want to use the smallest aperture you have; defocus is a much greater worry than the diffraction effects caused by very small apertures (and can be harder to compensate in software). It'll also eliminate any corner dullness, spherical aberration, light fall-off, and some chromatic aberrations that come from shooting most lenses at their widest aperture. Try to arrange your subject in a plane perpendicular to the lens: for instance, generally take a picture of a bug more from the side or top rather than face-on.
Enable your mirror lock-up and self timer, if you're shooting in controlled conditions on a tripod. Mirror lock-up will result in less vibration from your camera's mirror (if you're using a digital SLR), and the self-timer will give physics a chance to damp the camera movement caused by you pressing the shutter button. This will result in sharper pictures, particularly if using a longish exposure without a flash.

,,, Use exposure compensation if you have this problem (or if you're shooting fully-manual, as you may have to with some cameras when using improvised methods, adjust your shutter speeds and apertures manually until it looks right)., Crop your picture as tightly as possible in your favourite image editor. Show your pictures off to the world!"

Mark a dimple in the center of the body cap with the center punch tool.






Using a nail or similar tool is also effective.





;
, Using the center mark that you created in the previous step, drill a hole in the body cap.


Use something under the body cap to protect your working surface if needed.







,


Using a soda can with the top and bottom cut off, cut a 3/4"" (1.9 cm) square to 1"" (2.5cm) square piece. The size does not need to be exact nor exactly square, however the size must be small enough to fit flush inside the body cap yet large enough to hold while sanding.






Round the corners of the square piece for safety.







, Take a sturdy sharp needle, and slowly use a twisting motion with gentle pressure, to make a dimple in the center of the aluminum.


Go slowly and steadily so as not to create a hole that is too large.






The dimple should be just visible on the underside of the aluminum piece.






Do not push the needle all the way through; there shouldn't be a visible hole at this point, only a dimple.

, Using very fine grit wet/dry sanding paper (emery cloth) of 600-800 grain or finer, gently sand the dimple flush with the surface of the aluminum surface.

, Use the needle once more to gently round out the hole (both sides).


The optimum diameter of the pinhole depends on the distance from the pinhole to the film surface (digital sensor). For most (D)SLR cameras that is somewhere around 50mm. Using a pinhole calculator, the optimum pinhole size is apx .3mm. A #13 sewing needle should pass through a .3mm hole but a #12 needle should not.
The size does not have to be exact at any rate, any hole close to .3mm will work just fine.
If the hole is too small, gently use the needle again to enlarge the hole and sand both sides smooth.
If the hole is too large, try the lens to see how well it works, or discard the piece and cut a new one.
What is important is to make the hole as round as possible and to keep the edges smooth and flush with the surface. Jagged edges will cause diffraction effects and show up on the final image., Doing this is important since residue can get in the pinhole and cause image distortions or worse the residue can get on your camera sensor and require a cleaning.

, Using a toothpick, or something equivalent, sparingly spread the adhesive around the edge of the aluminum piece, being careful not to get any adhesive near the pinhole.


Use silicone adhesive as you can easily remove the pinhole from the body cap and remove the adhesive from the body cap if you ever need or want to.

, Make sure to center the pinhole in the drilled hole in the body cap.


Try to be exact when positioning the first time, in order to keep the adhesive from getting all over the body cap and possibly into the pinhole.

, Do a final check to make sure the pinhole is still centered on the hole in the body cap.

,,, Leave the aluminum piece exposed so it can be painted black., This will greatly improve the image quality.

,, The ink sticks better when dotted onto the surface rather than wiped because the aluminum surface has no tooth for the ink to adhere to.


Be careful not to dot over the pinhole. This area does not have to be perfect as it will not reflect as much light as the entire aluminum surface would.







,

Attach the body cap to the camera body.







, Take a photo. Look at the histogram. If the graph indicates that the image is over-exposed (the histogram will show data bunched to the extreme right) or under-exposed (histogram data is bunched to the left), adjust the shutter speed to compensate.


Once the exposure is set you can use this exposure while shooting in similar light conditions.






Depending on how bright the scene is your exposure time may vary from several seconds to just under a second. The yellow flower photo shown here was exposed for 1/2 a second at ISO 400 in full sun.






The sun through the leaves photo was exposed for 1/15 of a second at ISO 400.
If your scene lighting changes, recheck the histogram and adjust shutter speed to compensate.

, In this case, it has been attached using a rubber band. Be sure that you will be able to focus the light onto the subject.

, Having your camera on a tripod is very helpful here, so that there is little movement.

,,, You should have a good depth of field, as evidenced by this image.

"
"
Decide on the size and style you want your tripod to be.,

Create some templates of the appropriate size for what you are making.,

Take an 8 x 5.5 inch (20cm x 14cm) piece and attach it to a 4 x 5.5 inches (10cm x 14cm).,

Create or visualize about a 1/2 inch (1.27cm) seam line and sew there.,

Double sew the seams to make sure that they hold.
,
Continue matching the lengths.,

Do this until all of the seams, except for one short one, are closed.
,

Invert the bag that you have just created.
,
Cut the corner of the bag if the beans are still bagged.,

Determine whether the bag will work as a tripod.,

Sew the beanbag tripod together so that the beans won't fall out.",How to Make a Beanbag Tripod," Some people will choose a round shape, while others prefer a rectangular cube.
, The one shown in the article measures 8 x 5.5 x 4 inches (20cm x 14cm x 10cm). Cut out two templates for each shape., Make sure the outer parts of the beanbag are all touching each other. You will be inverting the beanbag when done., At the corners, be sure that you have a tight seam at the corners.,, For example, match the 4.5 with 4.5 (11.5cm with 11.5cm), etc. Continue to do this until you have formed a cube.,,, Then carefully pour them into the beanbag. If you have a funnel, you can use that, depending on how much this improves the flow., To do this, clip the hole in the beanbag so that the beans can't fall out and use it. If you're pleased with the results, it can be sewn up; if not, make the necessary adjustments first., Remember to take it with you for photo shoots."

Choose a box.,
Secure the bottom of the box with packing tape.,
Lay the box on its side.,
Mark lines about 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside each edge of the box on each side and on the top.,
Using the box cutter, carefully cut along the lines you drew.,
Cut the front flaps off with a box cutter.
,
Cut a section of white fabric (white muslin fabric) or White Nylon and white fleece, large enough to fit over each of the openings you cut.,
Use the box cutter and scissors to remove any stray pieces of cardboard from the front edge of the box.
,
Cut a piece of matte white poster board to fit the inside of your box.,
Insert the poster board into the box, curving it up towards the top of the box.,
Cut matte black poster board in sections large enough to cover the tissue paper areas.,
Add your lighting.,
Take some test shots as you go.,
In the end, your images should come out clean, crisp, and without a ton of gray color throughout.,
Finished.

",How to Create an Inexpensive Photography Lightbox," The size should be appropriate for the the objects you will photograph. You may find that you need to make boxes in various sizes.

, Use more packing tape to secure the bottom flaps inside. This will keep them out of the way.
, Have the opening facing you.
, A standard 12"" (30cm) ruler makes the perfect straight edge and is the right width.
, You can use the ruler as a straight edge to guide your cut. It is not necessary to get the cuts absolutely straight. Notice that the flaps on the front of the box have been left on for now to add stability and make it easier to cut. You may find that taping the front flaps shut makes it easier to cut.
,, Then tape it to the outside of the box using cellophane tape. Start with one layer of fabric. After completing the box and making some test shots, you may find that you need additional layers of tissue paper to achieve the right lighting.
,, The piece should be in the shape of a rectangle, with the width being the same as a side of the box, but the length being twice as long.

, Curve it gently; don't crease it. Trim it if necessary. This will create an infinite, edgeless look for the background of your shots.
, This will allow you to block light from certain directions when taking photographs.
, Photo lights, flashes, and even standard desk lamps can be placed on either side or above the box to produce the desired lighting effect.
, See how well your tissue paper filters and diffuses the light. Add layers of tissue paper as needed. This photo was taken in the example light box, and is not retouched (other than cropping). Now go start taking great photos!
, Take a look at this sample image taken from the box this process built.

Assemble the following items:


2 cups of soap flakes (you can grate your own if needed)
1/2 cup hot water
Powder paint (for coloring, optional)
Aluminum foil
Electric mixer.,
Add hot water to the soap flakes.,
Place the sculpting soap material into a bowl in front of those sculpting.,
Lay down foil for the work surface.,
Sculpt away using just your fingers.,
Leave to dry.",How to Make a Soap Sculpture,";
, Only a responsible person/adult should do this step. Beat using the mixer until it turns stiff. It will cool down during the beating.


If adding the powder paint, do so now.







, Each person sculpting needs to keep dipping his or her hands into a bowl of warm water during sculpting, so provide this within easy reach.

, This makes it easier to work with the soap sculpting medium.

, Make anything you'd like. Good first choices include snowmen, a cat or dog, a turtle, or a mouse. Objects such as sticks, sequins, ribbon, shells, craft pieces, glitter, etc., can be stuck into the sculpture.


Items such as a pine cone can be decorated with this sculpting medium; it looks like snow once dried.
You can use a clay knife or similar if you need to smooth anything out but try to only use your fingers for most of the sculpting work; that's a large part of the creative fun of this project.







, The soap sculpture will dry out quickly in a warm, dry room. Expect a porous texture. It will last for a few weeks.

Finish your Pringles and put the can aside.,
Create a 'door' cut.,
Cut a hole in the plastic lid to match the size of your light source.

,
Push the light through the hole in the lid.

,
Attach the lid to the prepared Pringles can.,
If you need to diffuse this light, put a sheet of paper in the reflector, supported by the top and the bottom 1/2 inch (13mm).

,
Finished.

",How to Create a Pringles Can Light Reflector," You could wash it out, but since it's made from paper, it's best to shake it out first, then wipe it out with a paper towel or two.;
, About 1/2 to 3/4 inches (approx. 13mm to 19mm) from the top and bottom, draw a line across the can. It should go about halfway around the can and then finish with another down the middle of the two lines drawn on the can, to form an ""I"" (see the image).


Make sure that the lines match up on their ends. You will want to open these 'doors' when you use the light.

,,, You can now use the Pringles can light reflector to light your image.

Select a larger sized box.,
Find or purchase a suitable light source.,
Create reflectors for the light.,
Create a way to diffuse the light.,
Assemble the box studio.,
Ready your camera.",How to Create a Box Studio for Your Photography," The most important thing is that it must be sturdy. You can substitute with a reusable containers, but you will have better results using something with a flat bottom. Cut out the front of the box as shown in this image––use a craft knife for ease of cutting.;
, This could be a removable camera flash, a desk lamp, a bright flashlight or something of that nature. An example of a good, portable light source is an LED lamp or flashlight.

, A reflector is a surface used to redirect light towards a given subject for the purpose of photographing it. You can use aluminum foil, white cardboard, white sheets, etc.

, You can make your own very easily using paper or even cotton sheets. Some other materials that will work well include tissue paper, wax paper, shower curtain liners, etc. In this image, an unwanted shower curtain liner has been attached to an empty frame to create a simple and quickly made diffuser.

, Place the items together in readiness for taking your photos. In this screenshot, you will see the following items assembled:


Black background (created from a sturdy mouse pad)
Diffusers (created from a picture frame and a cut piece of a shower curtain liner); the diffuser can become a part of the box by cutting away a piece of the side of the box in the same width as the frame, then taping the frame onto the box
Platform (another picture frame)
A way to raise the platform (a roll of packing tape under frame)
Two light sources (desk lamps).

, It doesn't have to be a fancy camera but you will want a tripod to ensure that your photos are easily repeatable without the lens moving. In this image, note that the camera sits on a mini-tripod and has the diffuser made in an earlier step placed behind it.

Sketch your sculpture.,
Create a base.,
Build an armature.,
Fill in the basic form.,
Move from large forms to smaller ones.,
Add in details.,
Add in textures.,
Cure your sculpture.,
Paint your sculpture.,
Mix media.",How to Make a Sculpture1," Always draw out the sculpture you plan on making first. It doesn't have to be a great drawing, but it should help you get an idea of where everything goes and how the shapes will meet up. Draw the sculpture from multiple angles. You may want to draw a more detailed sketch as well, for areas that are highly detailed.;
, If your sculpture will have a base, it's a good idea to build that first and build the sculpture on the base. The base will be less structurally sound if added later. You can build a base from wood, metal, clay, stone, or any other material you want.

, ""Armature"" is a word sculptors use that just means ""support structure"". It's like the bones for your sculpture. It keeps pieces from breaking off and while not every part of your sculpture will need an armature, it's important for pieces like arms or legs, which move away from the body and are easy breaking points.


Armatures can be made out of thin or thick gauge wire, plumping pipes, pvc pipe, lumber, sticks, dowels, or any other material that works for you.
Generally start with the ""spine"" of the piece and create branches for the ""limbs"". Using your design sketch can be helpful for forming the armature, especially if the sketch was made to-scale.
Anchor your armature in or to your base before continuing.

, Depending on what your sculpture will be made out of, you may want to form an underlayer with a different material. This is most common when sculpting with polymer clay. An underlayer can help reduce materials cost and weight, so consider using one.


Common materials are newspaper, tin or aluminum foil, masking or painter's tape, and cardboard.
Loosely tape or join this filler material to your armature, forming just the basic shapes of your sculpture. You want to leave yourself room to build with your final sculpting material, though, so don't go overboard!

, Start adding on your sculpting material. Start by creating the largest pieces (the ""large muscle groups"") to the smallest ones (the ""small muscle groups""). Go from larger details to smaller ones. Add on and take away material as necessary, but avoid taking away too much material, as it can be difficult to add it back on.

, One the general form seems complete, start blending, carving, and generally creating the finer details. These are items like hair, eyes, the outlines and curve of muscles, fingers, toes, etc. Detail your sculpture until it looks fairly finalized.

, The final step in the actual sculpting is to add textures to your sculpture, if you want to. This is important for creating a more realistic look, but isn't necessary if you want to work in a different style. You can use sculpting tools to add texture or you can create your own from household tools.


With proper tools, the general rule of thump is that the smaller the tip, the finer the detail that tool is meant to create. Looped tools are for scraping off clay and any cutting edge is for pretty much what you would think it would be for.
You can fashion your own tools from tin foil balls, black peppercorns, toothbrushes, toothpicks, necklace chains, ball bearings, combs, sewing or knitting needles, knives, etc.

, You will need to bake your sculpture or allow it to dry, whichever is appropriate for the material you chose. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your material.

, If you want your sculpture to be painted or colored, do so after baking. You may need to use special paints, depending on the material you chose. Painting polymer clay, for example, requires model enamel paint.

, You can create extra interest for your sculpture by mixing media. This can make it seem more real or add interesting color and texture to a piece. Consider things like using real fabric for clothing, or using fake or real hair instead of sculpting the hair.

",How to Create a Lightbox from a Cardboard Box," Mark out where you will be cutting. You will want to leave yourself 1.5 to 2 inches (3.81cm to 5cm) on each side.;
, It is up to you whether or not to cut the third side. Cut out at least three sides of the box.

, The material in this screenshot is a very inexpensive shower curtain liner. Continue doing this for at least three of the sides. The fourth side will need to remain open.

, This image has white poster board taped together. Admittedly, the image here is not the best look but it gives you the idea; check out the introduction image for a smoother finish.

Collect the items needed to complete this project.,
Find some suitable elasticized fabric.

,
Measure the circumference of the camcorder lens or whatever mounting point the light will attach to.,
Using the glue gun, put a dollop of glue on the edge of the elastic strip.,
Hold this in place till glue hardens, approximately 20 seconds.

,
Follow this wiring diagram for the next steps.,
Please read the ""Warnings"" section below before continuing with the next steps.

,
Plan out the light circuit before soldering.

,
Solder the resistor to the positive terminal on the first LED.,
Test the circuits by touching the positive lead (the end with the resistor) to the positive side of the battery and the negative lead (the negative side of the second LED) to the negative side of the battery.,
Solder on the wires (see ""Things You'll Need"" below for sizing).

,
Cover all the connections in glue to prevent the electrical components from touching and arcing.,
Glue the three sets of lights equally around the elastic strap that you created earlier.

,
Combine all the wires coming from the light circuits (there should be 3 positive wires and 3 negative wires).,
Solder the negative wire to the negative end of the battery connector.

,
Solder the positive end to one end of the switch.,
Solder the positive wire of the battery connector to the other end of the switch.,
Test the soldering by plugging in the battery and turning on the switch.,
Cover all the connections in glue for weather proofing.,
Try it out!

",How to Build an LED Camcorder Light," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
,, Then measure the same for the elasticized fabric.


Cut the elastic to the measurement. Be sure to add a couple centimeters or inches to your measurement to compensate for overlap.

, Overlap the two edges while forming a circle.

,,


Note that the colourful stripes on a resistor denote its value. For a 470 ohm the stripes on the left side of the resistor are yellow, purple, black, black and on the right side brown.
When measuring out the wires, make you have enough slack to make it around the whole lens and then some.

,,, Continue to solder the link from the negative terminal on the first LED to the positive terminal on the second LED.


This is the series circuit. Repeat this for all the series circuits, there are three. Refer back to the wiring diagram.

, If the light comes on, the lights are wired properly. If they do not, check your solder connections.

,, This will also weatherproof your light.

,, With these wires striped twist them into each set of three into one. Now there should be two wires. This completes your series circuit.

,, Refer to the picture in step 14.

, Refer to the picture in step 14.

, All the lights should illuminate. If not, double check your soldering.

Find the rotation/pivot point by doing the test described in the External Link below.,
Cut a piece of wood for the base.,
Cut the side.,
Line up the two four inch edges so that the side is sitting on top of the base to form an “L” (see the picture above).,
Drill a hole near the center of the base.,
Make the hole in the side about 4 1/2 to 5 inches above the base – your camera will need room to swing downwards when you’re shooting a picture of the sky.,
Cut the arm.,
Drill a hole at one end for the arm to attach to the side piece where it will pivot.,
Attach the arm to the side by using a flathead machine screw .,
(Optional) Cut a piece of wood about the size of the base for the swivel, preferably big enough so it sticks out a bit – that will allow you to put markings on it so you can see how many degrees you’ve swiveled.,
Install a socket or insert nut as described in Step 5 for the base section.,
Sand all the parts.,
Use your new panoramic tripod (and some software) to take gorgeous pictures.

,


",How to Build a Panoramic Tripod Head,";
, Use a piece of very flat, thick (5/8” or so) oak plywood or a plank of hardwood. Make it about 5” by 4” (12 cm x 10 cm).

, To make sure the camera has enough clearance when you swing it down, make the tripod a little over five inches tall. The width would be the same four inches as the base.

, Drill holes up through the bottom of the base into the side and screw the two together. A little glue and maybe some bracing might help – the less flex the better.

, The exact distance from the side is critical as it will need to run through the center of the lens. So place your camera on a table and measure the height from the table to the center of the lens. This is the distance the hole in the base needs to be from the side.
If you’re not using a swivel under the base, you’ll need a fairly large hole here, as you’ll need to install a socket (or “insert nut”) so the tripod can screw into the tripod head. The dimensions of that socket will depend on your tripod – if you’re planning to mount this to the screw that normally attaches to the camera, you want a “1/4-20” socket.

, It also needs to be in the same plane as the hole in the base. In other words, if you’re looking at the unit from the side, the side hole will appear directly above the base hole.

, To figure the length, start with that previously measured distance between the entrance pupil and the screw socket determined in step 1 – this distance is shown in green (it will be different for every camera). Add between a half inch and an inch on either side. The width need only be a couple inches.

, Drill another hole 4 1/8 inches (or whatever your measurement is) down the arm towards its other end. This last hole is where the camera attaches, so it needs to be 1/4"" wide. Insert a 1/4-20 thumbscrew through this hole (1/4-20 means 1/4” wide, with a thread pitch of 20, which is the most common pitch).

, You may have to gouge out a bit of the hole in the arm so the full head can sink into the arm and not hit your lens. Push the screw through the arm, then through the side, then use a washer and a wingnut to secure it.

, Drill a hole through the center of it, and push a flat head machine screw through it, then through the hole in the base. As with the hole in the arm, you will probably need to gouge out the hole in the swivel a bit so you can prevent the head from sticking out – that surface will need to be flush with the tripod. Secure the screw with washer and wingnut.

, Position it as near as possible to the center to maximize stability.

, To finish things up, you can varnish, seal or paint, but don’t get any of it on the rotating surfaces – they’ll stick every time you adjust the arm or swivel. Attaching a small level is highly recommended.
