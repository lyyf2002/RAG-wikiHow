Make a sculpture sketch.,
Carve the basic form.,
Use a pointing machine.,
Carve in the details.,
Sand down your sculpture.,
Done!",How to Make a Sculpture2," Start by making a clay, wax, or other fast version of your sculpture. This will be used as a ""sketch"". You will take measurements from it and use those to carve the stone or other sculpting material.

, You can take basic measurements from you sculpture and mark the stone or wood where you know it will need to be cut. For example, if you know your sculpture isn't going to be more than 14 inches (35.6 cm) high, you can cut away all material above 15 inches (38.1 cm). Leave some room for movement but certainly carve out the basic shape of your sculpture.

, Using a pointing machine or other measuring device, begin to measure your sculpture ""sketch"" and make the same locations and depths on your stone or wood.

, Using tools appropriate for your material, begin to chip away at the material and even out the points that you made using the pointing machine.

, Using gradually finer and finer sandpaper, sand down your sculpture until it is as smooth as you want it to be.

, Add any final extra details that you want and enjoy your sculpture.

Cut a hole in the body cap of your camera.,
Cut a hole in the metal bottom of an empty Pringles can.,
Glue the body cap onto the Pringles can with super glue.

,
Let it dry, and clean off excess glue.

,
Line the inside of the Pringles can with black paper.,
Put your lens into the other side of the Pringles can, REVERSE!,
Attach the whole thing to your camera, with the body cap.

,
Take pictures in manual mode.",How to Create a DIY Extreme Macro Tube," (It is assumed that you keep a lens on it and aren't using it any longer). The hole should be big enough to let enough light in to the camera-body when taking a picture.


Better yet, get a cheap aftermarket body cap and cut that up, keeping your original body cap for protecting the body and possibly adding value if you sell it.






Be careful that the hole stays small enough so that the systems that locks the body cap on your camera body stays intact!





;
,

Try a short Pringles can for roughly 1:1 magnification (the picture covers an area about the size of a postage stamp); a long one for significantly greater magnification and more difficult use.
The hole must be a little smaller than the hole in the body cap, so that the body cap can fit perfectly on to the Pringles can.

,,, Since the inside of the can is made of reflective material, you get nasty lighting on your pictures if you don't do this.

, Wrap a small piece of cloth around the lens, so that it fits snug into the can.

,, Remember that because the lens itself isn't attached to your camera, you'll lose autofocus and aperture control. Focus by physically getting closer to or further away from the subject, and control the aperture manually by the lever on the lens.

Go through the dirt and remove any rocks, roots, and any other non-dirt materials.,
Take about half the dirt and slowly mix in the water.,
Take some of the mud in your hands and begin to shake it.,
While doing this begin to shape it into a sphere.

,
Repeat 3-4 until it begins to get tacky.

,
Hold the ball in one hand and dirt in the other.,
Repeat step 6 until it starts to really hold its shape.,
Put the ball in a plastic bag until water condenses on the bag then repeat 6 times.

,
Keep repeating steps 6 and 8 until it gets about as hard as leather.

,
Now you can put the ball in a fridge to accelerate the condensation and repeat 6 and 8 again.,
Dry out the rest of the dirt, then put it in a Tupperware.,
Repeat 11 until the dorodango feels powdery.,
Repeat 11 as many times as you can, the more you do it the better your ball comes out.

,
Let it dry for at least 20 minutes.

,
Get a very soft cloth, and slowly begin to rub the dorodango.","How to Make a Hikaru Dorodango, or Shining Ball of Mud"," Usually this can be done with a window screen or kitchen sifter.;
, The amount of water you use varies, but the mud should be thick, like dough. Usually, you should have more dirt than water.

, This gets out air bubbles and brings tiny clay like particles to the surface.

,,, Begin to sprinkle the dirt onto the soft ball of mud, and then smooth the surface/wipe some of the dirt off.

, It should not crack.

,,, At this point you can just let it dry out, but if you want it to shine keep going.

, Shake the Tupperware and fine dirt particles will stick to the sides. Roll the Dorodango on this.

, Then put it in another bag.

,,, When it gets smooth you can start rubbing faster and harder. If you rub too much, you'll go though the layer of fine dirt; not enough, you don't polish it.

Choose an item from which to make your mold.,
Clean and dry the item you wish to duplicate.,
Set the item on a surface to act as a flange.,
Brush on a thin layer of liquid latex.,
Brush on more layers of latex.,
Add reinforcing material.,
Allow the mold to dry overnight or longer once complete.,
Peel off the mold.,
Build a support stand for the mold.,
Cast your item using any casting medium.",How to Make a Latex Mold," You can cast a latex mold over almost anything. Some people mold rocks, plants, and masks. The one caveat here is that you cannot apply the latex over someone’s skin. The latex will seal the skin from the air and cause damage to the skin., Dirt, dust, and other contaminants can interfere with your mold. Clean the item with an appropriate cleaner such as soap and water (this may vary from item to item). Before creating the mold, make sure that you dry the object or allow it time to air dry., Choose a flat, wide work surface. This will allow you to apply your mold beyond the edge of the object you wish to capture and form an outer flange. This flange will be useful when you are filling your mold in the future., Go a couple centimeters past the items edge to create a flange. This first layer will be the mold surface so ensure that there are no air bubbles. Allow this layer to dry for about 30 minutes., Allow each layer to dry before applying the next. More layers of latex will yield a stronger mold. For very small items, four or five layers may be sufficient. Larger items may need ten or more layers.Do not allow the latex to dry overnight between layers. This will cure the mold and cause subsequent layers not to bond properly.

, If you are molding a larger item, you may need some extra materials to produce a sturdy mold. Loosely woven fabric such as gauze works well. Wet it with latex and apply to areas that are likely to stretch out of shape when the mold is filled with casting medium. Avoid reinforcing areas that will need to stretch to facilitate the item's release from the mold.The mold is likely to stretch and deform near the bottom of the mold (which is likely the top of the object). This is because it has to support most of the weight of your casting material.

, This process is called curing. Only cure the mold once you have added all of the layers necessary. When cured, the latex will be unable to bond with subsequent layers. It will also be more resilient to environmental things (water, air, etc.)., The latex should be very durable and can be peeled right back inside-out. Then just pop it back to it's original shape. If you have an intricate object, you may have to pull and stretch some parts of the mold to release it. Be careful not to tear the mold or break your original object when separating the two., For most items, it is best to support the mold just under the flange so that it is suspended. Larger items may require extra support such as a wooden box to keep it in the proper shape when filled. You can also use a medium like sand to reinforce the mold all over.By placing your mold in sand, the weight of the casting material is supported evenly by the sand. This holds the mold in place and prevents stretching and deforming. Be careful not to get sand into your resin or plaster.

, Plaster of Paris is probably the easiest. It can be painted later. That said, polyester resin or similar polymers will reproduce very fine details in your item. Choose your casting medium to fit your needs."

Decide how you want to create your sculpture so it looks good.,
Hollow out your sculpture.,
Keep your creation uniform to prevent shrinkage and cracking.,
Use plastic sheets and bags to keep the work wet while building, and to control drying speed.,
Reassemble individual pieces by scoring both ends of reattached pieces and using adhesive mud.,
Roll out coils with fingers, usually starting from the center and working both hands away from each other.,
Roll out slabs with a rolling pin.,
Create texture in innumerable ways such as rolling clay on burlap, branding with all sorts of implements, carving, using imprint tools.

,
Finish the piece.",How to Do Ceramic Sculpture," Sculpture can be created by piecing together things thrown on the wheel, by the use of coils and slabs, using a mold, by making solid objects out of clay, or any combination thereof.;
, Clay cannot be fired solid, and should only be usually no more than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick in any place. You can use ceramic trimming tools to scrape and dig out the clay while still retaining a strong wall.

, Different thickness of clay will shrink at different rates, so most parts of a single piece should be of roughly the same thickness.

, Water can be added at any time with various sizes of sponges. Red iron clay tends to dry slower, have a lot of strength, and is very workable.

, Dried, reused clay soaked and dissolved in water can be used as adhesive for attaching parts.


For instance, use a wide-mouth gallon size plastic jar as a base mold and let water evaporate and clay congeal to a thick, axle-grease consistency. This may take a few weeks. The adhesive clay is then applied to both ends after scoring and is pressed together. With a wooden tool, the edges are mashed together both inside and out, then covered with stiff working clay for strength. When the piece is reassembled, all exterior joints are contoured for the final finish. This is then dried slowly, the bigger and thicker pieces taking up to two or three weeks. If the hollowed walls are done unevenly, with curved trimming tools leaving lots of ribbing, the pieces may warp and not end up being smooth.

, When joining coils lengthwise for pots, they can be scored and applied together with adhesive clay. However, the inside should normally be mashed together for strength. Coils are especially vulnerable to separation on the bottom.

, For even rolling, line the clay between two strips of material such as plywood, the thickness of which is the same as with the intended slab. The ends of the rolling pin, when rolled on the strips, should then flatten the clay to that exact width. Slabs will tend to considerably warp in the fire. Interior ceramic bracing may be necessary to mute this. Plaster used as a working surface will tend to dry out the clay. Find a non-stick surface such as raw wood.

,, Ceramic sculpture can be glazed, painted with stains, or fired and then painted with acrylics or oils or any combination thereof. Sculpture too big for the kiln can made in pieces to be fitted together after firing. Allowance must be made for attachment in the interior and the ability to cover and color the cracks so they do not show. Ceramic sculpture is delicate and subject to breakage.

Choose a bar of soap.,
Get a knife.,
Cover your work area.,
Decide on the subject.,
Scrape off the brand name.,
Draw an outline.,
Slice away the outside portions.,
Begin detail work.,
Polish the soap.,
Use scented soap.,
Create layered flowers.,
Make a character profile.",How to Make a Soap Carving," Any soap will do, but the harder the soap, the more difficult it will be to cut. On the other hand, if it is soft instead of firm, it will be more likely to crumble. Rectangular soap is easier to cut for beginners than round soap. The color you use is up to you and your project idea.Inexpensive ivory soap is good for practice.;
, A carving or paring knife is perfect for whittling down the soap into a basic shape. Soap is often soft enough that kids can use butter knives, plastic knives, spoons, or popsicle sticks. For detail work, you may wish to get a finer knife such as a detailing knife or substitute in an orangewood stick or toothpick., Spread newspaper out over the area where you’ll do the carving. When you’re finished, you’ll be able to wrap up the newspaper to easily remove the soap fragments. Another option is to hold the soap over a bowl as you work.








, What you make out of the soap is only limited by your imagination. Experienced carvers make highly-detailed flowers and animals. For beginners, choose a block shape such as a turtle, fish, or heart. These patterns fit the shape of the soap bar and don’t require much detail work.

, Your soap bar may have letters on one side of it. To get it off, place the soap under warm, running water. This makes the soap less firm so you can use a sponge or a knife to wear away the top layer. Rub off bits of soap until the surface is smooth.








If you don’t mind these letters showing a little on your design or on the back of your carving, you can skip this step.

, You can use a pencil to make the outline or you can etch the outline into the soap using a knife, orangewood stick, or toothpick. This basic outline shows you what parts of the soap you need to remove.







, These cuts can be roughly done, but the soap may crumble if you try to go too fast. Slice off the edges of the soap, starting at one of the corners. Cut down to your line so that your soap forms the basic shape of your design.








Try using the knife as you would when peeling a potato, keeping it between your finger and thumb and pulling it forward through the soap.

, At this point, you may want to switch to a pointed knife, orange wood stick, plastic fork, toothpick, or other sharp, precise instrument. Work from the middle of the bar and drag the implement to scrape out small details such as eyes, scales, and petals.







, Carefully use your fingers or a paper towel to remove any soap shavings left on the surface. Use as little pressure as possible. The soap will be fragile if you added a lot of details. Wet your finger and rub the surface to create a smoother finish. Let the soap dry for a day if you do this.








, Once you obtain scented soap, you can add some flair. For pineapple-scented soap, cut the soap into the shape of a pineapple. This is a simple way to practice carving and the design shows exactly what kind of soap you have.








, Instead of cutting out a simple block shape, use detail work to create more elaborate designs. To achieve three-dimensional flower carvings, for example, use a sharp carving tool. Create the middle of the flower in the center of the soap and shave away excess soap as you move outwards and sculpt thin petals.







, While you can opt to create the whole character out of soap, you can also emphasize the head and upper torso. Similar to the flower, you won’t have to start by cutting away the soap. Instead, start in the center and create an outline. You can scrape away layers on the top surface outside the outline to make this profile picture stand out more. Etch details with a sharp tool.Since the face and upper body are enlarged, you have more of an opportunity to emphasize a character through precise details, such as lines for the hair, lips, and clothing.

Measure the inside of your oven.,
Have a mold ready to use.,
Make adjustments appropriate to the specifications of your project.,
Measure the size of the of the overall piece you need.,
Mark the shape with a black felt tip pen.,
Place the plastic sheet on a cookie sheet and place in an oven set to 250 F. Wait about 10 minutes for it to warm fully.,
Put on your gloves when you work with the plastic.,
The first step is to cut any curves, corners, cutouts, etc.,
Once it's cut to form, place back into the oven and raise the temperature to no more than 275 F. At 300 F. it will begin to stick to the cookie sheet.,
Pull the plastic out and quickly press onto or into the mold that's ready.,
Quickly dunk into cold water to cool and set the piece.

,
If there is a mistake, reheat and start over again.

,
Final check.",How to Easily Mold Acrylic Plastic Sheets," As you'll need to put the plastic sheet into the oven, this is your size limitation.;
, The example here is the outside of a mold, but it can work inside, too.

, The only major variable that can affect the forming process is the thickness of the plastic sheet. This article uses a sheet about 1/4"" thick, so all times are about 10 to 15 minutes per step. For thicker sheets, it will take longer, and for thinner sheets, it will take less time. Modify the timing as necessary.

, Make sure the sheet is just big enough for the form. Use a plastic cutting knife to cut the sheet down to the general overall size.

, This should include any interior cutouts, corners, etc.

, When it's ready you'll find it flexible when you try to pick it up.

, It's hot and will burn you if you're not careful.

, using the heavy shears or scissors. You'll have about 2 minutes before it cools and hardens too much to cut. If it gets too hard, put it back in the oven to warm up again.

, Above that temperature it can melt and/or begin to bubble.

, use your fingers and firm pressure to press into any corners, fold, bends, etc. Continue to hold and press into shape until it begins to harden.

,,, If there are a few curves or bends that need correcting, you can turn on a burner on low to pass the piece back and forth over to SLOWLY heat it up for localized bends.

Take apart the hanger.,
Get an appropriate block of wood, 2-inches X 4-inches or 4-inches by 4-inches .

,
Drill two holes into your block.,
Stick the ends of the hanger into two of the holes.,
Cut the panty hose.,
Pull the panty hose over the hanger once you have your base sculpture.,
Paint over the panty hose with white glue or acrylic plaster.,
Paint over the dry glue with acrylic paint.",How to Make a Panty Hose Sculpture," The size of the hanger will determine the size of the sculpture, so choose wisely. However, the color of the hanger doesn't affect the sculpture at all.;
,, The depth of the holes should be about a quarter of an inch (a little more than half a centimeter). You can draw two, but draw four if you're planning on using two hangers.


Keep the holes small, so that the end of the hanger will be able to fit in it snugly without coming out.
Decide where to put the holes. They can be any length apart, but their distance will have an effect on the sculpture. If you want a thin sculpture, put them closer together.
Have them at least three inches (7.62 cm) apart from each other to make the hosiery snug.

, The holes don't need to be across from each other any certain way. You can make them side by side or across. Make sure the hanger is snugly in the holes and won't come out.


Once it's snug, bend and twist the hanger into the shape you want. The curves in the hanger will give you the basic shape of your sculpture.
If you're feeling ambitious, you can add a second hanger for the other two holes to design your shape. You can either cover the extra pair of holes or just don't punch those.
Remember that you'll usually see the outline of the hanger, so consider where you put all the wire curving and shaping in places so the panty hose is stretched by the wire; then you will see the hanger or hangers as curved edges.
Once you have the hanger in the right position, use a glue gun or use e6000 glue on the ends of the hanger that go into the holes. This will help keep it secure.

, Cut it so the part where the panty hose closes for your foot is about one foot (30 cm). Throw out the side that is open on both sides.

, It's very hard to modify the sculpture after this step, so make sure you have it the way you want it before hand. Pull the panty hose over the hanger, and over the wooden block.


Try to make the panty hose as tight as possible without causing a run. Once you have it at the bottom of the block, there will be a few inches of unused panty hose hanging.
Don't cut this off yet, however, or the panty hose will come loose.

, You don't need to glob it on, just put a layer over the panty hose.


You need to paint anything that's covered by the panty hose, even the block. Don't paint the bottom, however.
Once the white glue is dry, you can cut the extra panty hose off of the bottom. The sculpture is now secure.

, Try colors like silver and gold. Shiny colors work best for this. Completely cover everything except for the bottom of the block. Don't paint it on too heavily. Let it dry for a day or two, and you're done!

Purchase plaster bandages that are approved to use on skin.,
Set up your workspace.,
Help your model feel comfortable.,
Ask the model to undress when she's ready.",How to Make a Plaster Cast of a Lady's Derriere1," Plaster bandages can be purchased from art stores, or in large quantities from a hospital supply store. Plaster bandages are made to be used in body casting, unlike traditional Plaster of Paris powder or similar materials, which can be extremely dangerous.Don't assume anything is skin safe. Check the packaging and read any instructions thoroughly.
You can buy plaster casting kits that include lubricant and sometimes a drop cloth. Many are marketed toward pregnant women to cast their bellies, but it will work fine for your purposes.Trim the bandages to about 8 inches (200 mm) in length so they will be easier to work with.If the bandages are wide (6 inches or more), fold them in half lengthwise. You'll have an 8x3 inch double layer of bandage to work with.;
, You'll want a hard surface, like a tile floor or sturdy table, for your model to stretch out and hold a stable position. Avoid rooms with carpeting--the plaster will ruin the carpet if there are any spills or drips. Place a waterproof drop-cloth over the area where you will be working. If your model is going to be on a table, you may want to spread a tarp on the table and the floor beneath. This will protect your furniture and make cleanup a snap.Make sure you have access to a shower or bath so the model can rinse off after you have removed the caste.Check the temperature of the room. If you can control the heat, you will want the room to be very warm so your model doesn't get cold when she disrobes. If you don't have access to the temperature controls, bring in a space heater to create a suitable environment.If you use a tarp to cover your workspace, look for one with some texture. It can become very slippery when wet and may make it difficult for your model to hold her pose., She might feel nervous or embarrassed at first, so it's important to run through the process with her beforehand. Knowing what to expect may ease her mind and increase her confidence. Let her know you will halt the process at any time if she begins to feel uncomfortable.Your model's comfort and safety should be your first concern.


Keep things professional, but don't be cold. You will be spending a lot of time with her, and she will be in a vulnerable position, so it is essential you develop a good rapport.Have the model try out the pose you want to for the cast. She can decide if it's a pose she can hold for 30 minutes, and you can see if it's really the pose you want or if you need to make any adjustments., It is very difficult to remove dried plaster from fabric, so she may want to disrobe entirely.Otherwise, she may want to wear an old bra or bikini top or an old t-shirt she can roll up so it doesn't interfere with the cast, but still keeps her chest and shoulders covered and warm.


If your model is still concerned about getting cold, she can wear socks, leg warmers, or a knit hat, too, since these areas are nowhere near the area you will be casting.
Your clothes will likely get covered with plaster, so make sure you're wearing something you plan to throw out or don't mind ruining.

"
"
Cover the skin you plan to cast with a thick layer of petroleum jelly or olive oil.Allow the model to apply the lubricant between her legs and anywhere else she might not feel comfortable with you touching.It is important to have a barrier between the skin and the bandages, as this will keep hair and skin from sticking to the plaster, making it painful to remove.,
Position your model on the table and provide adequate support.If the pose requires her to prop herself up on her elbows, put pillows underneath her chest so she has some support.,
Dip the bandages in a large bowl of warm water, one at a time.,
Start from the thighs and begin laying strips down one at a time, overlapping and working your way up the body.You must work as quickly and efficiently as possible, as the plaster becomes stiff in under 10 minutes and new strips will no longer adhere to the dried bandages.Lay down your strips in different directions, either alternating between horizontal and vertical, or in criss-crossing diagonals.,
Layer the bandages as you go.,
Allow the plaster to harden.,
Loosen the edges of the dried cast, then gently lift it off the model's body.,
Let the cast continue to dry.",How to Make a Plaster Cast of a Lady's Derriere2,"


After your model finishes with the petroleum jelly, apply a thick layer over the back of her upper thighs, her buttocks, and her lower back (or as high as you want the cast to reach).Make sure the coat of petroleum jelly is smooth and there aren't any long hairs poking out.
Your model may wish to shave or trim her pubic hair before you begin, just to make sure nothing gets caught in the plaster.
For extra protection, your model can use a plastic wrap to cover her her anus and labia, protecting them from the wet plaster., If one leg must be lifted slightly, use a phonebook to prop the leg up.


If you pose her in too difficult or uncomfortable a position, you may be forced to stop before the plaster has dried. Try to find a pose that fits your artistic vision and takes her comfort into consideration, too., Do not leave the bandages in the water to soak--the plaster will come off and the bandages won't stick. Slide the wet bandage between your middle and index finger to wipe off excess water. Be careful not to wipe off the plaster as well.Make sure the water is warm so it will be less shocking when you place it on your model's skin.It is quite helpful to have an assistant wetting the plaster bandages and handing them to you, as you will have to work very quickly once the process has begun.
Don't let the water get too white or milky with plaster, or your bandages may separate later., This will make it less likely your cast will have holes or leaks.Use your hands to gently smooth any air bubbles out and releasing them from the sides of the bandage.Don't press too hard on the wet bandages or you may create dimples that will affect your finished mold., Instead of covering the entire area with bandages and then starting again with a second layer, you want to be covering each area with at least three layers as you move up the body. Let the different layers criss-cross and weave over each other so the cast will be tightly sealed, strong, and firm.To prevent the edges from breaking when you remove the cast, make the edges at least six layers thick., This should take no more than 10 or 15 minutes, and you can begin cleaning up while you wait.Tap the cast gently to test if it has hardened--it will sound firm and will feel dry., The cast will be difficult to remove--there will still be tiny hairs stuck in the plaster, despite the petroleum jelly.Though it feels hard, the cast is actually quite delicate, so be very careful as you lift it.Ask the model to wiggle slightly, as this may help loosen the plaster from her skin.Make sure you have a robe or clean, dry clothes for the model to put on immediately.

, To avoid damaging the mold, you can place it on a soft surface, with the hollow side down.You can also tie a string around the cast and hang it from a hangar or a nail in the wall.Cover the completely dried cast with an oil-based varnish to strengthen it and prevent mold.Once dry, your plaster mold is ready for use.

"
"
Inspect the inside of the cast for any holes or cracks that might allow plaster to escape when you pour it the mold.Repair these cracks by smoothing them over with a little wet plaster or clay.,
Spray the inside of the cast with oil soap.,
Mix up a few pounds of plaster in a large bucket.,
Place your plaster cast on a flat surface or somewhere it will remain steady while you pour the mold.,
Pour the liquid plaster into the cast.,
Allow the plaster to harden for at least 30 minutes.,
Remove the plaster from the mold.",How to Make a Plaster Cast of a Lady's Derriere3,"


Use sandpaper to buff away any ragged edges or bumps.
You may want to file the top, bottom, and sides of the cast so they are even and represent the exact area of the body you wish to mold. So if you accidentally placed the bandages too high on your model's back, you can now file the plaster back down.

, This will create a barrier between the plaster cast and the liquid plaster, allowing you to remove your sculpture with ease., You'll have to estimate the amount it will take to fill the cast. Make sure you follow the directions on the package.Pour the powder plaster into the bucket and then add water, mixing vigorouslyScrape the bottom and sides of the bucket so that all the powder is incorporated into the water and you have no lumps., You want the freedom to tip it slightly so you can distribute the filling evenly, but you don't want it to tip over, either.Try placing it on the ground, hollow side up, and wrapping an old blanket around it for a little support.

, Pour slowly, as this will decrease the chance of air bubbles. Gently shake the cast and tap the bottom of the cast to release any air bubbles that may have formed., It will heat up significantly as it dries. You'll know it's ready when it's once again at room temperature.Only test the temperature of the plaster when it has clearly hardened, so you don't get any on your skin.

, You can smooth any creases, rough edges, or lumps with sandpaper. Paint or display the finished cast as you see fit.

Also, make sure that the shirt comes down to your hips. Don't wear a baggy t-shirt as it will create too much bulk.You won't be able to salvage this shirt. You will cover it with tape an cut it up.;
, Tear off a sheet of plastic wrap and fold it until it's the same height as your neck. Gently wrap it around your neck. Tuck the two ends under the front color of your shirt so that no skin is showing. You will eventually be taping up your neck as well, so you need to protect the delicate skin there.If you don't have plastic wrap, you can use paper towels instead., Make sure that you wrap it firmly so that it conforms to your figure, but not so tightly that you can't breathe.If you are male, wrap the tape just under your pecks.
You will need to have someone help you during this step, and for the rest of the steps in this part.

, Lay down one piece of tape so that it goes from your left shoulder down to the underside of your right breast. Lay down a second piece of tape so that it goes from your right shoulder down to the underside of your left breast. You should be left with an X-shape, with the center being between your breasts., Lay down a strip of tape across your left shoulder. Bring one end down across your left breast towards the horizontal strip of tape. Bring the other end down across your back. Continue adding strips of tape until you reach the edge of your shoulder.Overlap each piece of tape by ½-inch (1.27 centimeters).
Repeat this step for the right shoulder and breast.

, Tear off smaller strips of tape. Lift up your arms, and lay them down across your ribcage horizontally. Be sure to cover the gape between your armpit and the horizontal strip of tape. Again, overlap the strips by ½-inch (1.27 centimeters).

, You should now have a V-shaped gape on your chest and back. Tear off more strips of tape, and lay them across your back and chest. If you have a low-cut shirt, make sure that your chest is covered by plastic wrap or paper towel., Wrap 1 to 2 strips of tape loosely around your neck.Use smaller strips to fill in any gaps showing through.

, Keep wrapping the tape in rows, overlapping each one by about ½-inch (1.27 centimeters). Stop when you reach the bottom hem of your shirt.

, Have a person you trust help you cut down the back of your duct tape shirt, from top to bottom. Make sure that they cut through the duct tape, shirt, and plastic wrap layers., You should now have a body-double made out of duct tape. If anything became dented on the mannequin during this step, such as a beast, use your fingers to gently push it back out.

, Place the cut ends together so that they match up. Cover them with a strip of duct tape to seal the gap.For extra security, apply tape to both the inside and outside of the shirt.

, Take a look at the top and bottom edges of the mannequin. If you are happy with them, leave them be. If they look ragged or jagged, touch them up with more tape.


Consider cutting the top edge of the neck down at a slight, downward angle to mimic a real mannequin. Make sure that you still have some neck left, however!

, If you need to, cover the neck hole with a few strips of duct tape so that the stuffing doesn't come out the other end. Keep stuffing until the mannequin feels full and firm. You will need about two bags of polyester stuffing.

, Stand the mannequin upright on a sheet of cardboard of foam board. Trace around the mannequin using a marker. This will eventually make the bottom of your mannequin.

, Make sure that you cut just inside the lines that you drew. Make your cuts smooth and precise.

, Turn the mannequin upside down. Set the cardboard base into the bottom of the mannequin. Fold short pieces of duct tape over the edges of the cardboard onto the bottom edge of the mannequin. If you want to, you can cover the entire bottom of the cardboard with more duct tape so that it matches the rest of your mannequin., Trace the neck opening onto a sheet of cardboard. Cut the circle out. Set it down on top of the neck. Secure it with strips of tape, all the way around. Cover the top of the cardboard with more tape, if desired.

, Choose a sturdy, metal stand, such as a lamp post. Trace the top of the metal stand against the bottom of the mannequin. Cut the hole out, then set the mannequin on top of the stand. Seal the seam between the edges of the hole and the stand with hot glue.For extra security, use epoxy or an industrial-strength glue instead.
If you are using a lamp post, make sure that you cut away any wires so that you are just left with the metal stand.

, The easiest way to do this would be to find another fitted shirt, and place it over the mannequin. You can also sew a fitted, corset-like cover for it using cotton or jersey fabric."

Go with a “toy” for expendability.,
Start with a cheap “hobby-grade” helicopter for longevity.,

Come up with a training schedule.,
Practice inside at first.,
Stay low and nearby in the beginning.,
Start with basic maneuvers.,
Be slow and steady with your controls.,
Practice higher elevations bit by bit.,
Inspect the helicopter after each crash.,
Pay attention to how your helicopter sounds.",How to Start off With Flying RC Helicopters," As a beginner, it is very likely that you’ll crash your helicopter at some point, so just take that as a given and start off with something that you won’t mind banging up. Choose a “toy” helicopter rather than a “hobby-grade” one. Familiarize yourself with the basic principles of flying before upgrading to a more advanced or expensive model.Another bonus is that toys are preassembled, while hobby-grade ones often require you to put them together yourself. A mistake will affect your helicopter’s performance.And if your helicopter isn’t performing correctly, learning how to fly it correctly obviously becomes much more difficult.
Toy helicopters are often cheaper than hobby-grade ones, but not always. If the packaging is vague in description and you're unsure of which one a particular model is, visit a brick-and-mortar hobby store or join an online forum for enthusiasts to ask.;
, Don’t expect toys to last very long. If you definitely have a long-term interest in flying RC helicopters, consider buying a lower-end hobby-grade helicopter if money is an issue. Benefits include:Replaceable batteries: The battery life for both toys and hobby-grade helicopters is usually under ten minutes. The batteries in toys are typically fixed in place (which means you have to recharge them before flying again), but with hobby-grade helicopters you can swap the drained battery with a fresh one.
Replaceable parts: Toys can’t be repaired once things start to break (which they will definitely start doing in a short amount of time). Hobby-grade helicopters, however, allow you to replace specific parts when they break or wear out.
Better design: Even the cheapest hobby-grade helicopter is designed with the enthusiast in mind, rather than someone looking for a fun one-time thrill. This means they perform much better than a toy, which makes learning how to control them easier.

, Whether you go with a toy or a hobby-grade helicopter, expect a variety of designs. Since you’re a newbie, opt for a “coaxial,” which are more stable in flight and thus easier to control. A coaxial helicopter has two rotors on top instead of one, and none on the tail.One drawback to coaxials is that they are less agile in the air than the traditional “single-rotor” helicopter design. Their stability makes them ideal for beginners, but if money is an issue and you definitely want to advance to some fancy maneuvering, you may want to go with a single rotor instead.

, The number of “channels” that a control has corresponds to the number of directions that the helicopter can travel. As a beginner, opt for the fewest channels possible so you can concentrate on those and master them faster. However, you can always go with a 4-channel helicopter and just pretend it only has two or three if you can’t afford to keep trading up to more advanced models.


2-channel controls only allow you to lift, lower, and turn your helicopter to the left and right. One drawback: the helicopter always moves forward when in operation.
3-channel controls allow you to stop the helicopter from moving forward so it can hover in place instead. Some also let you move it backward.
4-channel controls enable you to move the helicopter sideways without moving forward, as opposed to turning its nose to either side while moving forward.

, Expect mastering the controls to take a lot of practice. At the same time, remember that the battery life for most RC helicopters is usually limited to six to eight minutes. Decide which aspect of flying you want to focus on before you start each practice. Make the most of the short time you’ll have., This may seem as bad of an idea as playing ball inside the house, but take your first few flights indoors. Start off in a controlled environment. See how the helicopter responds to your commands without interference from other elements, like winds or uneven ground.Favor large spaces like garages or enclosed patios. Obviously, avoid the family parlor where you keep all your fragile heirlooms and antiques.
If practicing inside isn’t feasible, wait for a day with little to no wind and stick to level ground, like a paved parking lot, for easier lift-offs and landings.

, Resist the urge to test the helicopter’s limits in terms of range right off the bat. Fly it low to the ground, no higher than three feet or a meter in the air.Keep a safe distance (a few feet or couple meters) between the helicopter and yourself, but not so far away that you can’t see it or its surroundings in detail.Again, keep that short battery life in mind. You don’t want to be flying as high or far away as possible when it suddenly runs out.

, Don't try any fancy flying right off the bat. For now, just concentrate on the basics. For example, focus on lifting off, flying in a straight line, and landing again after a short distance for your first couple practices. Once you master that, try lifting off, turning to the right in a full circle, and then landing once you straighten out. Then repeat with turning to the left. From there, move on to flying in more complex patterns, like a figure-eight, before landing., Whether you’re adjusting the helicopter’s speed or direction, make your adjustments gradually. Avoid sudden, drastic changes. Expect these to result in a loss of control and increase the likelihood of crashing.This is another good reason to stick low to the ground at first, especially if you’re outside. Air currents are weakest here, which means you should only need to make slight adjustments to your controls anyway in order to keep it steady.

, As you grow more confident with flying within a few feet of the ground, start going higher up. As you do, expect your helicopter to meet more air resistance. This means you will have to make more pronounced adjustments to your controls in order to accomplish the same feats that you pulled off in the beginning, so increase your elevation by increments. For example:Instead of shooting up as far as you can go right away, stick to within six feet or two meters off the ground.
Repeat all the exercises that you did in the beginning to grow familiar with any changes that you have to make in your adjustments.
Once you feel confident operating at this height, increase the elevation by another three feet or meter and repeat.

, Hopefully, the baby-step approach will have kept you from crashing thus far. However, the more you branch out, the more likely you’ll lose control at some point as you deal with new elements and interference. In the event of a crash, always give the helicopter a look-over. Confirm that nothing has broken before attempting to fly it again.Loose parts can break off in flight, which means they may come flying at you or anyone else nearby. Never attempt another flight if any part seems broken.

, As you put in more and more time with your helicopter, keep your ear tuned to the engine. If it begins to sound any different than it did when you first started flying it, land it immediately. Expect changes in sound to possibly indicate damage or malfunctioning parts.This is especially true if you’ve crashed it any point. Keep in mind that not all damage may be visible (or recognizable to a beginner).
Even if the helicopter appears to be functioning normally at present, repeated use may make problems worse.

Install the Body Cover.",How to Tune a Nitro RC Vehicle," Before doing anything make sure to inspect vehicle and make sure that the fuel lines and air filter housing are properly and securely in place. There are two fuel lines one going from the bottom of the fuel tank to the carburetor and the second going from the exhaust muffler to the top of the fuel tank. The air filter housing is attached at the top of the carburetor.;
, Ensure that the air filter itself is clean and ready to go, if you find the filter to be dirty rinse it with fuel to remove all contaminates and then lightly apply the proper oil to the filter. Consult your engine manual to get the right oil weight., Servos are the little mechanical devices in charge of controlling the throttle and moving the tires when steering. The majority of on road vehicle have two sets of servos, one two control the throttle and brakes and another set to control the steering. To check that both sets are working properly turn on your both your remote and the vehicle transmitter, make sure to turn on the remote first to ensure that the signal is picked up correctly, then move the throttle and steering mechanisms of the remote control. If both sets of servos function in correlation with your commands on the remote then the servos are working fine.


, Make sure to both trim settings on your remote control. The trim settings control the servos settings when you are not touching the remote. If the trims are out of whack the the tires will not be straight and the throttle could be open too much.

, Fill the fuel tank to the top, keep in mind that it is not necessary to fill the tank to the extreme top just make sure that about 90% of the tank has been filled. Make sure to consult your engine manual to ensure you are using the appropriate nitro blend. Mixtures with higher nitro content cause the engine to run faster thus performing better but at the cost of running at a higher temperature. Normally on road vehicles take fuel in the range of 25-33% nitro, whereas off-road vehicles tend to perform best at 20% nitro., The first step in actually starting the engine is to prime it. Priming the engine means that the piston sleeve housing is full of fuel and will allow your engine to start immediately. To prime the engine first block the exhaust tip of the muffler either with your finger or dry cloth. By blocking the muffler all of the exhaust pressure will travel through the fuel line into the fuel tank forcing the fuel to exit through the bottom fuel line into the carburetor. Next turn over your engine by pulling the pull start cord, you should be able to visibly see the fuel enter your carburetor through the fuel lines. Once fuel enters the carburetor stop turning over the engine., Once the engine has been primed it is now ready to be started. Make sure to not block the exhaust tip and leave it freely open. Insert the glow plug driver on the glow plug and then pull the chord a 3-5 times until the engine starts. Once the engine starts remove the glow plug driver and drive the vehicle around to build up the engine temperature.

, The high speed needle governs the fuel/air mixture at ¾ to maximum throttle whereas the low speed needle dictates the fuel/air mixture at idle to ¾ throttle. It is worth noting that engines smaller than .15 cubic inches typically have only a high speed needle.

, Make sure that your needle settings are set to factory, in which the needles are flush with the chamber.

, Make sure the fuel tank is filled and that all servos are working fine. If needed, now is the time to replace any dead batteries. Once ready take your vehicle to an open lot and start the engine., Once engine has been started drive the vehicle for a minute or two to build up the engine’s temperature., Once the engine has been warmed up you are ready to begin the tuning process. Using your screwdriver,turn the high-speed needle 1/8 of a turn clockwise. By turning the needle clockwise you are leaning out the mixture which will lower the amount of fuel the engine takes in and increases engine RPMs. With each adjustment the vehicle’s top speed and performance should improve.

, Continue to lean out the high speed needle in 1/8th increments and be sure to drive the vehicle after each adjustment. Some of the signs to stop leaning is when the engine begins to bog out, no blue smoke is visible or the engine suddenly shuts off. When this happens richen the needle by turning it 1/8 of a turn counterclockwise and drive the vehicle to make sure it is running smoothly without bogging out or shutting off., This is done in the same manner as the high speed needle. Using the screwdriver, lean out the low speed needle in 1/8th increments by turning the needle clockwise and driving around after each adjustment. As you drive the vehicle after each adjustment you should notice that the vehicle's acceleration and bottom end speed improving.

, Some of the signals that indicate we have tuned the low speed needle too lean is when the engine revs to fast at idle and very little blue smoke is visible when accelerating. If you experience any of the signals make sure to richen or lean out the low speed needle., Also another way of making sure we have properly tuned the low speed needle is to pinch the fuel line and observe the engines behavior. If the engine slowly begins to rev up and quit in around 3 seconds then the low speed needle is tuned correctly. If the engine immediately shuts off then the needle is too lean or if the engine take very long to shut off then it is tuned too rich., Make sure that there is a trail of blue smoke coming out of the exhaust when running and that the engine is not bogging out or shutting off.

, Once the engine is running smoothly with no problems, the body cover can now be installed.


Your vehicle is now properly tuned and is operating at optimum performance.

",How to Start up a Nitro RC Vehicle," Look for cracks, loose screws, chipped screws, any thing missing or damaged and a very simple way to easily see problems is to have a clean vehicle. This way, dirt or any grime won't obstruct any damage to your car.;
, Would you rather simply replace some old batteries then have to pay to fix your car because your battery died and tried to challenge a sidewalk? Make sure the batteries in the remote are working well and that the batteries that are in your car also work well. Make sure your glow starter is working and it has enough energy.

,, After you pour your fuel, prime it so that your engine has fuel to start up with. Then stick your glow starter into the engine and depending on your car, you can manually pull-start it by giving short but quick pulls and make sure that you do not damage the starter by pulling too far back. You can also use an electric starter which resembles a drill in which you can stick it in the engine and start it without any effort.

Take care of your model sailboat.,
Consider where you will store the model when not in use.,
When you have a question and seek an answer, turn to those who have already faced the issue.",How to Select a Radio Controlled Model Sailboat," Model sailboats often operate with the same sophistication of design as any full-sized yacht. The more sophisticated ones are designed for racing, and the R/C sailors call them ""model yachts"", to distinguish their more sophisticated models from the ""toy"" sailboats often sold at toy stores or online.;
, The ""model yachts"" sailed in competition are generally better-quality, more rugged, and more costly than ""toy"" sailboats. They use readily-available parts (from hobby shops), so you can repair the yachts when something goes wrong. Often, ""toy"" sailboats require an overseas order to get replacement parts.

, As with any hobby-sport, the cost of the model yacht reflects its degree of sophistication. The ""model yacht"" market is supplied by a number of highly qualified one-man companies as well as by a handful of larger companies. The ""toy"" market is generally served by larger toy companies.


The long-term cost of model yachting is far less than the cost of sports fishing and golf. The start-up cost depends on the model sailors willingness and ability to build his/her own boat (from a kit or scratch), as well as the sophistication of the yacht itself. You can expect to invest as little as $450 and as much as $5,000 for a true ""model yacht"". After obtaining the boat and related gear, the actual cost of sailing is very low.

, One of the important considerations in selecting a model is its size. If you cannot see the boat well enough to distinguish wind changes on the sails and reaction to the controls, you will be unable to operate it among a fleet of models sailing offshore.


The uninitiated spectator who has been watching a model out sailing and then sees it being brought ashore will express great surprise at how big it is. That little model you see out on the pond can be eight feet long and weigh up to eighty pounds.
From a practical standpoint, the minimum overall length for a sailing model is 24 inches (61.0 cm) when sailed among other larger models.

, The generally accepted minimum radio control system has two channels. Each pair of units, radio transmitter and radio receiving system, operates on a discrete frequency so that several radio control units can be operated at the same time and location without conflicting with one another., The number of channels refers to the number of functions the set will control directly. The basic two-channel system allows discrete control of the steering on one channel. The second channel operates the sail control which sets the position of the sails.

, The actual operation of the model is by manipulating the controls of the radio transmitter unit on the shore. The skipper controls the steering and the sails on the model. The model can be sailed as if it were a full-size yacht.

, The distance to which we can sail our model yacht is limited by the range of the radio transmitter and receiver in the control system and by the capability of the human eye. Visibility is crucial for setting sail trim and course - and also for avoiding collisions.

, The oldest and most prominent AMYA classes are the ""formula"" classes. Rather than try to handicap differing models, a set of ground rules was established with a wide range of individual variation still possible between models.


The largest fleet of racing models is to be found in the 50/800 or International Marblehead Class






This formula is quite simple and requires the model to have a mono-hull which is 50 inches (127.0 cm) long and to carry not more than 800 square inches of sail.






The Star45 Class is a one-design class with specifications resulting in significant performance differences between models.
Within the hull space are: a radio-controlled receiver, batteries for the receiver, a sail winch for trimming the sails, batteries for the sail winch, and the two or more servomechanisms which steer the boat and control the winch.







, It can be an expensive proposition if the rig is complicated.


Masts run the gamut from simple wood spars to slotted aluminum through carbon fiber shafts. From a time-of-assembly standpoint, an aluminum mast is excellent. For salt-water sailing, however, you will need the anodized aluminum.







, Professionally made sails are a fact of life if you plan to race seriously.


Sail Control Units, aka Sail winches, are required for sheeting sails.
Two popular winch configurations. The drum or loop configuration trims the sail by winding the sheet or a loop about a drum mounted on the shaft of a gear motor. The swing-arm configuration attaches the sheets from the sails are attached to an arm mounted on the shaft of a gear motor.

, One great difference between radio-controlled model boats and radio-controlled aircraft is that it's very difficult for even a rank novice to do harm to a sailing model while sailing it. Therefore, the prospective purchaser will be sure to find a number of local R/C skippers who will let him have a try at sailing their boats when asked.

Ask about at your local shops, park departments, and newspapers, and you will be able to locate the local yachtsman sailing his R/C craft at some nearby spot. Stop by and watch him, ask advice, and get to sail a model or two.
Find a club. If there is more than one club locally, visit all and choose the one that makes you feel most comfortable and sails a class that you think you would like to start with. Speak to the club members and seek advice from all on an appropriate starting class. Test sail as many member's boats as you can. Most club members are quite willing to give test sails.

, R/C models require a launching area with water deep enough to allow for the depth of the model keel. The typical 50/800 Marblehead draws 15 to 18 inches (38.1 to 45.7 cm). You may need to wade out into the water to launch and recover your model.

,, Set aside space to stow away a ten-foot mast with sails attached.

, A quality model can be an investment lasting for many years. Some modelers have models that have been passed along for a couple of generations.

, How will you transport it to the water's edge? What is involved in your launching it (depth of water required, the weight of the model, bulk of model, etc.? The same considerations must be given to the spars for your model.

, They may have left answers in Internet resources or model club newsletters.

Try undoing the knot.,
Start with the easiest tangles first.,
Hold onto one end of the Slinky.,
Use a ruler to keep this set of coils aligned.,
Twist the Slinky around the ruler.,
Repeat the process to get other tangles out.",How to Untangle a Slinky1," In order to untangle a Slinky, you need to find the place where it is tangled. Identify the problem area by stretching the Slinky out.


Don’t pull so hard that the Slinky bends or warps.
You might need to arrange the Slinky in a circle if one end has tangled with the other end. Spread it out as much as you can.;
, Once you’ve stretched out the Slinky, you will see where the tangle has happened. Then you will be able to identify what the tangle looks like. Has one end meshed into another end? Has it been tied in a knot?


Most tangles look like a U-shaped section. It usually sticks out from the rest of the coils.

, If the tangle is the result of a knot, carefully try to pull apart the knot. You can also try looping the Slinky back through itself.

, Your Slinky might have multiple tangles in it. Start with the tangle that is smallest and closest to one end.

, Stretch out the end until you get to the first tangle. Hold the coils on this end in one hand.


You may need someone to help you by holding one end of the Slinky while you work on the tangle.

, As you work on undoing one Slinky tangle, you can risk making the Slinky get more tangled. Use a ruler or another straight, hard object to make sure that the Slinky doesn’t wrap back around itself.


You can also use your hands by holding the coiled end firmly in one hand.

, Rotate the Slinky around and around so that more coils move from the tangled side to the untangled side., Essentially, you’re moving the tangle further along the Slinky until you have moved it to the end of the Slinky.
The Slinky should correct its spiral as you twist the Slinky around the ruler.

, Once you get one tangle out, you’ll have more of the Slinky with untangled coils. Use the ruler to hold these coils straight. Twist the Slinky to move the next tangle past the ruler.

Take another look at the two Slinkies.,
Untwist or untangle the two Slinkies carefully.",How to Untangle a Slinky2," Examine the Slinky mess you have. Figure out where one Slinky begins and ends.

, Try to figure out how the two Slinkies are attached. Look for U-shaped tangles and knots.

, Start your untangling job on the Slinky by tackling the tangle that is closest to one end of one of the Slinkies.

, Using one hand, keep the untangled end together so that it doesn’t end up tangling back into the rest of the Slinky mess.


You can also use a ruler or another straight, hard object, to keep the Slinky aligned.

, Rotate the Slinky around and around so that more coils move from the tangled side to the untangled side.You might need to carefully hang onto the tangled end with the other Slinky so that you don’t introduce more tangles into the mess.

, If possible, focus just on one Slinky that seems easiest to untangle.


If you can extract one Slinky from the other, then you can work on each Slinky separately to untangle them. There may be a point when one Slinky will become unknotted from the other Slinky.

, If your Slinkies are not coming apart, start working on another end of the Slinky. Twist the coils around and around to work out another tangle from another end.

,, It’s likely that once you’ve gotten most of the tangles out, you’ll be able to see how the Slinkies are attached.

, Once you’ve identified the nature of the tangles, you can untwist them. Or, you can do a final rotation of the coils on one of the Slinkies to separate it from the other one.

Don’t toss your slinky into a toy bin.,
Don’t throw your slinky around.,
Store a ruler inside the slinky.,
Keep the slinky away from young children.",How to Untangle a Slinky3," Once the slinky is in a toy bin, one end of it will start to slip down between toys while the other end will stay on top of the toys. This is a good way for it to start tangling up. Instead, store your slinky on a shelf or in its original box.

, When you throw your slinky onto the ground, it can land with one end meshing into the other end. This will create a tangle. More often than not, it’s very difficult to pull it apart and you’ll need to spend time untangling it.

, When you are not using the slinky, put a ruler or another long, straight object through the middle. This will prevent one end from tangling with the other end.

, Young children are great at tangling up a slinky immediately. Keep the toy out of little hands for optimum slinky performance.

Line up the channel with the screw hole. This is the idle stop screw that will line up with the channel to keep it from pulling out too far and pushing in too far.
Put the screw in and crank it down. Down the barrel carburetor – you want to push it in until it stops and look for a tiny ½ mm gap.

,,,, There should be a little mark that the set screw made so that you can line it up in the exact same spot.,, Take the housing and 2 washers – the fuel inlet goes in between them and screw them right into the inlet.

Be very careful when screwing this in as it is a coarse screw thread going into plastic. You can even use your hand just to be safe.
Thread in the high speed needle until it stops, and back it out 4 stops to reset it. That’s it for the carburetor.

So when you rebuild, you have to put oil back on everything that moves, starting with the bearings. Then put your crankshaft in., This is the most crucial step – the piston and rod assembly goes in a specific way. If it goes in backwards, it will destroy the motor. So make sure you see the backside is round and the front side has a little cutout and oiling hole. So when it is sitting in the motor, it should be sitting in the front. Slide it in through the top and slide it on. Try not to use tools in this part – hands only – so that you don’t damage anything.,, There is a small notch on the bottom that will line up with a small pin on the top of the motor.

Put some oil on the back, One of the notches on the starter shaft will line up with the connecting rod.

As you put the back plate on, line up the starter shaft with the connecting rod. On the starter shaft, the bottom is smooth and the top has 2 notches.
Make sure the notches are facing up. If you install this upside down, it can again ruin your engine.
Push it in, and spin the starter shaft and it should fall right into place.

Stand him on the ground.

",How to Work a Marionette1," To do so, follow these steps (assuming you put him away using the method below):


Carefully, drag him out by the wooden bar (the 'control') - never by his feet!
Hold the control in two hands and twist it round and round to decrease the amount of spin and lower the puppet until all the strings are off the control.
Open the control to form a cross.;
, Do not stand precariously as the excitement of moving the puppet can unbalance you.

Keep game pieces inside a toy cash register or child’s jewelry box.,
Hold paint inside a half of a plastic toy egg.,
Contain office supplies inside a Slinky toy.,
Use old books as placemats.,
Create bookends using small, plastic action figures.,
Prop large, hearty stuffed animals to become bookends.,
Use puzzle pieces as magnets.,
Use an old skateboard as a shelf.",How to Use Toys for Practical Purposes1," If the original game box is missing or damaged, consider using an old toy cash register to hold game pieces and even the game board if its large enough.;
, Is your child interested in painting but nowhere to hold all the different colors? Dig into your child’s Easter basket or toy kitchen supplies and use half of a plastic hollow egg to fill with paint.

, Errant office supplies flooding your desk can be annoying. Contain pens, rulers and even notepads inside a Slinky toy. Simply wrap the Slinky into a circle on your desk, clip with a binder or paper clip and you have an automatic desk coral.

, Dig out an old paperback picture book (or even coloring book) to use as a quick option for a placemat. Be sure you are truly finished with the book as using it as a placement means it will most likely be trashed by the end of the meal.

, Mount 10” to 12” hard, plastic action figures on the wall to hold caps and jackets in your child’s room. Drill holes in the figure’s feet and mount on the wall using screws.

, If books keep falling off the shelf, find the most bottom heavy stuffed animal that will fit on the shelf and make the toy do the job of a book end.

, Purchase self-adhesive magnetic strips and attach to the back of puzzle pieces.

, For the ultimate skater, mounting an old board on the wall not only acts as a handy shelf but will also be a proud way to show shred-worthy credibility. Boards can be mounted either by the trucks or through the board itself depending on how you plan to use the board (as a hook or a shelf).

A cardboard core will give your fabric rigidity and form. If you don't have any cardboard, you might be able to layer several pieces of rigid construction paper together with glue as a substitute. The material you use for the ears should be stiff enough to keep it from flopping around loosely once attached to the headband and if you don’t have felt, you can paint or color the cardboard black.








Black felt
Cardboard
Rigid construction paper (optional)
Household glue
Plain paper
Ribbon (10” (25 cm) long)
Ribbon (3” (7 cm) long)
You should be able to purchase everything you need for this project at your local fabric or craft store.;
, The headband can be any color, but it should be at least ½"" (1.27 cm) thick. You will eventually attach your mouse ears to the headband, so thicker headbands might give your mouse ears greater stability. Including a head band, you should also purchase the following tools:








Headband
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Household glue
Pencil
Pipe cleaner
Scissors

, You should trace two circles on your paper with a pencil or your chalk. Each circle should be between 3” and 5” (7.6 and 12.7 cm) and have a ½” (1.27 cm) tab at the bottom of the circle. These templates will be used to assist you in outlining the dimensions of your mouse ears on both fabric and cardboard.








The tabs will on the bottom of your circles will be used to secure the ears and the headband together.
You might be able to use the base of a bowl to help you in drawing identical circles for both of your templates.

, Place your paper template on top of the felt and trace the circle with chalk onto it. You could use a piece of tailor’s chalk, or even regular chalk in a pinch. This way, you can wipe any leftover chalk away with a damp cloth.









Make four felt circles for every pair of ears you make. You will need to glue felt to the front and back of your cardboard core to make your mouse ears uniformly black.

, Take your scissors and follow the chalk outlines you've drawn to cut free your felt circles free from the fabric.You can add some jazzy flair to your mouse ears by using zig-zaggy pinking shears.








Pinking shears will add a cute border to your fabric and prevent your fabric from becoming frayed., These cardboard circles will form the core of your mouse ears, making it possible for them stand up straight, just like Minnie's! Use your pencil or a piece of chalk to trace the circle template onto the cardboard.








You will need two cardboard circles for every pair of ears you make.

, Using your scissors, follow the chalk or pencil outline you drew with your templates onto the cardboard. Be sure you don't cut off your tabs! These will be necessary to connect your mouse ears to the headband.








You may need to touch up your cardboard and felt circles/tabs to make them as close to identical as possible.
Compare and trim your felt and cardboard circles by holding the cardboard and felt pieces together in a stack. Then you can trim down any irregularities.

, Household glue should be sufficient to attach a piece of felt to the front and back of each cardboard circle/ear. Drizzle glue back and forth along the cardboard and press your felt into place. Press the felt to the glue firmly for five to ten minutes help it set.









To create the best bond between your glue and the felt, you may want to allow your glue to rest for 30 minutes to an hour., Regular household glue won’t hold up to wear and tear as well as hot glue. The special glue used in hot glue guns, however, is much more durable. It will create a firm bond between ear and headband.









You'll have to move quick after you apply your hot glue. The glue will dry quickly soon after application.
Hot glue fresh from the gun will be very hot. Be careful not to burn yourself., Your circles should be at least 4” (10 cm) apart so that you have room for the bow that will go between the ears. You may want to mark your headband with your chalk where you'll be attaching the ears to prevent yourself from gluing them into the wrong place.








If your headband is flexible or will permit the use of staples, you could also use a hardy stapler to connect the tabs of your mouse ears to your headband.

, Playing with your mouse ears before the glue has completely dried could cause your mouse ears to come free of the headband. To ensure you don't have to re-glue any of your pieces together, you should allow your glue to firm for 30 minutes to an hour.







, Your mouse ears might not stand straight up like Minnie Mouse's at first. To encourage your mouse ears to hold this position, fold both up and forward. The glued tabs will keep the ears in place.








, You can use either ribbon or fabric for your bow, although ribbon will likely be a little shinier and look more like the bow Minnie wears. In either case, it should be 5” to 8” (12.7 to 20.3 cm) wide. You will eventually gather this fabric around its middle, which will cause the sides to fan out. This will give your bow its shape.








Thicker cuts of fabric will create more bunching when you gather this piece around its middle, which will give your bow a fuller appearance., This is the piece you will use to gather the fabric around the middle of your 10"" (25 cm) length of ribbon. You should use a similar kind of fabric to your 10"" (25 cm) ribbon, but you could also add some pop to your design by using a contrasting color fabric.








For example, if you are using Minnie's traditional bow color, red with white polka-dots, you might choose a bold blue for your gathering string.

, Put the print side face down. You're going to want to glue your gathering string along the back of your bow, which will be the same as the opposite side of the pattern.








, You'll want each side to overlap slightly at the center of your 10"" (25 cm) length of ribbon. Fold one end at a time so that there is enough overlap to glue these side where the meet at the center of the ribbon.







, It should only take a dab or two of hot glue or fabric glue to join the ends together firmly. Press the fabric firmly to create a stronger bond between the fabric and glue.









You should follow the directions on your glue to achieve the best bond. Some glues will set and cure faster than others. Generally, you should hold the glue firmly for one to five minutes for best results., Use one hand to pinch your ribbon together toward its centermost point from the top and bottom edges. This will be easiest to do if you are working with a ribbon that is at least 5” (12.7 cm) wide.








Pinching your ribbon together tightly will cause the outside edges to flare out more dramatically.

, The 3” (7.6 cm) piece of ribbon will hold the fabric of your bow in its flared position. Wind it around several times and then remove your fingers where you were pinching the bow in the middle.









Hold the ribbon with your free hand to make sure it doesn't come unwound or loose.
Wind the remaining length of your ribbon around the center tightly.

, Lift one end of the small piece of ribbon and apply a dab of hot glue or fabric glue. If using hot glue, you should be careful not to burn yourself by pressing on the fabric immediately after glue application.








To apply pressure to make the best seal between your hot glue and fabric, you might use a tool to prevent getting burned, like a paperweight, gloved hand, or tweezers.
Fabric glue and other cold glues should be held together firmly to encourage a strong bond. Press the glued piece of ribbon together. Hold this position for about 30 seconds to a minute.

, The bunchings of your bow fabric should have created folds through which you can thread your pipe cleaner so that it passes under your glued gathering string.









If you find it difficult to feed your pipe cleaner through a fold and under your gathering string, you can always use glue to attach the pipe cleaner along the back of your bow.
A dab of hot glue onto the back of your gathering string should be enough to hold your pipe cleaner in place.

, Orient your pipe cleaner so it is equal length on both sides of your gathering string. Now cross the sides of your pipe cleaner at the midpoint over the front of your gathering string and add a twist.









This will prevent the pipe cleaner from slipping out of the bow while adding stability to the bow in general.
Experiment with different colored pipe cleaners to personalize your Minnie Mouse ears!

, Center the bow between the ears. Then you're going to wrap each end of the pipe cleaner around opposite ends of your headband. Twine each side of the pipe cleaner down opposite ends of the headband until you go no further.









The ends of pipe cleaner can be pointy. To prevent the wearer from getting poked, you may want to turn these inward on your headband. The ends can also be taped to the headband as an extra precaution.
By attaching your bow to your mouse ears with a pipe cleaner, you'll be able to swap out different bows without having to make a new pair of mouse ears.
Twist ties can be used to reinforce your pipe cleaners if you find the pipe cleaner windings are not holding the bow in place well enough.

, Minnie, being a stylish mouse, would probably go ga-ga over some rhinestones, glitter, feathers, or other accents you might add to your mouse ears. Most of these can be attached with a small dab of hot glue. Once you've finished adding your finishing touches, you should show off your mouse ears to all your friends.

, Pull the left front string up (raises left hand) or down (raises right hand) to move the hands. Pulling the left string up and out simultaneously will lift both hands.

, These work in the same way as the hands, but with the string that is attached to the legs.

, Pull the leg string up and down so that the feet make a walking motion, whilst moving the marionette forward will create a simple movement to this effect.

, Dancing is great fun with a puppet, and can be done in multiple ways. One such way is to make a walking movement again, but instead of moving the control forwards, bounce it up and down. Once you have mastered this, hold the right hand and left leg string together and move them up and down, up and down. To create the best effect, tip the control from side to side as he dances to make his head tilt in time with the music.

Ask your child what sort of a tea party he or she would enjoy.,
Decide whether you'll have real or fake food.,
Set up the tea party.,
Start the tea party.,
Clean up afterwards.",How to Make a Tea Party for Toys1," Knowing which toys are invited will help decide the theme and the types of things served at the tea party. For example, if it's just dolls, the party can be tailored to the type of dolls, while if it's teddy bears, the standard teddy bear's picnic would be a fun thing to do.;
, This is the ""theme"" and it might be helpful to suggest ideas to get your child thinking. Some theme possibilities include:


A teddy bear's picnic
A Barbie afternoon tea
A garden party for dolls and/or stuffed toys
A scones, jam and cream high tea
A birthday party for a special doll or toy.

, If you have a lot of time and you'd like to have real food, this could also include doing some baking together, to make scones/cupcakes/muffins and children's drinks. Even more fun is making cookies shaped like the toys, such as teddy bear cookies or animal cupcakes.


Real food can be combined with fake food. For example, you could have a lot of miniature food/pretend food but some real cookies and milk.
If using real food, you'll need to set up in a place where it is appropriate and hygienic to eat.
Mud pies are not a great idea when toys are involved. There is a chance of the toys getting dirty and they can be hard to clean in some cases.

, Choose a suitable spot and find the gear needed for the party. You can use doll's tea sets or real cups, depending on what you have at home. Another alternative is to buy cups, saucers, and the like, from a thrift store, just for such occasions and keep these aside in a box. They can be washed before and after use, and be reused again and again.


Set the table or lay a blanket on the grass.
Put out dishes of food and plates for the dolls and toys to eat from.
Add glasses or cups for the drinks.
Include a centerpiece for decoration.
Set up anything else that your child thinks would be nice as part of the tea party.

, It's up to you whether or not you participate. Gauge your child's wishes––if she or he asks you to join in, then by all means do so. But if your child seems to be happily playing away imaginatively without you, just keep an eye on it from afar and let him or her enjoy the play.


Your child may wish to ask over a real friend or two. They could bring their own toys along to the tea party.
Take photos. This is the sort of thing wonderful memories are made of.

, This is an important part of your child learning to put things away and to keep things clean. If real food was consumed, show your child how to clear away crumbs, clean the plates and vacuum (if needed). Even if everything used was not real, the toy items need to be packed away neatly.

Remove the bear from the dirty water and rinse.,
Lay the bear on a clean towel, dabbing it with another towel to get rid of excess moisture.,
Let the bear air dry.",How to Wash a Build A Bear1," Be sure to add the detergent while the water is still running.


The cold water will help preserve your bear’s color. You can also use warm, but never hot, water.
Do not use any harsh detergents, as they can damage the bear’s fur. Baby detergents work well.;
, Simply swish the bear around in the soap and water mixture until it is completely covered.

, Take care around the stitches so they don’t come loose.


Hand-washing is the gentlest method for cleaning the bear. Washing too roughly may cause the stuffing to come out of the stitching.

, Use cold running water to rinse the suds off of your bear.

, Follow by brushing your bear with a soft brush.


Brushing the bear’s fur right after washing will help prevent any clumping or matting., You may need to turn it over periodically to allow both sides to dry.


It is usually best to let a stuffed animal dry on its own outside, as long as it’s a warm and sunny day.Not allowing your bear to dry properly can result in mold or rotting. Make sure the bear is completely dry before boxing it up or letting a child play with it."

Get the ""right"" type of toy.,
Open up the toy.,
Now you'll have to pick a place to solder two cables on the existing on-off switch.,
Put the female plug on the toy.,
Solder the cables to the plug.,
Now, for the second part: The external switch.,
Finally, if necessary, make a housing for the switch.",How to Make Adapted Toys," This is the most important step. Not all toys can be adapted easily. What we need here are toys that have an ""on/off"" switch on them, the kind that go crazy when ""on"" (those that start moving, making noise and blinking lights are fine), and don't do anything but sit on the shelf when off.;
, You've got to be careful here, we don't want to end up with ""extra parts"" later on. This is where we have to think a bit. Find the place where the on-off switch is. If you can, play with it a bit. ¿see how the toy turns on when you flick the switch? OK, that's enough playing for now.

, If you look carefully, you'll see that the switch has a couple of metal plates that connect directly to the batteries. We'll have to solder the two cables in parallel to the existing ""on-off"" switch. That is, the toy should be activated by either using the ""on-off"" switch on the toy, or by bringing together our two cables. (check out some of the soldering how-to articles on this site for details on this step if you don't know how to solder). If the toy turns on by bringing the cables together, the you've done a great job.

, First you'll need to find a good spot to place the plug. Make sure you'll have enough room to close the toy afterwards. Drill an appropriately sized hole on the toy. Put the female plug in place. If necessary you could use a bit of silicone to fix the plug to the toy (in case the hole is too big).

, Now, cut the cable to an ""appropriate"" length (that, of course, depends on the particular toy you're working on) and solder the ends to the female plug. That's all for the toy part.

, In order for the toy to be activated at a distance, it's necessary to have an appropriate switch. You can buy one for about $10 USD, or make one yourself. To make the switch, get a one meter piece of stereo cable. Solder to one end a mono plug (that fits to the one on the toy) and solder to the other end a momentary switch (something like the ones used for your mouse's buttons). Momentary switches generally have three metal contacts that you can solder to. Use a bit of trial and error to figure out which two to use.

, Depending on the child, you may need to try different things in order to have them use the switch. In some cases it's enough to paste the switch to the table.

, Welcome them with a large hug. This will be very important for other steps.

, Write down all your teddies, dolls, and/or stuffed animals' names on the computer or by yourself. Write them down in alphabetical order; e.g, Brian then Caramel because b then c. This will help you keep the names organized.

, Include birthdays, allergies and interests. Plan out the whole week; for real teachers, this is like a to-do list.

, Like if one subject is Art, write what they draw or paint like- Space is good.

, Hope you enjoy your prep year! Love, (insert your name here).

Decide which grade you will teach your teddy bear(s).,
Choose what classes you will hold.,
Decide the recess and lunch times.,
Have an exercise book for each one of your teddy bear students.,
Ask your family if they have any shoe boxes.,
Give each teddy a pencil, rubber, sharpener and a ruler each.,
Make worksheets for each subject and photocopy it to match the amount of teddies you will teach.,
Have uniforms.,
Set up the classroom.,
Get a chalkboard and some chalk or a whiteboard and some markers.,
Decide how many teddies will be attending your school.,
Make sure you know which teddies you're going to use.,
Make a register for your teddies and tick off their names if they are in.,
Let them introduce each other on their first day.,
Have breakfast clubs and after-school clubs if you wish.,
Keep playing if you have the interest to keep this up.,
Give the teddy bears rewards.,
Balance work and play for the teddy bears.,
End the day with a prize time, where the best-behaved teddy gets a prize.,
Set an appropriate home time.,
At home-time, make sure each teddy goes home with a grown-up.",How to Run a Teddy School," Ask yourself, ""What grade will I teach to my teddies? Kindergarten? First grade? Even second or third grade?"".

If you write formally, which includes a wikiHow article, you write first, second and third out in full. If it's texting your friends, you can write 1st, 2nd and 3rd. There's a lesson for your teddy bears.;
, Do you want to teach your teddies to read, write and count? Math? What about spelling? Create a lesson plan. Plan out which subjects you are teaching on which days. You could have English, maths, science, P.E, fashion (if they are Build-a-Bears), handwriting, art, history and geography. Your choice!, When will they be and how long will they go for. This is just as important as the classes.

Create a timetable to stick to. Include break times, lunchtimes and assembly times.



 


Consider creating a canteen (or tuck/food shop) for your teddy bears. During recess and lunch breaks, you could organize some food for your teddies.
Provide toilet times and outdoor play sessions. Your teddies will grow bored if they have to work all day!







, If you have lots of spare exercise books lying around in your house, you can give them maths books and writing books.

, The teddies can put their possessions inside. If not, have a small tub or pencil case so that they can get stuff if they need to.

, Then they don't need to ask each time they want something. You may want to have a small pencil case in the front of the room so each individual teddy doesn't need one.

, Gather pencils, pens, rulers, rubbers and sharpener, supplying one for each teddy. Alternatively, give them a pencil each and get them to share the other supplies., If you can, create a school uniform for your teddies. Make sure it is not too fancy otherwise you might get frustrated trying to make enough for the teddies. Near enough will do, or you could even imagine they have uniforms.


If you choose to have school uniform, provide mufti (non-uniform/casual clothes) days, pajama days, and dress-up days.







, Find an empty wardrobe, a spare room or even just a corner of your bedroom. Set up tubs or thick books to be used as desks.

Find someplace like the corner of your room if you have a small class, or find an empty guest room for a huge class.
If you like, you can make a wall out of cardboard and cut a door in it, but, this is optional.

, If you don't have either of the boards already, use paper instead.

You can buy a cheap board on sale during back-to-school time.
You can even make your own whiteboard. Find plain sheets of paper and laminate them. Use whiteboard markers to draw on them. It will be easy to wipe off the markers with simply, just a tissue or cloth.

, Knowing how many teddies you want in your school will help you set up the area of your school. Try not to have too many teddies as your school will get messy., If you find you've forgotten one, introduce them as a new student later.

, If any are absent, you can make up a symbol for that. Any late-comers should make up time after school or during break time.

, If necessary, organize a 'circle time', where they pass round a special toy and say what you ask, like how they feel, what they did over the holidays, who they already know, etc.

, Just make sure your day isn't too hectic.

, After their first few days, use exercise books for their reading records, and send them home with a book to read. Ask their parents to listen to them and help them if necessary. Don't forget to change them every so often!

, If it helps, you can have a color changing system for when they do bad and good stuff.


Provide free time and art if they are being good and you have no work left for them to do. Be aware they may need a little help with art though.







, Instilling them with a good work ethic is the aim of decent schooling.

, Make sure they all get a prize in the end, or they might get jealous!

, Schools can usually end around 3:00 to 3:30pm. You could try even make a day where the teddies go home early. Or, send them home when you're tired of playing school with teddies., If a grown-up can't come, bring them to their homes yourself.

Wake up Teddy with breakfast in bed.,
Make plans for something special to do together.,
Don't forget to get something for Teddy.,
Make a special dinner with dessert.,
Enjoy the day.",How to Spend Valentine's Day with Your Teddy," It can be fake food or real food, it depends on what you prefer. One tasty breakfast in bed is the classic bacon and eggs with a side of toast, but if you make your teddy a bowl of oatmeal with an English muffin, that works too. It depends on what you both like to eat. Oatmeal and an English muffin is best if Teddy's on a diet but remember that you'll end up eating it, so choose what you like and can fit in.;
, You can have a picnic in the park and feed the ducks, or you could rent some movies, make a big bowl of popcorn, and stay at home watching movies together. Another good idea is to take a day trip to visit someone right outside the city and to look for a view of the beautiful sunset. It depends on your tastes, budget and ability to get around.

, This is a special day for the two of you. It could be a heart-shaped box of chocolates or a gift card to his favorite store. Naturally, you get to keep the gift, so choose something you actually like.

, A nice idea for this is to make your favorite dinner, then finish it off with something delicious, such as strawberry ice cream with berries for dessert.

, It's about the both of you spending Valentine's day together and doing things you like to do.

Plan where you are going to host it.,
Figure out how many people are coming and send out invites.,
Prepare the food.,
Decorate and set up the picnic area.,
Have activities ready for your guests.",How to Host a Teddy Bear Party," The most obvious place would be your backyard. It'd be best to have a clean-up of your yard of any rubbish that could injure little kids playing on it (such as rusted metal), and make sure it is a good size. Even better if you have things like trampolines or swingsets for the children. If you don't have a suitable yard, you can ask a close friend or family member to use theirs. If it's a small party, you could also use a public reserve or park.;
, You'll want to do this about a week or two in advance. A good amount would be between 5 and 10 kids, as you will have to be cooking a lot of food if you have any more than that. For invites, use a cute image of a teddy bear on the front and be sure to ask everyone to bring their own teddy or stuffed animal.

, Party favourites like chips, sliced fruit and vegetables etc. can all be used. You'll also want to include some teddy bear themed food like perhaps a teddy bear shaped cake. Make sure it's all able to be easily transported if your picnic is not in your own home. Also, keep in mind that young kids can be very fussy when it comes to food, and parents may want healthy food for their kids.

, A simple picnic rug on the ground with plastic cutlery and plates will be fine for food. Try putting drinks like juice in teapots for a more classic and charming feel. You can use pastel bunting hung from trees, helium balloons tied to teacups and more to decorate. You may want to set up an outdoor table with nibbles and coffee/tea for the adults, so they can socialize while keeping an eye on their kids.

, While the picnic may be fine by itself for a short party or younger kids, you may want to include other activities to keep kids occupied. Try a teddy bear scavenger hunt for chocolate coins, a teddy-bear dress up station, a bouncy castle or an obstacle course.

Know what not to do when displaying bears.",How to Collect Teddy Bears," This may be dependent on your interests, whether you've a sentimental or a purposeful collecting intention in mind, and on your budget. Ultimately, the why and the how you collect teddy bears is totally up to you; it is only when you want to ensure that your collection is very valuable that you need to pay more attention to some of the ""rules"" about careful collecting. Some examples of possible ways to collect teddy bears include:


Collect teddies that you like. These don't need to be valuable, just appealing and kept in great condition. They can be bears from Build-a-bear or similar ""make a bear"" companies, they can be any teddy bear that you happen to like. While categorizing a bear collection is right for some people, being eclectic in your bear choices or driven to own as many teddy bears as possible are just as valid reasons for your collecting style as honing in on a particular type or style of bear.
Collect teddies with sentimental value. This means keeping the teddy bears that you and other family members have had over the years. Even better if the teddies come with photos of original owners, events such as bear picnics, etc.
Collect teddies which have value from the start. For example, Steiff bears, Boyd Bears, Bearington bears, Vermont Teddy Bears, Mary Meyers, Gund, or Care Bears.
Collect teddies that you think will become valuable eventually. This could be a crossover with bears that you like or an addition to collecting already valuable bears.
Collect store teddies. Many stores have their own teddy bears, often for special occasions such as a holiday season, a celebration of the store's history or because it's a famous toy store (such as Hamley's of London) and they just like having their own brand of teddy bears. This can be a fun collection in its own right, and gives you an excuse to browse a few stores.
Collect miniature bears. The advantage of this collection is not only its cute factor but its small size; it's a lot easier to store and display smaller teddies. There are early versions from Steiff and Schuco, many hand-crafted versions from artisan stores and markets, and lots of versions from different decades.Collect dressed bears. These are bears with clothes, and the clothes can be a point of interest as much as the bears. Bear artists often dress bears, and you'll also find both vintage and modern clothed bears, depending on your preference.
Collect special edition bears. These began being issue around the 1980s, especially as major teddy bear manufacturers began celebrating milestones.Special editions are also issued by companies such as Disney.
Collect travel bears. This could be a collection based on buying teddy bears whenever you travel. You'll need to decide what the parameters are, such as a teddy from each city or country, only collectible teddies, or deliberately going to a place known for making teddies, etc. If you love travel and teddy bears, it's a great way to combine both passions.
Collect bears made by teddy bear artists. What defines who is a teddy bear artists is arguable but at the very least, look for quality, originality, individualist creations that will stand the test of time. Liking the creation is an absolute plus.
Collect all things ""teddy bear"". In others words, not just the teddy bears but also other items which have teddy bear designs or shapes, such as china figurines, posters, clothing, cards, key-rings, etc.
Collect bears with a ""story"" behind them. For example, bears which have survived certain historical events, bears that come from famous owners, bears that have helped their owners cope with life in some way, etc.;
, This is important because it helps you to work out whether you're paying a fair price for teddies you want to add to your collection, along with knowing what to look for by way of tags, accessories, etc.


Grab hold of a teddy bear identifier or guide. This should be a book with really good photographs of the teddy bear types, along with detailed information about the background (the manufacturer, date, country of origin, height, etc.) and other information that helps you to identify the bears. Get a few of these, if possible, from different decades, as things change over time and even up-to-date books may be missing some vital information. Visit a library or a specialist collection rather than attempting to buy lots of these books––unless you want to, of course (a collection possibility of its own).
Unfortunately, as with any area of collectibles, there are fakes when the stakes are high. By knowing what things should form part of the teddy bear, you are more likely to know how to spot fake teddy bears than someone who hasn't done their homework.

, For modern bears that are still being produced, these sources are your best option. Always keep your purchase receipts/purchase trail; if you find any problems with the teddy bear after purchasing, you can return the bear and either ask for it to be replaced or fixed, as appropriate.

, for older bears. You never know what you might find in any of these sources, so this involves a lot of rummaging, hit-and-miss and hope. However, it's fun to look in these places and you may unearth a really special teddy every now and then.


Get friendly with local antique sellers who do stock toys, including teddy bears. If you let them know what you're looking for, many of them will be keen to keep an eye out for you when they do their buying and it's an extra source of help for your collection.

, Both online and real time in-house auctions (especially toy auctions) will often have an array of bears that you can browse through and decide to bid on. Remember to keep within your budget and have your highest bid set. Avoid letting your emotions overtake your budget when bidding on bears. No matter how rare that bear, remind yourself if it goes over your highest bid point that there will be some other gem of a bear that you can afford some other time. It may not be the same bear but you'll keep an intact budget.

, This may result in bears that you're not so keen on but it is one way to get teddy bears that may have a long history and could be either very sentimental or valuable (or maybe even both).


Ask family and friends to donate any of their unwanted teddy bears to you.
Leave ""wanted"" messages on sites such as Freecycle, or any other forum online where asking for freebies is allowed.
Place an advertisement in the newspaper asking for unwanted teddy bears for your collection. Be aware that people may expect to be paid if you advertise, so make it clear that it's donations only.

, Even if you're just collecting bears based on non-valuable reasons, it's still important to get bears that are worth the money you part with for them. The following section details some of the things to take note of, especially if you are parting with a lot of money for a collector's bear.

, The older the bear, the more its features may have somewhat ""shifted"" over time, reducing its collectible value. This doesn't mean the bear isn't worth having (after all, you can see it needs love), it just means that the price must be fair. Some questions to ask yourself include:


What is the condition of the eyes? Are they still in the bear's head, are they scratched or worn, or are they even the original eyes for that bear? Boot-button eyes were the standard for bears pre World-War I, glass from the 1920s (slightly earlier in Britain) and plastic from the 1950s.Replaced eyes should be as close to the originals as possible, showing the right size and color.Do the ears sit properly? Sometimes the original ears were replaced; check the seam lines on older bears, as well as old advertisements for the bear.Is the nose original? If it isn't, is the replacement as close to the original as possible? For those in-the-know, the stitching of the nose is a giveaway of the manufacturer.
Know your bear stuffing. If you collect older teddy bears, it pays to know what the bear has been stuffed with. Early bears were stuffed with kapok, making them very light; crunchy bears were stuffed with wood wool. Later stuffings included sub-stuffing, lightweight foam, excelsior, etc. This varies by country.Look for character in the bear. This is subjective but still important. Does the teddy bear's look attract you? Does the bear seem to have a character or personality to you? This can be easier to discern if purchasing face-to-face; online buys will make this aspect harder to work out.
Teddy bear or doll hospital repairs (common 50 or so years ago) come with their own charm and history. They don't necessarily condemn the teddy to lesser value, but it does help if you have the full history of that bear, such as a seller's explanation of a visit to a bear hospital in 1952. If you get such explanations, type them up and include them with the teddy bear so that the story is not lost.

, Labels, if they are still on the bear, will usually be found in the ear or on the arm of the teddy bear. Early bears didn't always come with labels, and homemade bears often lack them too. Labels can help you to identify the origins and make of the bear but beware of fake labels if the bear is worth a lot.


Bear labels can be collectibles in their own right.
If you purchase bears made by modern bear artists, with labels attached, keep the labels intact for future identification and value.

, Much-loved bears tend to get holes, then patches and stitches. This doesn't mean they're not worth collecting but it does mean that you should be alert to the possibility that the bear has weaknesses and if it's a vintage collectible, this can affect the value.


Look for split seams, tears or rips and poor repair work. These can reduce the value of the teddy bear.
Check under clothing on dressed bears, to see what it may be concealing by way of replaced bear parts or repairs.
Is it faded? Over time we all fade, bears too. Check the color under joints or areas under clothing and compare to the exposed parts of the bear to see how much fading has occurred.
Are the joints working in the bear (if it is jointed)? Limbs may have been stitched back on; check closely.If the teddy bear has a voice-box or squeaker, does it work? More than likely it won't in an old bear, as that's just what happens over time. Beware poor modern replacements.Not all teddy bears are fixable. If the material is falling apart on the teddy bear, it's on its last legs and either avoid it or offer to take it out of pity, for free.

, If purchasing brand new teddy bears just for the purpose of maintaining a collection, leave all tags in place and keep the boxes or other packaging as well. These can all increase the value of the teddy bear. If you don't have space for boxes, undo them with care and pack them flat somewhere safe from insects and disturbance.


Be sure to keep all certificates, ""birth"" documents and any other related items with the collection too. You might like to consider having a separate folder for these things. Have digital shots of them too and keep these as back-ups in case you lose the paper ones, although they are only for information as they won't increase the value most times.

, Teddy bear collections are more valuable when the bears forming the collection are kept in as good a condition as possible, given age, make and rarity. Things to bear in mind include:


Only surface clean teddy bears, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
If a teddy bear needs washing, read the care label first and follow its instructions. Only bears post the 1970s will have such labels, if at all. If the teddy bear is valuable, old or fragile (as opposed to modern, machine-washable teddy bears) and you cannot find suitable washing instructions, seek advice from a reputable toy store or a fabric conservator first.
Keep the teddy bears in an environment that prevents their decay. Things that can harm a teddy bear collection include dampness, high humidity, mildew or mold, heat, sunlight, insects, etc.
Keep out of the reach of children and pets. Both will see teddy bears as playthings, which they are, but not once they're part of your collection!
Display them so as to protect them. See the display section below for advice.

, Things happen, such as burglary, fire, flood, your child's marker pen, etc. Getting insurance is a form of at least getting back some of the value of your precious collection should the unthinkable happen. If you're going to sink money into items for collecting, insurance should always be a part of your expenses.

, The more bears you collect, clearly the more space you need. Unlike stamps, coins or trading cards, bears take up a lot of space over time, so you do need to think about where they can be placed and whether you can spare a corner of a room in your house for placing the bears on display. Once you hit serious collector numbers from around 10 onwards, those bears will begin to take over!

, Cabinets or display cases behind glass are good, as they help to keep off dust while providing shelves for the bears to be arranged on; the glass also allows for ease of viewing. Shelving can be used too but if it's open to the air, you'll need to dust off the teddies regularly.


Lockable display units can be handy to prevent the intrusion of curious, sticky fingers.

, The following things should be heeded when displaying teddy bears:


Do not display them in direct sunlight or near a heat source. Both will cause the bears to fade and/or deteriorate.
Ensure that moths do not have access to your teddy bears. There are plenty of moth-ridding solutions you can use in the vicinity of the teddy bears. Do not place any chemical substance on the teddy bears themselves.
Keep the bear display area clean. Regularly clean the display area and gently brush away dust from the teddy bears.

Some good things to do outside are: hopscotch, tossing a ball back and forth, or sliding down slides at a park.
Some good things to do inside are: playing board games, dressing up in silly outfits, having a tea party, or playing with toys together.;
, Teddy bears make good listeners. They don't interrupt and they stare right at the pictures. Read teddy some of your favourite books or stories before bedtime or during the day.


Help teddy read by pointing its paw at pictures or helping it turn the page.

, Teddy bears love to watch T.V. and movies, especially with you. Just set teddy in a seat on the couch or on your lap and snuggle together while you watch your favourite movie or show.


Remember to ask your parent or guardian if you can watch a certain show or movie. Some shows or movies may be too scary for teddy.

, Teddy bears are great listeners. They never interrupt and their ears are always open. Tell teddy about your day, your dreams, or stories you've heard or made up.


When you have had a bad day at work or school, talk to your teddy about it. They are great listeners and will be very sympathetic.

, Give your teddy bear pretend foods such as pretend fruit, vegetables, and fish. Give your teddy healthy foods to keep it strong. However, an occasional treat such as a pretend cupcake or slice of birthday cake is perfectly fine and will make teddy feel special and happy.


Make your own food with air-dry clay or Play-Doh.
The food teddy eats cannot be eaten by you. Special teddy food is only good for teddy bears and can make humans sick.

, Whenever you take teddy anywhere, remember that you have it with you. Take care to collect it after a play-date or a visit to the park.


If you lose your teddy bear, ask your friends and family to help you look for it.
Write your name on teddy. You can put a necklace on teddy with your name on it or write your name on its paw. That way, if you lose teddy, someone will know it is yours.

, If teddy is ripped, stepped on, or thrown around, make teddy feel better by helping it heal its wounds. Your parent or guardian can help patch up open wounds and replace any lost stuffing.


Put bandaids on teddy's wounds and kiss them better.
Let teddy rest if it gets hurt.

, This could be inside a cardboard box, in a corner of your room, or inside a wardrobe.


Add pictures to the walls of you and teddy, or teddy's favourite pictures you've drawn.
If teddy has lots of toys, give it a toy box to store all its toys. A clean home, free of clutter, is important to teddy.

, Use baby doll clothes and clothes from other stuffed toys to dress teddy. There even special stores to dress teddy bears that offer a variety of outfits, accessories, and even shoes.


If you or a grown up is handy with a needle, sew some new clothes from scrap fabrics.

, You can make a small bed for your teddy bear out of a cardboard box or basket, and some pillows or blankets. Use whatever you think is good and comfortable for teddy to sleep in.


Tuck teddy into his covers each night.
You can sing a lullaby or read story to teddy before it goes to sleep.

, Hugs are good too. There are no reports of a teddy ever saying no to kisses and hugs.


Give teddy a goodnight kiss before going to sleep. Your teddy can sleep in its own bed or with you.
Allow others to give teddy hugs and kisses. Both teddy and your family and friends will appreciate some love.

, Wash your teddy bear often, especially if you go outside with teddy a lot. When washing, follow the manufacturer's care instructions. If teddy can be machine washed (check with dad or mom first), you might find How to machine wash your teddy bear useful as guidance.


Treat stains quickly. This makes it easier to get the stains out, rather than letting them set permanently. If your teddy bear has a simple food stain on it, you can blot it out with some warm water and a towel. Ask your parent or guardian for help if the teddy has a really bad stain that won't come out. They'll know what to do to help remove it.
Sometimes it may be enough to just use a wet cloth and carefully wipe over dirty parts of the teddy bear.
Keep teddy away from dirty areas. This means if you need to leave teddy at home, put it in its bed or on your bed. Or if you're outside, don't leave teddy on the ground in case it's muddy or teddy gets stepped on.

, When teddy's hair is messy, use a baby's brush or a very soft brush to gently brush teddy's fur back in place.


Do not use spiky brushes for teddy bear fur. The spikes will catch on the fur and can rip it out.

, When you aren't tucking teddy into bed or placing it on your bed, put it somewhere safe. Good places include on a shelf, inside a toy box or chest or sitting on a chair.


Don't leave teddy on the floor, in direct sunlight, next to a heater or squashed under heavy things. These sorts of places can hurt teddy and cause teddy's fur to change colour or its body to become misshapen.

Choose a space for the city.,
Think about how many bears you want in your city.,
Finally, choose your bears carefully.",How to Create a City of Teddy Bears1," A small corner of your room, your empty walk in closet, or an empty guest room will all work!;
, If you have a small space, like a corner of your room, it is best to just do 1-5. A medium space, like a walk in closet, can house 6-10 bears. And a large space, like an empty guest room, will house anywhere from 11-60 bears, depending on the size of the room.

, If cardboard boxes are going to be the houses, it is best to go with something such as a Beanie Baby. If your city is in your walk in closet, best not chose the 10-Foot teddy bear you won at the fair last week. And even if you have a huge room that your city will be in, try not to use the 10-foot bear, as it will hog up the whole room! Your city will look neater if all of your inhabitants are the same size (18 inch, 12 inch, etc)


Conclusion - Rooms, bears, and sizing all come to mind when choosing an appropriate population for your city.

If your bear does not already have a hole in a seam through which the stuffing can be removed, very carefully open a straight seam (such as the back seam) by cutting the seam thread with a pair of scissors, a very sharp knife, or a seam ripper.,

Very gently hand-wash the now empty fur in warm water with a mild laundry detergent.,

Remove the excess water by placing an old towel on the floor, placing the bear on the towel, folding the towel over the bear, then standing on it.,
Blow dry the bear with a blow dryer, being careful not to scorch the fur.,

Tease out the matted knots if the bear's fur was matted, after the bear is dry.,

Turn the teddy bear inside out to examine each seam for holes and to examine the thread which may be, if the teddy bear is very old, weak and rotten.,
Turn the bear right side out.,
Replace missing eyes if necessary.,

Fill each of the legs and arms using a ball of polyester fiberfill approximately 6 times the size of the volume of the cavity to be filled, packing each very tightly.,
Fill the head and body cavity, using one large clump of fiberfill for each.,

Sew the seam closed that you've packed the fiberfill through.
,Comb the fur to make it fluffy.,Dress your teddy in nice, clean clothes, if you and (s)he agree on it.,
Take care of your newly refurbished teddy.",How to Refurbish a Teddy Bear," Remove all of the stuffing and discard.
, Rinse well with warm water. Repeat these steps as necessary, until the wash water no longer becomes coloured with the dirt that may come out of the fur. Gently squeeze (do not wring) the fur to remove most of the water., This will squeeze excess water from the fur without wringing it, which could damage the fabric., Allow it to further air dry overnight to ensure the seams are completely dry., A dental pick works well. Work the pick through the knots, being careful not to pull the fur out., Sew the holes closed and reinforce the seams as needed, using either a needle and thread or a sewing machine. If a needle and thread is used, be sure to place the stitches close together and pull each stitch tight., Examine the seams and areas you've stitched to ensure the seams are tight and the stitches are invisible from the outside. Tight seams are crucial!, Buttons work well., Using one ball for each arm and leg is better than filling them with many smaller balls of fiberfill., Pack tightly, ensuring there is enough fiberfill to make the arm, leg and neck joints firm.,,,, It'll be good for decades to come."

Dress up in a Mickey outfit and show off your ears.",How to Make Mickey Mouse Ears," You will need black felt and cardboard to fashion your ears. However, if you don't have cardboard, you might be able to use construction paper that is both thick and stiff.








All materials needed for making Mickey Mouse ears can be purchased at a craft or fabric store.
If you don’t have any felt, you can paint or color the cardboard circles black or you can even paste some normal black craftsheet on the cardboard.
You could glue together several pieces of sturdy construction paper if you don’t have cardboard for the ears.
The material you use for the ears should be stiff enough so that the ears don’t flop over after affixed to the headband.

, The headband should be black and at least ½"" (1.27 cm) thick. This will form the base for your mouse ears and attach them to your head. A thicker band might give greater stability to your mouse ears.







, You will need to trace two circles, one for each ear. Each circle should be between 3” and 5” (7.6 cm and 12.7 cm) and have a ½” (1.27 cm) tab at the bottom of each circle. The circle template will look somewhat like a globe lamp. The bottom tab on the circle will serve to anchor the ears to your headband.







, Hold the paper template with one hand while you trace four circles onto your black felt. You can trace your circles with a piece of chalk. Later, you can wipe the chalk off with a wet cloth.







, This cardboard is what will support the fabric of your mouse ears, keeping them looking perky. You will need two cardboard circles, one for the left ear and the other for the right.









You can also use the bottom of a bowl to create the circles you need for the ears.

, You'll want to use very sharp scissors or fabric scissors, otherwise you might not be able to cut smooth circles in your fabric. Follow your outlines with your scissors and a steady hand. You may need to clean up the edges once you have cut the circles free.







, In the same fashion as the felt circles, but still identical in shape to those circles, you'll need to cut out your cardboard circles. These will be used to reinforce the fabric and make it sturdy.







, In most cases, household glue will be good enough to attach the felt to the front and back of each cardboard ear. This will give the ears the internal stability of cardboard, but the color and appearance of mouse ears.







, The higher quality glue used in a hot glue gun will create a better bond between the flap of the ear and the base of the band. Or, if the headband is made out of more flexible material, you can simply staple the mouse ears to the headband.







, The circles of your ears should be about 3” (7.62 cm) apart. Use your hot glue gun attach your tabs firmly to your headband. You can achieve the best placement for your ears by marking the position of each ear where you plan on attaching it to the headband.








You may need to fold the ears up and forward to encourage an upright position.

, Staples won't require time to firm up, but if you've glued your mouse ears together, you should allow 30 minutes to an hour for the glue to set. You can improve the bond between your mouse ears and headband by holding the glued parts together while the glue sets for 5 to 10 minutes., You might be able to get away with a costume comprised of Mickey's classic yellow shoes and red shorts. Or maybe you'll want to imitate one of Mickey's character roles, such as the robed assistant wizard in Disney's Fantasia.

Start with imagining.,
Look around you.,
Name it.",How to Have Fun Without Toys," Think about what you like, or like to do. Do you like animals? Does being a doctor or a fireman or an astronaut sound fun to you? Get some ideas of fun things you would do or be right now if there were no limits at all. Maybe you could role play being another character or creature. Or draw images of these things or make plans for becoming someone famous one day. Let your imagination run wild.;
, Do you normally play inside or outside? Is it safer to play inside? Do you have a big yard or park? Do you have your own room or do you play in the main part of your home? See what you have to work with and then mix your make the most of what you do have.

If indoors, you can make a fort or a pirate's ship out of lounge chairs. Imagine you are sailing the high seas or flying a plane. Make use of the furniture around you. Borrow items from the kitchen to make a noisy percussion band and create a concert for the rest of the family to hear in the evening.
If you can play outdoors, you can still play games of imagination. In addition, you can make a fort, throw around balls such as a tennis ball or a soccer ball and you can use chalk to draw pictures or make games on the ground, such as hopscotch. Use your body's skills such as running, jumping and skipping to create fun games.

, Naming your games makes them easier to remember so you can play them again and again. Once you have created your own games, they become an important part of your creativity and deserve to be remembered and played again. Some games thought up by children are set out under ""Tips"".

Insert a small drop of super glue into the hole made by the circles.,Decorate if wanted and your spinner is complete!",How to Make a Fidget Spinner1,", Depending on the type of spinner, you'll want to glue two or three pennies onto two or three water bottle caps. Three-pronged spinners are favored for their longer spin time versus the two prong., Do not glue a penny on it. Many water bottle caps have a small point in the very center. Use a craft knife or pen to make a hole in the very center of the cap. It should be big enough for the toothpick to spin without being disturbed but small enough that it won't slide out.,, Make sure the hole is perfectly aligned with your center cap's hole. Super glue the cap and plastic together, but make sure to keep the holes aligned., For a two-pronged spinner, the formation will look like a line, and for a three-pronged spinner, the formation will look like a triangle., Trace it ten times on your thin cardboard, and cut out the circles.,, Make sure that each pile has 3 circles that have holes in the center.,, Make sure that the three with holes are all touching each other directly and are on the bottom., Insert one end of your toothpick into it.

Measure the liquid latex and vinegar.,
Combine the two ingredients.,
Roll the substance into a ball.,
Wash the ball in plain water.,
Dry the ball with paper towels.,
Bounce the ball.",How to Make a Ball1," Pour 20 ml of liquid latex into one graduated medicine cup. Pour 20 ml of distilled white vinegar into a second graduated medicine cup.


Perform this experiment in a well-ventilated area since vinegar and liquid latex can produce mildly to moderately irritating fumes.
It is very important to measure out the two ingredients precisely. When used in disproportionate amounts, the chemical reaction involved will be altered and the latex may not solidify properly. If desired, graduated cylinders can be used instead of graduated medicine cups.;
, Combine the liquid latex and vinegar in a 3 oz (90 ml) plastic cup. Stir with a Popsicle stick until well combined.


The liquid latex is packaged in ammonia. When you add vinegar to it, it should neutralize the ammonia and cause the latex to solidify very quickly.
Only stir the two ingredients together until the substance congeals into a soft solid. Do not allow it to harden past the soft solid stage.

, As soon as the mass solidifies, remove the substance from the cup and begin rolling it in between your hands. Mold the latex substance into an evenly rounded ball.


You will need to work quickly since the latex will continue to solidify. It will eventually solidify to a hardened state, at which point it will be impossible to mold.
After forming the rubber into a ball, allow it to sit for a few minutes to finish hardening. When the rubber returns to its formed shape after being pressed, you can proceed to the next step.

, Submerge the completed ball into a basin of lukewarm water. Scrub and gently squeeze the ball with your hands.


You can also wash the ball under running water in a sink.
As you wash the ball, gently squeeze it to remove excess water and trapped bubbles of vinegar.
If you do not already have safety goggles, you should wear them during this step since the vinegar could splash into your eyes as you squeeze the ball.

, Remove the ball from the water and thoroughly dry it with clean paper towels.


While drying the ball, continue to gently squeeze it in your hand to remove any excess water from inside.

, Drop the ball onto a hard surface and watch it bounce.


The finished ball should be relatively soft and capable of bouncing slightly when dropped or thrown. It ball should remain in this state permanently.

Find a torch (flashlight) that emits a white light.,
Decide what color you want your light saber to be and get cellophane of that color.,
Get a few pieces of clean, white paper.,
Wrap one piece of paper around the top or the torch or flashlight.,
Wrap another piece of paper into a roll.,
Check that it's sitting straight and is firmly taped together.",How to Make a Light Saber Using Everyday Items1," The brighter, the better. If it's too weak, it may not do the trick. Most flashlights you find in your bottom kitchen drawer will do the job just fine.









If you find a flashlight/torch that's too dim, try replacing the batteries -- they may just be old.;
, Cut out a piece to cover the front of the torch, adhering with transparent tape.









Cover just the lens of the flashlight. You don't want the cellophane to show through to the base.

, Steal some from your dad's printer tray if need be -- doubt he'll miss three pieces of paper in the long run.









A4 or A3 paper both work. As long as it's clean and white, the force will be with you.

, On the underside of the paper, double over tape (or use the double-sided kind) all along the edges of the flashlight's base -- you don't want the tape to be visible.









If there is overlap, you may want to cut the paper to size. You want the light to emit evenly on all sides.

, Attach it to the end of the first piece of paper, overlapping minimally. Use the same taping method, adhering the tape on the inside of the second piece. Continue this process until you think your light saber is long enough.









If it gets too long, it may start drooping. Two or three pieces may be your limit.

, Then, turn on the torch or flashlight, turn off the lights, and have fun!









This paper version won't stand up to actual lightsaber duels. It's more for show and bragging rights than anything.
If you've time on your hands, make a light saber hilt out of a paper towel tube and insert your flashlight/torch into it.

Buy a Mamod engine.,
Decide upon either one that remains in a fixed position, known as a Stationary Engine or one that moves along the ground known as a Mobile Engine.

,
Know that there are some basic things you now need to do starting with ""getting it running"" like getting water and fuel.

,
And always - ALWAYS take your alcohol or dry fuel engine outside to run it.,
Make sure that water is to be carefully poured into the boiler through the hole in the top where the Safety Valve is located.,
On the boiler back plate, either look at the Water Level Glass or as with older engines, the water level hole, and stop filling when the correct level is reached.,
If you have a Water Level Plug type, this is the time to screw it, finger tight, back into the hole.,
Fuel next.,
The liquid you need here is Methylated Spirit or methyl alcohol.,
Now you are nearly ready to fire up.,
Now check that your Safety Valve (and Water Level Plug) is tight and your water level is correct.,
Place the burner close to the engine and ready to insert under the boiler.,
Gradually the water will begin to get hot and then raise a head of steam.,
Everything should now be running smoothly and you can let it run until the fuel runs out.,
When you have had enough of running the engine, drain the water and just put it away - clean it if you want to but it's not absolutely necessary.

",How to Get a Mamod Steam Engine Going," These can be purchased cheaply on eBay and if you look there over a period of a month you will see many different types in various states of repair. They range from ""ready for restoration"" to ""immaculate unused"".;
,,, The possibility of accidental fire in the home is just too great and easily avoided.

, Do not fill the boiler. If there is an overflow hole on the end opposite to the chimney. Leave this open while filling and stop when water comes out. Use HOT water to minimise start time and maximise running time.

, There needs to be some air space left in the boiler above the water to allow pressure to build up.

, Make sure all the filler and overflow holes have their caps screwed back into place before fueling.

, Now let's look at what to do about fueling up. There are two types of fuel. Present day fuel is in solid tablet form which are placed into a burner tray. It may be necessary to cut these tablets down in size to fit your particular burner as they do differ in size in accordance with the boiler size. Older models have spirit burners which contain either non replaceable gauze or replaceable wicks that soak up their liquid fuel.

, With old type rectangular shaped gauze style burners you should pour an amount of Methylated Spirit directly into the top of the burner. The burners were sized to be filled until you can just see the alcohol on top of the gauze. There will then be enough fuel for a good run of the boiler, but not enough to boil it dry. Do not refill the burner without topping up the boiler again. If you have an even older type of engine it will have a round tank burner with wicks numbering between one to three. Again, just fill up the tank through the filler hole and refit the brass screw cap finger tight.

, But wait, you need to squirt oil onto the moving parts. To put it simply, any moving parts that are in friction contact with another need some oil. You can but Mamod oil although any oil is better than no oil! Castor oil is one of the most effective options available. You can use car engine oil, handyman oil or the real thing. Don't use grease as it will not flow and so will not lubricate fully.

, Spin the flywheel using your finger to get the oil around a bit and to ensure everything runs smoothly.

, Just practice this once before light up. And then, the action begins! Using a box of matches, ignite the burner and using the burner handle, place the burning burner neatly under the boiler. From now on, do not leaving your engine until the burning process is completed and the hot boiler is not in harms way.

, Steam will begin to hiss in the area of the piston. Now you can gently flick round the flywheel. It revolves in a clockwise direction as seen when looking at the piston side of the engine.

, If you want to stop it running very temporarily you may place your finger into the flywheel to restrict its movement. If you do that, the Safety Valve will fizz with boiling steam and water until you allow the flywheel to run again. This is not a dangerous thing to do and can be quite fun but just be wary of the very hot spitting steam!

Look at your combat style.,
Consider your physique.,
Look at your philosophy.,
Consider your training with other weapons.",How to Choose a Lightsaber1," Which form do you prefer? Makashi? Soresu? Djem So? Something else? Particular forms work better with different lightsaber styles.;
, A short person would have real trouble wielding a lightclub. A strong person probably doesn't want to use a curved-hilt lightsaber. Certain lightsabers require certain physical traits to wield effectively.

, Pacifist Jedi were disapproving of weapons such as the saberstaff, calling them ""more slaughter per swing"". Sith, on the other hand, loved weapons like this. More aggressive people probably want lightsabers that do greater damage, and more pacifist people should choose sabers better suited to defense (funnily enough, a saberstaff fits both these requirements).

, Quarterstaff or bo staff training lends itself well to saberstaff wielding. Whip users can become lightwhip users. Ever practised with one of those batons that policemen (or stormtrooper TR-8R) use - the one with a handle sticking out of the side? Look no further than the guard shoto.

Get your materials.,
Measure and pour the Waterglass.,
Measure and pour the Ethanol.,
Quickly combine the two.,
Form the ball.,
Let it set.",How to Make a Bouncy Ball2," This project should be done with an adult's help, as some of the materials are dangerous. You'll need:


Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol, you can usually find this sold with household cleaning supplies)
Waterglass (if you can't buy this at your local store, you can make it yourself by mixing lye, crushed silica gel beads, and water)
Rubber gloves
Two glass bowls
A stirring stick, like a Popsicle stick

, Pour 4 teaspoons into one bowl.

, You'll need to pour 1 teaspoon into a separate bowl from the Waterglass.

, Quickly pour the contents of one bowl into the other and immediately start stirring with the stick.

, Once the material is all mixed and solid, put on the gloves and form the mixture into a ball, compressing and smoothing.

, Wait until the ball is dry and the surface no longer crumbles. Now it is ready for play and can be touched with bare hands. This ball should not be left around young children, as it is not safe to go in mouths. Enjoy your super bouncy ball!

Heat the milk.,
Add the vinegar.,
Let cool.,
Strain out the clumps.,
Dry with paper towels.,
Roll the substance into a ball.,
Give it a bounce.,
Dry until hardened.",How to Make a Ball2," Pour 1/2 cup (125 ml) of whole milk into a small saucepan. Set it on the stove over medium heat.


Allow the milk to heat to a simmer. Do not stir it during this time or allow the milk to reach a rolling boil.
As the milk heats, it will gradually separate into two parts: a liquid and a sold. This solid is made of fat, various minerals, and a protein called casein.

, Add 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the saucepan of milk. Stir until white clumps form.


After you see white clumps beginning to form, you should continue stirring for a few minutes longer.
Adding less vinegar will usually produce a slightly softer plastic, while adding more may create a slightly harder plastic.
Consider adding a pinch of cornstarch along with the vinegar. Doing so is not strictly necessary but may help the ball hold its form better. Add no more than a pinch of cornstarch, though, since too much can negatively affect the chemical reaction between the milk and vinegar.

, Turn off the heat and allow the substance to cool in the pan.


Wait until the outside of the pan feels completely cool before proceeding to the next step. This can take 30 minutes or more.
The vinegar should react with the casein during this time, producing a long chain of molecules that form a soft plastic polymer.

, Pour the cooled substance through a mesh strainer. Collect the liquid into a glass bowl and retain the solid white clumps caught by the strainer.


The liquid can be discarded once you finish separating it out.
The white solid pieces should be removed from the strainer and placed on a sheet of wax paper. These are the pieces you will use for the ball.

, Gently pat the white solid pieces with clean paper towels until they feel dry to the touch.


You will need to blot the plastic material using very light pressure. The substance will still feel somewhat tacky, and if you press the paper towel into it too firmly, it may stick and become difficult to remove.

, Gather the white pieces of soft plastic into your hands and press them together. Roll the clump between your hands until it forms a ball.


The plastic will only be flexible for several hours. This should still give you plenty of time to mold it as long as you begin immediately after straining out the solid polymer portions.

, Place the molded ball into wax paper and allow it to dry for a few hours. After that, drop the ball onto a hard surface and watch it bounce.


At this stage, the plastic should still be soft even though it can no longer be molded. The ball will be able to bounce slightly as a result.

, Return the ball to the sheet of wax paper and allow it to dry for two days or more. Try rolling the ball across a hard surface.


At this point, the plastic will be harder and may no longer bounce. The surface of the ball should no longer feel sticky, though, so you should be able to handle it without contaminating the plastic.
The ball should remain in this state permanently. If desired, you can use acrylic paint to add color or other decorations, but doing so is not necessary.

Spray paint the flashlight silver.,
Cover the flashlight head with a piece of colored acetone paper.,
Create the sword.,
Join the sword to the handle.",How to Make a Light Saber Using Everyday Items2," You obviously won’t be using this flashlight for anything other than the light saber, so make sure its not an expensive flashlight that you may need later.

Lay out newspaper outside (preferably on the driveway or a table) before spraying the flashlight and cover the top with duct or masking tape. You don’t want to spray the top of the flashlight with paint otherwise you won’t be able to “see the light force” when it’s turned on.
Spray the entire body a silver color. You may want to take a few passes with the spray paint. In fact, you don’t have to spray your saber silver either. Ask your young Jedi--he/she may desire a different color such as sparkly pink or purple. Making a homemade light saber allows you to fully customize the toy to your child’s liking.

, If you could only pick up a regular flashlight, have no fear. Your light saber can have the color of your choosing using special colored paper.

Place the flashlight, light side downward on your paper. Trace the outside of the flashlight opening so that the paper circle is slightly larger than the flashlight opening.
Cut out the paper and place over top of the flashlight. You can secure it using glue, silver duct tape or even (if large enough) a rubber band.

, Make sure the sword tubing is the desired size. Also, before you purchase it, compare the width to the size of your flashlight to ensure it can easily slip over the flashlight mouth.

Use an exacto knife to size and cut the tube to fit. However, depending upon the girth of tubing you may need to use a hacksaw to do the job. If your Jedi is especially little, you may not want him/her to play with an extremely long saber so determine what he/she can handle and cut accordingly.
Use excess tubing to “top” your saber. You will want the tube to have a top to it, so use residual plastic to create a topper. Use the top of your saber as the guide, however make the circle approximately ½ inch larger so you can completely cover the top of your tube. Use clear glue such as liquid nails or a hot glue gun to adhere the top to the sword.

, Duct tape and a little elbow grease can help this light saber show you that the force will be with you.

Slide the tubing over the top of the flashlight until the tubing covers approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the flashlight top. You will want the tubing to cover enough flashlight real estate so that it stays in place and doesn’t fall off during battle.
Glue the tube to the flashlight using liquid nails or Super Glue. Your first step to adhering the tube to the flashlight is to glue it together. Use small dabs of glue around the top of the flashlight and then slide the tube over it. Hold in place for several minutes to ensure it sticks.
Secure the tube and flashlight using silver duct tape. You can also use other colors, however if you spray painted the flashlight silver, the silver duct tape will match best. Wind the tape around the tube and flashlight several times taping the tube both above and below the flashlight mouth area for full coverage.

If you already have a style in mind, go for it!,
Understand that a standard lightsaber is the best option for most situations.,
Choose a saberstaff if you prefer a more aggressive style, or if you want to maximise defensive coverage.,
Go for a shoto or guard shoto if you can't use a full size blade, or as a second blade in Niman or Jar'kai.,
Choose paired blades if you want the best of both worlds.,
Use a curved-hilt lightsaber for elegance and precision.,
Go for a crossguard lightsaber!,
Choose a lightclub if you're a big fella.,
Go for a lightwhip if you don't care for defense.",How to Choose a Lightsaber2," Trust your instincts over which lightsaber you should go for. Let the Force guide you!

, There is a reason that it's called the ""standard"" lightsaber. This is the traditional Jedi weapon and is used for all seven classical lightsaber forms. It offers a good balance between reach and maneuverability.

, A saberstaff is a saber like Darth Maul's: big handle, blade at both ends. Having two blades, it is better at defense as there is more blade to defend with. However, when attacking, the second blade points behind you, so it is no better at attack than a regular saber. It's increased length means that it requires wide open spaces, and the bigger handle presents a large target. If thrown using Force telekinesis, it can inflict far more damage than a regular saber.

, A shoto is a short lightsaber like the one Yoda wields. The blade is typically between 1/2 and 2/3 of a metre, and the handle is smaller. A guard shoto has a second handle at right angles to the first, similar to a police baton. Shotos offer increased maneuverability at the expense of range, but are easier to handle than a regular saber.

, Paired blades are a pair of lightsabers that can be joined at the hilt to form a saberstaff, like the ones Asajj Ventress uses. They can be used as a single blade, dual blades or as a saberstaff. As such, they have very few weaknesses, but require extensive training to use properly.

, These sabers fit better in the palm and allow for quick changes to the angle of attack, disrupting an opponent's defense. These sabers are most often used by Makashi practitioners, such as Count Dooku.

, These offer all of the benefits of a standard lightsaber, plus they offer hand protection. The original crossguard saber had one guard, slanted towards the blade at 45 degrees. Kylo Ren's saber has two guards at right angles to the main blade. The guards do make it a bit harder to do spins, though, as they can catch on your hand - possibly slicing off your thumb. Make sure you don't do this.

, A lightclub (or greatsaber) is kind of the opposite of a shoto - instead of a scaled down lightsaber, it's a lightsaber that's been made bigger and heavier. These carry a lot more momentum in their blows, but can only be wielded by Jedi that possess a large amount of strength

, A lightwhip is the lightsaber version of a whip - a long, flexible tendril of lightsaber, up to ten feet (3m) long. A lightwhip can be very difficult to defend against, as it can wrap around your blade and rip it from your hand. They also have substantial shock value - almost nobody has ever encountered one. However, there are good reasons why - the lightwhip has a vast array of weaknesses. There are ways to compensate, however. You can use a shoto alongside your lightwhip, or use some kind of saberstaff hybrid - whip on one side, blade on the other (obviously don't activate both at once). Or you can do what Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith, did: make a lightwhip with multiple tendrils, some energy, some solid, that can lash out at multiple angles simultaneously. Here are some weaknesses:


The blade is weaker than that of a lightsaber. This stops it from cutting through walls, although it can still cut flesh.
The blade can short out if it is hit hard enough with a lightsaber.
A lightwhip has absolutely no defensive value. Being flexible, a lightwhip cannot block another saber. This pretty much eliminates lightwhips as an option for most Jedi.
It is very easy to hit yourself with a lightwhip.
It's useless against dual blades - your opponent can tangle your whip with one blade, then use the other to kill you.

"
"
Look at the style of the hilt.,
Decide on a finish on the hilt.,
If you have paired blades, decide on the locking mechanism.,
If you want other options, go for them!",How to Choose a Lightsaber3," Find something that you like. You might want a leather handgrip, or metal ridges, or axe-style blades on either side of the lightsaber blade (check out Darth Malgus' lightsaber).

, Darth Sidious and Mace Windu had hilts finished in electrum (a gold-silver alloy). Kylo Ren has a very weathered, utilitarian look to his hilt. Most hilts, however, appear to be somewhere in between, with a matte or metallic finish to them.

, This is the mechanism that joins the sabers together to form a staff. It is usually a simple twist to lock mechanism, but some have a fibre cable that allows you to hold one hilt and use the other as a flail.

, This is especially true if you're making your own saber. The possibilities for customisation are endless. For example, Pong Krell, a general in the Clone Wars, had saberstaffs (Yes, saberstaffs, plural. The guy had four arms.) with handles that folded in half, to make them easier to carry.

Cut out eight fabric panels.,
Pin pairs together.,
Sew the pairs.,
Stitch together two sets.,
Match and stitch the two halves.,
Turn and stuff.,
Sew the opening.,
Cut out two circles.,
Attach the circles to the ball.,
Toss the ball around.",How to Make a Ball3," Cut eight identical lens-shaped (football-shaped) panels of fabric. The panels should each be 5 inches (12.7 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide at their widest point.


The panels must all be the same size and shape. To ensure consistency, cut out your first panel, then trace the shape of that panel onto your fabric seven more times. Cut out each of the remaining seven panels along those outlines.
If you have difficulty creating the panel pattern yourself, you can use the pattern provided here: http://www.purlbee.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/smallmediumball.pdf

Felt and other fray-resistant materials are the easiest to work with, but any fabric can be used. Similarly, you can use either one color or multiple colors depending on your aesthetic preference.

, Match two panels together with the right sides facing toward each other. Hold the panels in place using straight pins.


Repeat with the remaining six panels. When done, you should have four sets with two panels each.

, Stitch from point to point along one curved edge of your first panel pair. Leave 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.


Note that you can hand stitch or machine stitch the pieces together. If hand stitch, use a back stitch. If machine stitching, use a straight stitch.
Leave the other curved edge open for now.
Repeat this step with the other three panel pairs. When finished, you should have four quarter pieces.

, Match the right side of one quarter piece with the right side of another quarter piece. Pin together, then stitch along one shared edge, sewing from point to point.


Backstitch by hand or straight stitch by machine.
Use 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.
Leave the other edge open.
Repeat with the other two quarter pieces. When done, you should have two half spheres, each consisting of four separate panels.

, Match the two half-spheres together with the right sides facing one another. Pin in place, then sew along both curved edges.


Sew from point to point along the first curved edge.
For the second curved edge, start 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top point, then sew all the way to the bottom point.
Backstitch by hand or straight stitch by machine, and use a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.

, Turn the ball right-side out by pulling the material through the 1-inch (2.5-cm) gap. Stuff the ball with cotton batting.


Use plenty of stuffing to create a firm ball with a spherical shape.

, Carefully fold the open slit, then blind stitch along this opening to close the ball.


Fold the raw edges of the opening inward by 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). Try to hold the edges in place as you stitch them together to create a clean edge.
You must blindstitch the opening by hand to keep the edge as even and hidden as possible.
At this point, the ball is sealed and can technically be used now. To create a more traditional ""beach ball"" appearance, however, you'll need to follow a few more steps.

, Cut two identical circles, each with a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).


If using fray-resistant material, like felt, you do not need to do anything more than cutting the circles out.
If using material that can fray, you should fold the edges under by 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) and press the folds with an iron to hold them in place.

, Center one circle over one end of the ball (the spot at which the points of each panel meet). Whipstitch the circle in place or use fabric glue to adhere it.


Fabric glue is recommended for balls made of fray-resistant material, but whip stitching the circle by hand is advisable for fabrics that fray.
Repeat with the other circle and the other end of the ball.

, At this point, the ball should be finished and ready to play with.

",How to Make Homemade Chalk1," Aside from the ingredients you need to make the chalk, you also need to pick out molds. Search around your house and go to the craft supply store to compile the following list of supplies:









Plaster of Paris. You can get a large tub of this from most craft stores. You'll need 1/2 cup per batch of chalk.
Tempera paint.This type of paint washes away easily, which is convenient if you'll be using your chalk on the sidewalk or on a chalkboard. Choose as many colors as you'd like.
Wax paper. You'll need this to line your chalk molds, so that the chalk doesn't stick to them.
Items to use as molds. You can use old toilet paper tubes, paper towel tubes, ice cube trays (as long as you don't use them again to make ice), or any other type of tube or carton.
Masking tape. You'll need this to cover the bottom of the tube molds to keep the chalk mixture inside.;
, Line the molds with wax paper so that the waxed part is facing up. If you're using tubes, tape one end with masking tape to keep the chalk mixture contained.








, You'll need two tablespoons of paint per batch of chalk. Measure it out into bowls, with one color per bowl. You can also mix paints to create new colors; for example, mix red chalk with yellow to make orange chalk, or blue with yellow to make green. Just make sure the total amount of paint in each bowl adds up to 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml).








, Scoop 1/2 cup of plaster of Paris into each bowl. Stir thoroughly so that the mixtures are fully incorporated and free of lumps.








, This helps the chalk wash away more easily. Just stir one or two drops into each bowl of chalk mixture.








, Use a spoon to help you pour the chalk mixtures into individual molds, one for each color. Fill the molds as high as you'd like; the chalk mixture won't expand as it dries. Cover the molds with waxed paper when you're finished.








, Place the chalk in a dry place to let the moisture evaporate overnight. The chalk is ready to use when it's completely dry.

Find two small mirrors about the same size.,
Cut the tops off two clean milk cartons.,
Tape the two cartons together.,
Cut a hole on one side just big enough for a mirror.,
Insert a mirror facing the hole at a 45º angle.,
Cut a hole at the other end, facing the opposite direction.,
Insert the second mirror facing the second hole.,
Look into one hole and adjust.,
Attach the mirrors permanently.",How to Make a Periscope1," You can use any flat mirrors, whether the frame is rectangular, round, or some other shape. The two mirrors don't even have to be the same shape, but they do need to be small enough to fit into a milk carton.


You may be able to find small mirrors at a craft or art supply store, or from an online store.;
, Find two empty milk cartons, each at least one quart (one liter) in size and wide enough to fit your mirrors. Cut off and discard the triangular top of each one, then wash the inside thoroughly to get rid of smells.


A long, sturdy cardboard tube could also work.
You could use a large, flat sheet of sturdy cardboard instead. Lightly score it with a craft knife to divide it into four sections, then fold it into a box and tape together.

, Use packing tape or another strong tape to tape the open ends of the cartons together, making one long box. To fasten the cartons together more securely, try taping the inside of the box together on one side, then taping all four outside surfaces.


You can tape two tubes or two homemade cardboard cartons together in the same way, to make a longer periscope. However, the longer the periscope is, the smaller the image will be., Place one of the mirrors on one of the vertical sides of the milk carton, about 1/4 of an inch (6 mm) from the end.Trace the mirror with a pencil, then cut on the pencil marks to create a hole.


A craft knife may be the easiest tool for cutting the hole, but should only be used with adult supervision, as it is very sharp.
If you are using a cardboard tube instead of a milk carton, flatten it slightly so you can trace the mirror.

, Use sticky putty or double-sided tape to attach the mirror you traced onto the inside wall of the carton, across from the hole you cut. Arrange the mirror so the whole surface can be seen when you look through the hole, but have it point downward toward the opposite end of the carton at a 45º angle.


To test whether it's at a 45º angle, use a ruler to measure the distance from the closest corner of the carton to where the lower edge of the mirror touches the carton's side. Then measure the distance from the same corner to the opposite end of the mirror, where it touches the carton's top. The two distances will be the same if the mirror is angled at 45º.
Don't use glue yet, since you might need to make adjustments to the mirror's position.

, To find out where to cut, place the carton in front of you on its short end, with the first hole you cut near the top. Rotate the carton so that hole is on the opposite side. The second hole will go on the side that is now facing you, right at the bottom of this side. Trace the second mirror and cut as you did before.

, Just like the first mirror, this should be visible from the hole, and should face the other end of the carton at a 45º angle. At this angle, one mirror will reflect light directly down through the periscope, and the second will reflect it directly through the hole and into your eye. You will see this reflected light as an image of whatever is on the opposite hole of your periscope.

, Do you see a clear image when you look through one of the holes? If it is blurry, or you only see the inside of the periscope, adjust the position of the mirrors. Once both of them are at 45º angles, you should be able to see through the periscope clearly.

, If putty or tape isn't enough to keep the mirrors steady, attach them with glue. Once they're permanently stuck in the right position, you can use your periscope to spy on people, or see over the top of a crowd.


If too much light is coming through the ""eye"" end of your periscope, making it difficult to see the reflection, tape black construction paper over the outside edges of the hole.

Combine ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of warm water with ½ cup (50 grams) of Plaster of Paris in a small bowl or a large cup.,
Mix in 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of tempera paint.,
Transfer the mixture into your mold once the mixture begins to thicken.,
Let the chalk dry.,
Remove the chalk from the molds and allow the chalk to finish drying.",How to Make Sidewalk Chalk2," Mix the two together with a plastic spoon until you get a thick, soupy mixture. There should be no clumps.


Plaster of Paris will begin to harden within 20 to 30 minutes, so you will need to work quickly.;
, The more paint you use, the brighter your color will be. The less paint you use, the lighter your color will be. Be sure that there are no streaks or swirls in your mixture. The color should be even.


If you want to make different colors, divide the Plaster of Paris mixture between two to three small cups. Stir in about 1 tablespoon of paint into each cup.
For an even more creative twist, you can use glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent paint instead of standard tempera paint.Glow-in-the-dark paint will allow the chalk to glow at night. Fluorescent paint will allow the chalk to glow under a black light.

, You can use almost anything that can hold liquids without leaking as a mold. For example, you can use a normal ice cube tray, or one with fun shapes, such as stars or fish. You can also use toilet paper rolls. Click here to learn how to make toilet paper rolls into chalk molds.


If you are using ice cube trays, be sure to wipe any spills and leaks with a damp paper towel before the chalk dries.
If you made toilet paper tube molds: line the tubes up on a baking sheet with the tape side facing down. Carefully spoon the colored mixture into each tube. Gently flick the side of each tube with your index finger to bring any trapped air bubbles to the surface.

, This can take anywhere between one to three days, depending on the size of your molds. For example, a simple ice cube tray may take as little as a day to dry, while toilet paper rolls will take up to three days.

, Once you pop the chalk out of the molds, you may notice that the underside is still damp. If this happens, simply spread the chalk out on a dry, flat surface with the damp part facing upwards. It should be dry within an hour.


If you used toilet paper tubes: peel off the duct tape and flip over each tube so that the bottoms can dry. After the chalk has finished drying, peel off the cardboard and wax paper.

Fill a muffin tin or several squeeze bottles with cornstarch.,
Add a few drops of food coloring into each well or bottle.,
Fill each well or bottle the rest of the way with water.,
Mix the cornstarch and water until you get an even consistency.,
Adjust the mixture, if necessary.,
Use the paint.",How to Make Sidewalk Chalk3," Fill each well or bottle halfway with cornstarch. If you see any clumps, break them up with a fork or by shaking the bottle.


A muffin tin will act like a paint palette. You will need a paintbrush to use the paint. It is great for painting pictures.
A squeeze bottle will allow you to squirt the paint out onto the sidewalk. It is great if you want to create random designs.

, The more food coloring you use, the brighter or darker your chalk will be. You can fill each well or bottle with the same color. You can also fill each well or bottle with a different color.


To make scented liquid sidewalk chalk: mix 1 envelope of a powdered fruit drink with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.You will be adding this mixture to the cornstarch in the next step. Skip the food coloring, as the fruit juice will be enough to give the chalk some color.

, If you are making the scented version, pour your drink mixture into each well or bottle.


Try to use equal parts water and cornstarch.
For a thicker paint, use one part water to one-and-a-half parts cornstarch., If you are making the liquid sidewalk chalk in a muffin tin, use a fork. If you are making the liquid sidewalk chalk in a squeeze bottle, close the bottle tightly and shake it. Make sure that there are no clumps. The color should be even once you are done mixing.

, A thicker paint will be easier to paint with, but a thinner paint will be easier to squirt out of a squeeze bottle. If the paint is too thin, add more cornstarch. If the paint is too thick, add more water. Be sure to mix your paint well once you add the extra cornstarch or water.

, Dip a paintbrush into the muffin tin wells, and paint pictures on your sidewalk. If you are using a squeeze bottle, hold it horizontally over the sidewalk and give it a quick squeeze.

Create your color base in a cup.,
Add ½ cup (65 grams) cornstarch to the mixture.,
Pour the mixture into ice cube trays.,
Freeze the chalk.,
Remove the chalk from the ice cube trays as you would remove ice cubes.,
Play with the ice chalk.",How to Make Sidewalk Chalk4," Combine ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of washable tempera paint. Stir the water with a spoon until the color is even. There should be no streaks.


For stronger colors, use more paint. Use less for lighter or pastel colors.

, Stir well until all of the powder has dissolved. Make sure that there are no clumps or streaks. The mixture should still be a liquid at this point, but it should be much thicker than standard paint.

, Gently sift the trays back and forth with your hands to bring any air bubbles to the surface.


If you want to get creative, use ice cube molds or freezable candy molds with fun-shaped compartments, such as stars or fish.
Alternatively, you can pour the liquid chalk into popsicle molds. Don't fill the molds all the way; the liquid will expand as it freezes. Insert the tops of the molds into the liquid chalk, snapping them in place., Carefully place the ice cube trays in your freezer. Make sure that they are sitting flat, or the tops will freeze crooked. Leave the trays in the freezer undisturbed until the chalk freezes. This will take several hours.

, Pour them into a bowl. If you made several different colors, you might want to separate the cubes by color. If you used popsicle molds, simply pull the popsicles out.

, You can draw with the ice chalk as you would with normal chalk. You can also leave the chalk on the sidewalk and let it melt into colorful puddles.


Note that ice chalk will melt as you play with it, so it can get pretty messy.
The colors may seem dull or translucent at first. Once the water dries, however, the colors become more vibrant.

Combine 1 cup (125 grams) of cornstarch and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of white distilled vinegar in a bowl.,
Pour the mixture into four, plastic resealable bags.,
Add 8 to 10 drops of food coloring into each bag.,
Zip the bag closed and mix the coloring into the cornstarch vinegar.,
Consider making some baking soda ""bombs."",
Add the baking soda into each bag and close it quickly.,
Shake each bag vigorously and set it down on the sidewalk.",How to Make Sidewalk Chalk5," Mix the two together until there are no streaks.

, Try to fill each bag about one third of the way with the mixture., Use a different color for each bag. The more drops you add, the brighter your color will be.


You can also use liquid watercolor paints. This will make the chalk easier to clean up in the end.

, You can do this by jiggling the bag or by massaging it. You should be left with a very thick liquid. There should be no clumps or streaks of color.


When closing the bag, try to leave as little air as possible inside it.

, Some people like to add the baking soda directly into the plastic bags, while others find that making little bombs first is easier. To make a baking soda bomb, do the following:


Cut a paper towel into fourths; you'll end up with four, smaller squares.
Drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of baking soda in the center of each square.
Fold the paper towel around it to create a little bundle. Don't wrap the towel so tightly that the bundle can't easily open on its own.

, Open each bag wide enough to slip the baking soda inside. Seal it quickly. Once again, make sure that there is as little air left in the bag.


If you made baking soda bombs, simply drop one bomb into each bag.
If you did not make a baking soda bomb, simply add 1 tablespoon of baking soda into each bag.
The bag must be completely sealed. If there are any holes or leaks, the air will escape through the gap rather than building up inside the bag.

, Step back quickly or you will get sprayed by the exploding chalk. The baking soda will react with the vinegar, causing the bag to expand. Eventually, the bag will pop or burst open, spraying the liquid chalk across the sidewalk.

",How to Make Homemade Chalk2," This all-natural method of making chalk uses ingredients you can find at the grocery store if you don't already have them on hand. Collect the following items in preparation for your chalk-making project:









Eggshells. If you are lucky enough to have an egg-laying hen, you might have a store of eggshells just waiting to be used. If not, find a way to gather as many eggshells as possible. If you start in advance you can ask your friends and neighbors to save them up for you.
Flour. This thickens the mixture and fills out the chalk.
Food coloring. Either the liquid or gel kind will work.
Molds. Use old toilet paper rolls, an ice cube tray, or any other type of mold of your choice.
Wax paper. You'll need this to line the molds.
Masking tape.

, Line your chosen molds with wax paper so that the waxed side is facing up. If you're using tubes, use masking tape to cover one end.








, Make sure they're totally dry before you begin. Use a mortar and pestle or a bowl and the back of a spoon to grind the eggshells to a fine powder. Be sure not to leave any large shards of shell; the mixture should be completely smooth.








, Mix two parts flour to one part eggshell in a bowl. Add water a little at a time until you've created a thick paste. Separate the mixture into as many bowls as you want, depending on how many colors you want to make.








, Stir a few drops of food coloring into the different bowls.








, Spoon the chalk mixture into separate molds, one for each color. Cover the molds with wax paper.









For a fun variation, try filling the molds halfway with one color, then filling up the other half with a second color.
Make marbled chalk by filling the molds with two or more colors, then using a wooden skewer to poke through the paint layers and create swirls.

, Wait at least 12 hours for the chalk to dry before popping it out of the molds and using it.

Insert a mirror into one end at a 45º angle.,
Insert the second mirror on the opposite end.,
Fix the mirrors in place once the periscope is working.",How to Make a Periscope2," Try to find a piece somewhere between 12"" and 20"", but be aware that the longer the pipe is, the smaller the image will be.You may also use two sections of slightly different sizes, so one fits snugly into the other. This lets you rotate the top of your periscope while using it, to keep a lookout all around you.


You can find PVC pipe at a hardware store or home improvement store.

, Place a curved elbow joint pipe over each end of the pipe to make a periscope shape. Have the two openings point in opposite directions if you want to look around corners or over obstacles.

, These mirrors must be small enough to insert each one into one end of the pipe. This may be easier with a circular mirror, which you may be able to find at craft stores or online.

, Use putty or strong double-sided tape to stick the mirror to the inside corner of the elbow joint with putty.Look through that elbow joint, at the mirror you just inserted. Adjust the mirror until you see the base of the pipe at the opposite end, or remove the opposite elbow joint and adjust until you can see straight through the pipe.

, Fix the mirror at the same 45º angle, so light reflected off one mirror will bounce through the pipe, hit the second mirror, and emerge through the other opening.

, Adjust the mirrors until you can clearly see through the periscope. Once the image is clear, attach the mirrors more firmly with several layers of packing tape, or with a specialized glue such as PVC adhesive or plastic epoxy."

Place the open end of one can over your ear and have your partner speak into the open end of the other can.",How to Make a Play Telephone," If you don't have cans or you don't want to work with them, you can also use cups (preferably plastic),such as the ones shown here. Plastic is a little easier to work with than metal. Styrofoam cups do not work well because they are soft and spongy and absorb sound instead of transmitting it. In a pinch, you can use disposable paper cups, but plastic and metal take more wear-and-tear.






;
, You might need your parents or teacher to help with this. You can make the hole with a drill, hammer and a nail, or some other sharp, pointed tool. If you are using plastic cups, you can probably just poke a hole with a push pin or any other sharp point. Make the holes only large enough to put the string through and no larger.








, It might help to push the string through with the end of a paper clip or thread it through with a bit of wire.








, When you’re done, pull the string tight so the knot rests in the bottom of the can. You can tie the string around a little piece of a toothpick if you can't get it to stay with just a knot.








, Tie a knot, as before, and pull the string tight.








,, Make the string as tight as you can. If you've made it correctly, you should hear your friend speak, even if it is a long piece of string. Then, talk while your friend listens.

If you don't have any at home, call a furniture store to see what they might have to spare., Lay it flat on the work surface., Tape the end piece to the side pieces. This end is very simple, just straight, so this part should be easy.

It can help to prop up the sides while doing this step, so that they don't fall and tear the tape away.

, Aim to shape the front flaps in a triangle or pitched roof shape. This may take a little fiddling and cutting but you should be able to bend the cardboard to shape. Tape in place.

Have an extra set of hands to help with this part; it will be easier than trying to do this on your own.

, Find a small but sturdy box for the post. Glue it to the base of the boat, at the point where the triangle part and the rest of the boat join. This becomes the ""post piece""., This might come from another box, or from scrap pieces.

Cut the corrugated cardboard to the width of the boat. Cut two lengths. Keep the width of the lengths proportionate to the size of the box; there should be plenty of space behind and in front of the sail post.
Glue or tape the first length across the post piece, gluing or taping to each side of the boat.
Add a small box the same width as the post piece on top of the post piece, sitting directly over the corrugated cardboard length you just added. This forms a continuation of the post piece.
Glue or tape the second length across the second post piece, attaching to both the post piece and the sides of the boat.
The end result should appear like a ""T"" with gaps in the crossbar of the ""T"".

, Paint it one color. You can add features once it has been painted., Stick one broomstick vertically into the sail post you've just created. Place the other broomstick horizontally, about 5cm/2 inches above the insertion point in the post. Wind duct tape around the join to keep it stuck to the vertical broomstick. Wind twine or rope around this to hide the duct tape and to make it stronger (it also looks more realistic).

Keep the vertical sail in place by using a plastic or metal ring just slightly larger than the pole, to prevent it from lurching about. Glue this into place before securing the two poles together.

, These can be same color as the boat, or a different color. Allow to dry fully., Tie a small fabric or plastic tablecloth triangle to one side and a large triangle piece to the other side. Tie with strong knots; you can add glue or tape if this helps to keep the sails in place.

A flag can be added to the top of the vertical pole. Attach the flag to a stick and glue or tape the stick to the top of the vertical pole.

, Pierce holes through the sides of the boat and knot around these holes to hold the base of the string lengths in place., You can add waves to the base or any other features you like too, although keeping it simple is best., This will protect the boat if used outdoors on the grass or concrete, as well as giving it more durability for play., Have the children take the boat out to the yard or playroom for a test sail.

It is okay if the sides are somewhat jagged, as you will trim it later. Once you have the flat sheet, roll it backwards along the table to undo the curve the can naturally has.;
, Cut that rectangle out and trim any jagged edges still there. Be very careful not to cut yourself. Recycle the other pieces.

, If it helps, fold it along a ruler. Unfold after you've done this.

, Cut along these lines and trim the pieces that hand off. You should have one half being 6cm x 9cm and the other being 4cm x 8cm.

, Line two edges of the smaller edge with this Blu-Tac, then flatten it out slightly.

, Press the Blu-Tac under the metal. Next, line the top of the piece you just folded over with more Blu-Tac, directly over the other bead of Blu-Tac.

, Be gentle, making sure to not tear the metal. If possible, use small pliers.

, It is not very important for the edge to be perfectly straight, but it helps a lot if it is. It should now be approximately 9cm long and 4cm wide.

, If necessary, fold it in half then flatten it.

, Wrap the first one so it is completely covered twice, then add the second straw, continuing to wrap the Blu-Tac around both straws until the Blu-Tac is used up. Make sure to add enough Blu-Tac so that the straws are well-secured by a good plug of Blu-Tac.

, Add some more Blu-Tac until it forms a good seal. Remember the Goldilocks principle: not too much, not too little.

, Fold the two outer pieces up, and squeeze them with the pliers. Add any needed Blu-Tac.

Pet D-rex.,
Feed the toy by placing something in his mouth such as the remote control bone.,
Use the remote control bone to trigger certain commands:


Attack mode.,
Wake him up.,
Turn the toy off fully by flipping the switch on its belly.

",How to Play With DRex," Petting D-rex encourages him to wag his tail and make happy sounds like one might expect from a dog. The petting sensors are on the top and back of his head. Do not pet the front of his nose, which he interprets as aggression.;
, He will chew contently on the bone till he is full at which point he will make spitting sounds.

, Press attack mode once to get D-Rex ready. Then press the button a second time to launch the attack. As you continue pressing the attack button, D-Rex will continue moving forward, roaring and chomping his mouth.
Guard mode. Pressing guard mode will prompt D-Rex to back up a few steps and start looking around the room and sniffing. Once he is done scanning the room he will sit and watch for an ""intruder"" to walk by. Every few minutes he will do another scan and sniff of the room. Once he senses movement in front of him he will automatically launch into attack mode by roaring and moving forward. If he doesn't see anything in 30 minutes, he will go to sleep.
Seek mode. D-rex will chirp to signal that he is ready for seek mode. Then you can call him with your voice and he will start walking towards you. Continue calling and he will get close enough so you can pet him. If he fails to find you, he will tire and start panting. Eventually he will whine and give up the search if he doesn't find you.
Prank mode. The prank button triggers a variety of humorous sounds such as the dinosaur fart, burp, yawn or roar. If you respond with your own sound, he will respond by moving his head, eyes and flaring his nostrils.
Question mode. Pressing this button will trigger D-rex to nod his head in agreement or shake it in disapproval. It essentially provides a random response to a yes or no question.

, After a few minutes of inactivity, D-rex will automatically ""take a nap"". You can wake him up by pressing his nose.

,
Waterproof everything with DAP kitchen and bath silicone and you are done!

",How to Make a Remote Control Toy Boat," These are the most expensive parts of the whole build.;
,, Even if you sail it on a mill pond somehow water will try to get inside. There will probably be one or more openings in the deck which you will need to get into the innards for adjustment and things like battery charging. Build a wall (coaming is the technical term) around the opening about 1 inch (2.5 cm) high, making sure it is well sealed (using glue) to the deck. Then fit a hatch cover that is a good fit over the coaming. The way to do this is first cut some thin card eg from an old Xmas card and tape it round the outside of the coaming. Cut walls for the hatch and glue them to each other at the corners while fitting around the coaming. Fit a top onto the walls. When the glue is dry remove the hatch and carefully release the card if that got stuck too. That way you can get a tight fit with just a gap equal to the thin card.

,, You can buy 'rudder assemblies' which have a flat plate—the rudder—attached to a rod—the post—that passes through a tube and on the other end has a little arm. Take it apart and remember exactly how it was because you are going to need to put it back together later. At the back end of the boat, on the center line, a little behind the propeller drill a hole for the rudder tube. Use a drill that is just a little bigger than the tube for example if your tube is a modern one it might be 6mm, so you could drill a 1/4 in hole which would be a bit bigger, but if you have lots of tools you might have a 6.1 mm drill which would be better.

,, Preferably not rusty and rather a lot less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) long.

,, Make certain the servo rod does not rub on it.

Make your batteries last.",How to Maintain a Healthy RC Car," Many RC (remote control) cars can cost $1000 or more--so knowing how to use it properly and keeping the parts working the way they are supposed to is critical.;
, When selecting a RC car, you have many types to choose from. First you want to choose if you like electric (runs off of a battery) or gas powered (runs off of gas)or Nitro (runs off nitromethane) gas car and nitro cars are most often faster-some reach speeds over 50 mph (80 km/h)! Electric and gas cars each have their strengths and weaknesses.

, A battery that is not fully connected will give you very little power.

, Different types of cars are suitable for different types of terrain. Some of the most popular are carpet cars, buggies, monster trucks, and stadium cars. There are others, these are just the most popular.

, Different types of cars work with different terrain. Carpet cars are very low to the ground and obviously can't handle jumps the way a higher, off road car can.

, Make sure you know the top speed of your car and the highest turning angle it is capable of. This could be the difference between a nasty crash and being able to use it again tomorrow.

, Make sure your motor and slipper gear are properly aligned. A mesh that is too tight will stress out the motor and ESC (electronic speed control). Make sure the mesh is not too loose either. A loose mesh could cause large amounts of power loss and will make your vehicle run less efficiently. It helps to place a piece of paper between the two gears if you are not familiar with how tight it should be. Just make sure to remove the paper before running your car.

, Before every run, make sure all screws are properly tightened and there are none missing.

, Most newer cars have adjustable collars on the shocks. Make sure these correspond with the type of terrain you will be working with. A car with no travel will not handle jumps effectively and will most likely cause damage to your car.

, Approach jumps straight with the tires facing straight ahead. Accelerating in the air is never a good idea unless you are skilled with remote control cars and know what you are doing.

, Tires should always match the type of terrain you will be running in. This will reduce tread wear, save money and increase performance.

, Get into the habit of discharging your batteries, whether they are 1200mah or 4200mah you will need to do this to preserve their lifetime and performance quality. Make sure the battery is fully discharged before charging it again, unless it's a LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery. These will fail permanently if they drop below 3.3V per cell, so make sure that your vehicle's has a low voltage cutoff (LVC) if you plan to run LiPos.

Decide on ready-built versus build-your-own.,
Buy a remote control plane.,
Build the plane (if assembly is required).,
Pre-flight the plane.,
Check which control stick operates which surfaces.,
Do a range check... with the antenna on the transmitter collapsed, walk 50–100 feet (15.2–30.5 m) away and check that your control surfaces still respond without chattering or unwanted movements.

,
Determine approximate wind speed by tying a ribbon to the end of the antenna of the remote and holding the controller parallel to the ground.,
Determine wind direction by throwing some grass clippings or other light material into the air.,
Slowly advance the power on your aircraft and wait for it to gain sufficient speed on the ground.,
Keep the throttle at 100% until the plane reaches a sufficient altitude for the size plane you're flying.,
Use a very light touch.,
Turn to the left or right by moving the appropriate control stick left or right.,
Keep the plane as level as possible; if you raise the nose too much, it may cause a stall.,
Practice an oval shaped flight pattern, keeping all turns in the same direction.,
Land the airplane by first making note of the wind direction to land into the wind.,
Flare just before the plane comes in contact with the ground by raising the nose at the last second so all three wheels touch at the same time.",How to Fly a Remote Control Plane," Do you want something pre-built, or want to assemble your own? RTF stands for Ready To Fly and includes everything including controller and battery, while ARF is Almost Ready to Fly, which assembly and the purchase of all necessary electronics (servos, ESC, receiver, battery, etc.) separately. PNF stands for Plug-n-Fly, often requiring you to buy your own battery, receiver, and transmitter separately. Do you want electric or glow (gas)? If you want to build the entire plane yourself, kits are also available.;
, Beginner planes are typically electric RTF trainers in the $50-$300 price range including battery and controller. A good Internet search is ""RTF trainer. If you have a brick-and-mortar hobby shop in your area, be sure to visit it. The employees there will be extremely helpful and knowledgeable, especially if it's a reputable store.

, Most RC planes, even RTF ones, require a bit of assembly.

, Turn on the transmitter, then the airplane. Check the direction of flight surfaces (have someone experienced check you).

, There are different conventions about which stick does what. These are called ""modes,"" and there are 4 main ones - Mode 1, Mode 2 etc. It is best to use a mode which is used by any instructor or the most common to other flyers in your area. Mode 2 is the most commonly used mode in the US.

,, Don't fly if the ribbon is parallel to the ground! Under 30 degrees is perfect.

, If possible, launch INTO the wind. If you are taking off from a runway and the wind is perpendicular to the runway, it is possible to take off, but not advisable for a beginner.

, Once the plane is almost floating above the ground, bring the elevators (usually up-down on the right side) up about 30% and let the plane get off the ground. If you're hand launching, advance the power to full and give the plane a straight level and firm (not too hard) toss into the air and quickly grab the controls. If you are still learning, have someone else launch your airplane for you so you can keep your hands on the sticks.

, I usually fly what we call 3 mistakes high, which is 150–200 feet (45.7–61.0 m) up, then reduce the throttle to half power.

, Just push the stick over for a split second and release. Simulator training will make you better at this.

, This will roll the plane slightly to the side. You will also need to pull back on the appropriate control stick slightly to pull the plane through the turn. To complete the turn, roll the plane parallel to the ground. Remember to always keep the plane upwind, this way it won’t blow away from you.(this only applies if you turn with ailerons.

, If you do stall, recover by pushing the nose down until the aircraft is flying fast enough to generate lift again. This may seem counterintuitive, but pulling back on the stick further will only make your situation worse in a stall.

, When you find yourself comfortable with this pattern, try flying an oval in the opposite direction (let other pilots around know what you are doing so they know to avoid you if you are flying an opposite pattern). When comfortable with both directions try a figure 8 pattern.

, Reduce power slowly (don’t touch the (elevator) stick - to descend, simply reduce the throttle). You want the plane to almost glide on its own. When the plane is about 5 feet (1.5 m) from the ground, cut the throttle.

, Note that this only applies to aircraft with a tailwheel, tricycle-gear airplanes should touch down on the back two wheels first and then let the nose settle down onto the runway.

"
"
Don't panic!,
If you can, try to fly the plane to where you can land on grass or a runway.

,
Decide whether a normal landing is possible.,
If you cannot make a normal landing, find a safe spot for an emergency landing.

,
Keep turns wide and do not over-control the pitch of the aircraft; you may cause a stall and crash.

,
If the engine has quit or you have no motor power, keep glide speed high enough to maintain control of the airplane.

,
Descend as expeditiously as possible and set the airplane down.,
Make sure your throttle switch or motor control is in the ""off"" position once the airplane is on the ground.

,
Recover the airplane; power down the airplane first by removing the battery or turning the switch off.",How to Crash Land a Remote Control Plane," Keep control movements moderate and gentle. Try to keep the airplane straight and level.;
,, If it is possible, set up for a normal descent and land your airplane.

Your instructor will spend time teaching you safety rules and procedures as well as basic flight maneuvers.,
Once you have demonstrated proficiency in basic flight maneuvers your instructor will give you the opportunity to solo.",How to Get Involved in Radio Controlled Flying," You can search for a club registered with the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA) at their website, www.modelaircraft.org. Your local hobby shop should also be able to provide information about clubs in your area.;
, You will find that people who fly radio controlled aircraft are friendly and willing to talk to you about their equipment and what training programs they offer for new and prospective pilots.

, Many clubs have a trainer that can be flown with an instructor with a ""buddy box"". This is simply two transmitters connected via a cable which allows the instructor to take-off and then hand over control of the aircraft to the pilot in training. The trainer can re-take control in the event that the aircraft is in danger of crashing. Buddy box training is the preferred method of flight training until new pilots demonstrate they have mastered skills necessary for safe flight.

, Your local club will also require you to join. Annual membership in a local club varies in cost depending on the circumstances, but usually ranges between $50 and $150 annually. Many clubs offer discounts to new members.

, A new radio control pilot will need to determine if they are more interested in airplanes or helicopters. Choosing a club that has members that have the same interest will ensure that you have access to individuals with more experience who can support you in your new endeavor.

, As a new pilot you can expect to spend anywhere from $200-$500 for the minimal equipment you will need to start flying. Most hobby shops provide a discount to the members of local flying clubs, and the hobby shop may even pay a portion or all of your first year's dues to the club. The hobby shop wants you to be successful so that you will continue to return to buy more equipment. However, you may not need to buy new equipment to get started. Most clubs have a listing of equipment that members are interested in selling. Ask for input from others - including club members, hobby shop staff and online forums such as RC Universe. If you are buying used equipment, ask a more experienced person to check out the equipment with you to make sure that you are not purchasing gear that is damaged or unsafe. There is nothing worse than taking your first flight to have it end with a crash.

, Talk to all of the instructors at the local clubs and choose an instructor with whom you feel comfortable. You will be spending a fair amount of time with your instructor, so be sure they are someone you feel comfortable with and that you like. You can expect to spend between 15-30 hours flying with the instructor before taking your first solo flight. Flight instruction is almost always free. The pilot in training will be expected to provide their own fuel and other basic equipment for instruction.

, During the first few flights you can expect to do less flying and more talking about safety. Spinning propellers and fast moving planes can be dangerous, learning and following safety procedures is an essential part of your training. In your training you will be taught and given time to practice straight and level flight, turns, take-offs, and landings. The amount of time it takes for mastery of these maneuvers differs from person to person.

, You will most likely be on the ""buddy box"" as a safety precaution, but you will do all the flying unless an emergency occurs. Successful completion of your solo flight will mark the end of your basic flight instruction.

Check for last minute precautions.",How to Fly a Remote Control Helicopter," This is just as important as your helicopter itself, as this is what you will control the copter with. Ensure all of the sticks move the control surfaces in the correct direction. For example, if you give a forward cyclic command, make sure your swashplate tilts forwards, not sideways or backwards.Tilt your sticks left and right, and see if the swashplate responds respectively to the commands.
Increase the throttle stick. This should show an increase in both the engine speed and collective pitch on your swashplate.
Give a right tail rotor command and see how your helicopter responds. The pitch of the tail rotor blades should change so that they are blowing air out the right, which in turn thrusts the tail boom to the left. Similarly, a left tail rotor command should blow air out the left side, thrusting the tail boom to the right.;
, Hold the helicopter by the middle of the rotor blades. Tile the blades so that one is pointing straight down, while the other is pointing straight up. If the CG is top heavy, the tail boom will rotate upwards. If the CG is bottom heavy, the nose will rotate upwards. A perfect CG is when the body of the helicopter sits perfectly perpendicular to that of the rotor blades.Another method to use is to hold your helicopter by the fly bar (if equipped with one). The helicopter will begin to pivot back and forth. If it begins to tilt backwards or forwards permanently, the CG is off.
If your CG is off, you will need to remove and position the battery pack in a more equidistant position. This could mean removing it with a screwdriver, or a pair of pliers, depending on how your battery pack is attached.
If you are using a gas powered helicopter, it is even more important to consistently check the CG. Small changes in the amount of fuel can drastically change the center of gravity.

, The single bolt and lock nut hold together the main and tail rotor blades. If you over or under tighten these blades, it could cause your helicopter to not function properly. A simple way to check the tightness is to hold your helicopter outright, perpendicular to the ground.The bolts should be tight enough that the blades don't pivot downwards by the pull of gravity, but loose enough so that they will move when you give the helicopter a minor shake.
The larger your helicopter is, the more secure you will want to make the rotor blades. This is especially true when the blade size reaches over 750mm. Smaller helicopters will need looser blades.
Use your wrench to tighten or loosen the secure bolt, depending on the size of your helicopter.

, You will want to do this very slowly, as applying too much throttle right away can cause your copter to tilt, and fall over, which will cause damage. This initial surge of power is called a spool. When you spool properly, the blades will turn, and you should start to feel some vibrations.Immediately stop spooling when the copter gets lift and wants to come off the ground. This is done by simply lowering the torque slowly.
With your helicopter on, this is the perfect time to use your eyes. See if your helicopter is shifting left or right when it spools. Listen with your ears to the engine. It should be making a consistent running sound, not a sporadic pumping sound.
When your helicopter is on the ground, do not add any cyclic trim. This will cause your swashplate to tilt in the direction of your command, and send your copter off against the ground.

, Each of your rotor blades sits at an angle. Most helicopters will hover between 4.5 and 5.5 degrees of positive pitch. If the angles of each blade are off from another, one blade will lift higher and cause your helicopter to crash. In order to adjust this so that the blades have even angles, you should first mark each rotor blade's tip with a different colored piece of tape.Next, turn your helicopter on, just so that it gets an inch or two of lift. Put on your safety goggles, and make sure your partner (if you have one) is wearing goggles as well. Bend down so that you are level with the running copter. You will want to be at least 10-20 feet away from the copter when you do this.
If the blade tracking is set correctly, both colors of tape will overlap with one another. However, if the tracking is off, you will be able to distinguish which color is higher and which is lower.
If the blades are off kilter, stop the helicopter and turn it off. You will want to reduce the height of the higher blade, while also increasing the height of the lower blade. Adjust the ball link that shifts the pitch per helicopter instructions (ball links vary widely among types and brands of RC helicopters).
Once this is done, turn your helicopter back on, get back on the ground, and see if the colors overlap. This may take two or three rounds before you get the height of the blades even.

, Place your helicopter in the middle of the field over which you will fly it. If there is any wind, make sure that the front of the copter is facing towards it. Start your helicopter as you are standing about 10 feet behind it (always wear your goggles). Turn on your throttle until your helicopter is light on its skids. If it begins to drift, simply lower the throttle back down.With a fly bared machine, depending on the way your helicopter begins to drift.
For example, if you have clockwise spinning rotor blades, the helicopter will almost necessarily lean left. Apply some right cyclic trim with your fly bared machine.
To access controls to your fly barred machine, you should either retrieve your independent controller, or the channel accessed through the swashplate.

, Start your helicopter up again, and allow it to hover/skid on the starting position (reference point). Once the helicopter is stabilized at the reference point, you can slowly increase the throttle forward. Your helicopter should move forwards about 10 feet, before you slowly decrease the forward command.Stabilize the helicopter at this position, as the helicopter skids gently against the ground. Then turn your throttle to the backwards position. Bring your helicopter back to the initial reference point.
Do the same thing as before, except move your throttle to the left and/or right, thereby moving your helicopter to the left and/or right of the reference point. Each time, move your helicopter 10 feet, stabilize, then turn your throttle back in the opposite direction to bring the copter back to the initial reference point.
As you move your helicopter, it should stay fairly close to the ground. The nose of your copter should always be facing forwards and towards the wind.

, Turn your helicopter on, and stabilize it over the initial reference point. Your copter should be bouncing on its skids as you increase the throttle (collective) power slowly. First, increase the collective until your helicopter is about 3 inches above the ground. After you get it to this point, begin lowering the copter back down to the ground slowly by decreasing the collective.Repeat this step through a series of increments. Start by going 3 inches in the air. Once you feel comfortable with this, go 6 inches or so, stabilize, and bring back down slowly to the reference point. Then go 9 inches, 12 inches, 15 inches, etc.
Once you have mastered hovering at higher altitudes over the reference point, you can begin adding directional controls. Move your throttle forward as your helicopter hovers higher in the air. Do this slowly, and stabilize the copter after you have moved it forward 10 feet away from the reference point. Then slowly move the throttle back, thereby moving your helicopter backwards until it reaches the reference point again.
You can do this with left, right, and diagonal controls as well. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, remember to first stabilize your helicopter in midair. Then bring the copter down slowly until it rests on its skids.

, For this move, you will want to move to an open area, but with a softer surface, such as a grassy farm. Once more, turn your helicopter on, hover it gently, and get a feel for the basic controls. The first part of the move is to turn the collective power on so that your helicopter rises slowly in the air up three feet. Once your copter is stabilized in the air at the three feet position, you can continue on.Start moving your helicopter at a diagonal angle forward and to the right. Do so by directional control with your throttle. Once the helicopter is about 6 feet away from the reference point start moving it only to the right and then on a backwards right diagonal, then backwards, then backwards left diagonal, then left, and then finally forward left diagonal.
While these directions may seem complicated, they basically mean that you will start hovering at the reference point, then move your copter in a circle clockwise, and finally finishing back at the initial reference point.
Inverse the previous directions when you move to the left side of your reference point. In essence, start hovering at your reference point, move in a leftward bound circle counterclockwise, and finish back at the initial reference point.
Once you get a feel for both the left and the right circles separately, you can combine the move into one continuous motion, thereby making a figure eight.

, So far, all of the precautionary steps, and basic maneuvers have assumed that your helicopter is facing directionally forward in relation to your reference point. This however needs to change, particularly when you will have to fly around tight spots, corners, and/or obstacles. Like normal, turn your helicopter on, lift your helicopter up three feet, and stabilize the the thrust power.Begin from your reference point, making a clockwise rightward bound circle, ending back at the initial reference point. However, instead of constantly keeping your helicopter facing forwards, you will use your directional controls on your thruster to change the position of the nose of your helicopter.
As your helicopter moves right, change the directional control of your thruster so that the nose is facing right. Allow your helicopter to hover rightward for 15-20 feet before you slow down the power and stabilize the copter. Then turn the direction of your thruster leftward bound so that the nose is facing leftward.
Bring the helicopter back to the initial reference point and stabilize it in midair. You can now start out from the reference point going leftward, and making your way back rightward. As you become better with changing the nose direction, you will not have to stabilize each time you turn, and it will instead begin to flow naturally.

, This involves both helicopter and physical movement. First, start your helicopter up, raise it at least 3 feet off of the ground, and stabilize it in the air. The helicopter should always start by facing the wind (nose pointed towards it) and you should be standing 10-15 feet away with the transmitter facing the copter. To perform the counterclockwise circle, begin by moving your helicopter to the left, with the nose of the helicopter also pointing left.Continue leftward, with the helicopter's nose facing in the direction it is headed. The goal is to make a counterclockwise circle around your body with the helicopter. This means that not only will you have to maintain the helicopter's leftward diagonal motion, but also keep it the same distance from your body the entire distance around (10-15 feet).
As you move your helicopter in a counterclockwise circle, you should also move your body in a counterclockwise circle, always keeping the transmitter facing the helicopter.
After you have completed the circle all the way around your body position, and gotten the helicopter back to the initial reference point, you can then move on to a clockwise circle. It is basically the same theory, keeping your body positioned away from the helicopter, yet always facing it with your transmitter. The only difference is the direction (rightward diagonal rather than leftward) that you will maintain to complete the circle.

, This is a product of basic physics. The extra lift produced by moving air is introduced to the rotor disk. This phenomenon can take a relatively pedestrian powered helicopter and transform it into a higher powered one. For example, if your rotor speed is going 20 mph, and your helicopter is facing a wind speed of 20 mph, the effective lift of your helicopter will be as high as if your helicopter's rotor blades themselves were spinning at 40 mph.To maximize translational lift, you will first have to do some research as to what direction and speed the wind is blowing at. Speeds between 15-35 mph can be translated into higher lifts, while speeds about 40 mph might actually cause you to lose control of your helicopter.
Begin your normal steps of turning your copter on in an open field, raising it up, and stabilizing it. This time however, you are going to raise it even higher to about 10 feet off of the ground before you stabilize your copter.
As you begin to perform your normal turns and directional shifts with your thruster, do so ever so slowly. For example, as you move your copter to the left, so so slowly without increasing the collective power, and allow the wind to carry your copter. Your copter will not only make a directional shift at your control, but will be driven to heights as high as 25-50 feet.
When you bring your helicopter down from these types of high altitudes, proceed with caution. You want to go very slowly. The best way to bring your helicopter down the first time is to bring your helicopter down in a series of circles (as practiced before). Eventually you will be able to bring down the helicopter in a more straight line.

, You need a wide open space, preferably a field, with no buildings or trees around. The number or people in the area should also be limited, as the functioning of an RC helicopter can be extremely dangerous. The size of the space you'll need will differ depending on the size of your helicopter.You can either go out by yourself, or go with one other person. Distractions such as pranks, games, or laughs can dampen your ability to focus on flying your copter.
Dogs and other pets should also be left at home. There are many horror stories where pets are killed by falling aircraft. Do not let this happen to one of your pets.
the area size should be at least 60X60 feet. The best ground material is clean, smooth pavement, or tightly packed snow.

, If you are someone who is new to flying, you will need to attach this equipment onto the bottom of your helicopter. The training equipment is typically two wooden or carbon fiber sticks, crossed in a ""T"" shape, with little rubber balls on the ends. These can be purchased at helicopter specialty stores, both online and on site, for around 40-60 dollars.For a good video on how to make your own training gear, visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJtNIzZ9U_0.

, You will need to make sure that your receiver batteries, helicopter, and radio are all charged up before you go out to fly your RC helicopter. You will also need to check the weather before you go out. If the weather is anything above 15 mph wind, and/or light rain, you should avoid flying your copter. You should also bring safety goggles with you when you go out to fly.
If you are going to be out in an open field, especially in the fall or winter months, make sure you are wearing warm clothes.

Unbox the copter.,
Make sure your copter is in perfect shape, with no bent rotors or dents in its hull.,
Set up.,
Fly!,
Fire.,
Charge your copter as needed.,
Join the flight club.",How to Fly a Propel RC Battle Copter," Take your newly purchased copter; open the box carefully. Opening it carefully will allow any fragile parts time to come loose out of its restraints. Take all the contents out, and organize them in groups. You should have one copter, one main box, one USB cord, one flight club invitation and one controller with spare parts.;
, If it is accidentally damaged in any way, you can contact Propel's website and they'll give you a 90 day money back guarantee (with a small fee of shipping and handling).


If your copter broke after 90 days, you can contact Propel's RC hotline to discuss questions or comments about your copter.
If a rotor is torn, or the landing gear is chipped, then you can repair it yourself by using spare pieces.

, Get your helicopter prepped for flight. Most copters are pre-charged at first opening and you can play with them immediately. Remember to put in AAs to your controller to get it up and running. Set your helicopter indoors in a wide open room, atop a flat even surface (e.g. coffee table), and get ready to fly it!

, Take your joystick, and hold it in your hands so it is perfectly balanced on the floor. Use your pointer finger to push the throttle up slowly. As you do, you'll see the copter rise.


If you push it up all the way, the copter should hit the ceiling! (Don't do this, because it could result in a damaged copter).
Balance the throttle so it stays balanced in the air. To turn the copter left, just lean the controller left. To go right, lean right. The same is with forward and backward movements.
You should get a feel of it; just don't go any direction too far or it will probably crash! If the copter is spinning, use the left/right trim on the controller to keep it steady in one direction.

, If you're in a beginner dog-fight, there are a few easy steps to follow to get it right. If you're battling with two or more players, this is the best method to use. When you stat off, fly to an area where you have an advantage (e.g. away from corners). Once an ""enemy"" is spotted, aim your copter so its nosecone is positioned straight towards the cock-pit of your target. Then, use the 'fire' button on your controller, and the enemy copter will flash red. It takes three hits to crash an opponent, and then they lose the dogfight. Try not to be hit yourself, otherwise you'll might lose!

, To charge your copter, take the USB cord, and plug it from your computer's USB port to the charging USB port on your copter. The charger should glow red if not fully charged; it disappears when fully charged. The charging process can take up to 2 days. The flight limit of your copter is about an hour.

, You enjoy flying your copter? Sometimes, parts may wear and tear. Don't worry! If you go to www.propelrc.com, you can join their free flight club, for ages 12 and up. This club lets you have access to free replacement parts for a year from the date of purchase! So even if you didn't break any parts on your copter, you should join it so you can get free replacement parts.

Tighten the gear mesh so it is not fitted too tightly, or else it will make noise and cause premature wear on both the pinion and spur gear.,
Listen for noise: if you have it set correctly you should not hear any noise coming from the gears.,
Try to use a narrow strip of printer or copier paper by putting it between the pinion and spur gear while you set the tightness.

,
Adjust the pinion to the spur with the paper between them, and then tighten the motor mounting screws, and you should be able to pull/work the paper out without it tearing it off.

,
A smaller pinion (and/or larger spur) will give you faster acceleration, less load on the motor, and slower top speed.",How to Choose a Gearing Ratio on an Rc Car or Truck," Placing a piece of notebook paper between the pinion and spur before tightening down the motor will aid in setting the gear mesh. After the motor is secure, remove the paper and check the gear mesh. You should have minute amount of play between the gears.;
, It is too loose it will cause gears to wear also, or to slip and clash and ruin the mesh.

,,, A larger pinion (and/or smaller spur) will slow the acceleration rate, increase the the load on the motor, and increase the top speed. The greater the load = the hotter your motor will get. The trick is to not overload (overheat) the motor. You should be able to hold on to the motor after a 4-6 minute run. If you can't hold on to it ( approx 130 degree F or higher ) your putting to much load on the motor and should decrease the pinion size or increase the spur."

Dampen the plush preliminarily with the water.,
Use the brush and the soap to scrub any visible dirt patches.,
Dry your Beanie Boo.,
If the toy is not fully clean yet, try using a more heavy-duty soap or even a washing machine and repeat the process.",How to Clean a Beanie Boo," The brush should have soft yet firm bundles of bristles, like in a nail brush or tooth brush. A makeup brush is too soft and a hairbrush is too stiff, so choose something mid-range.
, The temperature of the water should be as warm, but not hot or steaming as it may scald your hands or damage the synthetic fabric of the plush. Warmer water will aid in dissolving dirt or oils that may on the toy and also kill bacteria., You can either create a bubbly lather in the water by swishing it around with your hands, or you can apply the soap to the brush and create lather directly on the toy.

If the toy has been in a very dirty environment, is going to be given to a very young child, or is bought secondhand from an untrustworthy source, you may also want to use a heavy duty soap or even an antibacterial soap. This will kill bacteria more thoroughly.
If the toy is stained with dirt or similar substances, you can use a small amount of laundry detergent or borax in the water to get rid of stains. Ask an adult to help you since these materials can harm skin and be toxic.

, Do not fully soak the Beanie Boo if it's not that dirty: soaking a soft toy can create the risk of mold forming, which is harmful to both the integrity of the toy and for the health of the owner., Scrub gently to prevent ruining the fibres on the fur of the toy. Rinse after scrubbing- if the stain is still present, consider using a more heavy-duty soap., First, use a towel to thoroughly dry the surface moisture on the toy. Then you can follow up with a more intense drying process as follows:

Place the toy in indirect sunlight on a warm or windy day for about 12 hours. Avoid direct sunlight, as it may discolor the toy. You may also want to hang the toy on a clothesline to aid the drying process.
Use a hairdryer on a cool or warm setting (do not use hot, it will damage the toy or catch on fire) for about five minutes, keeping it at a safe distance.
Place the toy in a cool and gentle setting in a drier. Make sure to not leave the Beanie Boo in the drier without checking on it regularly- it may become damaged. However, this step will dry the toy thoroughly.

,

Once dry, brush out the fur to maintain its softness. For an extra touch, you may also want to use a small drop of diluted essential oil on the Beanie Boo for a nice scent.

Are you looking for a spotted animal, or a solid-colored animal?
Are you looking for a squishy animal, or a more solid animal?
Are you looking for a plushie, a knitted, a furry, a plastic?
Do you want a very big animal you can sit on or a small animal to put in your pocket?;
, There are many choices, from giraffes and kangaroos to the common teddy bear. Most common animals include:


Teddy bears
Dogs
Cats.

, You don't have to get one of those if you want to be different. You could get a monkey, a lion or even an octopus! If you really like dogs or cats, try getting one that looks like your favorite breed. You could have a bright green snake with a colourful pattern, or a moose with bells on its antlers, or a hyena with gold and orange streaks.

, Sometimes the best animals are ones that have been stitched up and redecorated. It makes them look edgy, interesting and unique (personalize it, because it will be identical to the ones from the store) . If you want a new animal try a toy store. Ask around friends if they have any old stuffed animals they are willing to give to you. Always check for stains or rips before buying. Don't buy a stuffed animal that is too expensive.

, Don't go with something anyone would name their stuffed animal, like ""Rover"" for a dog, ""Simba"" for a lion, or ""Bananas"" for a monkey. Use words from a different language or name it after a family member or past pet. Choose a name that suits him/her.

, Purchase them or make clothes at home. You can also give accessories to your stuffed animal, like purses and collars.

, Take an old shoe box or use the corner of your room. Add some decorations and make/buy some big doll furniture. Get old towels and scraps of fabric or felt to make a bed. Also make or buy some toys for your stuffed animal. You can also use dog or cat toys.

Run the model using no more than 1/4 throttle varying the RPMs from time to time.,
Watch the fuel usage.,
Repeat this process with 3 to 4 more tanks of fuel each time increasing the amount of maximum applied throttle.",How to Break in an RC Car Engine," Locate your specific model's user manual, and get familiar with the terminology used in the manual. There is usually a glossary of terms located near the end of the manual. Also become familiar with where all the engine parts are located.
,

Install the glow plug into the top of the cylinder head. Do not over tighten, snug will do just fine.
Fill the model's fuel tank.
Turn on the transmitter and receiver.
Make sure the throttle, braking, and steering servos are responding to transmitter (controller) inputs.
Set the carburetor needle settings to the factory positions specified in the user manual.

, If your model is equipped with an electric starter and built in glow plug igniter you will not have to purchase a separate glow plug igniter. If your model is fitted with a pull start starting system you will have to purchase the glow plug igniter. The glow plug igniter heats the glow plug to initiate combustion and start the engine. Once the engine is running the glow plug igniter needs to be removed before driving the model.

Plug the glow plug igniter into the glow plug at the top of the cylinder head.
Cover the exhaust pipe with the tip of your finger while pulling the engine over 3 times. This primes the carburetor and makes starting the engine easier.
With your finger now off the exhaust pipe pull the engine over until it starts. If using an electric start system do not exceed 10 seconds of continuous turning over at any one time.

, Then remove the glow plug igniter from the glow plug. Be careful as the cylinder head becomes hot very quickly., Do not let the engine sit at a high idle as this may cause excessive heat and premature wear to engine components. Once the idle has been dialed in the break in process can begin., We want to keep as much excessive heat out of the engine as possible during break in., Do not let the engine idle for an excessive amount of time. The engine is air cooled, this means that the engine is not being cooled when air is not flowing through the cooling fins. Prolonged idling will cause excessive heat build up and damage to the engine., Do not run the engine at a constant throttle for the duration of the fuel tank. You should see a steady stream of blue/white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe.

If this smoke it not present, turn the mixture screw counter clock wise until the smoke is present. This is called ""richening"" the fuel mixture. This means that you are adding more fuel to the air/fuel ratio.
On the other hand if the smoke is excessive turn the mixture screw clock wise until the smoke it present but not excessive. This is called ""leaning"" the fuel mixture. Note that running the air/fuel mixture too lean will cause excessive heat in the motor and could damage it.

, When the model is close to running out of fuel, bring it back to yourself and shut it off. Let the engine completely cool down to room temperature., You cannot over-break-in your engine, so the slower you go the better off you will be. You can however under-break-in the engine, and this can cause premature engine failure."

Troubleshoot the controls.",How to Drive an RC Tank," Firm clean ground with some contours and plenty of open space is your best choice for learning the ropes of this sport. Grass and weeds can jam the tracks of your vehicle, and soft, sandy soil will cause trouble with the gears that drive them.;
, A brand new remote controlled tank will need powering before it's ready to move. The transmitter takes ordinary batteries. Some tanks have a rechargeable battery pack, while others use AA batteries. The rechargeable variety comes with a special charger, or an adapter so you can plug it into a wall outlet.


Read the instructions before charging a battery pack. Overcharged batteries may explode.
If you ordered your tank from another country, double check the intended charge voltage. Plugging it into an outlet with a different voltage could destroy the battery and cause a fire.

, Always turn on the handheld controls before the tank itself. If the transmitter is not active when the tank is turned on, there is a chance that the tank will not respond properly.If the tank still won't respond, check the transmitter instructions for a ""sync"" or ""bind"" setup. This is not necessary for transmitters that use quartz crystals.

, If yours is the only RC vehicle in the area, you can skip this step. However, if there are multiple vehicles around, each one must use a different frequency to avoid interfering with each other. Some models have a setting to easily switch between different frequencies, but many require you to switch out the crystals in the tank and the transmitter in order to adjust this.


Most models operate in the 27 Mhz range (divided into 12 bands) or the 40 Mhz range (divided into 8 bands)., This will allow you to get the feel for the controls. Start in a straight line to develop a sense of the vehicle's speed, which can be deceptively fast. Get an idea for how quickly it can stop and reverse.

, The most common type of RC tank control uses a single joystick for movement.In a typical Tri Pact system, you move the stick diagonally to lock one of the treads, causing the tank to turn.You may not be able to move forward or reverse at the same time as turning.


Even most transmitters with two joysticks use this system. One joystick controls movement, while the other controls the gun turret or other features.

, There are a wide range of other control systems. Here are the next most common:


A simple two-joystick control uses one joystick for forward/reverse, and a second one for turning left/right.More advanced two-joystick controls operate the left and right treads independently. To turn left, move the right joystick further forward than the left.
Transmitters with buttons instead of a joystick are usually arranged in a simple forward/reverse/left/right layout.

, When finished driving, turn off the tank's receiver, then turn off the transmitter. Clean the tank's tracks and gears before storing, and remove rechargeable batteries.

, Also called electronic speed control, tanks with this feature move at different speed increments depending on how far you push the joystick. Try moving the joystick partway when maneuvering over difficult ground.


The simpler MAG speed control system has just two possible speeds. These may be toggled the same way, or by switch., Most hobby-grade tanks have a turret that can rotate anywhere from about 160º to the full 360º, depending on the model. Some can raise or lower the cannon as well. The transmitter may have a separate joystick for the turret, or two buttons for clockwise and counterclockwise rotation.


If you can't get a particular feature to respond, skip down to troubleshooting instructions.

, Cheaper tanks may not have this option. Larger tanks often do come with controls for firing the cannon, and sometimes the machine gun as well. This uses one of these three systems:


Some tanks just make a noise and may recoil when the cannon is fired.
Infrared weapons shoot an invisible beam that other infrared tanks can detect as ""damage"" for tank battles. These work best in dim light, and in fairly open areas (to avoid unpredictable bouncing.)Some tanks fire Airsoft BBs. These can cause injury and damage to objects, and may not be appropriate for children.

, Some RC tanks have minor features to add realism or fun. The most common are a smoke chamber, which usually operates automatically once it is stocked. If your tank makes firing and engine noises, there may be a volume control on the bottom of the tank., Test any of the non-movement buttons or joysticks while the tank is stationary, then again while it is moving. If the turret or cannon only respond while the tank is still, you have a simple 2-channel transmitter/receiver. These are much easier to operate, but moving will disable all other features. If the features do work while moving, or if you can't get them to work at all, you most likely have an advanced 4+ channel model.Look up specific instructions for your transmitter if possible, or experiment as follows:


If there are small levers next to a joystick, toggling them may enable extra commands from that joystick.In other systems, you may need to learn specific combinations of both joysticks in order to operate the weapons.A rapid flick of a joystick may send a different instruction than a steady push.

The radio control is composed of three systems.,
Fuel for these RC cars and trucks is a blend of nitro methane, alcohol and natural and synthetic oils, this product is carried at many hobby stores.,
Choosing a vehicle will depend on the surface you plan to drive on.,
With proper maintenance and operation your RC truck, car or buggy will perform and provide hours of fun and excitement.,
Use caution when racing; choose a well-maintained paved or hard surface.,
Most RTR cars and trucks have low power, slow speed servos with plastic gears.,
Tweaks are key.,
Be aware that your engine will not last forever.,
Keep extra air filters on hand.,
Make it Yours!",How to Buy a Nitro Remote Control Vehicle," First is the transmitter. This is the hand control; usually rechargeable batteries power it. They are available in FM and AM frequencies. Both transmitters and receivers have changeable crystals or frequency chips. The transmitter emits the signal to the antenna, which will be carried to the receiver. The receiver usually has a power supply, and is built into the vehicle to control the transmitter's signal to the final part of the radio controller, the servo. The servos, or servomotors are the devices which are responsible for controlling the throttle and or brakes, (some machines have separate throttle and brake servos), steering, and shifting (for units with reverse). The servos use linkages, usually adjustable, to control the vehicle.;
, Always follow recommendations for storage and use of this product since it is combustible. There are several different blends of nitro methane available. Higher concentrations of nitro methane will run hotter, but will decrease the total run hours of the machine.

, On-road nitro cars are ideal for racing on a hard surface. They are designed for speed and more difficult to control. Because they can be easily damaged in a crash, these are not suggested for beginners. Off Road vehicles are ideal for beginners. Capable of huge jumps and difficult climbs, they are suitable for almost any terrain. The durability and power make these a great choice for the novice. The ultimate for speed, acceleration, handling and durability of all is the Nitro Buggy.

, Always follow recommended steps from manufacturer. Often a “slow break in” is suggested. This allows more fuel to enter the engine, thus allowing it to run at a lower temperature. RTR cars will be set up for a break in at the manufacturers default setting. After each use shake out loose dirt and clean with a soft cloth. Routine cleaning of the outer air filter is recommended. An air compressor will do the trick. Replace all worn components of the clutch system and air filters. Pay close attention to the clutch ball bearings, these will take most of the abuse from regular use of your vehicle. Clean them often.

, Beginning drivers need to master control of the vehicle. By rolling into the throttle smoothly the car will handle better. Before cranking up the speed, take a few accident free laps around the track.

, Should you damage a servo, you should definitely consider upgrading to higher torque servos for faster throttle response, harder braking, and tighter turns under high speed. These servos also consume more power from your battery packs, so consider upgrading battery packs also.

, Understand how systems work, spend lots of time looking at the workings of it, you may see a way for something to work better. Examples are changing differential oils, adjustment of ride height, possibly adjusting battery pack locations to allow better balance.

, Some people get to run only a few gallons of fuel before repair/replacement is needed, while others get 20+ gallons of fuel through an engine.

, Dirt ingestion will destroy an engine very quickly.

, Colorful graphics, led lighting systems, brake and headlights, flashy stickers and bright colors let everyone know which car is yours!

If you already have a stuffed sheep or lamb, you can move onto the other steps.,
Make a small home that looks like a barn for your sheep, as it will need someplace to sleep.,
Dress your sheep up!,
Play with your sheep!,
Feed your sheep, and make sure it doesn’t starve!,
Care for your sheep.,
Familiarize yourself with sheep’s habits, likes, and dislikes.,
Get friends and relatives for your sheep if you can so it can have some company when you’re gone!,
Develop a bedtime routine with your sheep.",How to Care for a Stuffed Sheep or Lamb," If you don't already have a stuffed sheep or lamb, but you do want one, choose a stuffed sheep using the following tips:


Make sure it's not too big or too small, but somewhere in the middle. If it's too big, it may be hard to care for it, and if it's too small, it'll be even harder.
See if you'll be able to put clothes on it. If the sheep is puffy, your clothing choices for it may be limited, or you may not be able to put clothes on it at all.
Study the color of the sheep, and make sure it's one that you like.

Ask yourself, ""Does it look like I would play with this sheep a lot? Or does it look like I would not play with it a lot?


Lastly, check the price. If the stuffed sheep is a common stuffed animal, but very costly, try looking in other shops or buying a cheaper one off the Internet.;
, Use the following steps to make a small home that looks like a barn:


First, get an empty, sturdy box that isn’t broken or badly ripped.
Paint the box red, and paint the roof brown.
Cut out some windows, and make a door for your sheep. Make sure the sheep can fit.
Finally, place some shredded newspaper inside the box, and let your sheep sleep inside of it.

Suggested additions for your sheep’s home would be stickers, a pretend television, and two small bowls for food and water.


You could also make a regular bed by getting a box, and placing a small blanket and pillow inside of it. Your sheep could also sleep on your bed with you.

, Buy or make your own clothes for it. The size of the clothes you need will depend on the size of your stuffed sheep. Girl sheep love wearing dresses, skirts, necklaces, and hats, while boys prefer pants and casual shirts. However, you might not want to give your sheep shoes to wear. Sheep’s hooves are round, and regular shoes are pear-shaped.


If you want additional clothes for your sheep to change out of, go for it! Pajamas are recommended. It usually would be easier to buy them instead of make them on your own, but homemade pajamas are fun and cute! The size of the clothes you need will depend on the size of your stuffed sheep. Girl sheep love wearing dresses, skirts, necklaces, and hats, while boys prefer pants and casual shirts. However, you might not want to give your sheep shoes to wear. Sheep’s hooves are round, and regular shoes are pear-shaped.

For a sleep mask, cut out a small bit of cloth, and tape securely to a ponytail holder.


To make a scarf for your sheep, just get some fabric, neatly cut it at an appropriate length, and tie it around your sheep’s neck in a fashionable way. Make sure the fabric isn’t jaggedly cut, however, or you’ll have an untidy scarf.
Keep in mind that if your sheep has small, skinny legs, you might not be able to easily make your own clothes for it.

, Take it with you everywhere you go, unless if you know it might get dirty and you’d rather keep it safe at home. Play games with it, such as Othello, Battleship, or Connect Four. You can also watch movies and play video games with it!


For easy transportation, get a purse that you can fit your sheep in with its head sticking out. Only promise to take your sheep along if it says it will behave.

, Use the following steps to make sure you have a well-fed, happy sheep:


Get – or make – two small bowls for your sheep.
Cut up brown and yellow paper, and place the pieces into one of the bowls. This will be the hay.
Then, cut up blue yarn, and place it in the other bowl. This will be the water.

If you want the water to look more realistic, pour some craft glue into the bowl without the yarn in it. When the glue dries, it will look as clear as water.



, Buy a brush, or use your own, and gently brush its wool. Make it a habit to brush your sheep’s wool in the morning before you leave for school, and at night before its bedtime. Also, once a week, give it a shower. Although sheep should bathe more often than once a week, giving stuffed animals too many baths can cause them to deteriorate easily.


To give your sheep a bath, place five small drops of water onto a towel, then rub your sheep with the towel. However, never place your sheep in the bathtub, or put more water than instructed on it, or you’ll harm it!

, Know everything you can about your sheep, and care for it based on that knowledge. Keep it away from anything it is scared of (ex: spiders), and try not to make it sad. However, if it is necessary to do something for your sheep that it doesn't like, ignore its complaints, and get through with it (ex: giving it medicine when it is sick).

, However, if you don’t have enough money to buy any more sheep, or you can’t get any more, just choose several other stuffed animals to become your sheep’s friend. However, make sure they won’t hurt or scare your sheep before leaving them alone with it!

, You could read your sheep its favorite story before it goes to sleep, or sing it a lullaby. If you made or bought pajamas for it, you can put it on your sheep. If your sheep is too excited, try gently rocking them to sleep, and sing them a nice soothing song if that doesn't work right away.

But before cleaning them, you want to make sure that any rips or tears are repaired so that the animal doesn’t get destroyed during the cleaning process.


Take a needle and thread that’s as close to the color of the animal as you can get. Thread the needle and tie a knot it one end of the thread.
Starting at one end of the rip, push the needle up through the underside of the rip to lock the thread in place on the underside of the fabric. Then use the needle to push the thread from the material on one side of the rip to the other in a straight line. Move down and make another stitch. Continue making slip stitches like this until the rip is repaired.Don’t forget to sew and secure eyes, bows, and other features back on if they’ve fallen off.;
, To remove dust, dirt, mites, allergens, and other particles from the stuffed animals, you want to vacuum them periodically, and always before they go into storage.


Place several medium to large sized stuffed animals in a large garbage bag. Insert the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner into the bag and seal the bag around the nozzle. Turn on the vacuum cleaner and let it suck out all the air, dust, and dirt.When you're finished, you may need to re-fluff the animals if the stuffing has lost some shape in the process.
To vacuum smaller toys, hold them in your hand an use a nozzle attachment of the appropriate size to suck up dirt and dust.

, Depending on how old or delicate your animals are, you may be able to machine wash or hand wash them, or you can clean them with baking soda. Check the care labels on the animals before choosing which method to use.


For machine washable toys, place individual animals in mesh laundry bags or stuff them into pillow cases to protect them from snags. Wash them on the delicate or hand wash cycle if it’s available, and use a mild detergent and cold water.To hand wash animals, fill a sink with cool water and add one tablespoon (15 ml) of mild laundry detergent. Immerse the toy in the water and gently agitate the water and rub the fur to remove dirt. Rinse in a fresh sink of clean water to remove the excess detergent.To clean animals with baking soda, place one animal at a time in a plastic bag or pillow case. Depending on the size of the animal, use one tablespoon (15 g) to one-quarter cup (60 g) of baking soda to cover the animal with a light dusting. Close the bag and give it a good shake. Let the animal sit in the baking soda for half an hour, and then use a damp towel to wipe off dirt and excess baking soda., Wrap each toy in a towel and gently press out the extra water. If the animals have lost any of their shape during the cleaning process, use your hands to fluff them out and reshape the stuffing. To dry the animals, you can:Hang them on a clothesline in the sun. This is ideal for all toys, but it’s especially important for older toys that may be flammable and can't go in the dryer.
Let them air dry on a towel. Make sure you turn them over periodically so the air can reach all the sides. Be sure the animals are completely dry before storing them.
Put dryer-safe animals in the dryer. Use a low-heat setting and add a few towels to the load to help protect the animals from the tumbling.

, To help protect animals that are going to be stored for long periods, especially antique toys, wrap them individually in acid-free tissue paper, which will help to preserve them.Acid-free paper can be purchased from library suppliers, online, or at most craft stores.

, Lidded plastic totes are ideal for organizing and storing stuffed toys because they can be stacked on top of each other, they keep out pests that could damage the animals,and they allow airflow inside, which prevents mold and mildew growth.You can further prevent mold and mildew problems by storing the bins in a dry location.
To prevent damage and crushed fur, don’t overstuff the bins.

, Storing stuffed animals isn’t always about putting them away for the long haul, and sometimes you just need a solution that will help you organize and store toys to keep them off the floor and out of the way.Built-in or bookshelves are a great way to get animals off the floor and display them, and if the shelves are low enough, your child will still be able to access all her favorite toys.


Be sure to dust and rearrange toys often when they’re displayed like this, as dust, dander, and allergens settle quickly on immobile toys.
If you have multiple shelves, put your child’s least favorite toys on the upper shelves, and her favorite toys lower down where she can reach them.

, Toy cages, or toy pens, are tall open crates that can be used to store as many as 100 stuffed animals at a time. The toys get piled on top of each other, and the open slats or bars that keep the animals contained also allow children to access the toys and put them back.For a small animal pen, you can use a large basket with wide spaces between the bars. For a quick DIY animal zoo, take the shelves out of a bookcase and tie string or twine horizontally or vertically around the bookcase like bars. Fill the bookcase with stuffed animals and position the twine to keep them in place.

, You can use over-the-door shoe organizers or hanging closet organizers to store stuffed animals.Over-the-door organizers are generally better for smaller toys, whereas closet organizers will be able to hold larger stuffed animals.

, Toy chests come in all shapes and sizes, and they are excellent and beautiful pieces of furniture that can be used for all sorts of storage as your child ages. Old crates can also double as rustic toy chests, and crates on wheels make for excellent portable toy storage units., Toy hammocks can be hung from hooks on the wall or ceiling in your child’s room, and larger ones can be used to house many toys.You can use a toy hammock, a net, or even an old blanket for the purpose.


Most toy hammocks work best when they are suspended in corners, and from three separate hooks (one on each adjoining wall and one near the corner).

, Use hooks on opposite walls to run a clothesline along a wall in your child’s room. Then, you can use clothes pegs to fasten stuffed animals to the line.


For the clothesline itself, you can use yarn, string, or twine. Make sure you hang the line somewhere that your child won’t accidentally run into it.

, You can buy or make a bean bag chair shell that is just fabric with a zipper that’s designed to be stuffed. Instead of using cotton batting or other stuffing, fill the bean bag shell with plush animals.That way, the stuffed animals are contained, easily accessible, and are turned into a functional piece of furniture.

, For stuffed animals that your child won’t be using any time soon, stuff the toys into vacuum bags. Then, use your vacuum cleaner nozzle to suck the air out of the bag, thereby reducing the space the animals take up.


Because this method can squish and misshape stuffing, don’t use vacuum bags for precious stuffed animals or antique plush toys, as they could be damaged by the process.

, For this project, you will need four sanded pillars of wood that are cut to six feet tall and two inches by two inches wide. You will also need:One box of two-inch screws
One box of three-inch screws
15 screw eyes
A 40-foot length of rope
A drill
Six pieces of sanded wood that are 12 inches long and 2 ½ by ¾ inches
Five front railings that are 32 inches long and 2 ½ by ¾ inches
One piece of fascia that’s 32 inches long and 8 by ¾ inches

, Lay out two of the six-foot pillars on the ground, 32 inches apart. At the bottom of the pillars, lay down a front railing that will connect them. On the right side, pre-drill two screw holes through the front railing and the pillar. Repeat on the other side.


Once you’ve pre-drilled the holes, attach the front railing to the bottom of the pillars with the two-inch screws.
Repeat these same steps with a front railing at the very center of the pillars.
At the top of the pillars, attach the piece of fascia., Repeat the same steps that you did for the front panel, but use front railing at the top, center, and bottom.

, Start with the back panel, and attach a piece of 12-inch board at the top, center, and bottom on both sides of the back panel. Use the three-inch screws, and make sure the 12-inch boards are attached perpendicular to the back panel.


Once you have the 12-inch boards attached on either side of the back panel, attach the front panel to the 12-inch boards using the three-inch screws.

, On the front panel, you’re going to place three hooks on the fascia, three hooks on the center railing, and three hooks on the bottom railing. Pre-drill holes for the hooks, spacing the holes out evenly across the length of the boards. Each 12-inch board on the side panels will get one hook in the center, so pre-drill the holes for that.


Once the holes are drilled, screw in the hooks.

, You're going to use the hooks to run the rope through the cage to create the bars. Tie a large knot at one end of the rope. Run the other end of the rope through the hook on the bottom side panel on the left. Pull the rope all the way through so the knot catches on the first hook.


Run the rope through the center hook on the same side panel, then through the top hook. Thread the rope across the top side railing and then run it down through the first hook on the fascia, followed by the hook on the center railing below, then the hook on the bottom railing below that.
Then run the rope across to the middle set of hooks and repeat. Repeat these steps until you have three sets of bars across the center panel and one set of bars on each side panel.
When you’ve finished running the rope, cut the excess and tie a knot in the end to secure it in place.

, After you decorate the zoo (you can paint it, add stickers, or leave it plain), position it with the back against a wall. Once dry, fill it with your stuffed animals. The rope bars will make it easy to access animals and put them back.

Fit to there special needs.,
Meals.",How to Care for a Vamplet," There are many Vamplets to choose from, and they all have different personalities. Lily Rose Shadowlyn is sweet, and loves to cuddle, but she can give lethal ""vampire kisses."" Count Vlad Von Gloom is a descendant from Dracula and is very royal. Choose wisely. There are six in all and they all have their ups and downs. You can read about all of them in the Hall Of Horrors on the Vamplets website.;
, Vamplets, like any other creature, need food. Blood can help calm your little creature of the night and less liable to bite you. They HATE milk. When Destiny gave them milk first, they threw a tantrum. Which is why they never have milk, you can get a blood bottle on the vamplets website.

, A shady spot in your bedroom will do just fine. Most vamplets come in a coffin, you can use that for them to sleep during the day and take their naps. Include stuffed animals (Midnight Mori will need a stuffed unicorn to put her to bed), bedtime stories (Dracula, Alice in Wonderland, and Coraline are good stories to name a few), toys (spikey ball, tug -o-war chain, doll haunted house), and decorations (mini bouquet of roses, little black rug, etc.)

, There are some clothes for Vamplets available for purchase on Etsy. You can also make vamplet shirts out of socks. You can try sewing tutus, onesies, and other garments as well.

, Whether it's listening to Emilie Autumn until they fall asleep, or reading Twilight to them until they get so bored they decide to sleep, create a bedtime routine. This bedtime routine should be placed around how busy you are. It could be very quick or a rather long process.

, If Burton Creeperson JR. decides it's perfectly acceptable to paint a self portrait with blood on your wall,or Howliss complains about how hot the sun is on his fur, or Lily Rose has a temper tantrum for no reason, you need to discipline them. This can be done by placing them in an enclosed pitch black space for a certain amount of time, or giving them a stern talking to. But never physically hurt them!

, Vamplets have special needs. Vlad Von Gloom needs a larger amount of blood, Mori needs a pretty stuffed unicorn to fall asleep, Evilyn needs a padded coffin because of her day walking,Howliss needs an umbrella for how hot he is in the sun, Make sure you fit to their special needs so they don't act out.

, They all like Bottles of Blood, But usually want a side. They eat poison black applesauce, sweetened and unsweetened.

Have fun on your vacation with your Pillow Pet!

",How to Travel with a Pillow Pet," Some Pillow Pets are more designed for travel than others. If you have a Jumbo Pillow Pet, for example, you may want to consider carrying him/her or leaving them at home, but if you have a PeeWee, they can easily squeeze into a suitcase or backpack, and if you have a standard Pillow Pet, it can go either way.


If you have a PeeWee version of the pet you want to take, try taking them along instead. Then you can bring your favorite Pillow Pet in a more compact size!;
, If you don't mind placing him/her in a suitcase, go ahead! But if you want to show them everything that goes on, be prepared to carry him/her, or, depending on his/her size, you may be able to place them in a small carry-on suitcase or a backpack.


Find out how much space they're going to need before you leave. Then you can plan accordingly.

, Going to the beach? Bring a Pillow Pet-sized sunhat. Going up North for the winter? Bring a warm hat for them. If you are having difficulty figuring out what to bring for them, look at your own accessories and mirror off of those.


Don't forget their most favorite possessions. A blanket, a favorite toy, even a small stuffed animal can be a huge comfort to Pillow Pets who are feeling a little homesick.

, This should keep it from getting lost on the way to your destination. Be sure your backpack/carry-on suitcase is zipped up tight to keep things from getting out of it!


If you are putting your Pillow Pet in your backpack/carry-on suitcase, be sure there is room for him/her to fit. If not, move around some things if you can and try again until you get the right fit.

, This is especially good for when you take him/her on an airplane, where there is very little elbow room, as it saves space, or when you have to pack him/her in the car. You only want to unfold them if you plan to sleep on your way to your destination. If this is the case, remember to fold him/her up and tuck them somewhere you can find them and reach them on short notice but also somewhere out of the way of the main hub of activity.


Stowing your Pillow Pets under the seat in front of you on an airplane is likely the best place for them. In a car, they can be placed in the back seat (if you are in the front and there are few people in the back) or on the center console of the car if you are in the back (this is where the drink holder is). Putting it on the center console can add a barrier between you and anyone who is sitting next to you, which can be handy when your sibling wants to pester you.

, Tell him/her where you'll be going, when you will leave and come back, why you are going, how you are going to get there, who you are going with, and what you will do there. This can be especially helpful for Pillow Pets new to traveling.


If your Pillow Pet seems nervous, reassure their worries, but be realistic if you think their worries are of some accuracy. Like, if your Pillow Pet is terrified they'll get left on the airplane or in the hotel, agree that it could happen, but also state that it is very unlikely as you plan to either take them everywhere or make sure they come home with you.

, If you left anything important behind, make sure you go get it BEFORE you leave. This will decrease the stress of the day a little and you will be able to leave whenever you need to.

, Point out sights, landmarks, and interesting things, or show them what you brought to do and invite them to do some of it with you, or reassure them as needed. Give them lots of hugs on the trip as well.


If you have to sleep on your Pillow Pet, do so. They can be very comfortable and will feel like something from home, especially if you are homesick.

, Go to your hotel/bed and breakfast/lodge/cabin/camp/cottage/condo and take them out, and put them on your bed if you don't plan to take them anywhere.

Choose a teddy or stuffed animal you want.,
Name your new friend!,
Make a house out of a box.,
Take it places like the movies, the mall, sleepovers, the beach, etc.,
Make some clothes!,
If it ever gets sick or injured, make a cast out of wet paper towels or some ""medicine"" out of Playdough,clay, even an empty Medicine bottle.,
On long trips, use a backpack for it containing a snack, a book and a toy.,
Sometimes you just can't take it to places.",How to Make Your Stuffed Animal Your Best Buddy," Garage sales can sell you some for about 5 dollars so they're a good place to look if your low on money. If you want a new one, browse toy stores or places like K-Mart. (Walmart if you're from the USA or Canada). Small ones are good for taking places, big ones are good for cuddling at night. If you want your stuffed animal to be an at-home pal about 35 centimeters (13.8 in) is good. If your teddy or stuffed animal is going to be exploring the world, a small one would be better. Boas, fish, snakes or anything with a weird shaped body would not be recommended because it's hard to find clothes for them. Dogs, cats, horses and big cats (tigers, lions, etc.) are great to have, as it is easier to find clothes for them!;
, If its fur is tangled or scruffy maybe Scraggy or Rough. If it's a camel maybe Tutankhamen or Cleopatra. Whatever you do, here are some names that should be avoided! Stripes, Patch, Pinkie, Teddy, Spot, Cutie, Princess. If your basing this on your pet or someone else and it's one of these names then that's cool because the name means something special. These names shouldn't be your teddy's name because they are used too much and they're not very original. Use your imagination!

, Lots of wikiHow articles explain how to do this and there's lots of cool ideas. Why not make features that move or work like a real working light or a fan that moves? Maybe make features that are based on the animal like for a turtle a hammock for a tropical friend or for a poodle a makeup stand. Be creative!

, This is a great time to think what your teddy or stuffed animal likes and dislikes. For example, if your teddy or stuffed animal flops down on the sand when you put it in a sitting position it might mean it's relaxed.

, Make a shirt or a dress first because you need those. Once you've got the hang of it try making swimwear, sunglasses, raincoats or shoes. You can make some gear like a ball, a book or two, a mat or a bed.

, Don't take it out anywhere that day because it probably needs some rest and it may be contagious. Poor little guy/girl!
, Make sure it is held close on your lap so you don't lose it.

, Remember to say goodbye and leave it some activities to do while you're gone. When you come back tell him/her what you did.

, Tell them when the party starts and what time to be there. Write all the details on cute little invitations with a photo of your stuffed animal. If your parents don't allow your friends to come over, tell them to drop their stuffed animal off at your house. Offer to pick your stuffed animal's buddies up and if you use the car, then buckle ALL their friends in. Ask them if their stuffed animal can stay for a sleepover, and let them get their PJs.

, Let them choose what they like. Take this opportunity to buy food. Some suggestions are: jelly, pizza, ice cream, fizzy pop, strawberries, crisps, toffee popcorn. Of course, this can be fake if you like. Ask your parents if you can use a camera to take pictures of them having fun and print them out, so they can take them home in their goodie bags.

, Remember to hide it and make sure your stuffed animal wants it. You can get their old christmas list and get one of the things that they didn't get.

, This means, make a cake and start decorating, and setting the table. You can put a chair with an extra cushion out for your stuffed animal, or simply let him or her sit on your lap. Prepare some fun activities like Legos or drawing and get your stuffed animal's bedroom ready! Lay down the spare mattresses if there is a sleepover and pack the picnic! Prepare everything!

, You could play hide-and-seek (you work in pairs to hide eachother. stuffed animals can be in the same groups, you just need to help them hide together) or make up another cool game. Let your stuffed animal play tag with his friends, or let her play inside. It depends what your stuffed animal wants. If you have video games, let them play, and take lots of pictures of them. Let them go nuts!

, Before letting your stuffed animal open them, ensure they are wrapped properly and you know who they're from so you can thank them later.

, Maybe bring a big bag to the park and put the stuffed animals inside. Again take lots of pictures, and let them take turns on what to do. Bring a picnic and put SMALL (you don't want to eat much after that cake!) snacks in. Let your stuffed animals go crazy, once again.

, Offer them the sofa and put a blanket over them. Let them watch a movie and wait until the credits roll. Then assure them to their room and tuck them in. Wait until they start to stir and party! (That will happen, if so, let them have a dance party), Have fun!

If the animal is way too dirty for vacuuming, give it toy a bath by putting it in the washing machine, or you can hand wash it yourself. Just be sure to read the washing instructions for your toy.







, Nobody wants a naked toy! The best store to buy clothes will be toy stores or places that let you make a bear/stuffed toy.

Use this method to minimize damage.,
Scrub water-sensitive parts with a dry towel or toothbrush.,
Separate all remaining pieces.,
Agitate in soapy water.,
Add vinegar (optional).,
Let the pieces soak.,
Scrub the pieces if necessary.,
Rinse the pieces.,
Dry the bricks.",How to Clean LEGOs1," This method is more time-consuming than others, unless the LEGO only has minor dust and dirt. Use this for your favorite or most collectible LEGO, to keep them safe from accidental damage.;
, Set aside any pieces with stickers or printed patterns, as well as any multi-part units that are not meant to be separated, such as turntables. Scrub these with a dry towel, or remove serious grime using a new toothbrush.


Delicate electrical parts can be cleaned using alcohol wipes instead.

, Detach all non-water-sensitive parts from each other, unless they are stuck. Make sure to pull apart multi-piece units such as tires.If you have a large collection, divide them into containers of about 200 or 300 each.

, Place the separated LEGO bricks in a container. Add lukewarm water and a little dish soap or other mild detergent. Agitate the bricks gently, stirring them around with your hand.


Never use a cleaning product that contains bleach.
Never use water above 104ºF (40ºC).

, If the bricks smell bad or if you would like to sanitize them, add white vinegar to the water. Use approximately ¼ to ½ as much vinegar as you did water.

, Leave them to soak for at least ten minutes, then check up on them. If the water is extremely murky, replace it with fresh soapy water and leave to soak for a full hour, or overnight if convenient.

, If there is still stuck-on grime, you may need to scrub it off using a new toothbrush, or a toothpick to reach crevices.Clear plastic pieces such as windshields are easily scratched. Rub them with your finger instead.

, Transfer the LEGO bricks to a strainer or colander and rinse them in cold water to remove the soap and loosened grime.

, Optionally, spin the bricks in a salad spinner to remove some of the water. Next, place the wet bricks in a single layer on a towel, right-side up so water drains from the underside. To speed up the drying process, leave a fan on blowing over the bricks.


Do not use a hair dryer, which can damage the bricks.

Provide them a place to live.,
Know where to keep them.,
Provide food.,
Love your Pokémon.,
Play with them!,
Watch shows with them!,
Take them everywhere!,
Wash them well.,
Put them to bed.,
Have fun.",How to Take Care of Your Pokémon Plush," Depending on your Pokémon and type, they will live in different habitats, Bulbasaur for example, lives in a grassland, but Charmander lives in the mountains, and Pikachu just likes the forest, or a barn.You want your plush to feel at home, right? Regardless of habitat you will need a big box (cardboard, plastic, anything as long as it's a box that they will fit and there is at least 6 inches of room for furniture or décor). You can also design a cozy house, or just a bed. The bed has to have a mattress, blanket, and pillow.


For grassland you could use ribbon or green string as grass. Or for the mountains Styrofoam like snow, but other methods recommend are things like paint and model magic or other air-dry clay that you could spike or create designs in if you want them in a house instead of their natural habitat.;
, Where to keep them is pretty crucial too. Your Pokémon's type will tell, for fire types (like Fennekin, Typhlosion, and Tepig), keep them by a fireplace or a window where the sun shines through, keep a fan or air conditioning on them if they are ice types (like Vanillite), next to the sink filled with water, a bucket of water, or a pool if you have one for water types (like Froakie, Oshawott, or Poliwag).


The garage or a place with lots of steel for steel types (like Beldum), near an electric socket or a window in a thunderstorm with lightning for electric types (like Pikachu, Pachirisu, Emolga, Electrike, or Manectric) take them to the gym on occasions for fighting types (like Hariyama), bug types (like Caterpie or Parasect) and grass types (like Snivy or Chespin) will enjoy being kept near plants, and normal or fairy types depend.
Keep Munchlax in the kitchen, or Jigglypuff next to your karaoke system (because Jigglypuff is excellent at singing).

, Food is a large matter here, whether you choose real food or just play food for dolls and things it won't matter. For real food let them have dinner with you, only when no one is watching. You can also take things like brown Beados on a spoon and feed them Pokémon food.


They might enjoy some Poffins with you. Poffins can be sugar cookies, dinner rolls, etc. Rare candy can be bought at stores in the shape of gumballs or chocolate balls, or you can pretend that you found new rare candy that is a gummy bear or some Smarties.
PokePuffs (found as cake balls, cream puffs, or donut holes) and Pokeblocks (as Jolly Rancher candy) are great, too!

, Love all depends on how you treat them and what kind of trainer you want to be. You can be strict like A.J. in the episode of the anime The Path to the Pokémon League or you can choose to be like Ash, he is friends with his Pokémon but does have his requirements, or yet just completely soft, they don't battle, they are low levels except for friendship, and etc.

, But make sure what toys, board games, and video games they like!

, Discover your Pokémon's favorite shows.


Phione loves Dora the Explorer.
Joltik loves Zerby Derby.
Paras loves Blue's Clues.
Swinub loves the Fairly Odd Parents.
Treecko loves Go Diego Go.
Squirtle and Chinchou love Franklin (you mean the turtle?).
Weedle loves Little Bear.
Venonat enjoys Little Einsteins.
Aipom loves Ni-Hao, Kai-Lan.
Pikachu loves to watch the Pokémon series.
Pachirisu loves the Wonder Pets.

, Only take them to places where you have no doubt you won't have to put them down, they can go in the car but leave them in a shady spot in the car when you leave, only if you have to. If you bring them into a store make sure that they don't sell that plush there; otherwise someone might report you for stealing it from that store, and don't ever put them down for a second.


Try putting them in a backpack with their head poking out, or in a purse, but ALWAYS check that they are still there in case they fall out. Only bring it to school on show and tell, and only have it out of your backpack when your teacher says so, you don't want them taken away now do you?

, If they are dirty, a nice hand wash for experienced adults, or if the plush tag says its okay, then the washer might help, when its done wrap it in a towel and give a nice long HUG. Repeat when dirty, but if it has fuzz like Cyndaquil's fire then its not a good idea to machine wash.

, Make sure you have a big box for them to sleep in. Sing to them if they feel like it, or tell them a story. Or, if you have Teddy Ruxpin and a Teddy Ruxpin Lullabies 1 or 2 cassette, let him sing to them for you!

, Having fun is the most important step, without it your Pokémon will neglect you. Bring them to the store as long as you follow Step 7. Take them outside to play, use some rope to take them on a walk, have sleepovers every now and then if you prefer to keep your Pokémon in its habitat at night. Read a book, or my favorite, watch a Pokémon episode all about that Pokémon. If you get a new Pokémon or stuffed animal that you care more about, then still play with the old Pokémon plush now and then, and if you are done with them forever, give them to another loving family or to a friend to watch them from now on.

If you haven't already done so, give your stuffed turtle its own name.,
Keep your stuffed turtle in a safe place.,
Keep your stuffed turtle away from direct sunlight.,
Wash the stuffed toy gently if it gets dirty.,
Dress your stuffed turtle.,
Take good care of your stuffed turtle if you take it outside of the house.",How to Take Care of a Stuffed Turtle," You could base it on turtle themed things, such as ""Green Shell"", ""Webby"" or ""Swim Champ"" or you could use a name that you just happen to like.


Is your stuffed turtle male or female? This might influence the name you choose for it.;
, Do not leave your toy on the floor where it might get trodden on or lost under piles of clothes. Find a nice place on a shelf, on the bed or on a table for the turtle to rest when you're not playing with it or cuddling it.

, Direct sunlight will cause the colors to fade very quickly, and any pattern on your stuffed turtle may be lost.


Also keep the stuffed toy away from heat sources. This is especially important around naked flames, as many stuffed toys burn very easily.

, Try spot washing before washing the whole toy, as spot washing can lift off stains and leave the toy looking nice again. It's always a good idea to clean the toy as soon as you can after getting a stain on it, as it will come out far more easily when the stain is fresh.


If you want to wash the whole toy, this can be done by hand by immersing it in a basin or bucket of lukewarm water with gentle washing soap. It's recommended that you only do this on a warm day, so that the toy will dry quickly outside. Hang from a clothesline or rest on a sweater drying base.
If you want to wash the stuffed turtle in the washing machine, read the label to see if this okay.
If you want to dry the stuffed turtle in the dryer, read the label. It might be possible on low heat but be aware that not all fabrics and stuffings are suitable for dryers. Moreover, if there are any fluffy bits on the turtle, these may shrink or even fall out if they are dried using direct heat.

, If you like playing with your stuffed turtle a lot, you might like to change its look by adding a few clothes or accessories. Here are some suggestions for you to try:


If it's wintertime, put on winter clothes for your stuffed turtle.
If it's fall, put a light jacket on your stuffed turtle.
If it's summer, put sunglasses on the stuffed turtle's head.
If it's spring, get a flower basket for your stuffed turtle. Pick flowers and put them in the basket.

, Some things to be careful of include:


If you play with the stuffed turtle in the garden, take care not to get it dirty with soil or grass stains.
If you take the stuffed turtle to school, keep it safe and don't share it around too much or it may get dirty or lost.
If you take the stuffed turtle on a car ride, to a picnic or on a trip somewhere, always remember to look for it before leaving, to make sure that you bring it back home with you.
If you go to the beach with your stuffed turtle, be sure to brush the sand off it when you're finished.

Follow these instructions at your own risk.,
Separate the pieces.,
Put the pieces in a laundry bag or pillowcase.,
Set the machine to gentle, cold wash. Use the gentlest setting on your washing machine, and cold water only.,
Add mild detergent.,
Let the pieces air dry.",How to Clean LEGOs2," LEGO customer service warns against using washing machines due to the risk of damage from heat or tumbling.> Many LEGO bricks have emerged from the machine unharmed, but that is not necessarily true for your bricks and your washing machine., Detach all pieces from each other unless they are stuck by grime. Set aside all pieces with stickers, printed ink, moving parts, electrical parts, or clear plastic. These must be scrubbed with a dry towel or alcohol wipes to avoid damage from the tumbling.

, A fine mesh clothes bag will prevent the bricks from jamming the machine, and minimize damage to the bricks from tumbling, although scratching is still possible. You may use a pillowcase if you do not have a laundry bag, but make sure to close it tightly with a zipper or a rubber band., Any temperature above 104ºF (40ºC) has the potential to melt LEGO bricks.

, Mild laundry detergent is recommended to avoid scratching. Read the labels on eco-friendly detergent if you're having trouble finding one marked mild.

, Lay the pieces out on a towel on their sides or base so water can drain. Keep in a ventilated room to speed up the drying, but keep them away from heat. They may take one or two days to fully dry, depending on humidity.

Wash the bricks first.,
Put the bricks in a transparent container.,
Cover the bricks with hydrogen peroxide.,
Weigh down large, floating pieces.,
Stir the pieces around once an hour.,
Rinse and dry bricks once color is restored.",How to Clean LEGOs3," This method will reverse the discoloration that occurs due to sun exposure, but it does not remove grime. Follow one of the methods above first to get your bricks clean before you attempt this.


You do not need to dry your bricks before following these instructions.

, Sun exposure is an important part of this method, so use a glass or plastic container. Place it in an area with plenty of sun, but keep it away from children and pets, as non-edible materials will be used.


Because the hydrogen peroxide reacts with ultraviolet light, only sunlight or a UV lamp will work.
Do not use this method for parts with stickers and electrical parts.

, Use the standard 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, available in drug stores. You'll need enough to cover your discolored bricks.


Although 3% hydrogen peroxide is safe for skin contact, wear gloves and safety goggles to minimize exposure, and keep away from mouths and hair. Children should have an adult handle this for them.

, Some of your LEGO pieces may float in the hydrogen peroxide. Use any heavy object to weigh down the largest pieces., Stirring the small pieces around with a stick or gloved hand will dislodge the bubbles causing them to float. Try this every hour or so for best results. If you leave pieces floating too long, they can develop a cloudy white marking along the water line.If no bubbles form on the pieces after an hour, the hydrogen peroxide has broken down into mostly water. Dispose of the liquid down the drain and try again with a new bottle.

, This typically takes about four to six hours. This time varies depending on the strength of the sunlight and the age of the hydrogen peroxide. Once done, transfer the bricks to a colander, rinse them, and air dry.

Consider using a lion if your kingdom is located in the jungle as lions are known as the ""King of the Jungle"". However, it is entirely up to you.

, You can give them a name, personal history, and family members if you like. The King can have a queen and there can be princes and princesses. The King can have knights and the Queen, Ladies in Waiting.

, All the stuffed toys can be upper class and ""posh"" if you like or some can be maids, and knaves and serfs.

, Have jobs for the animals based on their history. Remember, a baker can't bake without a farmer for the ingredients and a smith can't forge without someone mining the ores for them. There are no houses without a builder to build them and a supplier of the materials, for example a lumberjack for a wood house so if you want to, you can have a really detailed, working, Stuffed Animal Kingdom.

, A house can be a cardboard box with a doorway, a blanket draped over a chair, under a chair, even a small area that you claim is the house. The Royal Palace or Castle can be more fancy than where the peasants live.

, Make them carry out jobs, get married, start a family and have the children grow up. Make an enemy Kingdom and have knights that go into battle on behalf of their King if you like. Make bandits to pillage the kingdom. Remember that bandits and knights and what-not don't just appear really, but when you are playing make believe you can do what you like. You can pretend the bandits and knights grow up from your original kingdom members and have their history impact their futures. You can have the kingdom expand or grow smaller.;
, Include neighboring Empires and unknown territory for your animals to explore.

, Tell your friends too and let them run kingdoms alongside your own!

, If you have lots of friends, you could ask each friend to create a 'family' of animals and create a house for them. If you have one or two friends, then tell them to also create cousins, aunts, ect. You could even make a kingdom each, create allies with some, and rivals with others."

Use your custom block in your programs the same way you use any other block.",How to Program Lego's NXT Mindstorm," The robot should come with software for both Mac and Windows included, or you can download it from the Lego Mindstorm website. When you insert the disk or open the downloaded version, an installation window will pop up. Follow the instructions to get the software installed, and then open it.
, Use the toolbar at the top to save your program, open an existing program, or create a new one. Use the pointer tool, shaped like a black arrow, to insert, move, and delete operations. The pan tool, shaped like a white hand, lets you drag the program window around in the window so that you can scroll through your program. The comment tool, shaped like a speech bubble, lets you insert text over parts of your program so that you can add comments to describe and help others understand your program.

On the right hand side of the window, the Robo Center contains tutorials and instructions for several different robots that you can build and program. The other tab at the top of the Robo Center opens your Portal, which lets you access online resources to help you with your programming.
Hover over an operation to bring up a description of that operation in the bottom right, and view or change the settings for that operation on the bottom of the window.

, The toolbar on the left contains all the operations your robot can perform. The three tabs on the bottom of the toolbar give you access to different sets of these operations. Explore this toolbar to discover and experiment with different tasks for your robot.

The leftmost tab, with the green circle, contains the most common operations like Move, Sound, Loop, and Switch. This layout gives you quick access to the operations you'll use the most, but it doesn't let you access the rest.
The middle tab, with three colored squares, contains all included operations, divided into categories. Hover your mouse over the green circle at the top to access common operations. Hover over the green square to access actions like playing a sound or turning on a colored light. Explore the other buttons to find all other operations.
The last tab, with the teal equals sign, holds your custom operations, ones that you created yourself or downloaded from the internet.

, The software includes several tutorials that will guide you through your first programs. Go to the Robo Center on the right and click on the category of program you want to create. For your first program, think about starting with the Shooterbot under Vehicles. This tutorial will start simply but will introduce you to the basic controls at your disposal, as well as general coding and testing practices., Change their settings as necessary to make sure each operation does exactly what you want it to do. String together multiple operations by placing them in sequence, connected by the chain running through your program. Drop operations inside a loop or switch to include those operations in that control statement., Connect the brick to your computer using the USB wire. The square of buttons at the bottom right of your program window allows you to communicate with a connected NXT device. The bottom left of these buttons will download your program onto your device. Once the download is complete, unplug the intelligent brick, insert it into your robot, and start the program to see it run., This operation has two gears on it. Add it to your program and then configure the settings. Use the ports that are connected to the tires to move your robot. If you've connected the wheels to ports B and C, make sure the Move is set to use ports B and C.

Move forward or backward, or stop altogether, by setting the direction. Turn using the steering controls.
Move forward for a set number of rotations, a certain amount of time, or a number of degrees. Or set the duration to ""Unlimited"" to have your robot move until it receives a command, later in the program, to stop.

, In the Shooterbot tutorial, your shooter plugs into port A. To control this, use a Motor operation (depicted by just one gear) that activates port A. Configure the settings to control the precise operation of this motor by setting the direction (forward, backward, or stopped), action, power level, and duration of the motion.

Unchecking ""Wait for Completion"" allows the robot to begin executing the next commands in your program before completing the motion controlled by the Motor operation. This can allow your robot, for instance, to move and shoot at the same time.
The Motor command will execute any operation performed by the motor it controls. Build your robot such that the motor lifts up a tray, shoots a ball, turns the robot, or anything else you can think of. This command allows for creativity and flexibility in your robot's performance; take advantage of it.

, Hook up ultrasonic, touch, and color sensors to the intelligent chip's ports, and use them to sense light, color, sound, and touch. Your robot can also keep track of time and rotation. These sensors allow your program to perform actions only when they are activated. For instance, you could have a program say ""Red"" when it detects the color red, but not when it detects the color blue., These can include turning on or off a colored light, playing sound from a sound file, displaying an image or text on the intelligent brick's screen, or sending a message over Bluetooth., Loops allow you to perform a series of commands repeatedly, either indefinitely, for a set number of times, while a certain condition is true, or until a certain action happens.

For example, to have your robot to examine a bunch of balls until it finds a yellow one, simply create a loop controlled by the color sensor. The actions inside the loop will be those to examine the next ball; the control on the loop will be that the color sensor does not detect yellow. Thus when the color sensor, after examining a ball, detects yellow, it will stop examining new balls and move on to the next step of the program.

, A switch statement tells your robot to perform one series of commands if a certain condition is true and a different series of actions if that condition is not true. These two series of actions are mutually exclusive in the switch: the robot will perform one but not the other.

Nest one switch inside another to check for multiple conditions before performing an action. For instance, use nested switches to have your robot move forward if it detects neither light nor sound. The first switch will check for light; if light is not detected, the robot will enter the second switch, which checks for sound. Only if sound is not detected (after the light has not been detected) will the robot move forward.
To include more than one case in a switch controlled by a value, uncheck ""Flat view"" in the settings for the switch and, on the right side of the settings where it lists the conditions, press ""+"" to add another case. This is useful when the control is a number or text message whose value can be more than two different things.

, This will set the condition the robot will check for before performing the commands inside the switch or loop. Usually, the control will be a sensor. This allows your robot to interact closely with its environment.

Switches can also be controlled by a value. Attach a variable to the leading edge of the switch using a data wire. Add cases for the exact input of a number or text variable. For instance, have your robot execute a series of commands if the number variable is 0, different commands if it's 1, and yet another set of commands in case it's any other number.
Loops can also be controlled by time -- the statements inside will run for a certain amount of time -- or count -- the whole loop will run through a certain number of times. Choose Logic to have the loop run until a certain condition becomes true or false, or Forever to have the robot perform those commands indefinitely.

, Any operations that you put inside a loop will be performed every time the loop runs through. Operations that you place in each case of a switch will be performed if that case is met. Place and configure these operations as normal.

You can include loops and switches inside other loops and switches, if you so desire.

, Variables can store information so that you can access it later in the program. Think of them as a box into which you put certain information. You can later remove or change that information without changing the box -- the variable -- itself.

Each variable can store a number, a string of text, or a logic value (true or false). You can freely change the value of a variable, but you can't change its type.
Each variable has a unique name. Use this name to access and refer to the variable.

, In the window that pops up, enter the name of your variable and choose your desired datatype (logic, number, or text). You can also delete variables you no longer need.

Give your variables descriptive names so that you can keep track of what they are. If you want a variable to store a greeting that your robot will send as a message, name the variable ""greeting"" rather than ""text_var_1"" or something similarly ambiguous.

, Connect them to math operations to combine variables or set them to the result. Connect them to loops or switches to use them as the control, and even modify them inside the loop or switch., If you want a text variable for the name of your robot, set it at the beginning by going to Edit → Define Constants. Then you can refer to this constant without worrying about it being changed., Create a custom block for a series of two or more operations that you repeat several times throughout your program. For example, if you want your robot to move forward for three seconds and then flash a red light, include these instructions in a custom block so that you can access them quickly and easily each time you need to include them in the program., Include them in your program just as you normally would., Hold down Shift and click on each operation. Once they're all selected, click the equals sign in the top toolbar right next to the comments tool. This will bring up a window called ""My Block Builder."" You can also go to Edit → Make a New My Block to open the custom block builder.

If you have any data wires coming into or out of the blocks you selected for your custom block, these will appear as ports for your block, and you can connect them to variables or other data when you use your block in a program.

, The name should be short but descriptive so that you remember exactly what the block does. The description should be clear and detailed, and include important notes like, for instance, what direction your robot needs to be facing or what needs to be plugged into Port A for your block to work properly., Drag any icons you want into your block's icon at the top. When you're finished creating your icon, click Finish. In your program, the steps corresponding to your block will be replaced by the block you just created., You can even combine multiple custom blocks into another one to make your programming even easier. Be creative -- custom blocks can be incredibly useful if you take advantage of them."

Create the frame of your truck.,
Add cabin features to the lowered section of your base.,
Create the windshield of your LEGO vehicle.,
Fasten fenders to the front of your car.Your fenders, sometimes called a rounded mudguard, should be half circles attached to a flat piece or brick.,
Add clear orange pieces to your front end piece.,
Sandwich your clear orange pieces with a 2 x 4 plate.,
Include lights on the front of your truck.The clear, sloped, red 1 x 1 piece will be attached to the top left and right sides of your front end, in line with the orange transparent pieces you installed earlier.,
Plate the very front of your front end.,
Attach your front end to the front of your truck.,
Connect your hood and air intake to your front end.,
Install doors and walls of the bed of your truck.The 1 x 1 circular attachment piece of your doors will have to go on the free stud closest to the front of your car to either side of the truck cabin.,
Create your rear end.,
Add rear accents to your rear end.,
Attach your rear end to your truck.,
Roof the cabin of your truck and the front-most part of the bed.Your flat, 4 x 4 piece should completely cover the top of the cabin of your vehicle.,
Add a unifying roof piece and a sloped window for effect.To join your cabin and bed together firmly, you should connect both by attaching your 4 x 8 piece to the top.,
Fasten your hood cover and railings for the bed.,
Construct your front wheels.On a 2 x 4 axle piece, first attach a 2 x 2 block.,
Attach the wheel assembly of your car to the front end.Make sure the studs of your spinning piece is lined up like a normal block to make sure its studs attach to the bottom of your front end.,
Construct your rear wheel assembly with half axles.,
Give your rear wheels enough clearance from the bed of the truck.You can do this by first adding a 2 x 4 block to the top of your rear axle.,
Attach your rear tire assembly and add wheels to the axles.Now you can attach your rear wheel assembly toward the back of your truck.,
Create a hitch for the rear of your truck.,
Link your hitch by pressing its studs into the underside of the bed.,
Close off the empty space between the bed and cabin.,
Make a step for your cabin.Take your 2 x 4 sloped piece and on top of it add a flat 2 x 4 piece so that the rear four studs of your flat piece hang off the back of your sloped piece.,
Add your cabin step and a driver.",How to Build a LEGO Truck," Take your small car base piece and attach a 4 x 12 long piece to the back four raised studs of your base.This will form the bed and front cabin of your truck.;
, The recessed area of your small car base is where the cabin of your vehicle will be and where you LEGO driver will sit. Put the steering wheel and the seat in the dropped-down area., Start by taking both your square windows and stacking them, one on top of the other. Then attach these in front of the steering wheel to complete your windshield.

, Connect your fenders in front of the windshield, so the half circles point downward on either sides of the front of your truck.

, Your front end piece, also called the license plate holder, should have two studs on top and a contoured front stretching four studs wide and two studs tall. On the recessed studs on the rightmost and leftmost side of your front end add your 1 x 1 clear orange pieces.

, Your clear orange pieces should have mad the contoured front of your front end even, which will allow you to put on a flat 2 x 4 piece on top of it.


Now the orange pieces should be sandwiched between the 2x 4 plate the the front end piece.

, Place the sloped sides of these pieces to face off to each side of the truck.

, You should add the flat, smooth 1 x 2 piece between the sloped clear pieces. Then, below this, put the 1 x 2 flat piece with a middle circular stud directly below.

, The front-most part of your base that you have already attached fenders to will be the landing zone for your front end. Attach your front end to the free two studs at the very front of your base.

, The hood piece should fit evenly, covering all free studs on the top of your front end. On top of the hood should be two free studs. On these, you should attach the 1 x 2 air intake piece.

, Then:


Use 1 x 8 and 1 x 4 pieces evenly to the outside of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece to make you truck bed walls.
Leave one row of studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece for the hitch and license plate.

, Much like you did with the front end, you will use your license plate holder piece to create the back of your truck. On the left and right recessed studs on the top four-across row of your rear end, add red sloped pieces, slopes facing outward. Between these, attach your license plate.

, This includes a flat, yellow 1 x 4 piece with black diagonal slashes on it. This will be your read bumper. Attach it so that it stretches across the bottom of your license plate holder piece.

, On the free four studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece, connect your rear end. Make sure the edges meet with the walls of the bed of your truck and the rear end piece is firmly fastened.

, Then, stretching across the gap made by the 2 x 8 pieces:


Attach two 2 x 4 blocks, on on top the other, so that both are flat against the back wall of your cabin.
Attach two 1 x 4 pieces behind the 2 x 4 blocks.
This should create an flat surface that is level with the roof of your cabin.

, A single row of studs should hang free the hood/window area of your truck.


Attach your sloped window atop the 4 x 8 on the front-most studs.

, The hood cover should go in the front-center of the 4 x 8 piece for the most realistic effect. Use 1 x 8 smooth pieces on the top of the walls of the bed of your truck.


Leave two free studs on the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin.

, On top of this block, add a 2 x 2 flat piece, and atop that add a 2 x 2 spinning piece. This will allow the front wheels of your car can turn left and right. Now you can press your wheels onto the circular axles on the outside of the 2 x 4 axle piece.

, Then:


Attach the wheel assembly so the wheels stick out under the half circles of the fenders.

, You're going to need to fashion two 2 x 2 half axles into a single piece to give the rear wheels of your truck more width. Use a 2 x 2 piece attached to the underside of the two half axles to create one 2 x 4 axle.

, Then on the 2 x 4 block, add two 2 x 2 pieces, or a single 2 x 4 piece, so that all piece form flat sides.

, Then push your wheels onto the rear axle to finish the assembly.


Attach your wheels so the back edge of your connecting block is beneath the fourth stud from the rear of the bed of your truck.
You might also experiment with rear wheel placement to find what looks best for you.
Do not attach your wheel assembly to the very back of the underside of the bed of your truck; you will need some space to attach the hitch of your truck.

, Your hitch begins with a 2 x 6 flat piece. Take this 2 x 6 and add to the back-most two studs a 1 x 2 hitch piece. The hitch piece should have a round, upward facing part, which is the hitch.

, You should allow your hitch to stick out from the back of your truck about three studs. This will make your truck hitch look more realistic.

, The bed of your truck closest to the cabin still has a slight gap. Close this off to complete the bed of your truck. Do this by attaching two 1 x 2 pieces on top of each other. Then:


Attach your 1 x 2 pieces between the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin.

, Then put a 1 x 1 piece with a circular stud on the side on the rear corner of your 2 x 4 flat where it attaches to the sloped piece.


The 1 x 1 piece with a circular side stud is where your LEGO truck can be filled up with fuel.

, The free hanging back four studs of your flat 2 x 4 piece should be pressed into the bottom of your car base beneath the driver's side door. Then, open the door and put a LEGO figurine inside. It's time to go truckin'!

Make a desert island.,
Create a medieval realm.,
Try using only mini-figures.,
If things are getting overwhelming, try just building.,
Use mini-figures to mimic people already made.,
Imagine your LEGO mini-figures have all been transported from your hometown to another universe.,
Make a LEGO movie.,
Imagine aliens invade Earth- only these aliens are robots.,
Make a board game.,
Invite your friends or siblings (yes, they count as friends, too) over to play with you.,
Have fun!",How to Play Creatively with LEGO Bricks and Mini Figures," Use brown and orange bricks to make the sand. Use homemade or store-bought LEGO palm trees as scenery. Add a few animals and the skeletons of past explorers. Then grab some pirate ships, a merchant vessel, and an old raft (if you don't have any pre-made, just build your own). Use mini-figures as pirates, royalty and rich families, peasants, and stowaways. Add them to the appropriate boats. Pick a destination for each ship, and name the important characters (or just go ahead and name everyone). Decide which way the wind is blowing, head everyone in a certain direction, and begin.


What happens next? When ships spot each other, do they make friends or raid their neighbors boats? Does anyone have cannons to fire? Who is taken hostage? Is anyone shipwrecked? Do the island animals join the fray? How do personalities collide? What about the thunder god who turns the tides of the sea? It's all yours.;
, Build a castle- you can use regular bricks or arches, doors, and special windows. Don't forget secret passages, a moat and drawbridge, the tallest tower, and the dungeons! Stick a few crocodiles in the moat (you can buy them or make them yourself) and grab your mini-figures. Who is going to rule? An emperor? A king? A queen, prince, princess, duke, duchess, or fairy? Or all of the above? Make a royal family. Then grab castle guards and servants.


Something missing? The opposing team, of course! Get horses, chariots, catapults, and everything else you can think of. Then begin. How does the battle play out? Does a wizard arrive and turn everything purple? Is the frog actually the lost prince in disguise? Do mercenaries appear and backstab their friends? Who organizes the jail breaks? Does anyone turn traitor? The stage is yours.
You can also make a medieval village with huts and poor people. Get a duke to bully everyone around and grab some forest animals. Do the people start a revolution? Is the serving maid really a princess? Are the huts actually alive and with chicken legs that carry them all over town?

, The people wake up in a land full of... nothing. No invisible walls, secret passages, or even rocks to stumble on. There isn't even any mist. What do they do? When machines, buildings, and weapons aren't available (with no way to even make them), people become the only source of leverage. Do people pick teams? It's hard to use the landscape to your advantage as there isn't a landscape. But there's more. Is there weather? What happens if someone removes their shoes? Do they disappear, or become the only projectiles?


You can also create a secret overlord. They can be the god of the underworld, a dragon, or just a really, really smart nerd. The overlord can create walls and scenery, mess with the weather, or just plain abduct people and watch panic ensue. Do the people know about the overlord, or is the whole thing just a mystery? And what happens when the overlord swaps people's heads?

, Make the fort of your dreams! Secret passages, look-out towers, and buckets of slime to pour on enemy heads are calling your name. Is your fort a tree house? On the tallest mountain ever? Or floating in the Atlantic ocean?


Try re-creating something that's already been invented. For example, Elsa from Disney's ""Frozen"" has a pretty neat ice castle you can make using blue and white LEGO bricks. Add arches and staircases. Don't forget the chandelier! You may want to watch some parts of the movie over again to get everything in the right place.

, If you can't afford to buy a set of the Hobbit LEGOs, you can just make them on your own. Study pictures of super stars and play around with legs, torsos, heads, and facial hair (as well as accessories) to make models.


Try to make a LEGO mini-figure that looks like you! You can even dress like your LEGO mini-figure and carry it around in your pocket.

, What happens to them? Do they start wars with each other, or stick together in fear of the unknown? What does the landscape look like? Mountains? Rivers? Valleys? Is it made completely of metal? Is there any gravity? What are the animals like? Do they bite? Speak? Are they part human? Is the ground itself alive, sucking up people one by one? Is there any way to get back to Earth, or is everyone stuck forever? What happened to make this happen? Was it the world itself, or did someone in the group turn traitor and suck everyone here for their own nefarious purposes? You decide.


Or, make it the other way around. People from planet Kslybnnszzcce get sucked here when their wizard makes a mistake. How do they adapt? Do they take over our planet? Are we ever able to send them back where they came from?

, Think of a storyline (it should be brief, like 3 minutes or less) and create your characters. Then use stop-action to move everyone around. Add funny voices and sound effects. Post your video on YouTube, or just keep it as a home movie.


You can also create LEGO scenes by positioning your mini-figures in funny positions. Then snap a picture and add hilarious captions. You can post these photos online or use them as your screensaver.

, They've been sent by someone on Earth trying to take over the world- they'll stop at nothing. The remaining people alive must pool their resources and fight them using... empty toilet paper rolls. Use classic story ideas, but give them an interesting twist to make them even better. Maybe the robots shoot lipstick from their palms, meaning that only teenage girls can survive their blows. It's up to you.

, Using LEGOs. Try playing Monopoly or Clue but with mini-figures of your own invention. You could also make a board game entirely from scratch. The board is made of LEGO bricks, the cards are LEGO platforms drawn on with Sharpie, the dice are made of LEGO's... you get the idea.

, Have everyone pick a team of LEGO people and grab a giant pile of bricks. Let the wars begin! Construct buildings to boost your defense. Scavenge for weapons and tools. Attack people. Use potions to turn invisible. Dress up like a serving girl and sneak into the dungeons to free your friends. Recruit ancient dragons to help you. Anything is possible.


Don't be selfish about hoarding your LEGO's. There are possibilities you've never thought of, things you've never imagined. Your friends and family can give you awesome ideas. Plus, it's lonely playing by yourself.

, LEGOs aren't homework. They're a bridge to another world, a world where you are once again a kid. Forget everything. Don't worry about being ""mature"" or ""sensible"". LEGOs are pretty weird and unrealistic anyway. Let your imagination run wild.


One of your LEGO mini-figures has a superpower. They can make sticky notes appear anywhere! Pick something completely random. It doesn't have to make sense.
Having trouble creating villains? They don't have to be human. Try a very angry cat as your villain. Or, you can have a cooking pot be conspiring with a table and a chair- they want to destroy the world!
Try to make everything a joke. Have things be ridiculous. Laugh out loud! Have odd comments or ideas and make everything something to smile about.

",How to Take Care of an Elf Toy," Let him/her have tons of hugs and kisses. Even though he or she is probably extremely happy to finally live in a big home with big people who will take great care of him/her, he/she is probably missing Santa and all his/her elf friends terribly.;
, get old boxes, newspapers, construction paper, doll furniture, and anything else you can think of that would make good furniture. Cut it up to make something. Let your elf enjoy!

, He/she probably hungry after his/her journey all the way from the North Pole to your house! All elves have a sweet tooth, so two-three little candies, like M&M, Skittles, or Smarties, will do just fine. They only eat at night, though!

, (s)he probably bored after his journey, also. Christmas stories are an elf's favorite, but elves like any kind of book!

, Whether you just walk down the street or go on vacation, your elf will love it! Some suggestions are Grandma's house, the park, your favorite place to play outside, your backyard, your friend's house, or the ice skating rank. They don't get to see any type of weather besides snow, and they have no clue what outside looks like if it's not at the North Pole. So, your elf will find it very interesting to go somewhere!

, He/she can't go to his/her regular school while he/she is away, so he/she won't learn anything. It's up to you to teach him/her! Teach him/her things you think elves would need to learn, like gift wrapping or cookie making.

, Again, an elf's favorite is a Christmas movie, but they like anything!

, Play dress up, play pretend, do a puzzle, play a board game, play video games, or anything you would like. Elves love it all!

, After all that playing, your elf is probably getting a bit tired. Sit down and give your elf some clay hot chocolate, and drink some people hot chocolate for yourself.

, If your elf and you would like, you could change him/her into pajamas. If his/her clothes don't come off, don't worry about it, or put some pajamas over his/her clothes. Give him/her an elf bath. Elves don't need water to get clean. Instead, put him/her in the bathtub you built (no water!) or a doll bathtub. Wipe him/her down with a dry cloth, and be sure to spritz him/her with just a dab of perfume once a week to keep him/her smelling nice.

, You could use an unfolded pillowcase, a dry hand towel, or a doll blanket for him/her. Be sure to give him/her a kiss and tell him/her if he/she goes to bed now, you'll play with him/her again tomorrow!

, Use a soft baby brush to groom the pillow. Wash it if needed, following the manufacturer's instructions for using a washing machine. Don't forget to take it out of the machine quickly once washed, to avoid it getting smelly.

Spot cleaning is often more effective than washing the whole pillow.

, It could either sleep in its own little box or you could let it stay on the bed with you. Your pillow pet should be comfortable.

, If you want, tell him/her a story or sing/play him/her a lullaby like ""Appalachian Lullaby"" from Tanya Goodman. Don't forget to wish it goodnight!, Feed your pet a little bit of food once in a while to make your pet's stomach feel better. If your pet throws up, clean it up and help your pet relax. Make your pet take a nap. If your pet refuses to, tell your pet the throwing up and sickness will never go away.

, Have conversations with it; you can tell it anything as it won't talk!, Play with your pet every day. If your pet has a favorite ball, play with it.


Entertain the pillow pet with toys, play hide-and-seek together, and play your video games together.

, But be careful, there should be some sounds that make you sad, so don't watch anything with those sounds.

Make sure the show is TV-Y, TV-Y7, and TV-G, and the movie is G or PG. Blue's Clues, Team Umizoomi, Bubble Guppies, Max & Ruby, Little Einsteins, and Fanboy & Chum Chum are great examples of shows to watch together.

, Trips are fun! Your pet is probably sick of staying in your house all the time. Whether it is a cool vacation to Disney World or just a visit at Grandma's house, your pet will sure be glad you let it have a nice getaway.


If you are spending the night at a hotel, or a week at a hotel, be sure to bring everything you and your pet needs. If your pet has a favorite ball or blanket or whatever, be sure to bring it. If your pet can't sleep without that special blanket or teddy, and you forget it, tell your pillow pet you are very sorry and you will not forget it the next time you go on vacation and you will let your pet sleep with you.

, Take your pillow pet to a restaurant, a movie theater, museums, parks and more, This is great because you've both a little friend and something to sleep on or rest against. Sit by a window so you and your pet can look out the window and see how far up you two are. If your pet is scared being so high, comfort your pet and tell your pet it won't last for long and your pet will get used to it.

, If you are sleeping on a bunk, and you are sleeping on the top bunk, make sure your pet isn't afraid of high places.

, If you aren't allowed to, and you brought books and fun games, you can play some games. Games you and your pet might like to play are in the tips.

, When you had all your fun, pack up and get ready to leave. If your pet hides behind a couch or under the covers of your bed, ask them why your pet is hiding. If your pet was afraid of the plane, your pet is probably hiding because your pet didn't like the plane ride to the place. If this does happen, tell your pet it will be okay.


Home, sweet home. When you are home, let your pet relax. Help your pet get settled in to your house. When your pet does, watch TV, eat popcorn, or do any fun thing that you couldn't do that your pet loves. Take care of your pet nicely! Have a good life with your pet! Love it very much!

",How to Organize Your Lego Collection," Do you want to sort it by size (2x2 bricks, 2x4 bricks or 1x- bricks, 2x- bricks, etc.)? What about by set or theme (Creator, Western, Fire Truck, etc.)? Perhaps colour is your preferred route (blue, green, light grey, etc.)? Pick the one you like best.;
, If you have all of it in one place already, you can skip this step! Otherwise, decide on a main LEGO area (where your largest collection is). Grab a few plastic bags and raid your other smaller collections and return it all to the central pile. You may be surprised by how much LEGO you actually have!

, If you only have a small amount of one group, mix it in with another small group. (e.g. you could mix light grey bricks with dark grey bricks or 2x2 bricks with 2x3 bricks).

, Purchase as many as you need, according to how you sorted your collection in the previous step. Place all your LEGO in the boxes.

, Translucent boxes may be a good buy as it will be easier to tell which group of bricks is in the box, especially if they are sorted by colour.

, If you're really a stickler for organization, you can arrange them by size (smallest up, largest down) by colour (the colour spectrum), or by set/theme (alphabetical, set number, etc.)

Remove the glass and face from the clock.,
Paint clock face.,
Measure the distance between the clock hands and the outer clock bands.,
Now its time to have fun.,
Hang on wall.

",How to Make a LEGO Star Wars Interchangeable Clock," You will return the glass to its rightful place after you’ve painted the interior portion.


Leave the clock border in tact--this is where you will place the LEGO figures. If you have to take the clock entirely apart, leave the clock border/frame on the sidelines, as you will be painting the clock face anyway. No point getting paint on the border.






Clean area around the clock face and prepare it for painting. Make sure you remove any debris or dust using a damp paper towel. Be sure if you wipe dust off the face you allow it to dry before painting.





;
, Depending on the look you are going for, cover the clock face with the paint color of your choice. don't forget to remove the clock's arms.


Use a stencil to create a Star Wars motif on the clock face. The Internet is filled with sites that provide you with a variety of shapes that can be transferred to the clock surface.






Consider using either (or both) spray paint and/or regular acrylic paint. If you are painting a large surface, spray paint may work wonders and get the job done quicker.






Return the clock arms to its original position after the paint has dried and after applying the background.






Wait up to 10 hours or overnight before putting the clock back together to ensure the paint has fully dried.







, You will be adding figures and possibly LEGO bricks around the perimeter of the clock. Make sure you have enough room so the hands don’t get stuck on a Lego block or person.


Trim the hands if necessary. Most likely the pieces should fit nicely along the edges and trimming the hands should not be necessary. However, make sure either you place the LEGO pieces strategically around the outermost edges or you use sharp scissors to trim down the hands.







, Use your imagination and a lot of glue to affix colorful Lego bricks and the characters around the perimeter of the clock border.

Use liquid nails or super glue to place LEGO bricks around the clock frame. Skip the areas that point toward numbers--this is where your Lego characters will be placed.






Return the clock glass to its original place.






Cut small strips of self-adhesive Velcro tape and place tape on the perimeter of the clock, in line with each number. The pieces of tape will be placed in line with each clock number so make sure you cut a piece that will be long enough to hold the Star Wars character but not too long that it blends into the next number. As an alternative you can use a lego block or piece.






Cut small strips of self-adhesive Velcro tape to be placed on the back of each LEGO Star Wars character. Make sure they are tapped firmly on the backs of each character.






Attach characters to the pieces of Velcro tape on the clock.






The Velcro design will allow you to move characters in different, interchangeable spots throughout the clock--so Darth Vader doesn’t always have to be seated when the clock strikes twelve.

Understand a Lego gun's firing mechanism.,
Construct the gun's ""beam"" or ""barrel."",
Incorporate a firing mechanism into the beam.,
Add a handle to your gun.,
Customize your gun.,
When you're ready to shoot, load your rubber band.,
Aim!",How to Make a LEGO Rubber Band Gun1," Generally, a rubber band is stretched from a fixed hook or notch at the front end of the gun (where an actual gun's muzzle would be) to a moving mechanism at the back of the gun (where an actual gun's hammer would be.) When you pull the trigger, the mechanism shifts, allowing the rubber band to snap forward, sending it flying in the direction that the gun's ""barrel"" is pointing.


Many Lego rubber band gun possibilities exist, as do many variations on the firing mechanism. The general principle behind most Lego guns, however - a stretched rubber band released at its back end - rarely changes.;
, The size and strength of your rubber bands should affect the length of the gun's barrel. If you're using big rubber bands, you'll want a much longer barrel than if you're using tiny orthodontic bands from your braces. The beam should be sturdily-constructed - it will need to bear the tension of one or more rubber bands.


A good basic ""barrel"" setup is one centered around of two long, thin pieces with holes in them. These pieces are separated by a space of one block - this gives room for the firing mechanism, which can be easily set up to rotate in one of the holes in the long thin pieces.Include a small notch or bump at the end of the barrel for the rubber band to catch on when it's stretched out. Make sure this is sturdy enough to hold the tension in the rubber band without falling off!

, A basic firing mechanism is simply a notch for the rubber band to catch on which is attached to an axle between the two pieces in the gun's beam. The axle should be kept from rotating freely by mechanism which releases when you press it - the gun's ""trigger."" When you press the trigger, the firing mechanism is allowed to turn freely. The tension in the rubber band causes it to turn forward, releasing the rubber band into your bratty cousin's ear.


Though they almost all follow the same basic principle, a variety of firing and trigger mechanisms exist for your Lego gun. The simplest incorporate a few simple L-shaped and straight Technic™ pieces rotating on separate axles to great effect., A handle can be as simple as a squarish ""chimney"" style pillar of blocks stuck on the bottom of the gun, or it can incorporate rounded pieces to form a custom grip for your hand. It's up to you - just make sure it's sturdy enough to support the weight of your gun and the tension in the rubber band, or you'll shoot yourself in the foot!

, Now that you've created a stripped-down but functional Lego gun, you have the opportunity to customize it. You can try adding parts to the gun to simulate the look of a real gun, like the fearsome Desert Eagle pistol.You might also want to try for a less-realistic look, like a futuristic rail gun or a rocket launcher. It's up to you - go wild and shoot in style.

, Catch your rubber band in the notch at the front of the gun, then stretch it back and catch it on the firing mechanism.


If your gun's construction is sturdy enough, experiment with loading multiple rubber bands at once. You may be able to get a ""shotgun"" effect with multiple bands.

, Look down your gun's beam, lining up the notch at the end of your gun with your target.


Never aim at someone, including the face, arms, chest, etc.

Get a suitable camera.,
Test drive the camera first.,
Practice working with a tripod.,
Keep the story simple.,
Write the sketch out.,
Start with a Lego base plate.,
Ensure that the base plate cannot move.,
Find the mini-figures and Lego pieces you need.,
Make the set.,
Place the camera on the tripod.,
Take the first photo.

,
Move the Lego person slowly.,
Continue taking shots until the whole scene is done.

,
Use your film editing program on your computer or digital device.,
Add dialog boxes if relevant.,
Watch it all the way through.",How to Make a LEGO Stop Motion," The camera must be able to take good quality images.

, It's important to be comfortable with how it works, and which of its features are likely to produce the effects you're after. If you haven't read the manual yet, now is the perfect time to do so.

, This is essential, as it makes for perfectly still shots.

, The longer the story, the longer you will be taking images, so keep it very short to begin with.


For example, a short sketch could be about a mini-figure attacking or robbing another mini-figure and another one coming to the rescue. Or, it could be about one mini-figure pranking another. Or, have a bunch of mini-figures sitting around a table having coffee and talking about life.;
, Include dialog if relevant. All of this will make it much easier for you, as you'll know what props you need, how involved the whole scene will be and what dialog you want to add later (if any).

, The base plate is a large square with pegs that allow figures and blocks to be attached to it. Choose the color according to the story theme, for example, green for grass, grey for a factory or office floor, yellow for a party, etc.

, Place pieces of rolled up tape or two-sided tape underneath the base plate. Then press the base plate down firmly on the surface where you intend to do the filming from.


It's a really good idea to place the set where it won't be disturbed for several days. That way, you can take breaks and come back to the filming later, when you feel refreshed.

, Include animals, flowers, trees, etc. If you need to have buildings, vehicles, trees, etc., sketch a design, as this will help you to know where everything should go.

, Build the design onto the base plate set, as per your sketch or ideas. Check that all the supporting pieces are firmly in place and can't be knocked over easily.

, Position the figures where they're meant to be.

,, The more frames you take, the better the final movie will be, so only move a fraction each time. Sure, it's painful but good art requires effort.


It is also possible to move the set slightly. Experiment a little.

,, Transfer the photos and piece the movie together.

, Or, simply print comments, etc. along the base of the movie.

, If you're happy with the end result, upload it to YouTube.

Go full auto!,
Take your targets out from afar!,
Use your ninja skills.",How to Make a LEGO Rubber Band Gun2," Imagine the havoc you'll be able to cause with a Lego rubber band machine gun! If you have access to an electric motor, the mechanism can be surprisingly simple - all you need is a gear centered at the back of the gun's beam which can turn via the motor.More elaborate Lego machine guns can even incorporate ""minigun"" style rotating barrels.Stock up on rubber bands before going on a rampage with one of these.

, A high-powered Lego sniper rifle allows you to cleanly and precisely annoy your targets before they even see you. All sniper rifles will have an extra-long, sturdy beam to accommodate the long, strong rubber bands that will leave welts on your opponents. Advanced Lego sniper rifles can even incorporate a bolt-action firing mechanism and a mounted scope for extra accuracy., Building a tiny, concealed Lego gun is the perfect way to take out an unsuspecting friend or hit someone who thinks you're unarmed in a game of Lego tag. All you'll need to do is make a really small, basic lego gun - just a beam and a firing mechanism. Then, load it and strap it under a long sleeve or hide it in a rolled-up newspaper and BLAM! Your mark won't even know what hit them. Be creative - use your skills to make a Lego gun trap or hide your ninja gun in a crazy place!

Fashion your floor.,
Give gravity a helping hand.,
Make a slide to release your candy.,
Build your rubber band mount.,
Reinforce your rubber band mount.,
Complete your automatic return.,
Test your return.,
Attach your handle and return to your reservoir.,
Retest your mechanism.,
Add a base to your machine.,
Complete finishing touches.",How to Make a Lego Candy Machine," Before you get started, you need to make sure you have all the necessary parts to make your machine. If not, you might need to go out and buy some more! For this machine, you'll need:

2x1 connector piece (with holes, x2)
4x1 connector piece (with holes, x2)
Assorted Legos (preferably single or double wide, including flat pieces)
Connector pins (x2)
Long connector pin (x1)
Medium rubber band;
, This is the part of your machine that will hold your candy. Your reservoir should be rectangular in shape. The size of this part depends on how many Legos you have at your disposal, but it's recommended that you build at least four layers for each side.If you have a limited amount of Legos, you can leave some spaces in the walls of your reservoir as long as these spaces are not bigger than the candy you intend on putting in your machine. Gaps that are too large will allow candy to escape!

, Assemble a platform that is roughly ½ to ¾ the length of your candy reservoir. You will need to leave a free space in your floor to allow your candy to drop down.

The gap of in your floor should be towards the front of your machine.

, To improve the flow of candy through your machine, top your floor with wedge shaped Legos. Now gravity can more easily pull your candy down toward the gap in your floor.

The angled pieces should be oriented to slope downwards toward the gap.

, This part will keep your candy in your reservoir until you are ready to set your candy free. Use long, narrow pieces to construct the handle of your slide, which will be a 1x1 block smaller than your reservoir so that your slide can fit inside your machine.

Cover the top of your slide with smooth, flat Lego pieces so that it will move easily when the handle is pulled.

, Your rubber band will provide the force to return your release to its original position. To build the mount, attach two 1x2 pieces to the underside of both ends of your flat 2x6 piece. Put the connector pins in your 1x2 connector pieces if these aren't in already, place your rubber band so the connectors are encircled by it, and attach the connector pieces to the inside of each of your normal 1x2 pieces under your 2x6 piece.The smaller 1x2 pieces will serve as supports for connector pieces that will hold the tension of your rubber band.
If your rubber band is too small, you may need to loop it once or twice so that it has the appropriate length and tension to return your slide.

, For better stability and thickness, you should use assorted flat pieces on the bottom of your 1x2 pieces and then reinforce these with another 2x6 piece., You will need to use your 4x1 connector pieces to attach the rubber band to your release so that it can apply return force to the release. Insert the pin (if necessary) in your 4x1 connectors, with the rubber band around the pin, then reinforce your 4x1 connectors with a 3x2 flat piece to give stability., The mount for your return will need to be structurally sound, otherwise when you pull your handle the rubber band might come free and your machine break. Pull on your rubber band with moderate force and make sure that the pins hold it securely.

Be sure the tension of the rubber band is not too great, or it might break the mount.
If you feel that your automatic return isn't stable, use flat pieces at the boundary points of other Legos to reinforce the mount.

, Turn your reservoir upside down and put your release inside so that the flat surface of its top is also upside down. The thick part of your release opposite the handle shaped part should match up with the gap in your floor, with the 4x1 connector attaching to your floor to provide return tension to your release.

The handle part of your release should remain partially outside of your machine.

, Attaching your handle and automatic return may have revealed to you some parts of your machine that need to be braced or supported with additional Legos. Add Legos where necessary, and then retest the handle and return.

If you notice your rubber band is too loose when testing your release and return, you may need to take a pin out of your connector and loop the band an addition time to provide tension.
If you notice the rubber band applies to much force to your handle and return, you may want to swap in a thinner rubber band.

, Add three or more layers of Legos that are the same dimensions as your reservoir to your machine to create a base. You can add a flat piece to the bottom to give it a finished look and add stability.You may have to add an additional layer to your machine to keep the handle, return, and floor evenly aligned so that they pull smoothly and release your candy without a hitch., You may want to add pieces for stability, add parts to give your machine more character, or even add a roof. If you want to include a roof for your machine, you should attach a simple flat piece to the top of your machine.

If you add a roof, you will need to remove this to add candy to your reservoir.

10 brown 2x2 bricks
3 brown 2x4 bricks
1 brown 2x3 brick
8 brown 1x2 bricks
5 black 1x2 brick
6 brown 1x1 bricks
1 black 2x4 brick
1 brown 1x4 brick
2 white 1x1 bricks;
, Line four brown 2x2 LEGO bricks in a row from left to right.Then place another four brown 2x2 LEGO bricks next to that (also going from left to right.) The rows should be positioned directly next to one another. When you are finished, you should have eight brown 2x2 LEGO bricks lying side by side in two rows of four each., To do this, gather two brown 2x4 bricks. Place one brown 2x4 brick on top of the right side of the base, positioned over the middle two studs and covering the last three studs (the brick should extend past the base by a distance of one stud.) Place another brown 2x4 brick right behind it, still covering the middle studs.


When you finish, all of the middle studs of the base should be covered, except for the last row of studs on your left.

, Attach one brown 2x3 brick to the two remaining open middle studs on the left. There should now be an overhang of one stud on the right side of the base and an overhang of two studs on the left side of the base.


From now on, the right side of the base will be referred to as the tail-end of your dog, while the left side of the base will be referred to as the front-end of your dog.

, On the underside of your base, attach two brown 2x2 bricks to the bottom of the base. These should be positioned so they’re attached directly in the center of your base, elevating it., Flip your base right side up. Attach two brown 1x2 bricks, laid horizontally, to the last two studs on the tail end of your dog. Connect those bricks by laying one black 1x2 brick vertically over the last two studs on the right.

, Take a brown 1x2 brick, a black 1x2 brick and a brown 1x1 brick. Position the brown 1x1 brick to the right of the black 1x2 brick, creating a straight line. Position the brown 1x2 brick across both bricks to connect them.Repeat this step four times, so you have constructed four identical legs.

, Position all four legs so they are attached to the bottom of the base in all four corners. Each of the black “feet” should be facing the front end of your dog., Get a brown 2x4 brick and a black 2x2 brick. Place the black brick on top of the brown brick and attach it to the first row of studs on the left hand side.This black brick will serve as your dog’s nose.

, Add one brown 1x2 brick, laid vertically, directly behind the dog’s nose. Then add a brown 1x4 brick, laid vertically, behind that. Attach two white 1x1 bricks to the top of the brown 1x2 brick.


These white bricks will serve as your dog’s eyes.
If you’re looking for more realistic eyes for your dog, you can buy these separately. Dog eyes can be found in the LEGO classic small box, available online and in stores., In back of the eyes, add one brown 1x2 brick. Position two brown 1x1 bricks on either side of your brown 1x2 brick. These will serve as your dog’s ears.

, Take the head so the dog’s nose is facing towards the front of the room and attach it to the front-end of your dog. The head should be positioned squarely on top of the 2x4 brick on the left side of your dog., Now that the work is completed, it’s time to have fun with your dog. Give them a name and build them a park to play in. If you have extra pieces, build another dog, so they have a companion to play with.

, A LEGO dog is just the beginning. Challenge yourself by building other LEGO creatures. Try building a cat or an elephant or any other animal you can think of.

, Once you feel confident with your LEGO dog making skills, try building a LEGO house. For instructions on how to build a LEGO house, try going here.

",How to Build a LEGO House1," Get a LEGO table or one of those green LEGO platforms. This will be the floor of your house, as well as the yard, if you save room for one.If you build your house in two parts, on two different platforms, you can open it up to see what's inside by pulling the platforms apart.;
, Lay a bottom row of bricks as your ""foundation,"" setting up locations for walls, doors, and the different rooms.Make a living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom if your house is big enough.









Think about what is in a real house and let this be your guide. For example, where should the fireplace go? If you are going to build one, you'll want to lay some bricks for the chimney during this planning stage.
If you're planning to add a second floor, make sure to save plenty of room for stairs. It's probably a good idea to build them while you're still laying the foundation so you know how much room they'll take up.

, Next, build up the exterior walls of your house, row by row.









Hint: your walls will be sturdier if you don't just stack the same kind of brick, one on top of the next. Instead, offset your rows so the ""seams"" between the bricks don't all line up from one row to the next.
Don't forget to leave spaces for the windows! You can leave these as empty spaces in your walls, or, if you have special window parts, install them.It will be harder to go back and add these later if you forget to put them in while you're building the walls.

, Finish setting up the rooms in the house with walls inside.








, For the living room, you can make chairs and a TV. For the kitchen, you can make a counter, sink, oven, etc. For the bedroom, make a bed and a desk, and for the bathroom, make a toilet, shower, and sink.









If you have them, you can make your furniture more realistic with specialty parts. LEGO makes pieces that look like keyboards, stoves, faucets, and more. These kinds of details can add a lot of realism to your house.

, Once you've finished the basics, you can start adding decorative touches to make your house more unique.









You can add tile floors or a patio using small flat pieces,add light fixtures or a ceiling fan, and landscape the yard with trees and flowers. Use your imagination and the parts you have available to make your house as interesting as you can.

, Adding a roof should be the last step in building your house because once you put it on, it's harder to to move things around inside your house.









You can get around this problem by making a removable roof. Attach it with hinged parts so you can pull it back, or just set it on top rather than locking it in place for easier access.

Grab all the things you'll need.,
Attach the 1x2 plate to the bottom 1x2 brick with a hinge.

,
Add the two 1x1 cylinders to the top of the hinge piece.

,
Attach that to the back stud piece.",How to Build a LEGO Jetpack1," These are:


Two 1 x 1 cylinder bricks
1 mini-figure
One 2 x 1 plate
1 mini figure back stud piece
One 1x 2 brick with hinge;
,,, The jet pack is finished and you can now put the mini-figure onto it.

"
"
Get a pattern.,
Check your parts.,
Follow the pattern.,
Customize if desired.",How to Build a LEGO House2," The LEGO sets you can buy in the store come with instructions for building the creation shown on the box, and LEGO Creator sets have 3 alternative house models you can build.









Alternatively, if you have a lot of parts already and are looking for house patterns or just general ideas for your house, there are several websites that provide patterns for free. The official LEGO website includes some free patterns, like these instructions for a basic house as well as videos that show you how to build many different creations.
Many other websites also provide patterns for houses at varying challenge levels, like this one at brickinstructions.com.

Letsbuilditagain.com features a mix of old LEGO manuals that originally came with different sets and creations made by visitors to the website. They have many house patterns, too.

, The pattern will tell you which parts you need to make the house in the picture. Go through your LEGOs and make sure you have all the parts you need. Otherwise, you might get halfway through and find that you can't finish your house.









Even if you are building from a set, it's a good idea to make sure all the parts are there before you start building. Occasionally parts are missing, which can be very frustrating to discover part way through the building process. If you check your parts at the beginning and something is missing, you can take the set back to the store and get a new one it before you start.

, Go step by step through the instructions, laying your bricks in place exactly as shown in the instructions.









Sometimes it's helpful to count the studs (the bumps on top of each LEGO brick) between bricks in the pictures to make sure you get the spacing right.

, Once you've finished the house, you can customize it with your own LEGO parts. Maybe it needs some trees or flowers, or even a garage.









For example, you can turn your house into a winter scene by adding thin white pieces to the yard for snow, and making icicles out of clear pieces.

Finish up.,
Enjoy!",How to Decorate Headphones with String," It doesn't matter how long you make the strings - just make sure they are all the same length in each round. 


The longer you cut the strings each round, the longer they will last you and you will not have to cut new strings as often if you have more each time.;
, Clip the part that plugs into the device first.

, Tie your strings all together in a knot just below the plug. Coat the knot well with nail polish and let it dry well.

, Do this until you have only about 5 inches of string left. If you don't know how to make forward knots, look up a tutorial in the above search bar.

, Again, cut some string (preferably long strands). Tie this string onto the headphones like you did at the beginning, only tie it on top of your leftover strings as well. Coat the knot in nail polish and let it dry. Then, cut off the leftover string from last round.

, Make a knot and coat the knot with nail polish. Let it dry.

, Do the same, only here, for both of these, I normally use only one colour.

, Make forward knots, change the strings and coat the knots until the string reaches the earbuds.

, Make sure all of the knots are coated and secure, and that they are all dry.

, You can now use your headphones. It may have seemed a bit hard and time-taking...but remember, every time you do this it gets easier and easier!

Gather your LEGO materials.,
Find a safe, clear space to build the car.,
Spread your LEGO pieces neatly in front of you.",How to Build a LEGO Car1," If you are following a set of instructions for an official LEGO car set, make sure you have the instructions and all the pieces needed for your car. If you are designing your own car, make sure you have a variety of LEGO pieces handy so that you can create whatever you want.


For a very basic LEGO car, you will need a minimum of 4 tires of the same size, 2 axles of the same size, and at least one long LEGO piece to connect them. LEGO also manufactures pieces like steering wheels, seats, windshields, and car doors that you may enjoy adding to enhance your car’s details.;
, A table or desk near a bright lighting source is a good place to build a LEGO car. You want to find a space that’s big enough for you to spread out your pieces (and instructions, if you’re using them).


LEGO pieces are small and can pose a choking hazard to pets and small children if they’re left lying around. If they’re left on the floor they might also be stepped on, which can be painful. Building on the floor will work, but keep an eye on your pieces to make sure they stay in a contained area.

, Organize the pieces by size and shape, so it is easier to pick the pieces you need.


If working with small children, make sure the children do not put the LEGO pieces in their mouths, as they are a choking hazard.

"
Gather your pieces.,
Snap tires to axle pieces.,
Build the front hood.,
Build the windshield section.,
Build the cab.,
Build the back end and “spoiler.” You will need 2 2x4 bricks, 1 1x4 brick, and 1 2x4 plate (thinner than the bricks).,
Press your axle pieces onto the underside of the plate.,
Select a LEGO figurine.,
Enjoy your car!",How to Build a LEGO Car2," This simple car can be built using LEGO pieces that almost everyone has. You will need several different types of pieces for this car, and you can vary the pieces used based on what you have. Measurements for LEGO pieces are given in ""stud"" count (the ""dots"" on many LEGO pieces). A brick that is 2 studs wide by 4 studs long is a 2x4.


For the chassis you will need 4 tires of the same size, 2 rectangular axles of the same size, and a thin 4x12 plate (the long, thin LEGO pieces).
For the body, you will need 2 2x2 bricks, 6 2x4 bricks, 4 1x2 bricks, 1 1x4 brick, 2 2x2 clear angular bricks, 1 LEGO windshield, and 1 LEGO steering wheel piece.

, The axle pieces are small square or rectangular pieces that have prongs on either side. Snap one tire to each prong. When finished, you should have two sets of wheels connected by the axles.


Make sure the axle pieces and tires fit together snugly. The tires should be secure, but still able to spin freely.
Make sure your tires and base piece are proportionate. Tiny tires will not adequately support a larger LEGO car, and will impede speed and movement.

, You’ll need 2 2x2 square bricks and two 2x2 clear angular bricks. Alternately, you could use one 2x4 brick and two 2x2 clear angular bricks.


Snap the clear bricks to the top of the square bricks.
Attach the pieces you just completed to the front end of your car.
Make sure the end of the plate is flush with the edge of the pieces you attached.

, This piece will sit directly behind the hood you just built. You will need 2 2x4 bricks and a 2x4 LEGO windshield piece.


Stack two 2x4 bricks together. Snap on the windshield piece. Attach this section to the plate just behind the piece you attached in Step 6.

, You will need 1 2x4 rectangular brick, 2 1x2 rectangular bricks, and a 1x2 LEGO steering wheel piece.


Snap the 1x2 bricks to either end of the 2x4 brick. It should look a little like a short “u” when you’re finished.
Position the steering wheel in the space between the 1x2 bricks. The piece should be on the back row of studs with the wheel facing you. Press into place.
Attach this section to the base just behind the windshield section.
Build the body of the car. You will need 1 2x4 brick and 2 1x2 bricks. Snap these together to form a “u” just like you did in Step 8. Attach this section to the plate just behind the cab.

,


Stack the two 2x4 bricks. Snap the 1x4 brick to the back of this stack.
Press the plate onto the 1x4 brick so that it hangs off the back of the structure a little. It should look like the little “wing” on the back of a sports car.
Attach this section to the base just behind the body section.

, One should go under the front of the base and one under the rear.


The front edge of the front wheels should line up approximately with the front end of the base piece. The back edge of the rear tires should line up approximately with the rear end of the base piece.
If the tires are obstructed, change the width of the base piece, or find two longer, matching axle pieces.

, Bend the figurine at its waist so it’s sitting and place it in the space behind the steering wheel.

, If it moves too slowly, the car may be too big for the base piece and the tires. You can experiment with different designs to get the look and power you want.

Place the back axle.,
Attach the knotted rubber bands to the back axle.,
Pull the rubber band up and over the top of your car body.,
Place the front axle.,
Make the car go.",How to Build a LEGO Car3," You will need some specialized bricks for this build, such as bricks with holes in them, thin rod-type axles, and separate wheel rims and tires. These come in LEGO Technic sets, or you can buy them separately from a LEGO Store or online.You will need 2 1x10 bricks with holes in the sides, 1 2x4 plate (thinner than a 2x4 brick), 1 8x4 plate, 1 1x4 brick, 1 2x4 brick, 1 2x2 brick, 1 2x8 brick, 2 Technic axles, 4 LEGO wheel rims, and 4 LEGO tires.You will also need 2 rubber bands.

, For optimal energy transfer, you should have two larger wheels for the back and two smaller wheels for the front. Set these aside for now.

, Place the 1x10 bricks side by side, like railroad tracks. Snap the 2x4 plate and 8x4 plate to the tops of the bricks. Now you should have a chassis that is 4x10.

, This will be the structure that the rubber band attaches to in order to create the power to move the car.


Snap the 1x4 brick to the very front of the chassis.
Forming a “T” shape, snap the 2x4 brick to the middle of the plate just behind the brick you just placed.
Snap the 2x2 brick to the very back of the chassis. Place it in the middle of the plate so there is 1 stud on either side.
Attach the 2x8 brick so that it covers the last 2 studs of the “T” shape. The back of this brick should hang out over the back end of the chassis.

, This is an easy knot you can tie with two closed loops (like rubber bands are).Wrap one rubber band around the finger and thumb of your non-dominant hand.
Slip the other band through the center of band #1 and pull about halfway through.
Slide one end of band #2 through the loop formed by its other end and pull to secure.

, Slide one axle through the last hole of the 10x1 bricks at the very back of your car. Attach a wheel to either end of the axle.

, To do this, slide one end of one band up and under the axle until you can see a little loop. Thread the other end of the bands and pull to secure.

, The band should run under the whole length of the chassis. Slip the end of the rubber band under the protruding part of the very top brick.

, Slide the other axle through the first hole of the 10x1 bricks at the very front of your car. Make sure the rubber band is under the axle. Attach a wheel to either end of the axle.

, To wind up the car, place the car on a flat, smooth surface and pull the it backwards. This will build up tension in the rubber band. When you let go, it should go speeding away!

Build a basic LEGO car.,
Place the 2x8 bricks together end-to-end in two rows.,
Turn the connected bricks over.,
Stack 5 2x4 bricks together.,
Thread the balloon through the hole.,
Inflate the balloon.,
Place your car on a flat, smooth surface.",How to Build a LEGO Car4," The design in this part creates a “dragster”-style car that is very light and has a low, stable center of gravity. You can design your own car, but try to keep it lightweight and low to the ground.


For this design, you will need 2 rectangular axles, 4 tires of equal size, 4 2x8 bricks, 8 2x4 bricks, 2 1x2 bricks, and a thin plate at least 2x4 (but a longer plate is better). You will also need one small party balloon., Each row should be 2x16 now. Snap a 2x4 brick to the top of each row to connect the 2x8 bricks.

, Snap the thin plate to the bottom of both rows so that they are connected.


Attach the tires to the axles. Place an axle at each end of the car.
Turn the body over. You should now have a car body that is 4x16 with the two 2x4 bricks on top and wheels on the bottom.

, Snap this column to the back of your car body. Make sure the bricks are connected snugly, but don’t press too hard or you might break the car body.


Snap the 1x2 bricks to the top of the 2x4 column. Place one at each end to create a little hollow in the middle.
Attach the final 2x4 brick to the top of the column. You should have a small hole in the middle of the column near the top.

, In order to propel your car, you will want the body of the balloon to be placed over the body of your car. Slip the neck of the balloon through the hole, but don’t pull the balloon all the way through.

, You may find it easier to blow up the balloon if you pick up the car and hold it close to your face while you inflate it. When the balloon is inflated, pinch the neck with your fingers to keep the air in.

, Release the neck of the balloon. Your car should speed away from you as the air pushes out of the balloon!

For some jobs, LEGO will actually ask applicants to participate in a build-off, to see who can come up with the best designs.At its heart, LEGO is about fun and the company knows that. In interviews LEGO asks applicants what they do for fun, because they know that fun is at the heart of what they do.;
, With time you should try moving on to LEGO models that require complex mechanical and computerized parts. Try to understand what makes them work.You can buy cheap second-hand sets off the Internet, often in bulk.
Mindstorms RCX LEGOs in particular are capable of being programmed to do amazing things. People have managed to make flying devices with this model.

, LEGO’s digital designer is a free application that can be downloaded online. You can design your own parts to create models that might be difficult to build otherwise. This would be good practice for ultimately designing your own LEGOs.LEGO used to allow you to have these sets manufactured for you, so that you could have a hard copy of these designs. They have ceased doing this for the time being., LEGO’s are an educational tool to help you think about how things are built. Once you’ve gotten these skills down, you should try to move on to building new things.Consider building theses like mousetrap race cars, water bottle rockets, forts, catapults, and water balloon rockets., Through elementary, middle and high school you should build a record of academic success. If you get ahead and build your credentials early, it will be easier to get into a good college. Study hard and do your best at every level of your education.

, You should take every opportunity available to study math and science in high school. Take four years of course work in each and take advanced classes when possible. If there is a science or robotics club, join it.


During high school you can also consider taking some classes in science, math, engineering, or software design courses at a local college. Typically, you can take these over summer, so that it won't impair your ability to complete your regular coursework.

, You will need a bachelor's and possibly a masters degree in a relevant technical field to be a viable candidate for a job with LEGO. To make yourself particularly attractive, consider completing two majors or doing a bachelor's degree in one field and a master's degree in another.Consider mechanical engineering. Get a degree that focuses on robotics and automation. Many LEGO designs require the construction of complicated mechanical systems.Also consider a degree in computer engineering. LEGO now uses computer programming to give life to its designs and being able to contribute to these projects is important for securing a job at LEGO.

, LEGO isn’t just about creating things that move, it is about creating designs that are interesting and exciting. As a company, LEGO is interested in people with a background in art and design. These skill sets can be important for creating toys that look realistic and engaging.


Lego has hired artists to build gigantic installations at locations around the world., LEGO is an international company, based out of Denmark, with locations around the globe. It does have jobs available in English speaking countries, including the United States. The majority of the jobs in America, however, are in business and management, not design.The top locations currently hiring LEGO engineers are: Denmark, China, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. There are no jobs currently available for engineers in English language countries.Because LEGO is a Danish company, Danish would be the best language to learn.
Language acquisition can be a slow and arduous process. It also becomes harder as you grow older. You should begin studying no later than college. If you can find the time to purchase a language learning program and study prior to college, that could also be advantageous.

, If you can successfully build complex robotics with LEGOs, submit your designs to robotics competitions. LEGO might notice your accomplishments and begin to build a relationship with you.Consider using online media to publicize your accomplishments. Build a website advertising your designs, tweet it to LEGO or post it on LEGO's Facebook wall.

, LEGO lists all job openings on their website. Check in on them regularly and, if there is anything that you believe you are qualified for, send in your application. Sometimes it helps to start small and work your way up to more desirable jobs. If you get your foot in the door with a job at LEGO, you might eventually be able to move on to working as a designer., LEGO is interested in applicants who love LEGO. To prove that you love LEGO in in your interview, you should know something about the company. How old is it? Where is it based? How have LEGO toys evolved over time?, These two documents are how you will advertise your skills to LEGO. Prioritize accomplishments that will speak to your qualifications.

,, Use either a very large unclutter table or Cool Whip containers to temporarily store the unused pieces. Technic pieces are styled into several types of pieces which include


Bricks are just like any other Lego-piece. Bricks don't play too big of a role in Lego Technic models however.






Pins help join and make the piece rotate to make the model move and connect one piece to another.






Beams are mainly decorative pieces, however, they do play a key role in making the model ""come alive"".






Bushes and joints also help secure axles to their associated pieces.






Power and transmission systems vary by model, however, just like on an automobile, they provide the necessary ""get up and go"" ""juice"" to perform the models' movement (if they need to be powered)






Chains and pulley's are also a necessary item and connect the motor to the transmission.






Levers and links vary by puzzle type. So have them, and some don't. Some are colored differently. They all work the same, but their length may differ.







, Each Technic model has two ways to create two different and distinct models, be sure to take the correct book or books for that specific style. Also, be sure to retrieve all the books that go with the model from the product box.

, This can include any sticker sheets or what-not. In the mere chance you would want to reassemble the model the opposite way, you'll need the other pieces.

, Although the ""What you'll need list"" at the front of the book helps, sometimes this info can get redundant when you've put together many models, since you'll know exactly what each piece will be able to conform to.

, You'll see a listing of parts by their part number (if necessary), quantity, color and shape. Bring out only these pieces you'll need from the bin or pile.

, Attaching the right pieces in the right order in the correct orientation is the key to correctly assembling a Lego Technic model.


For some often-times confused pieces, there are numbers in a circle on the back side of the piece that correspond to the number in the book.







, Be sure to match the stickers to the correct piece (by the piece number, if necessary)

, But you will have used up quite a grand majority of the pieces.Keep the remaining pieces to the model nearby (until you've decided to reassemble the puzzle the opposite way.


Try to keep all the booklets together with these pieces.

Separate your LEGOs by piece type.,
Separate the LEGOs by size.,
Separate your LEGOs by color and size or and color and type.,
Sort your LEGOs by set.,
Sort your LEGOs by favorites.",How to Sort and Store LEGO Toys1," You can choose whatever categories you’d like, but some common options include bricks, plates, roof pieces, wheels, and windows. It’s also a good idea to have a miscellaneous category for any odds and ends that don’t fit into a specific grouping.While you’re sorting your LEGOs, you may want to have interim containers to separate them into, so you stay organized. Plastic grocery bags are an ideal option.;
, You can sort your bricks and other pieces by hand, eyeballing them to ensure that you get all of the same size together. Sometimes, it can be difficult to judge, though, so you may want to use a LEGO ruler and sorting worksheet to help.If sorting by size seems too difficult to do by hand, you can purchase a tool such as the BOX4BLOX, which sorts the LEGO through a series of trays that have different sized grids in the bottom. You won’t need to spread your LEGOs all over the floor or table because the pieces can be easily found in the individual trays, especially the hard to find pieces which end up in the bottom tray.

, Sorting by color alone can make it difficult to find specific bricks or accessories that you want, but dividing your collection even further can help organize it effectively. You might sort by color and type, so all your red bricks are in one spot and all your red beams are in another. You can also sort by color and size, so all of your blue 2x4 plates are in one container and your red 2x4 plates are in another.


Start by sorting the LEGOs according to type or size, and then further sort the pieces by color.
Sorting your LEGOs by color is best for collectors who like to build sculptures and mosaics., It’s easier to have pieces stored together when you want to build the original sets over and over again. If you’ve kept the LEGOs in their original packaging, you’ll easily be able to sort the pieces. If you haven’t kept the boxes from your sets, it helps to locate the instruction booklets from your sets because they include a listing of all the pieces from the sets, so you can identify the LEGOs that should be gathered together. Spread your LEGOs out on a large, flat surface to make it easier to locate individual set pieces.When you don’t have the original packaging on hand, you may want to sort the LEGOs into small containers before placing them in the larger storage system. That’s because storing them each in their own bin, basket, or other storage option may take up too much room if you have many specialized sets. Ziploc bags or other small plastic storage bags are inexpensive and work well.
It’s a good idea to place the instruction booklet from each set in the bag with the pieces. Not only will it prevent you from losing the booklet, it can help you identify which set is which when you have several bags in a single bin, basket, or container.Creative builders may be frustrated if they store their collection by set because it’s more difficult to locate specific pieces when you’re building your own creation.

, You may instinctively know which LEGOs are your favorites, but it can help to keep track of the pieces you’re using for a week or so to give yourself a concrete idea. It helps to create specific categories, so you know how to sort the pieces. For example, you might decide on “Most Frequently Used,” “Used Regularly,” and “Used Rarely” categories.


Sorting by favorites or frequency of use is a good method if you’re organizing a child’s LEGO collection because it can help you identify pieces that you may be able to get rid of when your child needs room for other toys, books, or belongings.
Place the LEGOs into containers based on accessibility. You’ll want to put your favorite or most used pieces and sets in the bins or containers that are easiest to access. That might mean placing them on the top shelf of your storage unit -- or the lowest, if you’re sorting for children.

"
"
Purchase enough plastic bins to hold your LEGO collection.,
Place your LEGOs in the containers.,
Find a place for your bins.",How to Sort and Store LEGO Toys2," Many brands, including Rubbermaid and Sterlite, make plastic storage containers that work well for LEGO bricks and other pieces. Depending on your needs, you can find both open and lidded varieties. To maximize your storage space, though, stackable bins are a good option.Clear bins or boxes work especially well because you can easily see what’s inside. However, if you’re color sorting your LEGOs, you may want to color code your bins. For example, choose red bins for your red pieces and blue bins for your blue pieces.

, When you’re sorting your pieces in your bins, you don’t want to overload them or it will be difficult to find pieces when you’re working on a project. Having the LEGOs in a single layer in each bin is ideal because it makes it easier to see all of the pieces.It helps to buy bins in a variety of sizes, so you can customize your storage based on the size of the pieces. Small pieces, such as Technic pins, clips and hinges, can get lost in large bins, so smaller boxes are a better choice.
If you are storing small LEGO pieces in a larger bin, you may want to place them inside a Ziploc or other plastic bag to make them easier to locate when you’re building.

, One of the benefits of using this type of storage for your LEGOs is that they’re versatile. You can stack the bins on a bookcase or shelving unit, stash them in a closet, or even tuck them under a bed to keep them out of sight. In a child’s bedroom or playroom, you may want to simply stack them on the floor, so it’s easy for your child to access them."
"
Purchase a storage cabinet or drawer system.,
Add drawer organizers.,
Label your drawers.",How to Sort and Store LEGO Toys3," Depending on the size of your collection, you can opt for simple plastic drawer sets that only have a few drawers to more elaborate cabinets with many drawers that are usually used to hold crafting or hardware supplies.As with the plastic bins, storage cabinets that feature clear drawers are the best option because you can easily see what LEGO pieces are inside.
Look for drawer systems that provide different size drawers, so you can easily organize your collection based on the size of the pieces.

, In order to maximize your space, it may make sense to store multiple types of LEGO bricks and pieces in a single drawer. To prevent them from becoming mixed up, it helps to have a drawer organizer with different compartments, so you can separate the pieces based on your chosen sorting system.Drawer organizers are available at office and home supply stores. They come in a variety of sizes, and some are even customizable, so you can create the ideal storage for your LEGOs.

, Even if your storage cabinet has drawers made of clear plastic, it’s a good idea to label them with the contents, so you don’t have to go searching for a certain piece in the middle of a build. For the most organized collection, be as specific as possible when creating the labels.A label maker is obviously ideal for creating labels for your drawers, but you also easily create custom labels on your computer as well.

"
"
Use a tool, tackle, or craft box.,
Use kitchen canisters.,
Use a shoe organizer.",How to Sort and Store LEGO Toys4," These types of containers are usually divided into several compartments, which makes it extremely easy to sort your LEGOs and keep them separated. You can store the boxes on shelves or tables, but they’re also portable, which makes them ideal for taking LEGOs on the go.A tool, tackle, or craft box works best for a small collection. If you have many pieces to hold, you may need multiple boxes.
Avoid boxes with removable dividers because they are usually flimsy, and your LEGOs may end getting mixed together when you move the box around.

, The containers used to hold dry pasta, loose cereal, and other food items can work well for holding LEGOs, and because they’re usually clear, you’ll be able to see exactly what’s inside each canister. You can also easily fit them on shelves, bookcase, and other furniture.If you have old Tupperware or other food storage containers that you’d like to recycle, they can work well for small collections of LEGOs too.

, When you’re short on space, a hanging shoe organizer is an ideal option for LEGOs because you can make use of wall or door space. The organizer’s pockets make it easy to keep your sorted bricks and pieces separated, and the clear plastic allows you to see what’s inside."

Make some windows.,
Make wheels under the LEGO airplane.",How to Build a LEGO Airplane," Choose better choices so it won't take so long and be so hard to build the LEGO airplane. Better choices for the size of the LEGOs mostly counts:


Small LEGOs might make building a LEGO airplane harder, and it will take longer too. Make sure if you want to work hard, you pick the small LEGOs.
Big LEGOs make it easier to make the LEGO airplane, and won't take as much time to finish it. These kinds of LEGOs are good for beginners, but might make the airplane look too big.;
, Keep stacking these LEGOs on top of each other with skinny LEGOs. Use LEGOs on the back of the other, if the first LEGO is not five inches. Build until you think it looks the right way you want it.


For big LEGOs, you might not have to stack them on top of each other because they are already big, and they might reach five inches in one big block.

, Big LEGOs might not work for this.

, Add blue pieces of LEGO on the side, the back, and the front.

, Use LEGO wheels and axles to do this. Stick four axles under and stick the wheels through. Wheels will be for landing and taking off.

Cut out extra cotton lining as needed.

, Sew the tail and two wings together using straight stitch. Leave an opening at the base of the sewn items to allow them to be turned right side out.


Trim the seam allowance using pinking shears.

, Sew some decorative stitches on them (such as a cross, a flower, etc.). (See image one of this trio.), The body of bird is made of one top piece, two side pieces and a belly piece (see the section above for image of cut pieces).

Try not to name the toy anything that is too hard to pronounce or too long.,
Look at your toy carefully.",How to Name a Stuffed Animal or Toy1," You might find yourself forgetting it! Instead, try to have your stuffed animals name be from three to seven letters.


If you do choose a long name, think about the nickname you can create from the longer name. Is it a nickname you like?

, First, before anything, always decide whether you want a real person's name, or a name such as ""Fluffy""? Knowing this can help you think of names related to either people, pets or well-known characteristics of toys. Or maybe you want to name your toy something exotic, or not too popular? Consider each of the methods below to help you name your new toy. None of them are any better than the other, it's all totally up to you and what you think matches your toy best.

Have fun!",How to Prepare a House for a Stuffed Animal's Arrival," This will be your house. You can downsize it if you want if your stuffed animal is small, but if it is larger, you'll need a larger box!;
, Mahogany and white for bricks, whatever color for siding, dark brown for wood, whatever materials for a house and the comprehending color(s).

, You can do a glass door in blue and white, brown, black, gray, etc. Wood doors are the same, but don't use blue. Folding doors? Whatever color you want! Make sure the other side is the same color as the front!

, When you are doing this, think ""What will my stuffed animal be?"" as this helps you think of what colors and themes to use. Is your pet a girl or a boy? What's their favorite color? What is your pet's pet breed? These are good questions to ask yourself when you are designing the inside.

, Cut windows. These will let in light for your seemingly dark and forbidding house.

,, If you want wood furniture, ask a friend who is good with wood, unless you are good with wood yourself. Clay furniture will take up a lot of time, but it's worth it.

, Your pet will thank you for this, as wood and clay are uncomfortable to sit on and sleep on.

, This is also a good time to think of your pet's personality. Is your new stuffed animal playful? Shy? Caring?

, These spots will be your hot spots. You'll be glad you did this later.

, Stuffed animals don't like walking around with no clothes on! Think of pajamas, everyday clothes, fancy clothes, a bathing suit, etc.

, Having fun with your new stuffed animal is the most important thing after you get your animal."

Look at the features of the toy.,
If your toy's fur is, let's say, rather long or messy, you could name it Shaggy or Puffball.,
If your toy is related to a holiday or season, this might suggest a name.,
Think about how you met/got the toy.",How to Name a Stuffed Animal or Toy2," If the toy has a bobble head, for example, maybe you could name it Bobby, or Shaky. Or, think about the gender. You probably don't want a boy named Princess! Think about what animal the toy is and name it for what it is matched with. For example, a parrot. They are known to live with pirates, so why not a ""pirate""-ish name, such as ""Patchy""?;
, Or maybe if a toy is ""jet black"", you could name your toy Jet.


Look carefully at the toy's face, or expression, and sometimes a name just pops inside your head! See if it reminds you of someone you know, but don't give them your best friend's name if it's a stuffed pig.







, For example, Webkinz makes Love Puppies. If you have a seasonal stuffed animal, think about something related to that holiday. Like ""Spooks"" for a Halloween toy, or ""Hearts"" for a Valentine toy.

, Then the name will have a meaning.

For example: If you got the toy in April you could name the toy April, or if someone gave it to you, you could name it after them.

Build a tri-level swing with the following:Six hobby precut wood measuring four inches wide x quarter inch thick x two ft long
30 feet of rope
Two hooks that you’ll screw into ceiling studs
Four wood laths that measure four feet.
Hobby pre-cuts and wood lath are relatively cheap but make sure to choose lath that have minimal knots and are straight.
Each shelf fits around eight Build-a-Bear sized toys with room to stuff a few smaller ones in as well.;
, Sand both the hobby pre-cuts and the lath. Once smooth, cut your wood lath so that you will have six pieces that measure two feet in length and six pieces that measure one foot in length. There should be two two foot and two one foot pieces of wood lath for each level of your swing., Glue a length of lath to the end of your hobby precuts. Place two hobby pre-cuts on the ground separating them about two - three inches. At each end of the precuts, place a one foot length of lath and secure it using wood glue. Finish glueing the swing seats for each of the remaining two levels.Allow the glue to dry completely. Lay something heavy on each lath or clamp the lath and precuts as the glue dries.

, Drill a hole at each end of your pieces of lath. Make sure the hole is big enough for the rope to fit through. Measure the drill bit against the thickness of the rope prior to drilling. Measure the length of rope needed depending on how high your ceiling is and how low you want the swing to hang.You will need to cut four lengths of rope measuring at about eight feet depending on the height of your ceiling. Thread one piece of rope through your swing set making sure to knot the end so that it doesn’t come through the hole completely and secures the bottom. Create a second knot on the other side of the swing seat so that there is a knot on the top and bottom of the seat.Take a two foot piece of lath and place it four inches above the seat of the swing. Create the swing bar by wrapping the rope around the lath and either securing it with staples or by knotting the rope around it., Repeat the process of threading the rope through each additional level and securely knotting each seat and swing bar. Keep the seats about 18 inches apart or space them according to your preference. You could make more space between the first and second seat to keep the larger animals at the bottom., Screw hooks into studs in your ceiling. Use a stud finder to make sure you have a secure stud to hang your swing from and measure the distance between the rope on the left side of your seats and the rope on the right side. This will be the distance between your hooks. Knot the ends of the ropes and hang the swing to your hooks from each knot. You should have a knot on each side of the swing so that it hangs balanced."

Gather your materials.,
Prepare your branches.,
Drill your holes.,
Cut your rope.,
Hang the branch to the wall.,
Adjust the height.",How to Organize Stuffed Animals2," You will need a hand saw, electric drill with various bit sizes, a braided rope that’s five eighths of an inch, masking tape, screws, and branches that are one and half - two inches. The number of branches and the amount of rope will depend on how many animals you wish to display., Select branches that are straight and are even in diameter. You may need to cut the ends so that they are an even length or keep them uncut for a more rustic feel. Use a hand saw for clean cuts. Make sure that you dry the branches first if you have collected them from outside or you may purchase branches from a hobby or home and garden store., First use a small drill bit, about two inches, to create a pilot hole through each end of your branch. Continue to increase the sizes of your drill bit as you drill through the pilot hole until you have created a hole large enough to fit the rope through., Measure your rope to the length that you wish your swing to hang and then add fourteen inches to compensate for knots that you will be tying at the end of the rope. Prevent fraying by wrapping masking tape at the end of your rope. This will also allow you to thread the rope through the branch smoothly., At both ends of the branch thread a length of rope so that you have two pieces of rope attached to each branch. Tie a knot at the end of the rope. Use a drill and screw the top knots of the rope into the wall near mouldings or the ceiling.Make sure that the swings are only held by the knot in the rope. They are not meant to bear heavy weight especially if you have young ones who will want to climb it. Allow the swing to easily release from the wall in case a child tugs on it.

, Make sure the swing is level and adjust the height to your preference by adjusting the knots at the bottom of the swing. Play with the look of placing several swings side by side at different heights. Once you have your prefered heights, remove the masking tape from the ends of the rope and fray the ends of the rope to your preference.


Freshen the look of your branches by hanging stuffed toys in different colour combinations or style combinations. For example you can have all white bears on one branch and all black dogs on another.

Hang a stuffed animal hammock.,
Use a basket or wire hamper.,
Utilize an Ikea mesh closet organizer.,
Display your animals using the Ikea Komplement multi-use hanger.",How to Organize Stuffed Animals3," Utilize unusable wall space by hanging up a hammock in the top corner of your child’s room. Stuffed animal hammocks may be purchased online or your local children’s store. Simply screw in three hooks at any corner of your child’s room and unfurl the hammock onto the hooks. Make sure that the hooks are spread out enough to match the size of your hammock. Hooks can be purchased at your local hardware store or dollar store.Use a stud finder to make sure you have a secure stud to hang your hammock from. Hanging hammocks make cleanup fun because kids enjoy throwing their toys up and into the hammock but make sure the hooks are properly secure on studs.
There maybe a disadvantage to a hammock because, depending on your child’s size and the placement of the hammock, they may not be able to reach the toys when they want to play. Consider safety issues as kids may try to climb to reach their toys or even hang on the hammock once it’s reached.
Depending on how many stuffed animals your child has, it may be a nuisance to retrieve the animals on the bottom. Consider having a regular rotation so that your child gets use of all the stuffed animals and not just the ones that stay at the top of the pile.

, Purchase a large woven basket or wire clothes hamper online or at your local home and furniture store. Wire baskets are great because they keep all the toys visible and keep the toys easily accessible. Similarly, woven baskets keep the animals well-organized while still providing a cute display. Simply organize the animals upright so that their heads peak out of the basket., Similar to an animal hammock, hang a mesh closet organizer in the closet or hang it from the corner of the room. Screw in a hook that can be purchased at your local hardware store or dollar store at any corner of the room and hang the organizer, which can be purchased online or at Ikea.The closet organizer may only store stuffed animals of a certain size; however, it will be convenient for your child to store and access her animals whenever she wants.
Use a stud finder to make sure you have a secure stud to hang your organizer from if you plan to hang it from the ceiling.

, While the organizer is meant for scarves, the loops are perfect for holding and displaying stuffed animals as well. Simply place one half of an animal through a loop and allow it to be suspended by its arms and upper body. Place it in a closet or screw in a hook at the back of a door or on a wall to latch the organizer on to."

Organize by size.,
Create fun patterns with colour.,
Utilize every part of the room.",How to Organize Stuffed Animals4," Depending on how many stuffed animals there are, it may be necessary to organize them by size so that you keep the smaller ones in the front so that they are not hidden. Whether you are displaying them on a shelf or keeping them in the closet, keep the smaller ones visible.


You may experiment with fun patterns when you display your animals. For example, display all your large animals surrounded by five smaller ones and continue this pattern around the room.

, If there are a lot of stuffed animals, organizing them by colour will bring bursts of energy through your room. For example, you can have all the brown animals on the bottom of a shelf and the white ones on the top. You could also alternate and have a red animal in between flour black ones and continue the pattern around the room.

, If you do not have anywhere to confine your stuffed animals at a single space, you could use them to decorate every part of the room. Use the top of bookshelves, inside bookshelves as book stops, in between shoes in shoe racks, companions at a desk, or displayed on the window sill.


You may also create silly worlds where all the stuffed birds are placed atop book shelves and coats, stuffed whales swim on the floor, stuffed monkeys swing on the coats, and stuffed bears hide underneath the bed. Use your imagination to help inspire your organization.

Choose a fabric for your stuffed animal.,
Pick an animal.,
Make your pattern.,
Prepare your fabric.",How to Make a Homemade Stuffed Animal1," You can go with realistic coloring, like browns and greys, or pick a fun pattern like polka dots. Keep in mind that some types of fabric are easier to work with than others.Great fabrics for beginners include cotton quilting fabric, which comes in many fun patterns, and felt. Felt works especially well if you don’t want to sew your stuffed animal.
If you choose patterned fabric for your project, pick a pattern that looks nice when connected randomly. Sometimes patterns like stripes or chevron can be difficult to line up.
You can buy fabric at most craft and hobby stores.
If you’d rather not go out and buy fabric, consider repurposing some old fabric. You could easily use an old dress shirt, tablecloth, or towel to create your stuff animal.;
, Before you begin creating your pattern, you’ll want to decide what animal you want to create. As you are brainstorming, try to choose an animal that has a distinct shape and a simple silhouette.Some possible options include: a cat, a bear, a rabbit, a monkey, an owl, or a fish.You can also make things that aren’t animals like flowers or stars.

, For this simple project, feel free to use any type of paper that you have on hand. Since you will only have two pieces of fabric to connect, your pattern is basically just a simple template for cutting out those pieces.


Decide how large you want your stuffed animal to be when it’s finished. You’ll need to make your pattern one-half to one inch larger all the way around.
Simply draw a two-dimensional outline of your animal.If you’d rather not freehand your pattern, you can find many free, printable animal patterns online.Once you’ve drawn your pattern, cut it out along the edges.

, After you’ve made your pattern, you’ll need to transfer it onto your fabric.Make sure the fabric you’re using is ironed or steamed and free from creases. This will make it much easier to work with.


Lay your pattern on top of your fabric. Draw around its online with a dark marker or a piece of white chalk. Do this twice, one for each side of your stuffed animal.
Cut your fabric along the line you drew. It’s best to use sharp sewing scissors to cut fabric, if you have them.

If you want a real-looking dog, look in a dog book that shows you all of the available breeds. Find one you like, then search for a stuffed toy dog that represents the preferred breed. For example, if you like a German Shepherd, you'd probably look for a German Shepherd plush.


Look at online toy stores, trading and auction sites to give you more choices. It's fun to have your toy dog mailed to you.
If you can't afford the toy yet, start saving up or ask for it as a gift for your birthday or other special occasion.;
, You could base the name on what you love most. If you like the beach and Los Angeles, you could name your plush Pineapple, Neon or Sunny. If you like cold winter days, you could name it Cloudy, Misty, Snowball, Snowfall, Snowy, etc.


Use names people usually give dogs, such as Fido, Fluffball, Guy or Lassie.

, Braid strings together or get a real dog collar. Put on a license tag for the dog so that it can be returned if you misplace it. To make the license tag, get a piece of paper and write your stuffed animal's name down. Then write your phone number, so that if you lose your plush, the finder can call you and let you know that they have your stuffed toy dog.


Dollar store collars are another fine option for the stuffed toy dog.

, It could be real dog bed or just some soft blankets stacked up in a pile. Whatever it might be, it has to be comfortable for your cute plush puppy. Or, you could even let your pet sleep on your own bed.

, If you're handy with sewing, stitch them, otherwise use glue or clothing from other stuffed toys you own.

This is a great way to learn to sew and to improve your sewing––the stuffed toy dog won't mind how amateur the stitching is while you're learning.

, Check that your dog's license tag is firmly in place, just in case you lose it. Pack your dog's collars, costumes, sweaters, bows, etc. in a little bag. Keep your dog with you at all times. Keep it in your bag with its head sticking out, or carry it, so that your puppy can still be included in whatever you're doing for the day.

, Nothing shows more love than cuddling! Your plush puppy will love it.

, This is optional, because you might think your pet doesn't need to eat. If you want your pet to eat, then get some little cups of water or make some fake food for it to eat.


Cut out images of dog food from magazines. Glue these to some box cardboard and cut around to make the shape realistic. Feed this to your stuffed toy dog.

Pin your fabric together.,
Sew your sides.,
Turn your animal inside out.,
Stuff your animal.,
Close up your hole.,
Embellish your creature.",How to Make a Homemade Stuffed Animal2," Before you begin to sew your animal, you’ll want to use straight sewing pins to pin your two pieces of fabric to each other.This ensures your fabric pieces stay lined up correctly as you begin to sew.


Pin your fabric inside out. This means that you’ll want the two finished sides of the fabric facing inward toward each other.
Use the pins horizontally around the perimeter of your animal. You want your pins to be about half an inch apart all the way around.

, You can make your homemade stuffed animal either with a sewing machine or with basic hand stitching. Before you begin to sew, thread a need, and knot the end of your thread. Use thread that is the same color as your fabric or use a contrasting color for decoration.


Sew about a quarter of an inch to a half-inch from the edge of the fabric.
Whether you are hand sewing or using a machine, leave about an inch left unsewn so that you can stuff your animal. This often works well at the end of a leg.
After you finish sewing, remove all the straight pins from the perimeter of your animal.

, Using the hole that you left unsewn, pull your fabric through, and turn it inside out.It may take a bit of work to pull all of the fabric through your whole.


When you turn it inside out, the raw stitching should be hidden, and the good side of your fabric will now be visible.

, Once you turn your fabric, you’ll need to begin filling your animal. You’ll want to make sure it’s full but that there is no strain on the stitching. You can find stuffing at local craft stores.


Use the end of a wooden spoon, dowel, or chopstick to help push the stuffing in all the corners of your animal., After you’ve stuffed your animal, you’ll want to sew up the small hole you used to put in the stuffing. Doing this should not take very much thread. Use the same thread that you used for the perimeter of your animal.


Knot the end of your last stitch so it stays in place. Trim any excess threads.

, Once you finish sewing your stuffed animal, you can add more character with various kinds of decorations. These will make you animal come alive. Feel free to use items you have on hand, or pick some decorations up at a craft store.



Sew buttons on for eyes or a nose. If you are giving your animal to a small child, be wary of buttons, as they can become choking hazards.
Use fabric paints or markers to draw in details. This can be a good option for smaller children, as they can’t pull of small pieces of decoration.

"
"
Line up your fabric.,
Attach your sides together.,
Flip your fabric inside out.,
Stuff your animal.,
Close up the gap.,
Decorate your stuffed animal.",How to Make a Homemade Stuffed Animal3," You want the best sides of your fabric turned inwards to face each other. If you’re not sewing your stuffed animal, you don’t need to pin the sides together.


Remember: for this method, thicker, stronger fabrics work better., The two easiest no-sew ways to attach them are with hot glue or with staples. If your stuffed animal is for a small child, choose glue. Staples can be choking hazards or cause cuts.


If you’re using hot glue, run a thin line of glue along the sides of your animal a quarter to one-half inch away from the edge. Press the sides together, and let the glue dry and cool completely before moving on.To staple, just staple around the sides leaving, again, a quarter to one-half inch of space at the edge. Place the staples close together without leaving gaps in between.
In both methods, leave about an inch open so that you’ll be able to stuff your animal.
Alternatively, you can use fabric glue in place of hot glue. You’ll simply need to let it dry for several hours before manipulating it.

, Through the gap you left in the side, you should pull the fabric through. Be especially careful not to pull out any of your staples or put holes in your hot glue edge.


When you turn your animal inside out, the raw edges will be hidden, and the good side of your fabric will now be visible.

, Once you turn your fabric, you’ll need to begin filling your animal. You want to fill it without straining the staples or glue. For this project, you can find stuffing at local craft stores.


Use your hands to push the stuffing in as much as you can, and use the end of a wooden spoon, a dowel, or a chopstick to help push the stuffing into all the hard-to-reach corners of your animal., After you’ve stuffed your animal, you’ll want to use a few staples or another line of glue to seal up the small hole in your animal. Even if you used staples around the perimeter of your animal, consider using glue for this small hole so that you won’t have any visible staples.


Tuck the raw edges of the fabric in so that they don’t show.

, After you’ve finished the basics, you can add more character to your creation to make it unique and special. Decorations come in all kinds of forms and can be made from fabric scraps, things you have around the house like buttons, or even just drawn on with markers.


Glue on buttons or googly eyes.Again, be careful with these around small children, as they can be choking hazards.
Use a fabric paint or fabric markers to draw on other features.
You can even use scrap fabric to hot glue or staple together clothes for your stuffed animal.

Drain your Orbeez.,
Play with your Orbeez!,
Store the Orbeez in an airtight container.,
Dispose your Orbeez in the trash or by reusing them in your garden.",How to Make Orbeez1," Orbeez should be available at any major toy or big box store.You can also buy them online from most toy store websites or general retailers. They come in a wide variety of colors. While you might want to attempt a trial run with just one package, many people enjoy mixing colors together.


Different colored Orbeez can be used for team games or in art projects.;
, Use a pair of scissors to open the packet, making sure not to spill any of the tiny Orbeez on the ground.


The Orbeez should look like large grains of colored salt.

, You will not see any changes immediately. Don't worry, it takes some time before the Orbeez start to grow.


If your Orbeez aren't fully round you may not have used enough water, or you may need to wait for more water to be absorbed.
Use pure water to make your Orbeez grow bigger. Distilled water will get you the best results., They will grow 100 to 300 times their original size if you wait long enough, with a maximum diameter of 14 millimeters.If your Orbeez are not entirely grown but are running out of water, feel free to add more. Too much water won't hurt the growth of your Orbeez.

, There may be extra water at the bottom of the container in which you soaked your Orbeez. Drain it so that it doesn't spill when you start to play.

, Run Orbeez through your fingers. People seem to enjoy the smooth sensation. There are a wide variety of other things you can do with your Orbeez, here are a few suggestions:


Take them outside and have a bouncing Orbeez contest with a friend. See how high you can bounce them!
Play mini bocce ball, where you and your friends try to get your Orbeez close to a target ball, like a marble. You can use different color Orbeez for different teams, and each team can take turns rolling the target ball.
Try playing bullseye with a friend and two different colors of Orbeez. Simply draw a bullseye on a sheet of paper and take turns with your friend trying to roll a Orbeez into the center of the bullseye.
Play Orbeez croquet with your friends. You can fold pieces of paper or use paper clips to create your course ""hoops.""
Create an Orbeez obstacle course, like putt-putt golf. Challenge your friends to get Orbeez through the course in as few tries as possible.
Use different colored Orbeez to play classic games, like marbles or Chinese checkers.

, When you are finished playing with them put them into a container with a lid. This will make your Orbeez last up to a week.


If your Orbeez accidentally dry out, don't worry. You simply need to resoak them to reactivate them.
Do your Orbeez smell musty or moldy? This is likely because of impure water you used. Try using purified water, and if you still smell mold, dispose of them.

, If you are sure you don't want your Orbeez anymore or they've become moldy, it's time to dispose of them. Orbeez are not intended to be disposed of through plumbing, so you shouldn't rinse them down a drain. Instead, throw them away or mix them into the soil of your potted plants, where they will help the soil retain moisture.


Orbeez were originally developed to slowly release water into soil, watering plants gradually. They will help the soil retain moisture, thus helping water the plants you are growing. If you mix them into the soil, you won't have to water your potted plants as often."

Buy dried basil seeds or dried tapioca pearls.,
Soak the basil seeds in water.,
Boil the tapioca pearls in water according to package directions.By boiling the tapioca they will expand into balls of jelly.,
Play with your water marbles.,
Store your edible water marbles in the refrigerator.,
Dry your water marbles out when you are done using them.",How to Make Orbeez2," These should be available at most grocery stores, but if you're having difficulty in your search, check specialty Asian markets. These frequently offer less expensive varieties than what you might pay for brand-named Orbeez.


The basil seeds will make very small, gelatinous water marbles. Basil seeds begin hard, black in color, and about the size of a grain of rice, but they will grow as they absorb water.Because they are so small, they are less of a choking hazard for small children.Tapioca pearls are usually small, round, and colored white or off-white, ranging from one to eight millimeters in diameter.Your homemade water marbles are made of natural ingredients, so it's OK if they are eaten. Make sure children have washed their hands before playing or eating water marbles to ensure cleanliness.

, Put the seeds into any container, but make sure it has enough room for the water marbles to expand.


You do not need to worry about adding an exact amount of water. Make sure that you have added at least four times as much water as your seeds. If there is extra water when your beads are fully grown, you can simply drain the water away.
Put a few drops of food coloring in the water. You can also use a teaspoon of drink mix or a natural alternative to food coloring, such as beet juice for pink or turmeric for yellow.
Let the seeds soak up the water until they have grown to your liking. It will take at least several hours for them reach full size.

,


Once boiled, let the tapioca pearls cool completely.
Like the basil seeds, you can color the tapioca pearls with food coloring, drink mix, or alternative colorants.

, They are great sensory stimulation for young children. Simply put the finished water marbles in a container and let your children play with them between their fingers.


Some of the games recommended for store bought Orbeez might not be ideal for your homemade batch. Starch can dry and leave a glue-like trail behind, so you should plan accordingly when you play games with your homemade water marbles. You might want to try:

Using your dyed water marbles to make art.
Cleaning hands before play and using your water marbles afterward as a treat in your own bubble tea.
Playing water marble checkers with different colors for different teams.
Water marble bingo, using the marbles as chips to cover squares that have been called.



, Like most foods, they will spoil (or sprout) if left uncovered or if stored for too long.

, You should be able to reuse them at a future time if you dry them out before they spoil.


Spread them out of a pan and let them dry out at room temperature. On a sunny day you could even set the pan outside in the sun to dry.

Plan out a design.,
Make a final draft.,
Decide how your pieces will move.,
Make your cars.,
Decide what makes someone ""win"".,
Add some more features and obstacles.,
Add in a a fuel system.,
Finalize your ideas and build a final copy.",How to Make a Paper Board Game (Car Racing)," The easiest way to get started is to grab a sheet of scratch paper and drawing out racetrack designs.The drawings don't have to be overly detailed. After all, a racetrack is basically just an oval road. 2 equidistant, curving lines is usually all it takes.;
, After you have gotten your design down, it's time to move to another clean sheet of scratch paper. This time, however, you will want to draw out your racetrack the way it will look like in the final copy.

, The simplest form of moving pieces in a board game is probably using dice; the player will roll a dice to get a number, and then move that many spaces.


To create spaces, you can take your second sheet of scratch paper (the one with the clean racetrack), and add lines at intervals maybe on inch apart (depending on the size of the track) until the spaces are made all the way around.

, This is probably the most exciting or least exciting part. You can either draw and cut out your own cars, or print some off the internet.


However, make sure you can fit the cars in the spaces you made earlier. Too big of a car might be confusing to determine which space it is in, and too small of a car could get lost.
Be creative: This is your game and your car. Use whatever you want for your car. Maybe take the race car from a Monopoly game or just draw a new car every time you play.If you want to go big, use a poster board in your final copy of the game so that way, you can use toy cars as your pieces.

, The most basic gameplay rules can be just a set number of laps you must complete in order to finish, but there is no limitation. Get creative if you'd like to!

, Want to have a pitstop? Then add some more rules or obstacles to the course. Here are some ideas to get started with:


Oil slicks skip your turn once.
Rolling a 6, 3 times in a row will make your car break down and you can only move 2 spaces each turn until you reach the pitstop.
Using the pitstop makes you lose a turn.
Go Mario Kart style and add bananas and homing turtle shells.

, These can be tricky because it can be hard to measure each turn, but using a separate sketch pad may help.


Start with a base fuel level (Ex: 50). That is the total number of spaces your car can move before running out of gas
Subtract the amount you moved each turn from the base fuel. Every turn should bring it lower and lower
You can refuel back to 100% at the pitstop. If you fuel reaches 0, then you can only move 2 spaces each turn until you reach the pitstop.

, After finally finishing your ideas, it's time to move onto the final copy.


Copy the design for the racetrack you drew onto a clean sheet of copy paper. That way, it is easy to carry around in a folder to show to friends and family.

Study how the show assigns categories to its games.,
Be aware of the show's category gimmicks.",How to Make Jeopardy Questions2," ""Jeopardy!"" is intended as a test of general knowledge. Except for specialized versions of the game, such as ""Rock and Roll Jeopardy!"" and ""Jep!"" (a version of ""Jeopardy!"" for preteens), the categories selected for each round of the game should cover a broad range of knowledge without overlapping with one another.

, Even though ""Jeopardy!"" is a test of general knowledge, the show is creative with its category names and how it pairs categories in its games. Some of the methods are described below:


Theme boards. On a number of occasions, the 6 categories have names that suggest a common theme. For example, the Jeopardy! round of a game that aired in 2004 had a Shakespearean theme, with categories ""Richard III"" (about the king, not the play), ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (questions related to nothingness), ""Measure for Measure"" (covering units of measure), ""Hamlets"" (related to small towns), ""The 'Temp'-ist"" (all correct responses included words with the letters ""temp""), and ""Shakespearean Actors.""
Paired categories. When an entire board is not devoted to a single theme, categories may be paired creatively, such as a category named ""St. Paul"" about the apostle, followed by a category ""Minnesota"" about the state of Minnesota. On occasion, the same or a very similar category name may be used in the Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds to cover different subjects, such as ""Notions"" used in the Jeopardy! round for a category about ideas and in the Double Jeopardy! round for a category on sewing items.
Gimmick categories. In recent years, ""Jeopardy!"" has developed a few gimmick categories that test players' knowledge beyond simple recall. In ""Stupid Answers,"" the key word of the correct response appears somewhere in the clue. (For example, ""While Billy Batson says 'Shazam!' to become Captain Marvel, Freddy Freeman says these words to become Captain Marvel, Jr."" ""What is 'Captain Marvel'?"") In ""Rhyme Time,"" the correct response must include a pair of rhyming words. (For example, ""What is a green bean?"") In ""Before and After,"" the correct response is a name or phrase composed of 2 parts made into a portmanteau. (For example, ""Longtime host of 'American Bandstand' who is secretly Superman."" ""Who is Dick Clark Kent?"")
Traditional category names. ""Jeopardy!"" has established traditional names for some of its categories, such as ""Name's The Same"" for 2 or more items with the same name, ""Unreal Estate"" for fictional places, and both ""Potpourri"" and ""Hodgepodge"" for general knowledge. Category names that include quotation marks about part of the name indicate that correct responses will include the letters or word enclosed in the quotes.
Category name puns. ""Jeopardy!"" category names frequently are plays on words, such as ""See What the CAT Scan Dragged In"" or ""I'll Be Your Waiter,"" about people who waited for something. The show has frequently punned its ""Potpourri"" category name with such categories as ""Poe-Pourri"" (about Edgar Allan Poe), ""Pope-Pourri"" (about popes), and ""Pan and Pot-Pourri"" (about cooking).

"
"
Define your questions properly.,
Use the best information sources you can find.,
Verify that your information is still current before using it to write the question.,
Consider your audience.,
Phrase the clue in an interesting way.",How to Make Jeopardy Questions3," Asking for the ""second largest"" of the Great Lakes is not enough, you need to define whether you mean second largest by volume (Lake Michigan) or by surface area (Lake Huron). Defining what information you're looking for precisely will help you research, and expressing what you mean precisely will help avoid ambiguity on the contestants' part.


Even so, ""Jeopardy!"" has sometimes mis-defined its questions. On a January 2013 show, to indicate a scalene triangle, in which none of the sides are of equal length, the graphic image in the clue showed a triangle with dimensions of 6, 8, and 10. Because these measurements are a Pythagorean triple (6 squared plus 8 squared equals 10 squared), a contestant answered, ""What is a right triangle?"" � which was correct given the clue, but not the answer the show was looking for.

, While the staff of ""Jeopardy!"" has access to paid research sources such as Gale Research, you'll have to use less prestigious sources. Reputable encyclopedias, either in book form or online, are one possible source, as are specialized reference books and websites.


When reading, look for qualifiers such as ""according to,"" ""allegedly,"" ""reputedly,"" or ""reportedly"" and consider information following these words to be suspect.
To further vet a website, read the write-up under ""About"" or ""About Us"" about the person or organization behind the website. If the write-up indicates a personal agenda or bias, consider the ""factual"" information presented on the site as suspect.

, Many websites include a date of posting; news websites often include a note about how current an article is when covering breaking news. Also be aware that sports records can be and often are broken during an athletic competition or season, and entertainment records can be similarly broken with the release of a new movie or recording.


In general, questions involving records should be about the record holder rather than about the record itself. While some fans are amateur statisticians, most aren't.

, Choose the subject matter, difficulty, and vocabulary of your questions so that players and spectators can, on average, get 2/3 to 3/4 of your clues right. However, don't be afraid to occasionally stretch your audience; the best ""Jeopardy!"" players are those who are curious about many things.


You can get a sense of what subjects are commonly used on ""Jeopardy!"" by watching the show regularly. The 1992 book ""Secrets of the Jeopardy! Champions"" by former champions Chuck Forrest and Mark Lowenthal covers a number of the subjects used for the show up to that time, but be aware that in recent years, the show has featured more pop culture material than previously.

, ""Jeopardy!"" clues are distinctive not just for being formatted as answers but for providing information to help the contestants figure out the correct question. This is done in one of several ways:


Factual information. A fact can be the focus of an answer clue, as in ""Mary Ann Evans' pen name"" for the correct question of ""Who is George Eliot?"" It can also be a fact subordinate to the primary fact of the question, as in ""This Man in Black scored a minor 1984 hit with the country novelty song 'Chicken in Black'"" for the correct question ""Who is Johnny Cash?"" by incorporating Cash's nickname.
Irony. Some clues juxtapose facts of contradictory natures, as in a January 2013 Final Jeopardy! of ""The first of Jane Austen's 6 novels to be published in her lifetime, its title is last alphabetically"" for the correct question of ""What is 'Sense and Sensibility'?""
Style mimicry. Some ""Jeopardy!"" clues have been done to copy the style of text messages or personal ads, as in ""King good at solving riddles wants girl just like the girl who married dear old Dad"" for ""Who is Oedipus?""
Inside jokes. Just as ""Jeopardy!"" sometimes uses clever names for its categories, it also uses puns and inside jokes in its clues, such as ""Frank Zappa named his band this out of necessity"" for ""What is the Mothers of Invention?"" based on the adage ""Necessity is the mother of invention.""

Make a cardboard dollhouse.,
Make a cardboard stove top.",How to Make Toys Out of Recycled Objects1," Cardboard dollhouses are the best because the owner of this wonder can decorate it in any way that she or he likes. You could involve the child in making the dollhouse from the beginning, present the dollhouse when built but in need of decorating, or go the whole way and give a completely finished dollhouse. For ideas on how to make this, see How to make a cardboard dollhouse, How to build a cardboard dollhouse and How to make a cardboard dollhouse from a box. And why not make some cardboard dollhouse furniture too?;
, This cute little number is perfect for the budding little ""Master chef"". All you need is a cardboard box, scissors and markers and you can put together a very cute stove.


Find a short, square box. Tape it up so that it is completely closed.
Choosing one square side to the be top, divide it into four quarters. Mark these with a pen or pencil.
Stick opaque tape (black, white or any color the child likes) on the dividing lines. Also take the tape around all of the edges of the box. This will make it look sturdy and stove-like.
Make the hotplates. For each hotplate, make a cross from two popsicle sticks. Glue on diagonally for each quarter. For the round part, glue on varying sizes of cardboard circles. Black is a good color for the circles, but you can use colors to match the tape if preferred.
Add knobs. Screw or glue on drink bottle caps to the front side of the box. Have at least four knobs (one for each hotplate) and an on/off knob. You can add letters or pictures to the knobs if desired.
Make a splashback from cardboard. Choose a square piece of cardboard as wide as the stove. It must be box cardboard or strong cardboard, to withstand having things hang from it. Glue or staple it to the back of the stove.
Hang some cooking items from it. Use two bottle caps as holders and glue them towards the top of the splashback. Drill holes into the caps in the same place to allow for a wooden skewer to slide across as a hanging bar. Alternatively, glue it in place.
Hang little cooking items from the skewer bar. Open up paperclips to form S-shaped hooks, then hang off toy scoops, etc.
Done. The stove is now ready for fun.

Attach the blades to the dowels.,
Hook the wires up to a multimeter.,
Test your windmill model.",How to Prepare a Working Model of a Windmill Using PVC Pipes,";
, This will form the base of your windmill tower. Use 1"" (2.5 cm) diameter PVC pipe cut to the lengths described below, and attach as follows:


Fit three 6"" (15 cm) lengths of pipe into the three holes of a T-junction. Tap the pipes together with a hammer so they fit together tightly.
Make an identical shape with three more 6"" (15 cm) segments and a second T-junction.

, This third T-junction needs a new hole so you can snake the wires through that conduct power from your windmill. Follow these steps to drill safely:Secure the T-junction in a vise. Position it so the central branch points downward.
Dent the back of the T-junction with a hammer and nail, leading into the central branch.
Use the dent as a guide to prevent your drill from slipping. You can use a drill bit designed for wood or metal.

, Use the third T-junction you just drilled to connect the two central branches of the T-shapes. Fit these into opposite ends of the T-junction, to form one large ""H."" Before you make the connection tight, lay the H flat on the floor. Position the T-junction so the empty hole is pointing upward, and the hole you drilled is on the floor.

, The ""feet"" of the windmill are four 90º PVC elbow connectors. Attach one to each of the four ends of the H. The open end of the connector should be flat on the floor, so it supports the H with the central T junction facing straight up.

, It's up to you how tall to make your windmill, as long as the blades have room to spin without hitting the base. A 24"" (61 cm) length of pipe should work well. Attach this securely in the central T-junction.

, This should be as close to 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) in diameter as possible, since it needs to fit snugly inside a PVC coupling. You can buy the motor at an electronics store, or look for a ""turbine kit"" online. The turbine kit may include a hub, dowels, or other parts you need for this section of the project.The motor should have two attached wires. Before you continue, confirm that the hole you drilled in the T-junction can fit both the wires. If it cannot, expand the hole with a larger drill bit.
The driveshaft of this motor will need to fit into a hub (described below). You may want to buy the hub first, then take it to an electronics store to find a motor that fits securely.

, Attach a 3"" (7.5 cm) length of PVC pipe into a 90º elbow connector. Fit a PVC coupling over the other end of the straight pipe. You've just made the ""nacelle,"" or compartment that will house the rotor.


As before, make all connections tight by tapping them together with a hammer.

, Feed the wires attached to the DC motor through the coupling, and pull them out through the elbow connector.

, It's important to fit the motor snugly into the mouth of the coupling. To ensure this, wrap the motor with duct tape until it fits tight against the wall of the coupling. Position the motor so the driveshaft end protrudes slightly from the opening. Make it as straight as possible, since an off-centered motor will cause your windmill blades to wobble.

, This hub should fit snugly over the driveshaft without pressing against the body of the motor. Most people either use the hub from a ""turbine kit,"" available online, or a spool from a Tinkertoy set, with one central hole.


You can save money (and get an exact fit) by cutting your own hub out of plywood (a circle with angled slits in the edge for attaching the windmill blades).This is fairly difficult at the small size described in this project, at least for novice woodworkers.

, Get two extra wires long enough to travel down the vertical pole of the windmill and out through the hole you drilled in the base. Attach them to the two wires on the motor using twist-on connectors.



Splicing the wires together takes more effort, but is more secure.

, Have someone hold the top section (nacelle) while you drop the wires down through the vertical pipe of the windmill. Pick up the wires from the base and pull them through the hole in the base.

, Fit the elbow connector on the nacelle over the vertical pipe, tapping them together with a hammer. Position it so the hub faces forward, between the two legs of the ""H"" on the base.

, Both the kit and Tinkertoy hubs have holes spaced around the edge of the circle. Insert dowels or Tinkertoy rods into these holes. Each rod will support one blade on the windmill. You can use any number of blades on your windmill, but they must be evenly spaced around the hub. If the blades are unbalanced, the windmill will vibrate as it runs, and parts could break.


Make these rods as secure as possible. If they are loose, they may fly out at high speed while the windmill is spinning. The safest option is a dowel slightly too large for the hole, with one end sanded down until it barely fits.
Start with two to four rods, so it's easy to experiment with the design of your blades.You can always add more later if you need more power. Professional wind turbines rarely have more than three blades., Try poster board, or a sturdy paper or Styrofoam plate. If you want stiffer blades (which provide more power), buy thin sheets of balsa wood from a craft or home improvement store.Cut the blades to any shape and size you like, but make sure they are all identical so your windmill is balanced.


The blades will work better if the tip is rounded and narrower then the rest., Use strong glue or another strong adhesive. Just make sure the blades are very well attached, or they could fly off when the windmill spins.


For best results, tilt the blades 35.5 degrees back from the plane of the hub.Eyeball this as slightly more than ⅓ of a right angle.

, The motor powering this model windmill is very small, and probably can't power anything significant. Hook it up to the leads of a multimeter set to measure DC voltage instead. Depending on your blade design and wind strength, you will probably see a result of 0.2 to 0.5 volts once the windmill is running.


It is possible to get above 1 volt if the blades are made of stiff material, and have the right shape, size, and angle. In this case, you might be able to make an LED flicker. Red LEDs are the easiest to power.Put on safety goggles. Anyone near the windmill should wear safety goggles while the windmill is running. If a piece of the windmill breaks, it could fly off at high speed and injure someone. Reduce the risk by standing behind the windmill or in front of it, not on the side.

, Set up the windmill so the hub is facing the wind directly. If the wind hits the blades at an angle, the force could snap the driveshaft or knock the motor loose from the windmill.


If there's not much wind today, you can test your windmill indoors in front of a strong fan, centered in front of the hub. The air from a fan is more turbulent than wind, so correct this by blowing the air through a ""honeycomb"" of paper towel tubes, milk cartons, or other open tubes."

Make other toys from car tires.",How to Make Toys Out of Recycled Objects4," A car tire swing is a great way to use up old tires for another year or more. For directions on making this, see How to make a tire swing.

, If you have an outdoor playground area, there are lots of fun things you can do with old car tires to make it even more fun, including making a car tire rocker, a car tire seesaw or a car tire sit-on animal.


For a car tire rocker seat, cut an old tire in half. This requires serious sawing ability, so if you don't know what you're doing, ask someone who does or have a hardware place do it for you. Bolt cutters are also helpful for cutting away edges that are difficult to saw away. Clean the tire half well. Measure a slat of wood that is wide enough for a child to sit on and slightly longer each side than the tire half. Cut two brace pieces of wood for sitting between the tire and the wooden seat as well. Sand the wood well, then spray paint. Also spray paint the tire half, using the same color. Spray with an outdoor sealant to protect the paint finishes. Use long wood screws with washers to hold the open sides of the tires together, then attach the braces and finally, nail the seat in place. Handles are also a good idea, so you might like to attach these at the end too.

, You've now made your own pet hamster. Now you can name it and take care of it––some suggestions for this are provided next.

,, For example:


White (snow, snowflake, Bianca, snowball, sugar, cloud, misty, ice, blizzard, cupcake and blaze)
Brown (coco, chocolate, brownie, fudge, mocha, chocolate chip, bean, crusty, donuts)
Ginger (ginger, pizza, orange, bubbles, boo, Barney, mark, cheese)
Black (storm, smoky, thunder, pirate, checker, pitch, twilight)

, For example:


Shy (peekaboo, princess, prince, sweety, hide)
Calm (peace, Oliver, sugar, care, cheese)
Affectionate (love, hammy Valentine, pinkie, heart, sweety)
Nosy (snoopy, Mr. Wow, cool, interesting)
Mad (thunder, Mr. Evil, bite, Rex, pirate, 360, ollie).

, Start by feeding your hamster fake treats (such as doll food or cardboard made to look like food); once it’s comfortable accepting treats from your hand, you can gently and securely pick it up. Hold it for a short time at first, and then gradually increase your time with it.

, Once you’ve hand-tamed your handmade hamster, let it play outside of the cage (you can make a cage from a shoe box or similar recycled item), in a secure, enclosed area. Stay and supervise the play session.


If this were a real hamster, you'd need to be sure that you'd removed any electrical wires from the area, and anything else your curious pet could, but shouldn’t, gnaw on. If you're trying to be realistic, use pieces of yarn for cords and remove them.

, Remove droppings (these could be made from modeling clay), uneaten food and soiled bedding (use garden straw or grass) every day.


Every week, remove and replace all the bedding, and scrub the bottom of the cage with hot, soapy water.

, Talk to them about how you are cleaning its environment, taking it out to play and keeping it well fed, etc. In this way, they may come to see that you're acting responsibly and might consider getting you a real hamster.

Build the tack, feed, hay and bedding rooms.",How to Care for a Toy Horse1," It can be a soft toy, a Schleich model or a Breyer model.;
, Some Breyer horses come with stables, but it's more fun to build your own. You can use old cardboard boxes or plastic containers.Building stables out of popsicle sticks and wooden boxes is an option too. You can decorate these however you want but make sure they're what you want for your toy.

, You can buy plastic fences and trees from craft shops. Another option is to use cardboard and make it into a fence.

, You may have a doll to ride your horse, but if you have a large stuffed toy you can 'ride' it yourself by sticking it between your legs. If your doll is riding it, then it is a good idea to build a mini arena.Breyer and Schleich also sell realistic riders and caretakers for their animals. You could also make a riding timetable if you have more than one horse.

, Fold ( to a size that fits your horse) and tape a plastic sack.

, This may sound gross but its more realistic. Pieces of brown paper scrunched up into balls would do perfectly.

, Three pieces of cardboard joined together to make three walls with two right angles would be excellent.

, Once again, cardboard will do the trick. Put 'bedding' (yellow wool cut into pieces) in the bedding room. Put 'hay' in the hay room. Hay can be darker yellow than straw. For feed and tack, see below.

You can make a brush or find an old hairbrush.,
Make feed, water and bathing buckets by cutting out a rectangle and a circle made of cardboard.,
Make rugs and sweat sheets for your horse by getting some heavy material for winter rugs and light material for summer sheets.",How to Care for a Toy Horse2," You can use black wool for a bridle with white circles for the bit. Get a piece of coloured material in the shape of a square for a saddle cloth. You can use a piece of circular black material for a saddle, with a strip of the same material for the girth. Also use wool for a halter and lead rope.Use yarn to make a harness for your horse so you can have her/him pull a sled.

, Rip up bits of yellow, brown, white and pale brown/yellow paper for a coarse mix. You can make containers of different 'feed' types, aka colours. If you want, you can label the containers.

, Make a wheelbarrow with some cardboard and an old milk carton lid for a wheel. Make a pitchfork and shovel by getting a long strip of cardboard and attach a square of cardboard on one end for a spade and four short strips for a pitchfork. Do the same thing for the broom except use wool for hairs.

, For jumps use strips of cardboard against a base on either side. For dressage markers stick masking tape on pieces of cardboard around the arena with the appropriate letters marked on each one.

,, to make a brush, cut out an oval of cardboard and glue short strips of wool underneath it. For sponges you can use cotton balls or cut up an old sponge. Make a hoof pick by getting a strip of cardboard with a curved tip that is painted silver or covered with aluminum foil. Find a small bag to put all your grooming supplies in.

, Curl the rectangle into a cylinder shape and glue/tape/staple the two ends together. Attach the circle to the bottom and you have a bucket!

Mucking out: Gather your wheelbarrow, pitchfork, broom and shovel.,
Feeding: Collect your horse's feed bucket and take it to the feed room.,
Tacking up and riding: Brush your horse and pick out its feet.,
Sponging and cooling down: After exercise, you should always bath and cool off your horse.,
Tack cleaning: You should have a tack sponge.,
Hay: Always check that the hay is fresh.,
Exercise: With a lunging set exercise your horses so they won't get fat or they can pull a sled in winter.

",How to Care for a Toy Horse3," Tie the horse up outside the stable, or put it into the paddock. If you are skipping out the stable, just pick up the manure. If you are mucking out entirely, pick up all the bedding and manure and put it into the wheelbarrow. Use the broom to sweep any excess bedding into a pile before picking up. Take the wheelbarrow over to the muck heap and empty it, before getting fresh straw from the bedding shed. Air the bedding out by tossing it in the air before spreading it out neatly in the stall/stable and putting the supplies away.

, Measure out the correct amount of feed before taking it back to your horse. When you put the feed back, check your horse's water and hay net. When your horse has finished, use a bucket sponge to wash out the bucket. Dry it before putting it back into the horse's stall.

, Gently place the saddle cloth over its back, then put the saddle on and do up the girth. Slip the bridle over its head with the bit rings either side of its mouth. Mount your horse or give the horse's reins to its rider. Take your horse through some basic moves for dressage, go for a trail ride or go over some jumps! Do whatever you want.

, Sponge the horse down and put on a light sweat sheet. Walk your horse in the shade of some trees before putting it away.

, Clean the saddle by scrubbing all over. Clean underneath and the girth as well. Clean the bridle by folding the sponge over the straps and running up and down.

, Soak the hay in a bucket of water for a bit. Once thoroughly soaked, hang the hay net up again.

"Collect your materials, you will need- Super glue, tin, leather or suede, toy horse, marker pen

,
First you must outline the shape of a saddle on the tin, it should curve around at the bottom, go inward at the center, outward again to meet in the middle like a heart.,
Now put a thin coating of super glue on the flat tin shape and quickly stick the leather onto the tin.,
After this has been done, fold the leather in half and cut a large curve to make the saddle flaps, unfold it so that you have a long oval.,
For the knee rolls, cut two half circle and glue them to the front of the saddle flaps.,
Fold a small piece of leather in half and glue it together, then put it on the back of the saddle and glue it underneath it.

,
cut a two long thin pieces of leather and glue them under the saddle flaps, make sure that they meet with about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) metres to spare under the horse.,
Finally with two long pieces of leather, fold a round piece of wire onto both of them and glue into place to make the stirrups.

",How to Care for a Toy Horse4,", Once cut out make sure it fits your horse to the necessary requirements.

, Make sure that none of the tin is visible beneath the leather. Hold for a few seconds until secure.

, Hold it over the now bent into shape saddle and adjust if , necessary before gluing onto the tin side of the saddle.

, Cut of any excess leather so that it form a smooth curve.

,, Make a buckle by holding some round pliers and twisting the metal around them. Fold one of the girth pieces over the middle and glue into place.

Get a toy snake.,
Get a box.,
Put flooring in the bottom of the box.,
Get a shallow bowl, or saucer.,
Give your pet snake a place to hide.,
Put some good-sized rocks (two or three) in the box.,
Once the box is completed, name your toy snake.,
Find food for your scaly friend.,
Play, handle, and love your toy snake.

",How to Care for a Toy Snake," It can be any size, as long as you have a box big enough for the snake.;
, The box can be an aquarium, plastic, or even a cardboard box. It should fit the snake. A good box is one that when the toy snake is coiled, it should be able to have at least one or two free spaces of room, without the snake touching anything around it when all the necessities are in the box.

, It can be a towel, blanket, gravel, wood shavings, or you can leave it bare, but if the floor is bare, it won't look very cool.

, This will be its water bowl/saucer. it should be big enough where the snake can fit in it, when coiled. And it should not be deep. DO NOT put real water in it unless the toy snake is waterproof. You could put those clear ""rocks"" that people put in fish tanks in the bowl, pretending it is water.

, Snakes MUST have a hide. Some examples are: Half a coconut, a log, a paper towel tube (if the snake fits in it when the snake is coiled), or even one of those little cloth bags. Keep in mind at how big the snake is, because it needs to be able to fit inside of the hide when the snake is coiled.

, Because snakes like to sit on rocks to get warm, and when it it is sunny, rocks get warm. If you don't have any smooth rocks for your snake to sit on, you can use a folded piece of cloth (e.g, a handkerchief) for your snake to sit on., It can be a normal name, like ""Sam"", or an exotic name, like ""Zeus"". You might want to name the snake based on it's features, (e.g, for a black snake, it's name could be ""Midnight"", ""Shadow"", or ""Ebony"".) Think about it's gender. Make up a personality for the toy snake. If the snake is feisty and mean, its name could be ""Demon"". If the snake is nice, and likes to be handled, its name could be ""Sugar"". Or name it a human name, like ""Robert"", ""Bill"", or ""Mary"".

, Plastic mice, or plastic frogs are good. ""Feed"" your snake one or two mice/frogs once a week, or once every other week.,"

Listen to God.,
Find out if the pastor/leader wants you to play any specific songs.,
Find out who you are leading worship for.,
Find out any important ""topic"" information.,
Make a list of possible songs with their original key.,
Find out how many songs you are expected to play.,
Find any combinations of songs that go together.,
Arrange the songs.,
Arrange a split set.,
Figure out transitions.,
Submit the list for approval, to whomever is in charge.,
Practice, Practice, Practice.,
Play and have fun.",How to Set up a Worship Set," If God wants you to play a specific song, and you are close enough in your relationship with him, he will tell you specific songs to play. However, don't mix the voice of God with your voice saying ""Ooh I really like this song."" You'll know it's from God if you don't know why you should be playing it. This is extremely important as you don't want to miss what God is trying to tell his people.;
, Maybe you can incorporate one or two of those.

, Depending on the crowd, you are going to want to use different types of music. In some situations you'll want to use hymns like ""Be thou my vision"", in others you'll want to use older songs like ""Every move I make"", in others you'll want brand new songs like ""10,000 reasons"" or ""Our God is Greater"", and in some other situations you will want to combine all three. Generally this has to do with the people within the church and not the type of church it is, so go up to the pastor, worship leader, or some type of leader, and ask them to list off a few songs they normally play and base your song choice off of that.

, If you are playing for someone else who is speaking, which you probably will be, you will want to try to match your songs with the topic of the speaking. For instance, if the speaker is talking about how we should do everything as if we were doing it for Christ, you might want to play ""Every move I make"" or ""Jesus Paid it all"", or anything that is related to the words to be spoken.

, Once you have all the information about the types of songs you want to use, you are going to want to put all options into a list with their keys next to them. If you don't know the keys, look them up online and you should be able to find the key information, and if not, just guess what you think it might be in. Of course, if God told you any specific songs you will want to have those in their as well, even if they don't match the style of the church or the message.

, If you end up having too many songs for the time allotted, you will have to stop early and the set will sound unfinished. If you have too few songs, the set will sound awkward; you may have to fill time by playing again, one of the songs you already played! This is to be avoided at all costs. Find out how many songs you have time for, when you will be playing them, and whether or not they are split up. For example, the venue could tell you that you will be playing eight songs, so you set up those eight songs, but when you get there you find out you are playing four songs before the message and four songs after, which screws up the transitions you made for the 4th and 5th song.

, This is where the keys come in. Find songs that have the same, or close to the same, key. Example a song in B flat and a song in C are close enough together to be considered similar as you can change the key of one or even both of the songs without making any drastic changes. These songs will go together quite well, especially if they are in the same time signature. One thing that really makes worship awkward is when the worship team finishes a song, it becomes completely quiet, and the crowd starts hearing the movement of capos on guitars. you are going to want to make easy transitions, and this means either having the songs in the same key, or similar keys. Once you have the songs that go together, you are ready for the next step.

, While setting up the arrangement, you want to make sure you keep similar songs together, to make smooth transitions. If it's not possible, don't fret, it's not that big of a deal. Once you are completely done with the arrangement of songs, move on to the next step. There are multiple ways to set up a set depending on how many songs you are playing and when you are playing them. You will want to play upbeat songs early, normal songs in the middle, and intimate songs towards the end. If you are playing a lot of songs, six or more, before the message, you will want to start off with upbeat songs that get people on their feet, like ""Sing Sing Sing"" by Chris Tomlin or ""Your Love Never Fails"" by Jesus Culture. Around halfway, get into a normal tempo like ""Better is One Day"", then towards the end drop down to intimate like ""This is The Air I Breathe"", or ""Prepare the Way"". If you are playing fewer songs before the message (four or five) you will want to keep the same structure, but keep it more on the upbeat side throughout. Don't go all the way intimate. If you are playing just a couple songs before the message, (one to three) you will want to keep the same style throughout, preferably upbeat or normal. If you are playing many songs after the message, you will want to start off with an intimate feeling, then halfway through get all the way up to upbeat, then back down to normal or even intimate. If you are playing a few songs after the message, you will want to do the same structure as a lot of songs, but on the intimate side, meaning don't have the upbeat songs. If you are playing just a couple of songs after the message, keep them the same tempo, preferably normal or intimate.

, Now, this whole thing changes a lot when your set is split up like the example above. If you are playing a lot of songs both before and after, play upbeat songs up front, then slow down to more normal songs towards the middle, then speed up right before the message to upbeat. After the message, start off with some really slow intimate songs, speed up to normal, and end with intimate. This is at variance with the prior step. The reason you want to do this is because, if you are playing more than six songs before and after the message, you risk tiring out your crowd's attention span. So you need to mix it up. If you go to see a band play live, notice that they throw in some random really upbeat or really intimate songs so you keep listening, and you want this same thing in worship, because, otherwise, they will stop worshipping. If you are playing a few songs before, start with upbeat and end with normal. The rest of the information is the same as above.

, You want to keep the music flowing from one song to the next, and not have any sudden stops. When the next song is in the same key, keep playing the chord progression on an acoustic guitar very lightly and then change the progression according to the next song and continue. If two adjoining songs aren't in the same key, you can possibly make it sound like they are in the same key, for instance if you are playing a song in C and are changing to a song in G, you can keep playing C and G over and over again as they are in both C key and G key, then change to the G progression and it won't be at all noticeable unless your a musician. Even if there is just one note that's the same within the two keys, you might be able to have your guitarist keep playing that note and then continue in the next key once someone starts playing the new chord progression. Another way is to have the drummer keep playing and then have the rest of the band join in after changing keys. This can sound great if done right. If none of those are possibilities, have someone on your team pray or give a brief message while someone else starts playing the new chords. The audience will pay attention to the voice and not the music.

, This is crucial. This both tells them that you care about their feedback, and makes certain you don't offend anyone. Some churches may have spiritual or policy disagreements with certain songs.

, Most part time worship teams less frequently than is optimal. Practice at least once a week, if not more. This will both ensure that you remember what you are doing, and will help you focus more on God, rather than on the music, while leading worship.

, Don't get stressed out about this. God has it all under control. Don't feel nervous when you are playing. You are just playing for your brothers and sisters in Christ.

Determine how you see God.,
Establish a relationship with a caring God.,
Talk to God as you would a close, loving but all powerful friend.,
Have a talk with God.,
Watch for and pay attention to possible feedback.,
Tell God that you know that He has His own reasons for His seemingly hands-off response and His timeline -- and so trust Him in that.,
Try to keep following God's path in good faith in the loving concepts of God and expressing God's goodwill.",How to Talk to God1," You’ll need to determine who God is to you in order to confidently talk to God. Who is, and how do you define, God? Do you know God as a fatherly or motherly figure, a teacher, a distant -- or a close friend, sticking closer than a sister or brother? Or, is God an abstract spiritual guide? Is your connection to God rooted in a personal, spiritual relationship you have with God? Or, do you follow the form and order of your religion to understand who God is to you? Whichever is true for you will dictate how you view and talk to God. And, however you see God determines how you will approach God to talk to Him as ______ (as you see Him).;
, It’s easier to talk to someone when you persist to establish a speaking relationship with a person that really cares.So, your telling God your burdens and joys helps bond your relationship with God. Figuring out that God wants to hear from you and to share all your joys, pains and thoughts with you is the first step to establishing that relationship. And you can build on it by reading about how much God cares in spiritual literature or religious texts, such as the Bible, Quran or Torah.

, Talking to God as a tremendous friend is different from just praying to God as a need or duty. As with a friend, you expect back-and-forth communication by noticing how God answers, helps or teaches you. While prayer may be more of a one-way transaction, talking implies a conversation.


You can talk to God out loud or inside your mind, whichever feels most effective to you.
It may be best to find a quiet or private space you can occupy in order to concentrate while you’re talking. If you can’t, it’s okay to talk silently to God while you’re standing in the checkout line at the grocery store, sitting in a waiting room, or while you’re at work or school, etc.

, Talk to God similarly as you would, if a physical person were standing in front of you. You can talk to God about your daily troubles, your thoughts at the moment, your hopes and dreams, and even tell Him (and tell yourself) the things for which you’re thankful. You can tell God about casual or hard topics just as you would with a concerned friend.


Let’s say for example you were having an ongoing argument with a friend. You could say, “God, I’m not sure what else to say to Charlie. We’ve been arguing for almost two weeks now and we still can’t come to an agreement. I don’t want to think we can’t get through this, but I don’t know what more to do or say.”
Ever been amazed by a crazy, beautiful day? Talk to God about His gifts to you. “Wow, God! It’s so beautiful outside. I’d love to spend the day reading in the park.”
Maybe you have a difficult relationship with a family member: “I hate that my mom and I don’t get along. She just doesn’t understand me, and she refuses to listen when I try to tell her how I really feel. I pray that she would try to see things from my point of view sometimes. And, help me to to be patient, listen and understanding to her.”

, You may not get an audible response like you would, if a friend were physically standing in front of you. But you can receive a response from God in the written word of God or from the sermon of a minister. Anticipate it to also come in the form of an intuition, an inspiration, a scripture, a situation or an event that directly or indirectly relates to what you’ve been talking about to God.

, You may not find what you want when you want it, but He does everything for His reason.

, But, realize that whatever happens may be a result of a ""third person(s)"" involved in their self-centered, personal actions/inaction, or their doing the opposite of some of your ideas and needs. God does not necessarily contravene or interfere with the behavior of disagreeable parties -- Why? They, having free will as you do, might not follow love, good morals, the purposes of God, nor stop their misconduct that can involve you. Events could, thus, depend regrettably on their dangerous/uncaring intersections with your hopeful and peaceful path. Even in dire events one can talk to God, in the darkest day or when you pass through the valley of death. You need not fear, but may cry out to Him while trusting God, come what may.

Consider a change of scenery.,
Consider a change of attitude.,
Get help.",How to Save Yourself1," A bad situation can be hard to stomach, even if you're not quite sure what's wrong. If something just doesn't feel right, start interrogating yourself and getting specific about your condition and your circumstances. What's ""off"" about your life? What needs to be changed? Ask yourself the following questions to try to start narrowing down signs that you might be in a bad situation you need to be saved from.


Are you worried about your safety? Are you consistently stressed out about basic concerns, like where your next meal will be coming from, whether or not you'll make it through the day? If you're in a violent or dangerous situation, you might need to take drastic steps to change your life.
Are you in a fulfilling relationship? Are you with someone that supports you and makes you feel good about yourself? try to figure out if your romantic life might be the cause of your problems. There's better out there.
Are you happy at your job? Do you like your boss and coworkers? Do you spend more time having fun, or stressing about work? try to figure out if your job might be the problem in your life.;
, Surrounding yourself with negative, violent, or self-destructive people is a fast-track to a difficult situation. While it can be hard to make a break from friends and loved ones who can't take care of themselves, if it's affecting you to the point of crisis, you've got to learn when it's time to cut your losses. Identify toxic or enabling relationships and end them. Save yourself from bad influences.


try to focus not on ending bad relationships but on starting new ones. Spend time with people you enjoy, people who will support your and lift you up. People who spend their time doing constructive and positive things.
If you've taken big steps to cut addictive behaviors or substances from your life, but have lots of friends who haven't, it can be hard to maintain those relationships. Focus on finding new friends who do more uplifting and positive things with their time.

, In some cases, it might not be possible to save yourself from where you're living. Whether it be a town that doesn't offer the career options you want, a violent neighborhood that keeps you in fear, or a bad domestic life that you need to escape from, make a leap of faith and move. Move out.


Go somewhere you know people who'll be able to help you make the transition. Look up distant relatives or old friends from school who might be able to put you up for a couple days while you look for new work and find a place of your own.
Start saving now to start putting your plan into effect. If you can't afford to move right now, you can still start helping yourself. Even just the act of saving up and doing the research of finding that next step can help to alleviate the negativity of being stuck where you are.

, Every teenager who ever lived, Paris and Pittsburgh, has wanted nothing more than to escape to the glitter and the glamour that exists somewhere else. Everyone who works a job, great or dead-end, has an afternoon that never ends, a week from hell, an epic chewing-out from the boss. Learning to differentiate between a circumstance that needs to change and a need for a change in attitude is a big step in growing as a person, becoming more mature, and learning to save yourself.Imagine the source of your problems is gone from your life forever. How would your life be different? Would it? If so, make the change. If not, fix yourself.


If you've got the moving itch, make sure place is really the source of your problems. Is your town really as bad as you make it out? Would everything really be fixed if you moved to wherever? Or is the problem actually elsewhere? Don't outrun your problems, lest they pack their own bags to meet you there.

, No one should have to pull themselves out of a tough situation alone. Whether something as dire as getting out of a toxic relationship or as complicated as applying to graduate schools, learning to transcend your current condition and move to a better place requires the aid of others. Surround yourself with positive people and ask for their assistance when you need it.


If you're living in a violent situation, get help immediately. Visit a domestic violence center in your area or call 1-800-799-SAFE to get help. You don't deserve to live in fear.Talk to family, friends, teachers, and people you respect and tell them you need help in changing your condition. Get advice. Sometimes it can be hard to identify the sources of your problems when you're so close to them. Listen, without being defensive, and trust in the wisdom of others.

Write to God as a form of communication.,
Purchase or find a blank writing notebook and pen.,
Find a quiet and private space to write.,
Write for a specific amount of time.,
Write fast and freely.,
Write to God as if you’re writing a letter to a friend, or as if you’re writing in a private journal.",How to Talk to God2," Maybe you feel uncomfortable talking out loud to God, find it difficult to concentrate when talking to God in your mind, or maybe neither of the two work for you at all. If that’s the case, try writing to God. This form of communicating will still enable you to express your thoughts for a connection and create your side of a conversation with God.

, Choose something that will feel comfortable to write in every day. A spiral notebook or journal would be an ideal choice since it will easily lay flat on a desk. Select your preferred writing tool.


You’ll want to write to God by hand instead of typing on a computer. Computers have endless distractions, and for some the act of typing requires more conscious effort than scribbling in a notebook., Even though you won’t be speaking aloud, it’s still best to find a quiet spot for maximum concentration.

, Before you get started set a timer for a length of time that feels comfortable to write for. You may set it for five, ten or twenty minutes. Keep your pen or pencil moving until the timer goes off.

, Try not to be self-conscious about what you write. Don’t worry about grammar and punctuation, or about what you’re actually writing. In writing to God, you want your words to come from the heart. In order to do that you’ll need to relax enough that you can write freely about whatever comes to mind.

, If you’re not sure what to write about, consider writing about a current concern that you can’t stop thinking about. Write about what’s happening in your day to day life. Write down any questions you want God to answer for you. Or write about your goals or what you’re thankful for. Use the examples below for inspiration.


“Dear God, I have no idea what I’m doing in my life right now. I can’t seem to make good choices or meet the right people. I feel like I’m drowning in drama. When will this end? When will things change for me?”
“I can’t even contain my excitement right now, God. Today I met a woman who works at my dream job. Our meeting was completely serendipitous. I mean what are the chances of meeting just the right person randomly on a busy street? If I didn’t accidentally bump her shoulder and if she didn’t happen to drop her purse, I never would have gotten a glimpse of her business card. You’ve truly answered my prayers.”

What kind of things get you fired up talking about?
What would you be willing to sacrifice your life for?
If your home was on fire, assuming all living beings had been rescued, what three items would you want to take with you?
What aspects of your community or the world would you like to change?

;
, To further direct your path, do a visualization exercise. Visualization can be a powerful tool to clarify our desires and move us closer to obtaining them. Spend some time imagining who you would like to be in 5, 10, or 15 years.Go someplace quiet where you can sit without distractions. Close your eyes. Picture in your mind’s eye yourself at a specific point in the future (e.g. 1 year or 5 years). Imagine that you are at the peak of success during this time. You have realized all your goals.
What are you doing in this vision? What is your career? What kind of lifestyle do you have? Who are you surrounded by? What do you do for fun?
Absorb this image fully. Then, grab some paper and write out some details about it. What skills or strengths do you need to make this vision a reality? How can you gain these skills?

, It’s often said that most people overestimate what they can do in a year, but underestimate what they can do in a day. True enough, life consists of weeks, months, and years. However, you get there day by day. Think about the kinds of things you do daily. Do these actions or habits line up with your ultimate goals?, After you have spent time envisioning your dreams and assessing what you are doing daily, you can develop an action plan to bring you closer to where you want to be. What can you do today to get you closer where you want to be tomorrow? Set SMART goals that you can break down into smaller steps. That way, you can take some positive action towards reaching your goals every day.For example, perhaps in the visualization exercise you saw yourself running your own business. Your ultimate goal may be to “Be an entrepreneur,” but that’s a lofty goal to take on all at once.
Break your goals down. You might need to “Develop a business idea/plan,” “Secure investors,” or “Rent a location” to house your business. These steps may serve as starting places to move you closer to the larger goal.

Prepare the room.,
Relax your mind, and seek a place of calm.,
Relax your body.,
Prepare yourself.,
Begin your journey.,
Walk down your hallway.,
Welcome a past life.,
Be patient.,
Accept what you see.,
Return to the present.",How to Remember Your Past Lives1," Make sure the temperature is not too warm or too chilly. Draw the curtains, turn off the TV or radio, turn off your phone, and if you have a noise generator, turn it on just loud enough to mask any outside sounds. Try one of these settings:


White noise. It sounds like a TV tuned to no channel.
Brown noise. This brings to mind the sound of ocean waves in the distance.;
, Sit or recline in a quiet, darkened room.Away from friends and loved ones. Choose a time when you are alert and your body and mind are calm. If you are hungry,distracted or if you have a song stuck in your head ,you'll have a hard time focusing.

, Kick back on your bed, or wherever you’ve chosen to conduct your self-hypnosis, and simply relax for a few minutes to prepare for your journey.

, Close your eyes, and get comfortable. Lie on your back, with your hands at your sides, and bathe yourself with a protective light:


Imagine a white, enveloping light all around you. See it in your mind’s eye, shining on your feet, your legs, your knees, your thighs, your torso and arms, your neck, your face, your head. This white light is protecting you from all negative influences. It represents love and warmth and enlightenment in a dazzling mistiness all around you, cocooning you in its brilliance, protecting you from anything bad.
See it in your mind. Feel its warmth, and invite it to wash over you. Repeat to yourself, either in words or intent, ""I am breathing in powerful protective energy. This energy is building an aura of protection around me. This aura protects me at all times in every way.""

Say this to yourself five times for five inhales. After this, just concentrate on visualizing and feeling the energy, making it brighter and more powerful. Take the next color that comes to mind, and repeat until you feel ready to take the next step.

, Imagine yourself in a long hallway, with a large door at the end. See this hallway in as much detail as you can, whatever comes to mind.


Your hallway may be all gold and filigree, or Gothic like a cathedral, entirely constructed from gemstones, or a forest floor with a bower of branches arching over you—the choice is yours.
Whatever hallway you construct in your mind, use it each time you seek a past life. Imagine this hallway with the expectation that when you get to the end, when you reach the big door and turn the knob, you will discover a past life.

, Take each step down that hallway with purpose. See your feet touch the ground, visualizing every aspect of your journey as you approach the large door—the smell of the room, the sounds of your environment, the color of the light, even the ""smell"" of your surroundings.


When you finally reach the end—when you feel you are ready and not a moment before—take hold of the doorknob. See yourself doing it, feeling the texture of the knob, and the sound of the mechanism as you turn it. When the bolt is disengaged, take a breath, and give the door a gentle push.

, Accept the very first thing you see on the other side of that door as something from your previous planes of existence.


It might be something as abstract as the color yellow, or as clear and vivid as a much-loved child nestled in your arms. Take whatever you see as the foundation. Build upon it. Feel it. Hold the imagery in your mind and open up to it, accepting anything that arises in your mind.
You might find that ""yellow"" becomes a carpet. As you walk deeper into your vision, you might discover that yellow is sunshine spilling onto a carpet. Perhaps you'll suddenly realize that carpet is in a London house...and so on.
You may doubt yourself at this point, but be reassured, you are remembering a past life.

, If you see nothing, try thinking about something you've always enjoyed, a favorite hobby, skill, or travel destination. You may ask yourself, ""Why do I like this? Can this be past-life related?""


If you still get nothing, try the shoe method: look down at your feet, and go with the first pair of shoes you see yourself wearing, and work from there. You might see sandals, and then realize you’re wearing a tunic. You might see little pointy shoes, and realize you’re wearing a big silk gown.
If you find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife, and you wonder how you got there, you've slipped into a Talking Heads song. Smile and continue exploring.
Once you’ve remembered something—even if it's just a pair of shoes—and if you’re pretty certain there’s a grain of truth to it, you can start your next meditation from there. Always begin each session with something you’ve already seen. Always work from the known to the unknown.

, It will seem like you are inventing these images. Sometimes you are, and you must accept that as part of the process of trying to remember a past life.


These visions almost always have a shred of truth at their core. You will only know for certain when you’ve done a significant number of past-life meditations, and you begin to see patterns and details repeated over and over again.
In the meantime, you must choose to believe that what you see is genuine; if you don’t, you will never get anywhere. Your analytical mind will simply shoot down every image as a product of your overeager imagination.

, Unless you’ve had to remove yourself from an unpleasant memory, usually what will happen is that you will simply run out of steam. You will find the images have stopped coming, or your analytical mind has been inadvertently triggered by something you’ve seen...and then you’re done. You have no choice but to open your eyes.


If this doesn’t happen, and you're ready to return to the current life, simply imagine that doorway where you began. Open the door, and walk down the length of that gemstone hallway—or whatever you visualized—and tell yourself that when you reach the start point, you will be refreshed, and that you will remember your past life in perfect detail and clarity.

Identify your self-destructive tendencies.,
Identify your emotional triggers.,
Remove and replace the destructive stimuli.,
Learn self reliance.,
Control the inner critic.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.",How to Save Yourself2," If you're your own worst enemy, it's time to start getting real. How do you manage to keep getting in your own way? Before you start coming up with a plan to save yourself, it's important to get a real sense of what it is that needs to change.


Do you struggle with apathy? Does a Saturday afternoon full of promise turn into a YouTube spiral, an Xbox session, and a nap? Maybe you need to get motivated.
Do you struggle with addiction? If a substance or activity has a grip on your life, you don't have to live with it or face it alone. Start dealing with your addiction and take control of your own life.
Do you struggle with low self-esteem? You should be able to rely on yourself, not have to fear your self, critique yourself, and drag yourself down. If you have trouble being positive, your self-esteem might need to be addressed.
Do you take too many risks that don't pan out? If you're a gambler, someone who gets a thrill from the possibility of danger, of consequence, or of failure, it's likely you'll come up short more often than not. While there's nothing wrong with a little thrill in your life, if you're taking dangerous risks that are affecting your safety, you might need to take steps to save yourself from it.

, What sets you off down a self-destructive path? Whether it be a person, a circumstance, or an idea, it's important to learn to recognize the things that trigger your self-destructive or spiraling behavior so you can start to cut it off before it takes hold. Pay attention to when you feel sudden urges and interrogate yourself at those moments. Write it down if necessary.

, When you've identified the things in your life that trigger negative emotional responses, replace them with positive behaviors. try to reprogram your mental pathways toward positivity and grace, as opposed to self-destruction and depression. It's easier than you think.If dwelling on your relationship with your emotionally-abusive father makes you want to take a drink, learn to beat yourself to the punch. When you start focusing on thoughts of your father, head the gym. Hit the heavy bag for a couple hours. Blow off some steam.
If you struggle with apathy and self-esteem issues, start celebrating each little achievement and taking steps to develop your self-respect. Start exercising and taking more risks. Treat yourself as you want to be treated.

, Take responsibility for yourself and start taking care of yourself. It's ok to rely on others for help every now and then, but there's also a time for pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Start helping yourself.


If you're living at home above the age that it's appropriate to live at home, it might be time to move out. While that can be a great way of saving money after college, it can't be an excuse for not working. Take a step and grow up.
Don't ask for help with things that you can do yourself. If your computer is acting up, you could call your friend in tears and fall apart, or you could try to figure it out on your own. Respect yourself enough to figure it out.

, The cool police, the criticism cops, the guilty conscience. Whatever you want to call it, you've got to learn to control the little voice inside you that needles you with negativity. A conscience is an essential part of being a moral person, but it can also drive you into the ground with feelings of guilt, of remorse, and of self-loathing. It might be unwise to ignore your conscience altogether, but learn to control it. Learn to use it when it's necessary and when to let it fade into the background.Start anticipating what will make you feel guilty later. You won't need to worry about a guilty conscience after the fact if you listen to it before the fact. If it will make you feel guilty later to send that text, or to take that drug, don't do it.

, You can't and shouldn't have to do everything alone. Learn to surround yourself with people who'll hold you up, who'll support you, who'll reinforce the good parts of you and make the bad parts seem distant.


Avoid toxic relationships and enablers. People who reinforce the parts of you that need worked on might need to be cut from your life. While it might be difficult, cultivating healthier relationships can help to keep you safe from temptation.

Embrace the big questions.,
Place your faith in the power of some guiding hand.,
Talk to and learn from other believers.,
Consider embracing a formal religion.",How to Save Yourself3," If you suspect you might have a desire for knowledge and for satisfaction that can't be easily answered, you might need to turn to deeper questions to find solace.Whether you consider yourself a spiritual person or not, considering the big questions can lead many people to a new sense of purpose and fulfillment, helping to realign priorities and perspectives. Why are we here? What does it mean to lead a good life? Embrace the difficulty and the mystery of these questions.

, Whether you want to call it ""god"" or not, learning to give up some of your ego and embrace the idea of a higher power can be a powerful experience for a lot of people. It can be enough to save yourself.


If you're not interested in religion, that doesn't mean you can't find a way to live faithfully and with a deep sense of purpose. Physicists, artists, and people in lots of different fields are serious to the point of deep spirituality regarding knowledge. Throw yourself into something entirely and find redemption in work.

, An essential part of any religious practice is worshipping with like-minded believers. To learn more about whatever purpose, practice, or religion you're thinking of adopting, the best way to learn isn't from a book or from a video, but from real interactions with other believers. try to practice as they practice and bring your questions and concerns to the table. Deepen your questions into beliefs and a daily practice that you can comfort yourself with.


Spiritual practice should be a daily activity. Even if you only go to church once a week, or if you choose not to go to church at all, try to build some kind of daily devotion into your life. Meditating for a few minutes every day can help you keep you tied back into those deep questions you're interested in.

, If you want to grow in your renewed sense of purpose and your interest in the divine, it may be appropriate to devote yourself to an organized religion. Start by learning as much as you can about different modes of worship and experimenting with different theologies and schools of thought to find one that fits you and your beliefs. Take the next step. Learn more about joining different religions here:

Set aside time to pray to God.,
Find a quiet room or space to pray.,
Prepare for prayer.,
Decide what you want to pray about.,
Pray in a way that feels natural to you.,
Pray with others.",How to Talk to God3," Prayer can be considered a more formal way to talk to God because it is primarily rooted in religion. However, you can choose to pray in whatever way feels comfortable to you. While you can pray at any time and in any place, it helps to set aside specific times of the day to pray. Choose a time when you are unlikely to be disturbed and you'll be able to center yourself and pray effectively. Common times for prayer include: before meals or bed, after waking, during stressful times or periods of need, and during solo activities like exercising or a commute.

, Ideally, praying to God should occur in a place where you'll be able to tune out distractions during the few minutes it takes to pray.


If you can't find a quiet place to pray, don't worry. You can pray on busy city buses, in the middle of crowded restaurants, and anywhere you can center yourself. You can pray while you're driving down the highway, as long as you stay focused on the road while you pray.

, As you get ready to pray, some people like to take a few minutes to prepare the space and the self for communicating with God. The way that you choose to prepare for prayer will largely be up to your own personal preferences and/or religious traditions.


Some common practices might include: reading a few applicable verses of a religious text, lighting candles or incense, performing a cleansing ritual, taking communion, meditating quietly, chanting, or singing.

, This can be done beforehand, if there is a pressing matter happening in your life. Or it can be determined as you pray.


You could use prayer as a means to have a casual conversation with God about daily happenings or current events. Here’s an example, “God, today is my first day of class. I’m really nervous, but also excited. I pray that everything goes well today.”
You could use prayer as a way to confess or get something off your chest, or you could pray for a request or a need. “God, I feel horrible that I gossiped about a coworker. I’m afraid she’s found out, and I don’t know what to do to fix it. Please forgive me. Also, please give me the strength to ask her for forgiveness.”
Let’s say you’ve just interviewed for a job. You could say, “Thank you, God, for a great interview. Please let the interviewer see how perfect I am for this position, and decide to hire me.”

, There's no one right way to pray. Prayer should be unique to the individual believer who is praying. While praying in a church or worship center is often quite stylized and ritualized, when you're praying alone, you don't have to follow any particular rules, other than opening yourself up to God and speaking from the heart.


Some people like to bow their heads in prayer and close their eyes, while other religions will practice full prostrations or kneeling. Whatever seems most respectful and effective for you and your personal relationship with God is fine. You can pray with your eyes open and your head high just as its fine to pray kneeling and silent.
It's common to recite some traditional prayers out loud, but it's also very common to pray silently to yourself.

, It can be a powerful experience to pray with a group of like-minded individuals. This can be an excellent way to hear how others relate to God, and learn new traditions and rituals that you can integrate into your own prayer practice. If you don’t currently have a group to pray with, try to find one.


You can find a group in a local worship center or church you attend. You can do a search online for people who share your beliefs to see if there are meetups happening in your area. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, consider starting your own prayer group.
In some religions, prayer groups practice sending group prayers to friends and loved ones in need. Prayer lists are often created regularly to pray for the sick and needy members of a community.

Go on a retreat.,
Learn something new.,
Play.,
Clean up your diet.,
Spruce up your home.,
Read more.,
Compliment yourself.,
Volunteer.,
Meditate daily.",How to Restart Your Life2," One small way to hit the reset button is by participating in a retreat. Depending on your specific circumstances, there are retreats to suit virtually every preference. A retreat offers you the chance to depart from your everyday environment for a few days or longer in order to regroup and gain a new perspective or sense of inspiration for your life.


Retreats can serve a general or specific purpose. For example, a retreat may be hosted especially for writers, married couples, fitness enthusiasts or those looking to improve their diets., If your daily life feels uninspiring, you may need to invigorate your brain cells with a challenge. A pick-me-up in the form of a new skill or hobby could be just what you need to refresh your schedule.Sign up for an evening class to learn a new language, ballroom dancing, master French cuisine, or train in martial arts. Maybe you once enjoyed running or sewing, but stopped. Reflect on passions you used to enjoy and pick them back up. Whatever you do, find some way to challenge yourself and jazz up your routine.

, Life can start to feel colorless if you spend all your time working or attending to responsibilities. Burnout from work or caregiving can cause chronic stress that threatens not only your mindset, but your health, too. Assess your daily schedule to see what tasks you can cut out or cut down to make more room for fun.


Include some time each day for play. This may translate to throwing a ball to your dog, tickling your kids, playing a video or board game, or watching a comedy film.
Take note of how you feel when you make more time for fun in your life., Indulging on processed or fast foods, sodas, caffeinated beverages, or alcohol can worsen your mood and outlook on life. These foods and beverages make you cranky and affect your sleep quality—two things that contribute to how you feel in day-to-day life. Counteract the negative effects of poor dietary choices by making a commitment to eat cleaner. This small change could have resounding benefits on your health and well-being.

Cut out salty, sugary, and caffeinated foods for a plant-based diet. Make fruits, veggies, legumes, and whole grains the foundation of your diet. Also, drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day to properly hydrate your body.

, Your environment impacts your mood. If your home is cluttered, dull, or decorated in a way that does not reflect your personality, you may want to hit the reset button on home décor.

Let the light in by opening blinds or hanging up sheer curtains. Organize clutter by researching creative storage solutions. Donate old clothes, books, records. Paint the walls if you can, and hang up artwork that inspires you.

, Technology is the top choice for entertainment these days. Too much TV, web-browsing, or social media can jeopardize your health if you are sedentary. Plus, making comparisons on social media often leave people feeling depressed about their own lives. Take a detox from these sources of information.

Visit a library or bookstore and select a book in your favorite genre. Or, if you prefer, download a book on your tablet or ereader. Make a vow to read for at least 30 minutes each night before bed.

, If you view your life as dull, there’s a chance you’ve been engaging in self-defeating thought patterns. When you feel uninspired by your life, instead of looking outward to the possibilities, you may beat yourself up for not being where you want to be. You can instantly feel better about yourself by taking time to acknowledge the positives.


Take a few minutes each day—whether in the morning or at night—to compliment yourself. You might say things like “You are such a caring person” or “I love my smile.” For extra points, do it in front of a mirror.

, Perhaps you feel like you have been behaving selfishly or are taking your good fortune for granted. A wonderful way to reboot your inner humanity is by giving. Seek out opportunities in your community where you can be of service to others.


Volunteerism can equate to many different actions. It could mean starting a regular commitment with a non-profit organization, or it could simply be doing kind things for others when you have spare time. Read for children at the library. Offer to walk your neighbor’s dog. Help your disabled family member keep their home tidy. Think of ways you can help those around you.

, Sometimes, a life reset means slowing down and enjoying the present moment. You may feel like you are always running from place to place and never have time to just be. Mindfulness meditation is a beneficial practice that helps you become more aware of the present moment.Start by setting aside just 5 minutes each day to sit in silence. Close your eyes or focus on a neutral spot a few feet in front of you. Breathe in deeply through your nose. Hold the breath for a few seconds. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on your breath or the spot in front of you. If you notice your attention wandering, bring your focus back and continue breathing.

Drop unhealthy or unproductive habits.,
Go back to school or change careers.,
Move to a new place.,
Improve your appearance.,
End toxic relationships.,
Develop a financial wellness plan.",How to Restart Your Life3," If you are in the market for a major life overhaul, you may want to start with some of your habits. Habit change is a serious undertaking. However, when you replace negative habits with positive ones, you will notice your life starting to change for the better.


Pick out a habit that has been holding you back from reaching your goals or being the best version of yourself. Poor habits may include swearing, lying, cheating, excessively drinking alcohol, smoking, watching too much TV, drinking too much alcohol, being late, or procrastinating.
The best way to break a bad habit is to find a positive one to replace it. For instance, if you want to stop watching so much TV, you might find another activity you could do during this time like reading, coloring, or working on a puzzle. Create a reward system so that you reinforce you choosing the other activity over TV.For more serious habits like drugs, alcohol, or binge-eating, you may need to seek professional assistance., Suffering from burnout or lack of inspiration at work can lead to dissatisfaction in many other areas of life. If you don’t like what you are doing for a living, come up with a feasible plan to advance in your chosen field or switch fields altogether.

Career counseling may help you narrow down a career path of interest.You might also learn information about your career aspirations by reexamining your values and the best possible future self exercise.

, If your hometown lacks opportunity, culture, or other features that are important to you, it may be time to relocate. Or, maybe you love your current job, but don’t enjoy the daily commute. Talk with your family, partner, or close friends to help you decide whether moving could be the right choice for you., If you feel like you are stuck in a style rut, pressing the reset button may include a makeover. It’s up to you how big you want the change to be. If you feel like your wardrobe is out of date or colorless, go shopping for some newer pieces that flatter your body. Include some pops of color to brighten things up.


On the other hand, an appearance change could also involve getting a haircut, losing weight, getting your teeth whitened, or wearing makeup., Rebooting your life also includes your social connections. If you are surrounded by unsupportive people who mistreat you or fail to appreciate you, it’s time to nix those relationships. A spouse that verbally abuses you, a friend who always cancels at the last minute, or a boss who fails to recognize your contributions can all affect your life satisfaction.Think carefully about how each person in your life makes you feel. Cut out negative influences and expand your circle to include positive people. If you aren’t able to completely terminate certain relationships, get as much distance as you can.

Meet new people by joining clubs or organizations, taking a class, or connecting with people at work.

, If you have been spending exorbitantly, or are struggling to meet your basic needs, you may need to reboot your relationship with money. Start by developing a monthly budget that factors in all of your expenses and luxuries to figure out where your money is going. Then, devise a plan to either cut back on spending or increase your income to save more."

Visit a hypnotherapist.,
Congratulations!",How to Remember Your Past Lives2," Sometimes, past life regression requires tools that we are unable to master—self-hypnosis, for example, can be very difficult. Certified hypnotherapists who specialize in past life regression have been trained in the necessary fields. Here's how you can expect them to direct you:


They may play music as they talk you into a relaxed state, making you feel safe, warm, and comfortable. Let yourself follow along, and find your inner calm.
Clear your mind of directed thought, and let whatever comes to you happen naturally.
Relax your muscles in your body, especially your neck and shoulders letting the tension release.
As you relax deeper, they may talk about the light, letting it flow through you, reaching into every part of your body, until it totally surrounds you.
Once you are prepared and totally relaxed, they will open the doors to your many past lives by guiding you back through time.
They'll encourage you to explore your memories, with as much detail as you recall.
They may take you back to the womb, and talk you through being reborn in a past life.
When you've discovered your past life, they will guide you through it, encouraging you to feel it as you remember it, only this time when you awake, you'll have full knowledge of your past.
When you're session draws to the close, the hypnotherapist will slowly bring your back to the present reality and your current life.

, You have just experienced your past life.

Become spiritual.",How to Remember Your Past Lives3," For some, past lives are not so much a place you go, but part of who you are. Many cultures throughout mankind's history have held reincarnation as central to their beliefs.


While Islam and Christianity don't believe in re-incarnation, Hinduism, some Jews, and some Buddhists do. The best thing to do is not to completely devote yourself to a religion, as religions can be very restrictive; but rather to discover your own path. Find your own spiritual truths.

Aim for a healthy lifestyle.,
Try to be a better person.,
Stay on the path.",How to Practice Spirituality and Stay On the Path," Finding a spiritual guru will make the path of spirituality a little less complicated as he can guide you throughout the journey. You could ask any of your religious friends/ family if they recommend anyone or simply read up on the spiritual organisations which will help you take the right decision.;
, Today we are surrounded by various meditation centres and you could join any one of your choice. Learning meditation is the most crucial step to walk the path of spirituality. With the help of various meditation techniques, you could be able to identify one form which works best for you and start practicing it. On the other hand, if you do not want to spend your dollars, you can always learn new methods online.

, Reading leads to knowledge and to develop a keen interest in spirituality, we need to educate ourselves a little before hand. This will not only answer some of your questions but will also motivate you for your spiritual quest of life.

, Meditation is like clearing the clutter of our minds and trying to reach a state of nothingness. Practice makes perfect and specially when we want to quiet the mind. Even if its for 15 minutes, take out time during the day and sit. You may have to force yourself in the beginning, as our monkey mind has a habit of jumping from one place to another. Your mind might wander, but bring it back slowly. This should not demotivate you to meditate because it will be harder to resume again, once you stop it.

, Just as reading books is important, similarly spiritual discourses keeps our interest in this subject stimulated. You even have various videos on spiritual discourses online.

, Walking on the spiritual path not only requires mental discipline but to a great extent physical discipline as well. A healthy mind leads to a healthy body and vice verse. Exercising, eating well and avoiding stimulants like drugs and alcohol is the right approach to a healthy lifestyle. Physical activities release feel good chemicals in our brain, build self confidence and lead to our mental well being. Our body is the temple of our soul so take care of it.

, It has been rightly said that 'Actions speak louder than words'. Philosophizing something and giving expert advice to people is one thing but doing what you believe in is quite another. We all have a few personality issues to address. Try to work on them. If your anger is a cause of concern for you and your loved ones, practice patience. If your ego takes the better of you, Try to empathize with others. Learn to give; offer your help to those who need it- emotional, physical or financial. And remember, you cannot change yourself overnight. It takes a great deal of patience and perseverance to be the person you strive to be.

, Last but not least, you need to be determined to achieve anything and losing focus may take you back to where you started. Be persistent in your pursuit.

Molecular nanotechnology weapons (MNT for short). MNT is a technology formed on the ability to create structures to atomic specifications by mechanosynthesis. Weapons made with MNT could be less than an inch big, yet have the intelligence of a supercomputer. This risk would most likely occur in 10 to 20 years.
Wars. As simple as it sounds, a nuclear war that would most likely end up being World War III is very real. Military planners are creating concrete attack plans against Russia that include deploying missile systems and NATO ground forces in Ukraine. Although it does seem odd, some of these projects could destroy human values and turn people into unconscious zombies. YUCK! This risk would most likely occur in 5 to 7 years.

But an extreme EMP event could turn the world into an oven. Kind of like The Scorch Trials and The Kill Order by James Dashner.

, There are typically three types of preppers: Lifestyle, Passion, and Hobby. If you make prepping a lifestyle, you're going to spend LOTS of money and time on this. It becomes almost your second job, and most people have an extra room full of food, water, and other supplies. Making it a passion means you'll still spend an incredible amount of time on prepping, but you may find yourself trying to get cheaper items that may not protect you as well. The last level of prepping is just a hobby. Every once in a while, you go out and get a couple of cans of beans and vegetables. You store away one case of water, maybe two, and have a few weapons. Not much time or money is spent.

, Make sure you know when you are going to prep. If you work or have school during the day, wake up just an hour earlier and prep. Or, if you work out in the morning or can't possibly wake up at 5:00, go at night. Right after dinner and before shops close down can also be great, because there's no rush hour.

, A bug out bag is a big backpack or other type of bag that you have ready in case of an emergency. The safest bet during Doomsday is to bug in, but if the inevitable happens, a bug out bag should have everything you'd need to survive outside. It's almost like an earthquake kit. Here's a list of the minimum items that should be in everyone's bug out bag:


At least 4 flashlights and extra batteries
Small books or other things to pass time
Bandaids. LOTS
Any special medications
Non-perishable food, enough to last at least one week
Enough water to last two weeks
A Swiss Army knife (or two)
A small gun and a large gun
Chapstick, sunscreen, and other protection against the elements
At least one extra pair of socks, underwear, jeans, shorts, tank top/ bra (obviously for girls), shirt, sweatshirt, jacket, beanie, and hat
ANYTHING else you could imagine needing in the wilderness!

, Especially if you are bugging out, having something to trade is ideal. Gangs that have formed and claimed territory will make you pay for crossing. And they won't let you leave without paying something, either. Good things to carry around with you and in your BOB are half-dollars, rare coins, cool rocks, and things that look expensive.

, You may want to gather a group, or at least your family, to bug out with. If so, or even if not, practicing where you will go and what you will do and who you will go with and everything else will benefit you. Hide money (if you can) in places along your route, as well as food. Plan out every little detail, from where you will go to what precautions you will take.

, If you read articles about EMPs, MNT, and nuclear wars, you'll know much more about Doomsday. Read about picking a lock, making weapons from rocks and sticks, and others. There are websites that feature ways to survive Doomsday, and even I go onto those and learn more.

Find others who do believe similarly to yourself.,
Often the problem of feeling left out or unaccepted is somewhat of a construct in your own mind.,
Know yourself and your own needs.,
Do not try to take on a discussion with a whole group of family or friends at once.,
Try not to use a holiday get-together as your opportunity to discuss differences with another for the first time.,
Avoid situations where the planned activities are going to disrupt you emotionally due to strong conflict with your beliefs.,
When you have an opportunity to open up a conversation around dissimilar beliefs you should try initially to discuss your position with as little emotion as possible.,
Once you have come to an agreement on a good time to talk with another, you should prepare yourself for the meeting.,
Once you meet with another try to let them have equal time to share their feelings and their position.,
Remind others of the importance to you of getting their approval.,
An important thing to remember is that with any difference, there are almost always, many, many similarities.,
Lastly, congratulations!",How to Overcome Family Pressure to Be in a Religion," Maybe you live in an area where there are few or no others who think exactly like you do. But somehow make a connection with another who feels or thinks very similarly and/or is very accepting to you as a person. This will bolster your own confidence in speaking up about your need to be accepted/respected by others. Often, once you have friends/family who believe similarly to yourself, you will feel supported enough to discuss openly your need for further social acceptance. Finding that accepting friend or family member might be achieved through seeking a social group or social network outside of your own neighborhood or family group.;
, If it is at all possible, openly ask the family and friends you have about their acceptance of your beliefs and values. If you can ask for a conversation, you are already on the road to coming to terms about what it means for you to believe differently and still be able to successfully seek social acceptance.Sometimes once you establish your stance on certain beliefs or norms, others are more accepting than you might have anticipated. At the very least, you will have established their viewpoint rather than your assumption.

, Whenever you recognize resistance or especially if you experience open hostility for your beliefs, you must evaluate your position. Recognize, establish and accept your own need for maintaining social connections despite differences of belief systems. This will help you decide how much you are willing to do on your end of the relationship.

, Usually, sorting out your relationships is easier to do one on one.

, Take an understanding friend with you to any gathering where there is going to be heavy symbolism and/or rituals that are specific to others belief systems. Try to keep yourself open minded in how you react to these outward demonstrations of faith or values. Think of how you would react if you were attending the rituals of a tribe or group in a foreign country.

, You must accept yourself, respect your own need for sanctity of your beliefs as a first step in having others understand and respect you. Discreetly avoiding specific situations will not always be a viable alternative, but it is one tool that you can use at times to prevent open conflict in family or group gatherings.

, Also, ask permission to discuss giving the other person a chance to establish some control over the discussion.

, Review your feelings about how having your own beliefs which differ has affected your existence in the family/group/community. Be ready to discuss how you feel, without allowing the emotional impact of that feeling interfere with expressing your stance clearly. This is a difficult step. But allowing yourself to become demonstrably emotional while asking for understanding, can foster a weakening of your position. It can make your decision to stay rooted in your own beliefs seem less firm.

, Let them express openly how your beliefs and your stance make them feel. It is healthy to give them compassionate understanding, as that is exactly what you are wanting to obtain from them in return.

, You are, in fact, endeavoring to speak up about not just your right to have separate and distinct beliefs. You also are speaking up about your need for family and community relationships to be warmly experienced.

, This is the way to build a relationship with another on a firm foundation. You must find, embrace and remind them often of how very similar you are to them in many ways.

, If you are attempting to follow these steps to improve your relationships with family or community members then you are a fantastic human being who recognizes the importance of familial and communal belonging! Social acceptance is one of our most basic needs!

Await a verdict.",How to Protect Your Freedom of Religion," Religious freedom in the United States is a constitutional right and can therefore be protected in the court system. Your freedom of religion can be protected outside of the court system as well. In either situation, a qualified civil rights lawyer will greatly increase your chances of successfully protecting your rights when they have been threatened and/or diminished.


If you are a part of an organized religion (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Islam), talk to your religious leaders about lawyers they may know. In addition, talk to other members of your faith about possible recommendations.
If you do not get any qualified recommendations, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. Using this service, you will be asked a series of questions about your legal problem and you will be put in contact with qualified lawyers in your area.
When you meet with candidates, be sure you ask about their past successes and whether they feel comfortable with the issues you are discussing. For example, if you are planning on going to court, find a lawyer comfortable going to trial. However, if you plan on filing administrative complaints, find a lawyer who practices administrative law.
Ask about fees and make sure you feel comfortable paying what is charged. While lawyers can be expensive, you usually get what you pay for.;
, In addition to hiring a lawyer, or as a way to find one, you should contact civil rights organizations with reputable track records of protecting religious freedoms. Civil rights organizations will often have staff lawyers who will take your case on a pro bono basis (for free) and they will vigorously fight for your rights. In addition, civil rights organizations often have very charismatic leaders who can bring your fight into the public light by talking to the media.


For example, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) actively seeks clients who have had their individual rights trampled.Contact the ACLU if you have questions about your religious rights.

, Pleading your case in front of the court of public opinion can be an effective way to gather support and help. While you need to be careful not to make any defamatory statements in the media because you might open yourself up to litigation, a tactful media strategy can be the difference between success and failure. If you have hired the ACLU, they will likely help you put together a media tour. In fact, the ACLU has their own media department.When you talk with the media, you should explain your complaint in clear and concise language. You should also make a plea for help from others who have experienced the same problems. When you do this, you will likely get phone calls, emails, and other correspondence from people willing to help.
Help may come in the form of donations to help you pay for legal costs, food and lodging if you have to travel, or legal help if you are not already receiving any. In addition, the more people that share your concern, the more traction your story will get.

, Whether your religious rights have been endangered or not, if you believe in the freedom of religion you can protect those rights by becoming an activist. An activist is someone who believes in a social cause and campaigns for that cause.In order to effectively campaign for religious freedom, you will have to understand the laws you are trying to effect. At its most basic level, religious freedoms are protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The First Amendment has two religious clauses, and countless federal and state laws protect those religious freedoms.


The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from encouraging or promoting religion. Under the Establishment Clause, your religious rights may be diminished if government promoted a religion that is not yours.
The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment gives you the right to worship or not however you choose. Here, your rights may be infringed if you are unable to worship due to a government law or policy.The laws passed by federal, state, and local governments must all adhere to these constitutional principals. If they do not, they will likely be found unconstitutional by a court.

, Another way to fight for religious freedom is to write letters to your state and federal representatives and make your beliefs known. These letters can be particularly persuasive considering you are the individual voting these people into office. If they do not listen to your concerns, they may not win reelection. You can write your legislators as well as your executives (i.e., the President and governor).


When you write a letter to your representatives, state your purpose up front and be very clear about what you want your representative to do. For example, if there is a bill being debated in the senate that you believe diminishes your religious freedoms, you might write a letter to your senator letting them know you want them to oppose the bill.

, Prior to filing a lawsuit, you may choose (or be required) to file a complaint with a state or federal agency. Agencies are departments tasked with making rules and executing the laws of a state or the federal government. By filing an agency complaint, you may get the relief you seek without ever going to court. However, in some circumstances, you are required to file an agency complaint before you can file a lawsuit.


For example the Department of Justice (DOJ) gives you an opportunity to file a complaint if you feel your civil rights have been violated. To file a complaint, visit the DOJ website to determine what information you need to include and where your complaint needs to be sent. This information will vary depending on the type of complaint you choose to file.You are required to file a complaint, for example, if you are alleging employment discrimination based on your religious beliefs (e.g., being fired for wearing a hijab). In the employment discrimination realm, you must file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC will analyze your complaint and if they find sufficient evidence of discrimination, they will issue you a ""right to sue"" letter. Only when you have this letter will you be able to file a lawsuit., One way to ensure your religious freedoms are protected is to offer up a ballot initiative, if your state allows them. In California, for example, you can offer up a ballot initiative in order to propose and enact a law or an amendment to the California Constitution. To get a ballot initiative on the ballot next election, you will have to draft the legal language of your initiative and present it to the Secretary of State. Your initiative must also be certified by your local elected officials. Once this happens, you will need to go out and get a certain number of qualified voter signatures.When you meet these requirements, your initiative will be placed on the state ballot to be voted on in the next election. If your initiative passes, it will become law.

, If you only protect your own religious freedoms while other people's freedoms are being trampled, you will be setting a precedent to allow religious freedoms in general to be violated. If this happens, your religious freedoms could be violated in the future based on the precedent you set.


For example, if you are Jewish, you should also be vocal about Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and other religions. In the United States, freedom of religion means you are free to practice whatever religion you like.
Look for interfaith groups that work across religious lines to protect the broad freedom of religion. Get involved and do not focus on just one religion.

, When you decide to sue someone for diminishing your religious freedoms, the first important decision you will have to make is whether you will file your lawsuit in state or federal court. Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to choose or you may be required to file in one or the other. State courts are usually courts of general jurisdiction and can hear any case brought in front of them unless they are specifically barred from doing so. On the other hand, if you want to file your lawsuit in federal court you will have to meet one of two jurisdictional tests.


First, you can file in federal court if you are suing under a federal law, which includes the U.S. Constitution (i.e., federal question jurisdiction). For example, if you are suing an employer for employment discrimination, you might decide to sue under the federal law prohibiting those actions.
Second, you can file in federal court if you have diversity of citizenship. Here, you and the defendant must be citizens of different states and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000.If you can choose between the two, you should most likely choose to file in federal court. If you are suing based on a constitutional claim, or a federal law claim, the federal courts are much better equipped to handle your case.

, A lawsuit is started when a complaint is filed with the court. A complaint is a legal document that tells the judge and the defendant why you are suing someone, how the defendant violated the law, how you were injured, and what you want the court to do about it. Your complaint will include at least the following:The case caption, which includes the court where you are filing your complaint and the parties to the suit.
The jurisdictional basis, which tells the court why they can hear the case.
The nature of your suit and the cause of action (i.e., what law you are filing under and how you have been harmed).
Whether you want a jury.
Your request for relief, which is the dollar amount you are asking the defendant for.

, The summons is a document that demands that the defendant respond to your lawsuit. The summons is an already completed form and all you have to do is include the defendant's name, address, and the time limit in which they have to respond. The time frame a defendant must follow is laid out in state or federal rules of civil procedure. In most cases it is usually around 30 days., When you have completed your complaint and summons, you will take those forms to the courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts. In federal court, you can either file your case in-person or by email. If you can, file in-person. It will allow you to discuss your paperwork with the clerk of courts. Once the clerk of courts verifies your paperwork, he or she will ask you to pay a $400 filing fee (this fee may be more or less in state court).


If you can afford the fee and pay it when you file, your lawsuit will be stamped as ""filed"" and you will be assigned a judge and case number. Also, you will receive a summons with the court's stamp on it, which you will need when you serve the defendant.
If you cannot afford the fee, you must file a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, which asks the court to waive the fee. A judge will have to rule on this motion before your fee will be waived. If the motion is approved, your lawsuit will be stamped as ""filed"", you will be assigned a case number and judge, and you will receive an official summons from the court., You are required to notify the other party that they have been sued, and you do that by serving them with a copy of the complaint and summons. Under federal law, you have 120 days from when you file to serve the defendant. If you are in state court, you may have more or less time. Every defendant in your suit must be individually served. To serve the defendant, you will have someone personally hand the documents to the defendant or have them send the documents by certified mail.


If you are in state court, you can hire the sheriff's office to conduct service. If you are in federal court, you can get the U.S. Marshal's Service to conduct service if the court approves it., Once the defendant has been served, the person who served them will complete a return of service form. This form asks the server to verify that service was indeed completed. When this form is completed, it will be returned to you. You will have to file the completed form with the clerk of courts so the court knows service has been completed., If the defendant responds to your lawsuit, it will usually be in the form of an answer. An answer responds to each of your allegations by either admitting or denying them. In addition, the defendant may make cross-claims against you. If cross-claims are made against you, you will have to respond as if you were the defendant.


If a defendant fails to respond to your lawsuit, the court may enter a default judgment in your favor. When this happens, you will be awarded the relief you sought in your complaint., The first stage of litigation is discovery, which is when you and the defendant exchange information for the purpose of preparing for trial. During discovery you will learn the identity of witnesses and gather relevant documents. If the defendant does not comply with your discovery requests, you can file motions with the court to ask it to require the defendant to comply. In general, the following tools can be used during discovery in order to gather information:Depositions, which are in-person interviews with the defendant or other witnesses. These interviews are conducted under oath and answers given can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are written questions that a defendant or other witness is required to answer. The answers are written under oath and can be used in court.
Document requests, which are written requests for documents relevant to your case. Documents can include emails, internal memos, photographs, and graphs.
Requests for admissions, which ask the defendant to admit the truth of facts or the genuineness of documents.

, As soon as discovery concludes, most defendants will file a motion for summary judgment, which asks the court to decide the litigation before it gets to trial. In order to be successful, the defendant will have to prove there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court will make every assumption in your favor at this point.


You can defend against this motion by submitting your own evidence and affidavits that show the court there are facts in dispute that need to be decided at trial.
If you succeed in defending against this motion, the litigation will continue., At this point in the litigation, right before trial begins, you may want to attempt to settle your case in order to avoid the additional cost and time commitment of going to trial. When you attempt to settle, you and the defendant will get together and discuss what a reasonable award would be given the fact you are both winning if the case doesn't go to trial. The amount you settle for and the time you take attempting to come to an agreement will be based on how strong you think your case is. The stronger your case, the less likely it is you will settle for less than what you would get at trial. In addition to informal negotiations, you and the defendant might also take part in:


Mediation, which takes place when a neutral third party sits down with you and the defendant to discuss common ground and areas of agreement. The third party will not take sides and will not make any opinions about the case.
Arbitration, which takes place when a third party hears evidence from both parties and makes conclusions based on the evidence they hear. The third party will take sides here and will give you their opinion about the case.

, During your final pretrial hearings before trial begins, you and the defendant will meet with the judge to discuss how the trial is likely to proceed. The trial will be limited to the issues and claims brought up during this pretrial hearing., If your case goes to trial, you will have the opportunity to have it heard before a judge or before a jury. This decision must be made in your complaint. If you chose to waive your right to a jury, your case will be held in front of a judge who will make every substantive decision about your case. If you chose to have your case heard by a jury, you will take part in ""voire dire"", which is the process for choosing a jury. During voire dire you will have the opportunity to question potential jurors about their biases and ability to be impartial. If you think a juror is biased, you can ask to have them dismissed.


When a jury is chosen, they will be sworn in and the trial will begin., Your opening statement should outline the case you will make for the jury, or for the judge, and will provide a road map explaining your case. The opening statement is not a time to present evidence and you should not complicate things at this time. Your opening statement should be short and to the point.


Once you give your opening statement, the defendant will have an opportunity to do the same. However, the defendant can also choose to hold off and make a statement right before they present their case.

, When opening statements are complete, you will present you case by calling witnesses to the stand and introducing evidence through them. You will ask each witness questions and present evidence in accordance with the local rules of evidence.


When you are done questioning each witness, the defendant will have an opportunity to cross-examine them and try to poke holes in their testimony.

, Once your case has been presented and you have rested, the defense will have their opportunity to present their case. After the defendant questions each of their witnesses, you will have an opportunity to cross-examine them in order to call into question their testimony. You will do this by showing the witness was either untruthful or unreliable.


For example, if a defense witness stated one thing during direct examination, but the complete opposite during a deposition, you will want to bring this to light during cross examination.

, When you and the defendant have rested, you will have an opportunity to make a closing argument to the jury or judge. Your closing argument is an opportunity to go over the key points of your case, persuade the judge or jury you deserve to win, and to make any final points you need to make.


Once you make your closing statement, the defendant will have an opportunity to make one as well.

, When the trial is over, the jury or judge will deliberate about what they heard before making a final decision. After deliberations, the decision maker will make their decision and issue a verdict. The verdict is the final decision of the trial. If you win, judgment will be entered in your favor and damages will be awarded. If you lose, judgment will be entered in the defendant's favor and you will not be able to collect any money."

Cut out some windows on the outside of the house. Add curtains made from pieces of scrap fabric.






Cut out a door that goes between the rooms of the house. If you made the house upwards, add a staircase made from a concertina piece of card.






If you can find paper with brickwork or wood on it, use this to cover the outside of the boxes.






Glue fake flowers to the sides of the house, to represent a garden.







, This will make the LPS house a home for the LPS pets. Here are just a few simple ideas:

Shelf: Use a square piece of cardboard and fold a tiny tab at the top. Glue the tab to the wall.






Bed: Use a rectangular piece of cardboard on top of a rectangular piece of foam or Styrofoam. Cover with scrap fabric to make a mattress. Add scrap fabric sheets and duvet, plus a pillow or two. Pillows can be made by wrapping fabric around cotton balls and gluing in place.






Computer: Fold a small piece of paper over a small wooden block or a square of thick cardboard. Cover with white paper. Draw a screen on the top. Make a rectangular piece of cardboard for the keyboard. Cover in white paper, then draw little keys onto it. For fun, use a small Lego or similar mouse as the computer ""mouse"".






Rugs: Cut out rug images from magazines or print-outs; use scraps of fabric; use carpet offcuts, etc.

Obtain a prepared sample.,
Bring the SEM to atmospheric pressure in order to open the sample door.,
Put on gloves.,
While holding the door shut, press and hold the EVAC button until it begins to blink to put the chamber back under vacuum.,
After the 5 minutes is up, you are ready to turn on the electron beam and start taking pictures!,
Adjust the sample height.,
Zoom back out to your desired magnification and if you want to move to another area of your sample, you can use the X and Y knobs.,
Turn off the electron beam by clicking the green button that says ""ON"" on the top right corner.,
Open the sample chamber once the VENT button is solid orange.",How to Use a Scanning Electron Microscope," Preparing a sample for electron microscopy is a very in-depth procedure on its own, so for this procedure, use a sample that has been prepared for you. If a sample is prepared for SEM, it will need to be an appropriate size and will also need to have a conductive surface. Since the sample was prepared already, this article will assume it meets these qualifications.;
, Understand that the SEM will always be powered on, and the sample chamber will always be under vacuum. This means that the chamber will be completely empty of any gas molecules so electrons will have a clear path towards the sample.  Press and hold the VENT button until it flashes and you will hear a click. The VENT button will continue to flash until the environment in the chamber is raised to atmospheric pressure. Once the VENT button is solid orange, this means the chamber is at atmospheric pressure and you can open the door.

, This is extremely important because the chamber of the SEM needs to stay very clean!


Using the handles on either side of the door, slide out the door slowly.
Once the door is open, carefully grab the sample holder and slide it to the right. It will come loose from its grooves and now you can load your sample.
On each of the four corners of the sample holder, there are two set screws holding the sample in place. Loosen these screws slightly (half a turn of the screwdriver should be enough) and then remove the blank sample from the holder.
You can put the blank sample aside for now, but be sure to place it on a Kimwipe and not directly on a desk or table. Place your sample into the holder, then tighten the screws.
When your sample is in place, go ahead and slide the sample holder back into its grooves on the sample stage.
Now you can close the door by pushing the door back into the chamber.

, You will hear clicks, then after a minute or so you will hear the pump turbines spinning up. These pumps will remove all gas particles from the chamber and bring the internal pressure to about 10^-6 torr. When the EVAC button glows solid green, this means the chamber is at vacuum. Now wait an additional 5 minutes before continuing to the next step.

,


Go to the SEM's computer and the microscope software should be turned on. The green button in the top right corner of the screen will say OFF, indicating that the electron beam is off. Click it to turn the beam on, and then it will say ON.
Next, click the ACB (automatic contrast and brightness) button and your sample should come into view.
Using the magnification knob on the control panel, zoom in to your desired magnification. It is a good idea to do your focusing at a higher magnification than you want for your image, therefore your image will look better when you zoom out. For example, if you want an image at 2,500x, you might want to focus at about 4,000x.
Once you are zoomed in, use the focus knob to bring your image into focus.

, Now your sample is in focus, but you might notice it doesn't look as good as you would expect.


Underneath the picture of your sample in the computer screen, you will see the working distance specified as ""WD x mm"" where x is a number usually around 10-20. Take note of this number.
For good images, you might want to use a working distance of 10mm. This means that the beam is focused 10mm away from the lens. To set your working distance, click on ""WD x mm"" and a slider will appear, allowing you to change whatever number x is to 10. Go ahead and click 10.
Currently, the sample height is Z=25mm. To change the sample height, you will use the Z-knob. This part can be tricky. Whatever the original working distance was, subtract 10 from is and this is how much you will need to move your Z-knob. For example, if your WD was 16 mm and you changed it to 10mm, you will need to move your Z-knob down approximately 6 mm. So you will turn it to about 19mm.
While you turn the Z-knob, watch the screen because it will begin to come into focus. Once it is in focus, your picture is ready!

, You can also adjust contrast and brightness to your liking. When you find an area you like, take a picture by clicking the camera icon that says ""STORE."" This will open a dialog box allowing you to save your image file. You can name the file as you choose and store it in any folder on the computer or on a flash drive.

, Make sure it says ""OFF"" before you continue. Turn the X, Y, and Z knobs so that each value is 25mm. Now press and hold the VENT button until it blinks to return the sample chamber to atmospheric pressure.

, Once you remove your sample from the holder, place the blank sample back in the holder and slide it back into the sample stage. Slide the door back to the closed position. Finally, press and hold the EVAC button until it blinks. NEVER leave the SEM chamber vented, this can cause damage to the parts inside. Once the EVAC button glows solid green, it is save to leave the SEM.

Learn the components of the microscope.,
Place the microscope on a clean, flat surface.,
Rotate the objectives until the lowest magnification is above the stage.,
Keep your microscope manual nearby.,
Wash your hands before you begin.,
Keep a lint free cloth nearby to use to clean and touch the slides.,
Use prepared slides to begin with.,
Place the slide on the stage of the microscope.,
Secure the slide in place with the 2 stage clips.,
Turn on your microscope.,
Adjust your eyepiece, if you have a binocular set.,
Adjust the diaphragm to its widest opening.,
Start focusing on the lowest power objective.,
Move the slide to center it on the stage, if necessary.Most slides are much larger than the specimen that is mounted on them.,
Focus the slide using the adjustment knobs and diaphragm.,
Magnify the image with a higher objective.,
Store the microscope in a dust cover.",How to Use a Microscope," There are multiple essential pieces of the microscope that you need to be able to identify and use properly. The eyepiece is the portion that you will look into to view your specimen. Simple compound microscopes will only have one eyepiece while more complex microscopes will have a binocular eyepiece.

Here are the components:

The stage is a platform where you will place your slides for viewing.
The arm is the portion that connects the base to the eyepiece.
There are two focus knobs: coarse and fine focus. The coarse focus knob is usually a large knob on the side of the microscope that moves the objective lens towards or away from the slide. It allows you to find your specimen and roughly focus on it. The fine focus is a smaller knob that is used to focus specifically on the specimen. It allows you to fine tune what you’re looking at under the microscope.The objective is the piece that magnifies the image. There are multiple objectives of varying magnifications.
The light source is on the base of the microscope and points up toward the stage. It provides the light for image viewing.
The diaphragm is just underneath the stage and allows you to vary the amount of light shining on your image.;
, Clear your surface of any debris that could potentially harm your microscope. Clean the area with a surface cleaner and lint-free rag, if necessary. Make sure the table is located near an electrical outlet.Carry the microscope below the base and on the arm. Never pick it up solely by the arm.Place the microscope on the table and plug it in.

, The lowest power of magnification is a good place to start because it allows you to see the largest area of the slide. The magnification should be written on the side of the objective as a number and the letter ‘x’, for example 4x. The lower the number, the lower the magnification. It is easier to focus the slide on a specific region with this objective.If you change objectives, look at the stage while you do it. Higher powered objectives are longer and can break the slide if you’re not paying close attention. Use the coarse focus knob to move the objective away from the stage so it will not hit the stage.

, Read it carefully, if you want to see instructions on how to handle your specific model. The manual will also have instructions on maintenance and cleaning if those things are necessary.


Store your manual with your microscope so you can reference it easily.
If you have misplaced your manual, try searching for a downloadable version of the manual on the website for the maker of the microscope. If you can’t find one online, contact the company directly and see if you can have another one mailed to you.

, Your hands have oils on them that can easily get onto your slides and specimens. These oils can damage both your specimens and the microscope. If you have access to gloves, it is a good idea to wear these as well.


Keep your hands and the area you’re working as free of dirt and contaminating particles as possible.

, A lint free cloth is a special cleaning cloth that does not leave behind fluff after you wipe a surface with it.Many slides have a charge applied to one side of them to assist in the mounting procedure. This can make them easily attract dust and other contaminants. A lint free cloth will limit contamination.


Never use paper towels with the slides. These leave a lot of lint behind.
If you are wearing gloves you can touch the slide, but try to only pick up slides by their sides.

, Prepared slides already have a specimen mounted properly. You can buy these at scientific outlets or several may come with your microscope. Once you are comfortable using the microscope, you can try preparing your own slide.


To prepare your own slide, obtain a specimen you’d like to look at in more detail. Pond water or pollen are great samples to start with.
Drop a small drop of the water or place a few spores of the pollen directly onto the slide.
Place a cover slip at a 45-degree angle to the slide and gently let it fall on top of the slide. The water should hold the coverslip in place.To preserve samples for longer, add a bit of clear nail polish around the edges of the slide to secure the coverslip in place.

, Pick up the slide using only the edges, so that you don't press fingerprints onto your clean slide. Fingerprints and oils from your hand can contaminate the slide. You can also use the lint free cloth to pick up the slide.


If the slide is dirty, wipe it gently with the lint free cloth.

, There are two clips (metal or plastic) on the stage that function to secure a slide in place, so you can remove your hands and focus the microscope. You should be able to slip the slide underneath the clips easily.


Avoid forcing the slides underneath the clips. They should raise up slightly to allow the slide in. If you are struggling, try getting the slide under one clip at a time. Raise the clip, slip the slide underneath, and proceed to the second clip.
Slides are quite fragile and can be broken if this step is not done properly.

, The switch is usually on the side of the microscope. The center of your slide should have a small circle of light appear on it.


If you don’t see any light, try adjusting the diaphragm until it is open all the way. The diaphragm should have a lever or disc that spins to alter its diameter and change the amount of light coming through. If the diaphragm is closed, you won’t see any light. Move the lever or spin the disc until you see light coming through again.
If there is still no light, check the outlet or ask for assistance to change the light bulb in the scope.

, If there is only one eyepiece, you can skip this step. With a binocular eyepiece, turn the eyepieces to find the correct space between the eyes, or interpupillary distance. You should see a single circle of light when you look through both eyepieces.If you see two images when you look through the eyepieces, you need to continue to adjust the distance.
Move the eyepieces closer together or further apart until you see a single circle of light.
Remove your glasses, if you wear them. You can use the microscope's settings to focus the object according to your sight.

, The diaphragm allows you to change the amount of light on the slide. To begin focusing on your specimen, you want to shine the maximum amount of light on the slide.There should be a lever or spinning disc that allows you to alter the diameter.


Move the lever or spin the disc until the diaphragm is all the way open.

, You may have two or three different rotating objective lenses that you can switch into place to magnify the object. You should start with the 4x objective and increase until it is focused. Usually, the 4x (sometime 3.5x) objective is the standard for the lowest magnification on a basic microscope.The low power objective gives you the widest view, and allows you to slowly bring the object into focus without missing it. It is often called the scanning objective for this reason. Starting at the high power objective may mean that you don't see the object or you don't see the full object.
The two most common high power objectives are the 10x and 40x.
The eyepiece has a 10x magnification that is multiplied by the magnification of the objective; therefore, the 4x objective gives you a total magnification of 40x (10 times 4). The 10x objective gives you a magnification of 100x and the 40x objective, a 400x magnification.

, If you can see the specimen, try to position it directly in the middle of the light source. If you can’t see it, move the slide slowly around while looking through the eyepiece.


Remember, the magnification is mirrored, so you will need to move it the opposite direction on the stage to adjust it properly in your lens.

, Start with the coarse adjustment knob (the larger of the two knobs), move to the fine adjustment, and then change the light levels. While looking into the eyepiece, slowly turn the coarse focus knob until you start to see the image come into focus.


Use the fine adjustment knob to focus the slide further.
Be aware that as you focus, the stage rises closer to the objective. It is possible to raise the stage enough to touch some of the objective lenses, so take care during the focusing process to avoid this.
Adjust the diaphragm below the stage. Reducing the light may allow the object to look more rich and less washed out., Switch to a higher objective only when you cannot focus it further with the low power objective scope. The higher magnification will allow you to see more detail in your specimen. Not all high objectives are used with all slides, since some can focus too closely.


Use caution when switching between objectives to avoid breaking the slide.
Use the fine adjustment knob when working with the higher objectives, such as the 10x option. Because the coarse knob moves the objectives closer to the stage, the slide can crack if you’re not paying attention.
Switch between different objectives and adjust the focus knobs until you are comfortable using the microscope. Try using different slides to increase your practice.

, Lenses can easily be damaged by dust and other floating particles. Keeping the lenses and stage clear of dust will prevent damage from occurring. Only clean the lens with approved solution and a lint-free cloth.

Leather paint is slightly more expensive than acrylic paint and can cost between $2 and $8 for a small bottle.Although it is more expensive, it is less likely to chip or fade over time., Chalk-based paint can add a shabby chic, distressed look to an accessory or a piece of furniture.It adheres to many different surfaces and fabrics, making it a great choice for painting faux leather.Many brands have created variations of chalky paint which can be found at an arts and crafts store or a home improvement shop.

, Use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to remove dust, dirt, grease, and wax from the faux leather. Dampen a cotton ball and wipe the entire surface of the material. A clean surface, free from dirt and grease, will allow the paint to strongly adhere to the faux leather., Prepare a paint palette so you can easily and efficiently access your desired paint colors as you work. You can buy a wooden or plastic artist’s palette at an arts and crafts store, or you can use a sheet of aluminum foil, a newspaper, or a magazine to house your paint., Squeeze your desired paint colors onto your paint palette and add a few drops of acetone to the paint if you are working with acrylics. The acetone will thin the paint, making it smooth and easier to work with. Gently mix the paint and the acetone together with a small paintbrush. Be sure to only add a few drops or up to a teaspoon of acetone to your paint so that the paint does not become too watery.Acrylic paint can dry quickly, so do not squeeze too much paint onto your palette at once.
Gradually add a few additional drops of acetone if the paint is too thick.

, If you are painting a large surface in a uniform color, you will want to apply an even base coat of paint to the surface. Use the paint you selected for your project and apply it to the surface. This is ideal if you are working with furniture or clothing., Lightly press the sponge into the paint from your paint palette. Use long, vertical strokes to distribute the paint across the faux leather surface. Acrylic paint can dry rapidly, so you will need to work quickly if you are working with this medium.Focus on creating long strokes when painting a large surface to avoid creating streaks. If you are working on upholstery, plan to paint only one side at a time.

, Before adding additional coats, the paint will need to dry completely. Place the item in a safe place where it won’t be disturbed, damaged, or moved. Wait for about 15 to 20 minutes for the coat to dry completely.

, After the first coat of paint has thoroughly dried, add another layer of paint to enhance the brightness and saturation of the color. As you add additional layers, be sure that the previous coat is dry before you apply another coating of paint.

, Use a pencil to lightly trace your desired design onto the leather. Do not press too hard, as this will indent the leather. The paint is also semi-transparent, so any bold lines beneath the paint may show through., Using a paintbrush, fill in your design with the desired colors.Try to avoid creating thick layers of paint. A thick layer of paint will be more likely to crack over time. If your design has multiple colors, let each color dry before moving on to the next to avoid smudging the paint.


Be sure to clean your brushes each time you select a new paint color to work with. Keep a small cup of water next to your workstation. Dip the paintbrush in the water before placing it into another color.

, If you make a mistake while painting, use a small amount of acetone on a cotton ball or cotton swab to gently lift away the paint. Once the paint is successfully removed and the area has dried, you can continue painting.

, When you have finished painting your design, put it aside and let it air dry. The item should be secured in a safe place where it won’t be damaged or disturbed. The paint should dry within 15 to 20 minutes.

Move on to paint the veins.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Paint Eyes on Rocks," Look in places such as your garden or a local park to find the right rock to paint. It is recommended to use a small round or oval shaped rock with a rough texture.;
, Pick the color that you will use for the iris. You can use popular eye colors such as brown or blue or make it stand out by using multiple colors or making it rainbow. You can even use glow in the dark paints. Also, you will need to use the colors red or pink, black and white or light grey.

, Paint the top half of the rock white/light grey and let it sit and dry. If needed, apply a second coat of paint. Repeat on bottom half of rock.

, Once you have found the place you are happy with you can paint a circle in black to be the pupil. If you are afraid of making a mistake you may want to start by drawing the shape lightly in pencil first. Once you have done that let it dry.

, Using the color or colors you have chosen for the iris paint it as a circle around the pupil and the carefully fill it in. When this has dried you may want to paint lines of the color in different shades to create a more realistic look.

, These could be outlining the iris in a dark color or adding a highlight to the pupil.

, Start by turning the rock over to the other side and choose where you want the veins to come from. Using red/pink paint and a small brush paint squiggly lines coming from the point where you want your veins to start. For a more realistic effect try painting the start of the vein darker and make it go lighter until it fades. This can be achieved by adding water to the paint.

, Once you have let the all the paint dry you can now put them anywhere to add a decorative touch. Perhaps you can put them in your backyard or up on a shelf.

If desired, work as illustrators do.",How to Paint Ducks in a Row in Watercolor," The adult duck can be drawn in three simple shapes; body, neck, and head. Add legs, feet and the distinctive, rounded beak to complete the mother.;
, Try different poses because, like all babies, they like to explore their new world from many vantage points and angles., Plan ahead if you want to include a drake. He requires only one more basic shape than the female, but his colors are unique.

, They might include a park, an overgrown weed area near water, a pond, a backyard child's pool or a rain filled city gutter.

, Study children's picture books from the library such as Make Way for Ducklings or the Ugly Duckling. Look at what the internet can offer by Googling ducks and ducklings.

, Inspiration will come. Suddenly, you will be able to envision how you want your painting to look. On a sheet of #140 cold pressed watercolor paper in a pad, turned back to use the cardboard backing to support your paper, sketch your ideas.

, Put a little water on the color pads of a good set of pan watercolors to activate the pigments. You will also need brushes, a water container, a few tissues for catching drips and to absorb excess water from your brush. Put out a smaller scrap of watercolor paper to test colors.

, Many people like to do what they consider the ""hard"" part first. This is, to some, the figures or main subject. Others like to begin by doing the background, but either way is good.

, Do this by diluting the color with a lot of water. Glide on a sheer coating of color, working until the whole painting has a layer of color. Aim for an all-over coat at first. Allow this to dry and use a hairdryer if you wish.

, Add shadows on the undersides of the ducks, under the wings, head, and neck. Put deeper colors on grass, field water, and sky. Again, let this layer dry thoroughly.

, On the birds, add beaks. Texture the adults with short strokes to represent feathers. On the babies, represent the down with little dots and short strokes., With a fine, pointed brush accent what needs bringing out. Keep outlining to a minimum because it is always better to under than overwork a piece. You can always add more later.

, Use a black, fine line Sharpie marker and sketch over the colors. Either style of finishing is great. Enjoy your finished watercolor by framing it and hanging it for all to see year-round. It will help you to remember springtime and little ducklings marching behind their mom. It's a good way to remind you to ""keep your ducks in a row,"" too."

Select a flat-bristled brush for large surface painting.,
Use an angular or sash brush for corners and intricate details.,
Use synthetic bristles.,
Try natural bristles with oil-based paints.,
Purchase a variety of brushes.",How to Choose a Paint Brush1," Brushes that are used to paint larger surfaces, such as walls, shelves, dressers, and cabinets, come in a variety of different shapes and sizes. They range in width from one to five inches (2.5-13 cm). As a general rule, four inch (10 cm) flat-bristled brushes are best for large flat surfaces., The bristles are cut on an angle and make it easier to access hard to reach places. For more intricate details, you should choose a width that is slightly smaller than the edge you are painting.

, Synthetic bristles are usually made from nylon, polyester, or a combination of the two. They are versatile and can be used with latex paints as well as oil-based paints.Read the information provided on the package to determine exactly which types of paints can be used with the brush., Natural bristles are typically made from animal hair, such as pig, sable, weasel, or other small rodent. These brushes can only be used with oil-based paints. This is because the natural bristles will absorb the water used in latex paints, and the bristles will go limp., Depending on your project, you may need to use multiple different brushes. For instance, if you are painting a wall in your home, you may need a 4 inch (10 cm) flat brush as well as a smaller angled brush for the corners and window ledges.To save money, you can purchase a set of brushes. These will often be of lower quality, but is a great way for beginners to learn the feel of different brushes before investing a lot of money.

Find your niche by getting inspired in art.",How to Choose Your Niche in Art," Make sure it's away from anything that could get damaged by your materials. A backyard or an empty basement are good places to consider.;
, Pick the method and materials that you work well with or want to master or express. Artists use many kinds of materials to create totally different kinds of artwork. Some are:

Paint. Acrylic and oil-based are all good options.






Pencils. Artists pencils are sold in sets and individually, and come in many different thicknesses for darker or lighter lines.
Clay. Crayons brand children's clay comes in many textures and colors, and air dries. You may want to begin with that, if you are new to sculpting. But professional clay comes in more hues and bakes hard in the oven.
Yarn, string and thread. Knitting, crocheting, and embroidery are often considered crafts and not really art, but they teach many useful skills and are just as ""real"" as painting and sculpting.






Ink. Black ink line drawing requires dots, hashes or washes (watered down ink applied with a brush) for shading and tones.
Watercolor. This medium is a special cross between painting and drawing, using color washes.






Chalk. Pastels are something like watercolor (but dry).
Charcoal is a variation of drawing with chalk.
Commercial art. Illustrations, in books, cartoons, comics, plus animation, maps, technical drawing (and writing) etc. are good ideas.
Computer assisted. Digital art. Use art programs.

, Some people may consider some of these as crafts, or ""artsy stuff"", but that would be a matter of opinion:

Sheet metal. You can hammer copper relief similar to landscapes or steel to form shapes or bend and/or cut shapes and attach metal parts together for framed wall display or as mobiles (with moving parts).
Found objects. Buttons and bottle caps (odds and ends/pieces off machines, etc.) are great to use in several kinds of modern art.






Weld or braze metal rods, tubes and cut and shape pieces of sheet copper or brass to make art such as butterflies, trees, and town scenes, and such.
Wooden. Carve and cut sculpture in wood.






Silk screen. Create limited prints to sale (even art-Tee shirts as for musical bands).
Lithographs or art-prints. Draw and paint on smooth marble sheet; then dampen the area with a special solution and apply ink with a roller. The moist stone repels greasy ink. Paper is rolled with a drum to transfer the inked image, etc.
Linoleum art-prints. Cut and peal away non-image. Ink is applied, and print onto paper by roller pressure.

, Not everyone is a great painter naturally. You may need to learn how to correctly mix paint colors or how to draw the human body proportionally. Look around at community colleges and craft stores for public lessons in whatever skill you want to improve.

, Ideas for great works of art come in many forms. Magazines, old movies, buildings, and landscapes are all great places to look for examples. But your own thoughts are also creative. Draw from your own feelings, experiences, and dreams.

Select the paint.,
Select a design.,
Decide which application method to use.,
Clean the glass.,
Place the glass on a level surface.,
Apply the paint according to the method you selected.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Paint Designs on Glass,"


For decorative pieces, choose glass that has interesting shapes and pleasing lines.
Functional glass objects such as wine glasses and plates should meet the practical requirements of the object.
If you're a beginner, it's best to start with a flat surface on a glass object, for example, a plate, the foot of a glass, or a square vase.;
,


Always purchase your paints at a craft store to make sure they're the correct type of paint to use on glass. There are paints that can air dry and paints that need to be baked in an oven to attain the desired level of durability. Check the paint containers to learn the drying instructions.
Paints usually change color significantly when they dry. To ensure the desired results, refer to a color chart that is painted on glass.
Opaque paint will provide a solid color that doesn't allow light to pass through.
To get the effect of fused glass or colored glass, use transparent paint colors that allow the light to pass through.
If you're painting a glass object that will be used, such as a wine glass or a plate, choose paint that can withstand hand washing, dishwashing machines, and microwave use. Most paints that offer durability and permanence need to be baked after applied, so be sure to choose these types of paints when painting glassware for use.
If the piece of glass is only for decorative use, you can use paint that can air dry.

,


You can choose a pre-made design or create one of your own.
Pre-made designs can be traced or printed onto a piece of paper from an original.

,


Stenciling is a good method if you're a beginner or if you don't have a steady hand. The best method is to use pre-made stencils and fill in the blanks by sponging paint onto the glass, but you can also create your own stencils. To do this, print the design on a piece of paper and cut away the parts of the design that need to be filled in with paint.
You can also use hair, synthetic, or solid brushes without the aid of stencils.
To paint the glass a single color, sponging is the best way to distribute the paint evenly.

,


Use rubbing alcohol or glass cleaner on a clean cloth or paper towel to remove dirt and grease from the glass. This will allow the paint to adhere to the surface properly.

, If it's not, the paint will bleed to one side and the design will be uneven.

,


Use a sponge to apply 1 single color or to paint in stencils.
Stencils should be stuck onto the surface you wish to paint, and filled in with a sponge.
To sponge the paint onto the glass, simply dip the sponge into the glass and apply it to the surface evenly.
To paint on a design, place the design on the underside or inside of the glass and apply paint on the top or outside.
Glass is a non-porous material, so a little bit of paint covers a relatively large surface.
Start with the darker colors first and work your way to lighter colors and transparent paint.

,


Air-dry paint will be dry enough to handle in approximately 2 to 3 days.
When baking the painted glass, follow all instructions on the paint packaging. Usually, you'll be instructed to use a cool oven, but because each type of paint has its own specific compounds, refer to those to avoid disappointing results

Wipe away paint with a paper towel or rag.,
Glide the paintbrush over the paper towel or rag.,
Swish the brush in a cup of water.",How to Clean Acrylic Paint Brushes1," Before you clean the paintbrush with water, first wrap a paper towel or rag around the bristles of the brush and gently press to remove excess paint. Wiping away the excess paint will make the washing process easier and faster.Don’t wait in between painting and cleaning. It’s important to clean your brush directly after you are done using it.;
, Brush the bristles of the paintbrush over the paper towel or rag until the brush stops making marks. Doing this helps to remove paint before washing the brushes.

, Lower your brush into a cup of water and swirl the bristles of the brush around the bottom for a few seconds. Don’t submerge the brush for a long period of time; just swish the brush around to dislodge any more excess paint.If you used a cup of water to rinse brushes between colors, you can use this water or clean water. You will wash your brush with soap and water after this initial wash so it’s ok if the water is cloudy.
After you have wiped away the paint and submerged the brush, your brush will be cleaner. However, doing this much isn’t enough to completely clean the brush. You need to use soap and water to clean the brush and keep the bristles soft and flexible."

Choose a round or bright brush for detail work.,
Select a line, angle, and flat brushes for edging.,
Purchase filbert and fan brushes for blending.",How to Choose a Paint Brush2," Round and bright brushes have bristles that are rounded and come to a point at the tip. They come in a variety of different sizes and are used for creating lines, fine details, and edging. These brushes are excellent for control and accuracy.Bright brushes have shorter bristles and allow your create more detail with your brush strokes.

, These brushes come in a variety of sizes and shapes and allow you to create lines and are perfect for edging. Flat brushes hold more paint and can also be used for long sweeping strokes and filling in large areas. Alternatively, liner brushes are much smaller and can be used for writing text., Filbert brushes are similar to a flat brush; however, the bristles are slightly rounded at the tip. They are best used for blending and should be a staple in your brush collection.Fan Brushes are flat with bristles that fan out. They are ideal for painting grasses, tree limbs, bushes, and delicate blending.

"
"
Pull the bristles gently.,
Select a brush with flagged bristles.,
Pick a brush with a comfortable handle.",How to Choose a Paint Brush3," The bristles of a brush can indicate the overall quality of the brush. Before purchasing a brush, pull on the bristles. If a few bristles fall out, this is likely an indication that the brush is poorly made.


The bristles should be well-attached to the ferrule (metal piece that connects the bristles to the handle).
Also, when pushed on, the bristles should easily spring back into shape.

, Brushes with flagged bristles will look like split ends at the tip of the brush. These are preferred because they grip the paint better. Flagged bristles will also leave fewer brush marks on the surface., Paint brush handles can be made from either wood or plastic and they typically have some sort of curve so they fit in your hand. Choose a brush that is comfortable to hold. You could be spending a long time painting, and comfort is very important.For artistic brushes, the length of the handle determines how you will paint the strokes. Shorter handles are for close-up detailed work, while longer handles will facilitate distance and slashing motions.

"
"
Clean and rinse brushes immediately after use.,
Dry the brush.,
Store brushes in a deep container.",How to Choose a Paint Brush4," How you clean your brush will depend on the type of paint used. Read and follow the cleaning instructions provided on the paint. Make sure to thoroughly rinse the brush and clean it immediately after each use. The sooner you clean the bristles the less likely paint will stick onto the brush.Push the bristles down on a flat surface while cleaning. This will cause the bristles to splay and will allow you to rinse out all of the paint from the center of the brush.

, Use a clean towel to soak up some of the excess water. Then rest the brush on the edge of a sink or work station and let the bristles hang over the edge. This will allow air to circulate around the bristles and will help the brush dry faster.You do not want to get the ferrule wet because this can cause the bristles to loosen and fall out over time.

, Place the handles of your brushes into a deep container with the bristles facing upwards. You can also put the plastic or cardboard coverings that came with the brush over the bristles to help hold the shape of the bristles.Alternatively, you can hang large brushes upside down. Usually large paint brushes will have a hole in the handle. Hang the brush from a nail.

Hold the brush under lukewarm water.,
Pinch the bristles to dislodge leftover paint.,
Place gentle soap on the brush and work it into the bristles.,
Rinse out the soap.,
Swirl the brush in the soap.,
Rinse out the brush.,
Dry the brush.",How to Clean Acrylic Paint Brushes2," Turn on the hot and cold faucets until the water is lukewarm. Then hold your brush under the stream of water for five to ten seconds to rinse it, rotating it around so that the water hits all sides of the brush.The pressure of the water helps to dislodge paint that you may not have been able to clean just from wiping the brush.

, After five to ten seconds of letting the water stream over the brush, use your fingers to gently pinch the bristles of the brush.


At this point, the brush may appear clean, but it’s still necessary to keep cleaning with soap.

, Turn off the water, then put about a teaspoon of gentle soap or artist’s soap onto the bristles of the brush. Use your fingers to massage the soap into the bristles of the brush.You can also use shampoo in the place of soap.
If you are washing a big brush, make sure that you are massaging the soap into the inner bristles as well as the outer bristles.
It’s important to work the soap into the place on the brush where the bristles meet the ring around the stem of the brush, which is called the ferrule. Neglecting to clean the area of bristles around the ferrule will eventually spread out the bristles and alter the shape of the brush.

, Turn the water back on until it is lukewarm again. Then place the brush under the water. After the bubbly, soapy water stops streaming off the brush, use your fingers to massage the bristles and remove the last of the soap.

, After rinsing out the soap, squirt a dime-sized amount of soap in the palm of your hand. Hold the brush in your other hand and swirl the bristles of the brush around in the soap.


Swirling the paintbrush in soap helps to target paint in the hard-to-reach area of the brush around the ferrule.
The swirling motion mimics how you used your brush when painting, with the result that the soap reaches the areas of the brush where there might still be paint.

, After you swirl the brush around the soap in your palm, the brush should be completely clean. Hold it under lukewarm water, then massage the last of the soap out of the bristles., It’s not good for brushes to be wet for extended periods of time. After you finish rinsing out the soap, wrap the bristles of the brush in a paper towel or a clean rag, then gently squeeze to release water.Lay your brushes out to dry horizontally. Storing them vertically on their bristles can bend the bristles out of shape.

"
"
Dip brushes in water occasionally when using multiple brushes.,
Don’t soak your brushes while you are painting.,
Avoid getting paint around the ferrule.",How to Clean Acrylic Paint Brushes3," There are several habits that you can get into during painting that make cleaning your brush easier and can protect the bristles from hardening or getting damaged. One of the most important things to remember is to not let paint dry on the bristles.


If you are using multiple brushes when painting and are taking long breaks between each brush, remember to dip the brushes in water occasionally to keep them moist.
Dipping the brushes in water and swirling them around to remove excess paint ensures that the paint won’t dry on the bristles., If you are using multiple brushes, you may be tempted to just leave the brush in water. However, resting your brushes in the water can spread out the bristles and bend them out of shape. The best way to store your brushes while painting is to lay them horizontally on a rag or sheet of paper towel., When you are painting, you may be tempted to dip the bristles of the brush completely in the paint so that the entire head of the brush is submerged. However, doing this will get paint around the ferrule of the brush, making it extremely difficult to clean and eventually damaging and splaying its bristles.Instead of dipping the brush in the paint up to the ferrule, try to dip only up to ¾ of the brush’s bristles in the paint.

",How to Paint With Pastels," Pastels come in several forms, oil pastels, hard pastels, soft pastels, and pastel pencils, and each has distinctive properties.


Oil pastels are pastels with wax and inert oil as added ingredients.;
, Pastel paper comes in a variety of different textures and weights but is usually rougher than the paper used for acrylic or watercolor painting.This is because pastel does not like to stick to a completely smooth surface.Pastel paper also comes in different colors, as pastels are great for working on colored paper because of the density and saturation of their color.
Pastel paper is sometimes manufactured with a ""laid"" effect, meaning the grain on one side is made of closely spaced lines and the opposite side has a slightly mottled surface. Yet another type of pastel painting paper is very close to a carborundum (wet 'n dry) or a coarse sandpaper. These can be fun types of paper to experiment with.

, If you are unsure which type you would like to use, try purchasing a few pieces of each type of pastel and paper, then figure out what you like, and don't like, about each through experimentation.


While not used interchangeably, soft pastels, hard pastels, and pastel pencils can be used in combination with each other in the same painting. Oil pastels, on the other hand, can be difficult to blend with the other types of pastels. Keep this in mind when purchasing your pastels., Oil pastels, hard pastels, soft pastels, and pastel pencils all have different properties that you should explore through experimentation.


Run each type of pastel across a piece of paper. Notice how the lines they make are distinctive.
Pick up a pastel pencil and notice that not only does it resemble a traditional graphite pencil, the stroke it creates is detailed like a traditional pencil.
Handle a soft pastel pencil and feel its softer consistency. When pulling it across a piece of paper notice how much of it's pigments are transferred depending on the pressure you apply to it.
Apply a hard pastel to a piece of paper. Play with how you draw it across the paper. Use it on its end and then on its side. Notice how the lines created differ. Press firmly then softly and see how these lines differ as well.

, Try blending the colors together but also try to create clean and distinctive lines on top of other colors.









This kind of experimentation will help you build the skills you need to create a painting.

, If you are using loose pieces of paper, it can be helpful to tape it down with masking tape, so that you are not constantly having to hold it in place.









Study the ""tooth"" of pastel paper. ""Tooth"" indicates how much pastel pigment the paper is able to hold. Paper with more tooth allows more pastel to adhere to the paper. Paper that is too smooth is difficult to use if you plan to paint several layers on it.
Learn about how the paper's color affects the mood of your painting. Dark red paper adds a warmer glow, while paler paper colors give a softer, more subdued effect.

, Draw general figures, objects and buildings first. This is the time to decide where each major element should go in your drawing.








, Look at your sketch and choose the main color, which is going to be the largest area of your painting.









Paint with a light touch as you block in shapes and forms preliminarily. Once you are sure that the image is laid out correctly, use harder and more definite lines.
To keep an area lighter, apply white pastel over that spot before applying the color. If it is still too dark, scrape it down with a scraper and repaint.

, Fill in with heavier, darker strokes once you have finished blocking your picture or design.








, Add in tiny swirls of color, making sure to texture in the correct direction but making your painting strokes are random.









Mix colors and add detailed texture using strokes of a pastel pencil.

, This can add the final, polished details that will really make your painting look great.









Add fine color detail by picking up small amounts of pastel on the tip of a blender. Using a finer tool allows you to add in tiny details, like the light in an eye, more easily than by using even a pastel pencil.
Create softer edges by using a rounded, white eraser to blend. Simply drag the color out in gentle curves, making the lines fade over the paper.
You can also blend by using discarded packing peanuts. Packing peanuts allow you to save your fingertips while giving you the ability to lightly blend your colors. Using a packing pellet to blend pastel colors also prevents you from scraping your fingers on a rough-surfaced paper.

, Unlike traditional liquid paints, pastels will always be subject to damage and blending if the surface is touched. To stop this, fixative can be purchased at your local art supply store.









Alternatively, you can put your pastel painting under glass in a frame. This will keep your image safe from accidental disruption.

Good designs include a star, the moon, the sun, a flower or a clock. Shapes are good too, as are simple outlines of vehicles and animals.;
, Using a pencil, draw the design. If you make any errors, simply erase them until the image is as you wish.


This step can be skipped if you're super confident that you can draw the design using just the glue.

, Follow each of the lines carefully, leaving a good, even amount of glue on each line of the drawing.

, The drying time may be indicated on the label, otherwise it's best to leave it overnight. That way, you can be absolutely sure it has dried thoroughly.

, The next day, check that the glue has completely dried. When you're sure that it has, get ready to paint.

, Squeeze out excess water, you don't want any drips on the painting.

,, Wipe it across gently, eventually covering the whole piece of paper. You'll notice that the paint does not stick to the glue design, allowing it to clearly show through, revealing the color used for the paper underneath.

, Once dry, the glue-resist painting is ready to hang.

Protect your workspace.,
Prop up your board or paper (hereafter referred to generically as ""canvas"") so that you are looking up at it.,
Light your candle.,
Begin dragging the candle flame along the underside of the canvas.,
Vary the motions of your candle and the angle of the canvas.,
Blow out the candle and spray the surface with fixative.,
Experiment using fumage in combination with other media.",How to Paint with Smoke," If you do not have a work area that you can afford to mark with wax drippings, lay out a covering (such as an old tablecloth) to catch the dripping wax.;
, You'll need to work from beneath the canvas most of the time, so you may want to hang it from an elevated position, but if you can manage to hold it with one hand, you can use your non-dominant hand to change its angle as the candle's flame moves across the surface.

, Slender candles work best, but feel free to experiment. It's helpful to keep a pillar candle lit nearby to quickly re-light the one in use.

, As you guide the candle just beneath the canvas, you will see dark shapes forming on the surface of your canvas.

, The best way to ""learn"" fumage is to experiment with it. See what effects you can get by using tilting the canvas or the candle slightly, or by moving the candle at different speeds or in different patterns of motion. For more information, see the ""tips"" section below.

, When you are satisfied with your design, apply the fixative (a stabilizing or preserving agent, such as varnish) to keep it from smearing. Before you do so, you may wish to intentionally smear some of the soot marks with your hand, a brush, or some other implement.

, Wolfgang Paalen, the father of fumage, quickly progressed toward using fumage as a catalyst for his artworks, the seed from which the whole work would spring forth. With the fumage work providing his starting point, he would then add layers of oil paint, for example, to fully express his artistic vision. You can apply other media to the canvas either before or after you apply the fixative.

, Add a decent amount, as the glue will form the background for this decorative item. Tilt the lid to let it fill across the whole lid space.

, Add a drop or two of food coloring or liquid watercolor in one corner of the glue. The coloring will immediately run a little, but that's okay. Stick to only one to two drops at most.

,, By this stage, you'll have multiple colors.

, Do not combine the colors too much, or else you'll just get a boring, murky brown. Swirl just enough to create a pretty design and leave it at that.

, The food coloring will continue to spread a bit, forming its own interesting pattern and shape. The drying will take at least a day and probably more likely two to three days. When the glue begins to peel away from the container lid, it is dry.

, Thread a piece of string or ribbon through the hole and tie into a loop, using a firm knot.

Pour the paint into shallow containers.,
Tape the paper to the work surface.,
Blot the cut produce and set out them out on a plate.,
Dip the produce into the paint.,
Stamp the produce to the paper.,
Continue painting to finish your picture.,
Allow the painting to dry.",How to Paint With Fruit and Vegetables," You can use whatever fruit and vegetables that you'd like to paint with, but those with interesting shapes usually offer the most options. Visit your local grocery store or farmer’s market, and examine the produce to see which ones most appeal to you.Starfruit is an ideal option for painting because of its star shape.
Chinese cabbage can create rose-like shapes when they’re cut.
Broccoli and cauliflower work well for painting because of their florets.
Mushrooms come in a variety of shapes that allow for creativity.
Apples, pears, bananas, strawberries, raspberries, potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, corn cobs, green beans, oranges, lemons, and limes are other good options.;
, When you’ve chosen the fruit and vegetables that you plan to use, wash them with water to remove any dirt. Pat the produce dry with a clean towel.If any of the fruits and vegetables are particularly dirty, use a vegetable scrub brush to clean them more effectively.

, Most of the fruit and vegetables should be cut for the most effective painting. Use a sharp knife to halve or cut them into your desired shapes.








Slice a starfruit lengthwise to create star shapes. Chop off the base of a Chinese cabbage and use it for painting flowers.
Cut broccoli and cauliflower into individual florets.
Cut apples, pears, and strawberries in half lengthwise.
Cut oranges, lemons, limes, and bell peppers in half crosswise, and remove the seeds.
You can cut potatoes and carrots into wedges, quarters, or specific shapes, such as a star, heart, or flower. Bananas may be cut lengthwise or crosswise.
You can leave raspberries, blueberries, grapes, corn on the cob, and small mushrooms whole.

, To make it easier to dip the produce into the paint, transfer it into disposable shallow containers, such as a plate or dish. Fill a plate with each shade of paint that you plan to use.Tempera paint works best for vegetable and fruit painting.

, When you’re pressing the fruit and vegetable pieces to the paper that you’re working on, it has a tendency to shift around. Keep it steady by securing it to your table, counter, or other work surface with double-sided tape.You can use any type of paper that you like for your canvas, such as sketch paper, poster board, or cardstock.

, When you’re ready to start painting, gather all of the fruit and vegetable that you’ve cut on a plate. Use a piece of paper towel to gently blot the cut sides to remove any moisture that might dilute the paint., When you’re ready to start painting, place the cut side of the fruit or vegetable into the paint. Make sure that the piece is covered evenly with a thin coat of paint.








You can use a paintbrush or sponge to apply the paint to the produce instead of dipping it to ensure that it’s evenly distributed.
If you apply too much paint to the fruit and vegetable pieces, it can seep up around the produce and create a messy, indistinct shape when you press it onto the paper. Aim for a light layer of paint.

, Once the fruit or vegetable piece is covered with paint, press it firmly down on your piece of paper. Lift the produce away to ensure that it’s left a clear imprint on the page.








Lift the fruit or vegetable up smoothly to ensure that you make a clean image.
If you aren’t happy with the image that you’ve made, you may want to repress the produce over the same spot to add more paint.

, After you’ve stamped the first fruit or vegetable on the paper, stamp other produce over the canvas to create a scene or design that you like. You may want to have a piece of scrap paper on hand so you can test out the fruit and vegetables to see what shapes they make before pressing them on the paper.When you’re finished painting, you can use crayons, markers, and/or colored pencils to add fine details to the picture.

, When you've finished with your painting, set it aside to let it to dry completely before displaying it. It should take 1 to 2 hours, but placing in a sunny area can often help it dry more quickly.

Finished.

",How to Paint With Acrylics," You can either paint on a piece of plywood (or sections of wood with cross supports) or paint on canvas board or stretch canvas. Choose any medium onto which acrylic paint will easily adhere;
, Find textured or origami paper for the surface. For a plain background, paint the surface white. For paper, cover the wood in Mod Podge and lay the paper on top of it. Use a book or other object to ensure that there are no bubbles. Allow it to dry, then add ten or so layers of Mod Podge.








, Wet the surface, then sand with 120-grit sandpaper. You want to paint on as smooth a surface as possible.








, Acrylic paint dries quite easily, rendering it harder to work with. Make sure you keep your paint workable by doing the following:


Spray your palette with water every now and then while you paint. Having a small spray bottle filled with water at hand helps greatly.
Only squeeze a small amount of acrylic paint at a time. There's no need to get zealous; work only with the amount of paints you need.
You can purchase a stay-wet palette that helps keep moisture in your paint. These palettes usually come with both blotting paper (for underneath) and greaseproof paper (for on top). The blotting paper is briefly soaked in water and the greaseproof paper is laid out on top of it.

, Applied straight from the tube, or mixed with a solid white, all acrylic paints can look opaque. Manipulate the opacity by adding more water. The more water added to the paint, the more transparent the color becomes. Use transparent paints for watercolor or airbrush effects.








, Begin with larger outlines and then work your way to more detail. You might find it helpful to work with opaques while doing outlining, and then work with more transparent colors for detailing.

, After rinsing out the color of your brushes in water, lightly dab or blot your clean brushes on a clean cloth. This will keep water from running up and down the heel of the brush, creating blotchy paint on the canvas.








, There are relatively few rules when it comes to acrylic painting, but one of them is that when mixing acrylic out of the tube, to use no more than 20% water by volume (compared to the paint). Any more than 20% water or mineral spirits and the binding agent that makes the paint stick to the surface might fail, causing the paint to peel off at some later date.









Mix in other mediums, such as glaze or texture paste, when thinning the acrylic. Glazes give the acrylic a variety of effects, including marbling, trompe l'oeil, and glazing. Texture pastes add texture to the color, only dampening the color a bit after drying; they can be made more glossy by applying a varnish on top.

, This can help reveal any imbalances in your piece, and also point out any mistakes you may have made.

, Blending acrylic colors is both fun and fascinating; at times, it can be difficult. With a little bit of patience, and a lot of experimentation, you'll start blending with verisimilitude quickly.









Use an extender when blending. An extender is an acrylic medium that slows drying time while increasing ""open time"" of paints, allowing them to blend easier. Extender can be used both on the canvas and on brushes.
Use the side of your brush to distribute the paint. Use the tip of toe or your brush tends to scrape paint off instead of evenly distributing paint.
Blend two colors together by drying your paint brush and tugging on the under blended line until the two colors start blending. Sometimes, you'll want to soften the two colors so that the blending is even and uniform; other times, you'll want the blending to be harder, so that the effect is less noticeable.

, Masking tape can be used like painters use painter's tape when outlining the edge of a ceiling, for example. Masking tape can be applied to already dried paint without damaging it; simply press down the tape so that no paint escapes under its surface, bleeding underneath. Then, after you've painted your hard edge, remove the masking tape to reveal your perfectly straight line.








, So you have the base of a lovely green, but you want to make it lighter; or you have the base of a wispy fuscia, but you want to make it darker. Painters working with acrylic paints can lighten or darken their colors by either adding white or adding black. Lightening colors is called ""tinting""; darkening colors is called ""shading.""









Tinting is limited by the color you're using. Light colors can only be tinted so much; darker colors can be tinted more because there's more to work with in the beginning. A little bit of white can go a long way, so start off conservatively at first.
Shading can darken colors. Add only a bit of dark to begin with, even more conservatively than when adding white. Mix thoroughly or you'll find small streaks of black in your final color.

First, make sure the person is asking you, not the person next to you, to pose.,
Then, the artist should tell you what the ""setting"" of the painting is (ex.,
Wear clothes that are appropriate for the occasion (for a picnic maybe some worn-out overalls with a ponytail kind of thing).,

Buy your paint.,
Get the right wax.,
Scruff up your stainless steel.,
Clean and prep your stainless steel.",How to Paint Stainless Steel1," Use a high quality, oil-based paint. You can either spray, brush, or roll it on depending on what look you are trying to achieve. Buy the appropriate painting tools depending on which tool you want to use.


Spraying the paint on will give it the smoothest look, rolling the paint on will add a little texture, and brushing the paint on will add a ton of texture.;
, You can find many high quality waxes at a home improvement store that are specifically made for metalwork. Ask for that type of wax when you go to buy it. You will use the wax after the painting is finished for a final seal.

, If your stainless steel is relatively new and hasn’t already had years of abuse, you may need to do some damage to it yourself. Stainless steel has such a smooth finish that the paint has a hard time sticking to it. If your stainless steel has been scuffed up over years of used, the paint might stick. Otherwise you will need to use a sander to scuff up the paint. You don’t need to destroy the stainless steel, just add some scuff marks to simulate normal usage.


You can rent a sander from your local home improvement store.
If you don’t want to rent a sander you can try doing manual abrasion. Grab a wire sponge and spend some time scraping at the stainless steel with the sponge. This may be able to simulate scuff marks too. , You need to rid the stainless steel of any grease, dirt, or other debris. It’s a good idea to use a specialized steel cleaner or a degreaser, both which can be found at a home improvement store. If you use a cleaner, note the drying time listed on the bottle. Wait that amount of time before continuing your project. "

Purchase a pad of #140 cold pressed watercolor paper in 11"" x 14"" size.,
Set up a palette using tube watercolors in at least two shades of violet; red violet and blue violet.,
Select a #10 watercolor brush that comes to a good point.,
Assemble other items.,
Lightly sketch three or four large balls to represent hydrangea's blooms.,
Make these blooms appear rounded by ""under painting"" the sunlight and shadow right on them at the start.,
Break up the surface of each ball by drawing in pencil small circles to represent the many flowers comprising a blossom.,
Challenge yourself to see if you can make the water carry the color from the top of the large round blossom to the bottom.,
Touch the tip of a damp brush into violet paint that you have squeezed out on your palette.,
Help the colors mingle by making little bridges of water with a thin, damp brush tip, creating paths for the paint to travel along.,

Add veins to the leaves by scratching into a damp area with a sharp edge of a credit card.,
Continue painting blossoms, branches, twigs, and leaves until your page is filled.,
Add a background, if you wish.",How to Paint Cluster Blossoms in Watercolor," Spiral bound is good because you can open to a new sheet and by leaving it attached, the pad's backing can serve as a support board. You will be lifting and tilting the paper to help the paint mix.;
, Add brown, green, yellow, blue and red. Place the paints around the edge of your palette and leave the center clear for mixing colors.

, It should also spring back to shape when the damp hairs are bent. Also, get a liner brush with long, flexible hairs., A pencil, a large container of water, tissues, and a scrap of terry toweling to hold your supplies and for wiping excess water from your brush as you work., To paint lilacs, simply elongate the shapes slightly.

, Mix diluted puddles of yellow and blue on your palette. Lightly tint one side of each ball with yellow to represent the sun, or the light source. Have your strokes varied and feathery. Have them conform to the globe shape of the flower. On the opposite side away from the light source, do the same thing, only use blue, to represent the area shaded from the sun. Dry the paper thoroughly, using a hairdryer if you wish.

, Have the circles jammed close together and touching in places and spaced slightly apart in other places. In life, each little, round flower has tiny petals, so think of that and make the outlines irregular as you draw. No need to get exacting about the petals, let them be suggested and compressed in some areas.

,  Carefully wet, with plain water, one of the small circles representing a tiny flower within the large blossom.  Move to the neighboring circle. In places, leave dry paper between the two circles and in others let them touch.  Continue wetting the circles with plain water, being careful not to wet areas in the negative space because wet will attract wetness and you will lose the illusion of little flowers and get one huge mass, losing definition. If an area you wet earlier begins to dry, wet it again with a drop of water from a clean brush, keeping the water contained in the already wet spot.  If you look at your paper on an angle, the water spots will appear to be standing up slightly from the page. Try no to jiggle the paper.

, Touch the pasty violet paint to one of the wet areas on the flower.  Water will carry the color throughout the entire wet spot.  Repeat using slightly different shades of violet as you go.

,  Watch as the color from one wet shape quickly moves along the bridge and into the neighboring area.  Continue to paint the flower by carefully wetting more small circles, and bridge them with tiny, wet lines.  If areas begin to dry, use the tip of your brush and gently add more water to existing wet areas. Carefully tip your board to help the water and paint move, mix and mingle. The goal is to make the color leech into neighboring spaces and travel on the channels you have created.

, Paint some of the tiny circles using the wet method described above but alternate by painting some of the tiny flowers in a traditional way, by filling your brush with color and applying wet paint onto dry paper. After a bit, you won't need to draw circles, you can paint the little flowers free-hand., Use a liner brush filled with blue, brown and/or green and outline the little flower. Immediately drop on water and work behind the little blossoms, painting the space around them., Add minute touches of pigment directly from the colors you squeezed onto your palette. Try incorporating bits of red, yellow or blue and let these mingle with existing colors. Again, drop in more clear water to help color travel over the flowers., Hold your brush back along the handle to loosen your grip and achieve realistic looking branches.

, Quickly it paint with a stroke or two of yellow. Then, go over the area with blue and/or green. The two will form a shade of green that looks much more realistic than if you used straight green pigment. Use a combination of both wet and dry painting for leaves. Use green pigment from the tube sparingly.

, Or, let the leaf dry and paint veins with slightly darker pigment., Allow to dry thoroughly. If colors have dried lighter than you intended, add touches new of color, keeping the paint diluted and transparent. Be sure to do this on thoroughly dry areas., To put in a background, simply wet areas around the flowers and leaves with clean water applied with a soft brush. Touch the wet edge with color and watch as it travels on the water to all parts that are wet. Coax and guide the background color into smaller areas with the point of a damp brush. Pale gray, yellow, or blue are all good background colors. Just keep it simple. Allow the flowers to be the main focus.

Buy primer.,
Apply your primer.,
Begin adding layers of paint.,
Let dry.,
Wax the steel once it is completely dry.",How to Paint Stainless Steel2," Use any kind of primer that is rated for stainless steel. Primer has a special bonding agent that allows it to hold to most substances, but you still need to get a high quality stainless steel primer. This will give you the smoothest result. White primer is recommended for most colors, but if you are painting your stainless steel a very dark color you might consider a darker primer.

, If you want a very smooth application, consider renting a spraying machine from a home improvement store. You can also use a paintbrush but you might leave ridges from the brush. Apply one coat of primer over the entire area you plan to paint. If you are using a sprayer, hold the nozzle 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) away from the stainless steel. Try to use a wide mist.
If you use a sprayer, make sure you paint in one direction. You may have ridges, but at least the grain of the paint will look consistent. Let the primer dry before you start painting.

, You’ve already completed the hard parts. Now all you need to do is add layers of paint to your stainless steel. Once your primer has dried you can start adding layers, but you should wait for each layer of paint to dry before you add a new one. Two or three layers should do the trick. Once again, you need to make the decision between a paintbrush and a sprayer. If you used the paintbrush to apply primer than you should use the paintbrush to apply the paint too. If you like the ridges and texture that a paintbrush offers you can also consider using a rag to add additional textures.

, Consult with the directions on the paint you bought so you know how long it takes to dry. Once it’s dry, you’re good to go.

, Apply a thin coat to the whole area that you painted and let the wax dry until it has a hazy look to it. Now take a clean dry cloth and buff the wax. This will add a final seal. It's okay to use automotive wax.

Visit a professional powder coater (look in the yellow pages).,
Choose the perfect patina.,
Varnish your metal.,
Try nail polish.",How to Paint Stainless Steel3," This is an electrostatic process where plastic/epoxy powder is deposited in a very thin layer all over the surface and then baked on. The advantages of powder coating are flexibility, a very wide range of colors and textures, and the ability of the powder to adhere into small voids and cracks on the surface with out drips or runs.

, These are chemical formulations made to cause surface changes and coloration to metal. Some are used hot, while others are applied cold, there are many to choose from and they also allow you to highlight your project while maintaining a natural finish. Often waxes are applied afterwards to provide a final seal.

, Marine varnish is another way to put a final coat on your metalwork. Varnish has the advantage of being easy and forgiving to apply, however your work will have an obvious ""clear coated"" look that is not always desirable. Varnish is very easy to touch up later and to redo as maintenance at a later date without changing the overall finish.

, For painting small areas or writing on your metal, nail polish sticks very well and looks great. It comes in every shade imaginable, though, red hues are more widely available.

Layer the paint on the velvet.,
Use a clean, dry brush to lift paint that was erroneously applied.,
Allow the painting to dry.",How to Paint on Velvet," Velvet made from cotton, silk or another natural material is best. These options are preferable because the paint is more likely to slip off the surface of a synthetic material., Pre-washing ensures that you don’t have issues with sizing later, and also helps the paint stick to the fabric. Check the label on the velvet as it may need to be hand-washed and laid flat or hung up to dry. Use a gentle detergent, as left-over residue could affect the way your paint is absorbed., This will give you a chance to see how much of the paint the fabric absorbs before planning out your entire design. Decide if your paint and technique are compatible with the fabric (e.g., you may have chosen a design that is too detailed for the fabric, the paint you chose may not be the right kind for the type of fabric, or the colors you were planning to use may not dry as bright as you were expecting)., This keeps your fabric from bunching as well as allows the paint to dry more quickly. Stretch the velvet over the bars so that it lays flat and there are no wrinkles. Use a staple gun to staple the fabric to the frame, alternating sides as you go; put one staple on one side, one staple on the other side, one staple on the top, and one staple on the bottom. Repeat until the entire piece of velvet is stapled to the frame.You may also want to put a barrier between the velvet and the frame bars. A piece of cardboard or an acid-free foam core board work well and will prevent a line from forming in the paint where the velvet contacts the frame. The barrier should be slightly smaller than the frame bars so that you can easily remove it when your painting is dry.Frame bars are available at most craft and supply shops.

, Use a large, heavy sheet of paper. It should be large enough that, when placed over the stretched velvet, the entire painting surface is covered.Alternatively, you can draw your design on translucent tracing paper., Place a piece of cardboard or plywood over your work surface to protect it from damage. You want small holes, so use a small, sharp object. You could use the sharp end of a drawing compass, a push pin, or a similar sharp object to punch a series of holes to trace your drawing. Make the holes about 3/8 in (1 cm) apart.Alternatively, place the tracing paper on top of a sheet of carbon paper. Make sure the ink on the carbon paper is a different color than the velvet., Masking tape is a good option for this step. Taping the outline in place ensures that the design won’t move while you are transferring the chalk, which could ruin your image.Alternatively, tape the tracing paper, with the carbon paper beneath it, on the velvet., The chalk dust will go through the holes in the design and deposit on the velvet. This will create the outline you will use to paint the velvet.Alternatively, go over your design with a pencil or pen. The ink from the carbon paper will deposit on the velvet., Lightly brush away the extra chalk dust before removing the stencil. If the stencil was large enough, the only chalk on the canvas will be the outline of your design.Alternatively, carefully remove the tracing paper and carbon paper.

, Choose high-quality acrylic paints made for coloring fabrics. Using a wet brush will cause the paint to run and/or the fabric to become soggy.If your velvet is dark in color, brighter colors will show up better than pastels.
A high-contrast design may be easier to paint than one with a lot of fine detail.

, You could paint a thick white base coat only on areas of the velvet that will be painted with color. This will allow you to use less colored paint as well as help your colors pop since they will have a white, rather than a black, undertone. Be sure to let the base coat dry before painting over it with color., Velvet absorbs paint, so the paint's color tends to dull as it dries. To compensate, you'll need to paint in layers until you achieve the color intensity you want in the finished, dried painting. Allow each layer to dry before applying another coat.It’s best to begin with large areas first, then move on to smaller details, and finish with highlights.

, Do this immediately, before the paint is absorbed by the fabric., Let the painting dry for several hours, preferably overnight, to ensure you don’t smudge or ruin the painting. Carefully remove the cardboard or foam core, if applicable. Then, display your finished painting wherever you would like.

It can be hard to imagine the precise nuances of waves, reflections, and other common aspects of the sea. Therefore, it might be best to use a reference photo to assure accuracy. You can find a photo of the ocean online or review your own personal photo album for any pictures you have of the ocean., Seascape paintings should follow certain conventions to assure their accuracy. Before you start to sketch your painting, spend some time familiarizing yourself with the conventions involved in painting the ocean.


The horizon line is the point where the ocean meets the skyline. It should be convex, meaning it curves outward, without being noticeable to the eye. Edges, in general, should not be hard in a seascape painting. Keep the edges of waves and sprays curved and soft.When it comes to color, cool blues and violets work well under the foam of waves. Limit use of white, as it can make a painting feel busy.Decide whether you want to focus more on the water or the sky. This will help you decide how high or low you want to make the horizon., Before you start your sketch, you'll need to make certain decisions about the nature of your setting. If you're using a reference photo, this can be helpful.


You should decide what kind of substrate you want to use if you're painting water that's near the shore. The substrate is essentially whatever's lining the bottom of the ocean. It could be rocks, gravel, coral, stones, and so on.The lighting in your scene makes a big impact on color and reflection in your painting. Consider the time of day in the scene in your painting. Is it early afternoon? Evening? Where is the sun in the sky? Has it set yet? Light forms patterns in the water, called refraction, and less light results in less refraction while more light results in more refraction., Once you've made some basic decisions, sketch your drawing. Use the appropriate paper for the kind of painting you're using. For example, use watercolor paper if you're painting with water colors.Using the rule of thirds can help you position your painting on the page. Divide the canvas into three portions horizontally and then into three portions vertically. This can help you keep your proportions realistic while your sketch your painting.Study your reference photo if you're using one. Drawing is very much rooted in observation, so pay close to attention to the photo. If you're not using a photo, study how water moves and works. If possible, plan a trip to the beach to see the ocean in real life. You can also browse pictures and videos of the ocean online.Look for basic shapes. The world is comprised of shapes like circles, squares, triangles, and more. Knowing the underlying shapes behind a variety of scenes and objects can help you lay down the foundation for a drawing.Practice. If you're new to drawing, you may have to make a couple of different drawings before you find a drawing that works for your painting., You'll need to determine which colors to use in your painting to best convey how the sea looks. It can help to make a value chart of colors before starting to paint your sea drawing.


Gather your paints together, focusing on the colors you're most likely to use. For an ocean, that will likely be blues, purples, greens, and whites.
Pick a color and, without diluting the paint in water at all, draw a small line of it on a sheet of paper. This is the strongest shade of this particular color. Then, add a small amount of water and draw another line. Continue this process until the color slowly fades into white. This will give you a sense of the full spectrum of that color and an idea of how much water you should add to get your desired shade.Repeat this process will all the colors you're going to use on your painting., You should begin painting by adding your lightest color first. This allows you to form a foundation.


Use a brush and gently paint the areas on your canvas that need to be lighter.Running water tends to be lighter, as do the tips of waves and swells. The time of day also affects color. For example, water may be lighter earlier in the day.Once you're done painting, wait for the lighter areas to dry. While you're waiting, you can use something called masking fluid to make the areas where you plan on adding foam to any waves in your painting. The masking agent will prevent other colors from leaking onto these portions., Once the lighter colors have dried, move to painting on the darker colors. Use broad strokes when necessary to indicate shape and movement in the water. Try to blend the dark colors in with the lighter shades in order to create a smooth transition between the lighter and darker shades., Reflection can be one of the trickiest parts of painting water. Depending on the time of day, certain objects like mountains, ships, and rocks may be reflected in the water's surface.


Keep shade in mind. What's dark on dry land will be lighter in water and what's light on dry land will be darker in water.Colors are less saturated in water reflections. Even shades like white should be toned down slightly when drawn as a reflection in water. Also, obscure details. Really, only the basic smudges of images are needed in water reflections.Not all water reflects objects equally. Moving water, such as a stormy scene, will be unlikely to convey reflection. Also, water ripples can also obscure reflection. When in doubt, look up a variety of photos of the types of water you're painting to see how reflection is or is not present., The depth of the water can affect many aspects of your painting. Be aware of the water's depth while painting to portray it accurately.


Shallow water tends to ripple more, which can reflection to break. You should use quick and light brush strokes when painting shallow water.Deep water tends to move more slowly. Use broader brush strokes, and bigger brushes, and keep your movements slower when painting deeper water., Once you've finished the main aspects of painting, use water color pencils or thin tipped brushes to fill in small details. These are usually things like individual shadows, bubbles, or foam from crashing waves. You may also notice you missed a small spot here or there, which you can use a thin tipped brush or colored pencils to fill., Once you finished filling in any missing spots, step back from your painting for a moment. See if anything is missing. If so, try to add or alter the painting the best you can.


Foam from waves is typically one of the last thing a painter adds. You might have to add small dots of bubbles and foams. To do this, use a small liner brush and acrylic white paint., Once you're finished, allow your painting to dry. This may take a few days. If you're happy with the painting, buy a frame for it and hang it up in your home. Keep in mind it may take a few different paintings before you're really happy with your work. Drawing and painting are like any other skill in that they require practice for proficiency.

, Don't immerse it completely––just aim for a light paint coating as evenly as possible across the flower heard.

, This might be paper, a book, a jar, etc. Don't press too hard or too long, or the image will smudge and not be recognizable. Lift gently but quickly and leave the flower impression in place.

, Either use the same flower and color or use different flowers with different colors/sizes. You'll need to use a new flower after a few presses, as the flower won't remain strong and the paint will clog the fine details quickly.

If you don't have a beach near you, you can always buy shells from an art store. Some florists may sell also shells as vase fillers as well.;
, Rinse them using warm water, and scrub them with an old toothbrush or manicure brush. If the shells are very smelly, leave them in a bleach solution for up to 24 hours. Keep in mind that the bleach may also turn the shells pure white.If you are using store-bought shells, then you don't have to clean them. A simple rinse may be a good idea to get rid of any dust, however.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will make the surface smoother to paint on. Choose an acrylic paint primer, and paint both sides of the shell. Let each side dry before adding a second coat.

, Watercolor is easily absorbed into the shell, and will be translucent when it dries. It will ""dye"" the shell a new color while allowing the shell's original patterns and designs to show through. It is best for solid-color designs and ""tie dye"" designs.


You can also work with liquid water colors. They are more saturated and will give you brighter results. You will need to add a few drops of water to dilute them, however., Acrylic paint is opaque when it dries, and it will completely cover the shell. You will still see the shell's texture, but you won't see its original color or pattern. Acrylic paint is also great for layered designs, but you will need to let each layer dry first before moving onto the next.

, Choose a brush with fine bristles, such as taklon or sable. Avoid brushes that are made with horsehair or boar bristles, as they will leave behind brush strokes. You should also avoid using bushes that have bent or messed-up bristles.


Consider having an assortment of brushes, such as a flat brush and a fine-pointed, round-tipped brush.

, You can paint just about anything on your shell, from animal faces, to beach scenes, to designs or words. If your scene is very complex, consider practicing it on a sheet or paper first.


Having an idea of what you want to paint will lessen the chances of making mistakes later on.

, Watercolor paints need to be activated with some water, but even acrylic paints could benefit from a few drops of water. This will make your acrylic paints more fluid and easier to work with.

, Before you start painting, dip your brush into a cup of water, and blot it on a piece of paper towel. This will make it easier to paint with and reduce brushstrokes.

, Even if you are painting a simple design on your shell, such as a ladybug, you should start with the background color first. This will prevent the paint from mixing and creating a messy, muddy effect.


If you plan on painting both sides of your shell, let one side dry before turning the shell over and painting the other side.
If you are covering a large area, use a large flat-tipped brush.

, A fine-pointed, round-tipped brush would be ideal for this. If you mess up, don't worry, and keep painting. Depending on the mistake, you can always cover it up with the background color once everything dries.


Remember to rinse your brush before moving on to a new color.

, Once you are done, you can cover your shell with a clear, acrylic sealer. You can use either the brush-on type or the spray-on type. A glossy finish is the most popular, but a matte or satin finish can look nice too. The choice is up to you!


If you painted your shell using metallic or pearlescent colors, use a glossy finish. Matte or satin will take the sparkle away.
Use caution if you painted your shell using watercolor paints, as the sealer may cause the colors to run. Glossy sealers may also darken your colors, while matte or satin sealers may lighten them., You can display your shell on a candle charger, dresser, or even the fireplace mantle. You can also hot glue it to a hairclip and turn it into a cute accessory.

, Paint your shell a solid color and let it dry. Then, turn it into a critter by painting designs onto it, or glue on extras, such as cut pipe cleaners and googly eyes.


Draw a head, a vertical line, and some black spots to make a ladybug.Turn your shell into a crab by gluing on two googly eyes to the top/point of the shell, and short, pipe cleaner stems to the back.
Turn your shell into a fish by gluing a googly eye to the top/point of the shell, and smaller shells to make the fins., Ocean scenes are the best, but you can paint any sort of scene you'd like. Start with the sky first, then move onto the background (ie: ocean, mountains, grass, etc). Paint the largest object next (such as houses and trees) and finish off with the details (such as flowers, windows, and birds). Let each layer dry before you move onto the next.

, Paint the shell a solid color first, let it dry, then paint some geometric designs, such as zigzags, using a contrasting color. Black and white are classic combinations, but you can try other combinations, such as blue and white, or rainbow on top of black.

, Paint your shell a solid color first and let it dry, then make lots of tiny dots using the tip of a fine-pointed brush. Try to vary the sizes of the dots, and make them as close together as possible. You can make them all one color, or use different colors to create a striped or radial effect.

, Paint your shell using some pearlescent paint and let it dry. Then, add some glue where you want the glitter or gemstones to go. Add the glitter or gemstones, and let it dry again. Display it someplace where it will catch the sunlight and sparkle.


Fine, iridescent glitter will work the best for this. You can find it in the scrapbooking aisle of an arts and crafts store.
Use white glue for glitter, and super glue for gemstones.
Instead of glitter, try colored sand for some interesting texture!, You can paint the entire shell a solid color, or just the edge for something more elegant. You can even paint just one side of the shell, and leave the other side plain.


If you are painting the entire shell a solid color, you can use spray paint instead. It will be much faster.

Know the types.,
Buy a travel easel.,
Use a compact easel.,
Try a large easel.",How to Paint on Canvas1," To start painting on canvas, first thing you need is an easel. When you are buying an easel, you need to decide what the main function of your easel will be. Also think about where you will do most of your painting. If you paint on the go, you need a small travel easel. If you paint in a small space, you need a compact, medium sized easel. If you have a large studio space, you can invest in a larger, more stable easel.;
, If you are looking for a travel easel, the most important thing to consider is weight and collapsing features. There are many different types. You can buy a lightweight aluminum one with collapsible tripod legs. You can also get one that folds up and fits into a travel case. Try models such as The Jullian Plein Air Easel PA1 or the Daler Rowney St Paul’s Easel.

, If you have very little space, try a table easel. Use these on desks or tables of any size or height. Instead of long legs, they have a sturdy base that sits on any flat surface and don't take up room on the floor. They come in wood or metal and can be either H framed or collapsible. They can hold canvases as large as 35 inches. Most have a notched stand on the back that can shift to fit any angle needs. Try Reeve's Art & Craft Work Station or Windsor & Newton's Eden model.


If you have a little floor space to devote to your easel but not a large studio, there are some compact freestanding easels. They give great stability for small to medium sized canvases and can fold up smaller for easy, out of the way storage. They come in metal and wood. Look for models such as Windsor & Newton's Shannon or Mabefs Inclinable.

, Large studio easels are made for long term use. They are heavy duty and have the capability to hold large canvases. You can also get ones with masts big enough for you to work on the bottom of the canvas at eye level on any size canvas. Try the Best University or Santa Fe II models."

Paint the window trim.,
Clean up your paint and brushes.",How to Paint Interior Window Trim," The color of the paint that you choose is up to you. It’s common to paint interior window trim white, although some people choose to match the trim to the color of the wall, or to paint the trim a contrasting color to draw attention. For example, if you have white walls, you could paint your trim red for a splash of color.Don’t be afraid to ask the sales staff at your local paint store for help. They’ll be able to advise you as to the exact color of paint that you should purchase, and can help you choose between brands of paint.;
, Acrylic paints are the most common variety of paint used for indoor painting, and should be used on your trim. Older, solvent based paints should be avoided; these are less environmentally friendly, and give off less noxious fumes before they dry. Acrylic paints are durable and can be easily cleaned.When determining the amount of paint you’ll need to cover your interior window trim, you can use one of many “paint calculators” online. You can also provide an estimate yourself by measuring the area of your indoor trim. One gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet (32.5 square meters).The staff at your local paint store can also help you estimate how much paint to buy.

, These are the most popular finishes for interior woodwork painting, and will look good in any type of lighting and on any type of interior wood. A semi-gloss or satin (low-gloss) paint will also help your trim stand out against the surrounding walls, and should be relatively easy to keep clean.Although a high-gloss paint will catch your (and your guest’s) eye, it will only look good on high quality and extremely smooth wood. Unless you’re planning to hire a professional painter for the job, avoid using a high-gloss paint., A paint-supply store should sell a variety of paintbrushes (and rollers), but for painting window trim, a stiff angled brush will be the most useful tool. The 1.5–2-inch (3.8–5 cm) width should be a good fit for most window trim, and the stiffness of the bristles will prevent them from splaying while in use, and will allow for precise painting.If you’re unsure if this particular brush will suit your trim, or have questions about painting brushes in general, ask the sales staff.

, This will remove any stains or grime from the wooden trim before you paint it. Wash the trim by mixing warm water and a non-soapy detergent in a large bucket. Then, take a scrub sponge (sponge which has an abrasive scrubbing pad on one side), and dip this into the soapy mixture. Gently rub the sponge up and down along the trim, using the scrubbing pad to remove any stubborn stains., Once you’ve washed any dirt or grime off of the window trim, you should sand the trim to flatten the surface and prepare it for the paint. You can do this using individual sheets of sandpaper and your hands. There’s no need to use a professional-grade sander. Sand the trim, then rub your fingers along it: the wood should feel completely smooth.Since the paint will adhere optimally to the wooden trim if the trim is smooth and has no scratches, you’ll want to use a fine-grain sandpaper for this step. Your local hardware store will stock sandpaper; look for something around 120–180 grit.

, In order to protect the wall around the window trim that you’ll be painting, you may want to apply painter’s tape. This papery tape is only mildly adhesive on one side, so can be applied on any wall without stripping paint off. Be sure to place the painter’s tape close against the sides, top, and bottom of the window trim.If you’re concerned about dripping paint onto the floor (especially if it’s carpeted), you could also lay down a sheet of plastic beneath the window.
Painter’s tape should be available at your local hardware store.

, Pouring the paint into a bucket and then dipping your brush in this container will be more efficient than dipping your brush directly into the paint can. If you don’t pour the entire can of paint into a bucket at once, put the lid lightly back on the paint can so it won’t dry out., When you dip your brush into the paint, only insert the first two inches. Immersing the entire brush head will result in both wasted paint and paint spilling down the brush handle.Repeat this dipping and brushing process whenever your brush is running out of paint, or when you begin painting a new section of the trim.

, This part of painting trim is relatively straightforward. The window frame is made of the pieces of wood (top, sides, and bottom) that outline the window and face directly into the room. The window frame also extends to the inside of the trim (perpendicular to the glass window pane). Dip your brush into the paint, and then apply paint to the frame with long, smooth strokes.Don’t rush the painting strokes or paint in short, abrupt strokes. Both of these methods will result in unevenly applied paint, and will look rushed or sloppy once you’ve finished.

, If you open the window, you’ll reveal the sash. The sash is the section of vertical wooden trim that the lower window pane slides into and out of as it opens. The sash also includes the smaller “frames” of the window sections that slide up and down to open the window. Finally, paint the window casing and the window sills, then let the paint dry. Make sure that the paint is fully dried before you lower the window. If you close the window while paint is still wet, the window will become painted shut.

, The window trim is the roughly ½-inch (1.3-cm) deep “lip,” perpendicular to the glass window pane, that surrounds the wooden window frame. This wood should be painted last, after the front-facing surfaces of the window frame and the sash and trim have been painted.Paint the trim from top to bottom. This will allow the paint to drip downwards while you paint higher sections of the trim. You’ll be able to easily paint over and smooth out the places lower down on the trim where paint has dripped.

, To tidy up after you’ve finished painting, run your brushes under clean water, preferably from an outdoor spigot. (Running paint down an indoor drain will clog the drain.) Pour unused paint back into the paint can, and rinse out the paint bucket with clean water.

Don’t put this task off: if you delay cleaning off the brushes and putting the paint away, it could dry. Dried, hardened paint is quite difficult to clean, and you’ll likely need to throw both your brush(es) and bucket away.

Control #1 – Distance – Paint from the airbrush comes out in a conical shape.,
Control #2 – Volume – The finger button on top of single action airbrush allows the artist to control air flow only.,
Control #3 – Speed – Time is a factor in airbrushing.,
Good airbrush technique is realized by learning to master all three controls at the same time.",How to Paint Freehand With a Double Action Airbrush," The atomized paint particles become more disperse as they leave the tip of the airbrush. For this reason the closer the artist holds the tip of the airbrush to the art surface the smaller and more saturated the spray pattern becomes. Typically, pencil-thin lines are created by moving the tip within ½ inch of the surface. Soft and pale spray patterns are obtained by holding the tip several inches away. Really crisp and hard edges are obtainable by using mask and frisket – but that’s another lesson.
, Pressing the button turns the air on, releasing turns it off. Dual action airbrushes allow the artist to control air flow and paint volume with the finger button. Pressing the button turns the air on and pulling the button back opens the paint valve, hence, “dual-action’. The more the button is pulled back, the more the valve is opened and in turn, more paint released. Dual action airbrushes permit the artist to control the volume of paint sprayed “on the fly”. Air control is not variable; it’s either on or off., Moving slowly over a given space will deposit more pigment than moving rapidly over the same space. Maintaining the distance and volume at a constant and varying the speed of movement will yield a variation in color density between the slow and fast regions., Beginners may find it very helpful to practice controlling one element at a time. It lets the user see precisely the effect of each individual control. For example, the Volume control can be isolated by holding the airbrush at a steady Distance from the surface and maintaining steady Speed. Vary only the Volume by pulling the button back and forth as you move across the surface (keep the air on constantly). Do the same with Speed by keeping Volume and Distance steady and vary the pace of movement across the surface. To demonstrate the Distance control, maintain steady Speed and Volume and vary only the Distance. Practice until you can clearly see the effect of each individual control. There are other factors that control spray patterns, but distance, volume and speed are primary. Although the Speed control has the least visible effect on the spray pattern, it is perhaps the most important for mastery. This can be easily demonstrated: Hold the airbrush about ½ inch from the surface and take ten seconds to draw a circle. Next, draw the same size circle as quickly as possible. Even though each circle may not be perfect, the one drawn rapidly will have much smoother contours and will likely appear more pleasing. It takes a long time to learn to airbrush with quick strokes, but it is essential to produce well formed lines and tones."
"
Decide on your paints.,
Pick the brushes.,
Gather other materials.",How to Paint on Canvas2," There are two major types of paint used on canvas, oil and acrylic. They both have their pros and cons. The one you choose depends on what you want to paint and the way in which you want to paint it. You should weigh the pros and cons of each and decide which is best for your project.


Acrylic paints dry fast. This can help if you want to do many layers or apply crisp lines. It can be difficult when you are mixing paint and painting on large surfaces. You can get a defined edge, but color blending is hard. They don't change color over time, but they appear darker when they dry on the canvas. You can use super thin or thick layers because the paint will dry all the way through. They are also non toxic and have no smell. Acrylics also come off brushes with water.
Oil paints allow longer working times because they take longer to dry. The extra drying time makes it harder to make crisp lines. They blend well and make easy transitions between colors. The oil can degrade the linen or cotton fabric of the canvas. The color of the paint remains the same when it dries. It will yellow over time as the oil oxidizes. Oils are toxic and have a smell, due to the use of turpentine to thin the colors.
Although it isn't as popular, you can also use watercolors on canvas. These appear lighter and less crisp, but can give a great atmospheric quality., To do any type of painting, you will need to have brushes. The type of brushes that you need will depend on the medium that you plan to paint with. There are eight different kinds of brushes. They come in many different sizes and are made with natural and synthetic fibers.


If you plan on using acrylics, you should buy synthetic brushes. The materials in natural hair brushes degrade over time because of the components in acrylic paint.
For oil painting, natural fiber brushes are better. The bristles are harder and make more distinct marks on the canvas. If you buy synthetic brushes for oil painting, make sure they are made for oil paints. Otherwise, they can break down and build up residue.
The four most common brushes are the round, flat, bright, and filbert kinds. If you want to do detail work, you can use the pointed round, angular flat, fan, and detailed round brushes., There are a few other things you need to paint. You need a palette or paint tray to mix your colors. You can also get a palette cover to keep your paints from drying out. You need a color chart to help you mix different colors. You might also need palette knives for mixing colors and painting large areas of canvas. You can also use an apron to keep your clothes clean."
"
Choose your canvas.,
Pick your size.,
Apply the first coat.,
Apply a second coat.",How to Paint on Canvas3," There are many things that go into choosing a canvas. You need to choose what size canvas you need and what proportions you need for your project. You also have to choose a material for your canvas. There are all kinds of sizes and shapes you can buy from art supply and craft stores. Canvases come as small as a few inch square and as large as a full sized wall. The most popular sizes of canvas range between 11 x 14 to 48 x 72 inches.The two types of canvas are linen and cotton. They both hold oil and acrylic paint well. Cotton is cheaper, but it takes more work before you can paint on it. Linen is nicer, but it costs more.
If you want to go one step further in making your own canvas, you can buy the fabric and wooden frame and stretch your own canvas. However, most people buy their canvases pre-stretched., You size your canvas by painting a type of glue to the surface of the canvas. This helps fill in the holes in the fabric of the canvas. This is so the paints aren't absorbed and misshapen when you start. The type of size you will need depends on the kind of paint you are working with. If you are working with acrylics or watercolors, you don't have to size your canvas. Many painters do to make the canvas stable for painting. If you are working with oil, you need to size to avoid color fading.


The most traditional way to size a canvas is using rabbit skin glue. The most popular size for oil is poly vinyl acetate, or PVA size. You can use either one. If you use rabbit skin glue, you will have to mix it with water before you use it on the canvas., Pour a generous amount of your size onto the surface of the canvas. Using a large brush, paint the size across the canvas until all the sizing is spread evenly. Allow to dry for 30 minutes.


Make sure you do this in even, straight strokes. You don't want your size to be uneven.
Remember to apply the size to every side of the sides of the canvas as well. This will prevent degradation over time., Pour more size onto the canvas and paint it on with the same brush. Make sure you rub this layer into the canvas to fill in any holes in the canvas that haven't been filled. As you finish this second layer, take your brush and move along the surface in even strokes to make the surface smooth. Let it dry.


If your size looks a little thin, you may need a third layer. This depends on the quality of the size you choose to use."
"
Understand the technique.,
Start priming the canvas.,
Apply more layers.,
Create a smooth surface.,
Prime the canvas for watercolors.",How to Paint on Canvas4," You prime your canvas to finish getting it ready for painting. You use a paint like material called gesso. The gesso creates a surface for the paint adhere to once it's applied. Once your second layer of size has dried, you need to prime your canvas. The primer you use will depend on the medium that you intend to paint with. They come in white or translucent colors that provide natural lighting for your painting.


Oil, acrylic, and watercolors all have different types of gesso associated with them. However, acrylic gesso is now used most for both acrylic and oil painting. It is also used underneath the ground needed to paint watercolors on a canvas., Pour the gesso, such as Opus acrylic gesso, on your canvas. Paint it on the canvas in even strokes with a large brush. Wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the gesso to dry., Turn your canvas 90 degrees. Apply another coat of gesso in the same manner you applied the first. Let dry and repeat until you have enough layers.


You need three layers of gesso for acrylic paint. You need four layers of gesso for oil paint.
If you don't want to bother with sizing or priming, you can buy pre-primed canvases that don't need the size or gesso applied to them., Some painters prefer a smooth surface for painting. If you do, add one layer of gesso to your sized canvas. After the gesso dries, rub a piece of coarse sandpaper across your canvas. Apply as many coats of gesso as you need on top of the first. Sand between each one and after the last., If you want to use watercolors on the canvas, you need something extra on the canvas. Apply two coats of gesso in the same manner you applied it for acrylics and oils. On top of that, apply an absorbent ground such as Golden's Absorbent Ground.


Using a brush or roller, paint the ground on the surface in a thin layer across the canvas. Wait 30 minutes to 1 hour between coats to let it dry, then apply another layer. You should apply 5-6 layers of the ground to the surface of the canvas. Let the ground dry for 24 hours before you start to paint."

Paint a background.,
Start your work.,
Apply the high and low lights.",How to Paint on Canvas5," Some paintings require a background color. This will be different depending on your subject matter. If you need one, you have to start off with this. Using a large brush, paint your background color across the canvas. Make sure this is before you start to apply your other paints or sketch out your image., Now that you primed your canvas , you have your brushes, and you have chosen your paints, you can start work on your canvas. You should already have an idea of what you want to paint since you have chosen the colors that you need. At this point, you can sketch the outline of what you want to paint across the surface of your canvas before you start to paint. If you are working on a more abstract, free slowing work, you can just begin painting on the canvas., If you are working on a subject, you need to start with the low and highlights. Apply the darkest and lightest colors that you are going to use onto the sketch you made. From here, you can build up the middle ground shades on top of them, blending them as you go.If you are using oil paints, make sure you clean your brushes with turpentine between uses. If not, you will get paint build up and it will ruin your brushes. If you are using acrylics or watercolors, rinsing them out in water is fine."

Inspect the glass paint for several different qualities.,
Select your paint.,

Clean the glass.,
Read and follow all instructions for each glass paint product.,
Outlay a design in lead.,
Use a pipette to apply the paint to each section of your design.,
Fill in the design with your glass paint.,
Use a sponge (optional).,
Consider baking to set the paint.,
Follow instructions on paint package for baking.",How to Paint Glass," When it comes to glass paint, you should look at transparency, color range, permanence, and ease of application.


Transparency: how transparent is the paint you're buying? Glass paints come in both transparent and opaque colors. Acrylic paints are usually used for opaque colors, while resin paints are usually used for transparent colors. Transparent colors come both in glossy and frosted varieties.
Color range: look for a true color chart of what the colors will look like on actual glass. Sometimes, paint will look significantly different on glass than it does on the color chart.
Permanence: especially for items, such as wine glasses, that will be used, permanence and durability is very important. Paints that have been baked are usually more durable than paints that haven't been.Ease of application: how easy is the color and pattern to transfer? Does the paint come with any stencils or transfers, or must you make your own?;
, When it comes to glass paint, choose from among from among several different options available. For decorative painting purposes, glass paint falls into three basic categories:


Acrylic enamel paint or enamel paint that’s usable on glass as well as other shiny or slick surfaces.
Acrylic paints that become paints for use on glass when a glass and tile medium is added.
Specialized solvent-based paint.
Know that when it comes to paint, you'll get what you pay for. While cheap paint may be the best to experiment and play with, if you're thinking about painting a showpiece or something higher-grade, it's best to opt for nicer paint. Cheaper paint doesn't apply as well, look as brilliant, or last as long.

, Know that a special paint brush is not required. It’s okay to use your regular painting brushes (rounds, liners, or flats) with synthetic hairs or synthetic mix. Some people prefer the softness of all natural hairs.


Use synthetic or natural-hair brushes. Synthetic and natural brushes can both be used to paint glass; they have different advantages. Synthetic brushes leave more visible brush strokes, while natural-hair brushes give the artist a smoother coverage.

, Make sure that the glass you're going to paint is adequately cleaned before continuing.

, Some glass paints require an undercoat before application and an overcoat after applications; painting without following the directions may result in a failed end product.

, To do this, use either the strip or squeeze-on variety, depending on what you want. Use your stencil or transfer if available, or use freehand.


An alternative to this method is to use permanent marker as your outlay. When painted over and fired, the permanent marker will usually not show, and lead and paint won't mix.

, There are two ways to do this. You can add the paint by the drop, as you move your hand across the desired surface area; or if the volume of the paint is enough, and you find you now you have gaps between spots, even it up uniformly by drawing a toothpick through the area in lines, back and forth. This will also help in ridding the piece of any air bubbles trapped in the paint.

, The lead you have already applied should stop the paint running out of the desired area.


Make use of a sticky stencil. Stick stencils, placed on the opposite corner of the glass, adhere well and give you a good visual suggestion to follow.

, A sponge will provide uniform, even coverage, and is the best implement to use if you're painting an entire piece of glass one color.

, Baked paints last longer than unbaked paints. If you don't want to go through the hassle of baking your painted glass, there are varieties that you can find which don't require baking.


Resin-based paints are removable until baked. If you mess up using a resin-based paint, it's perfectly acceptable to start over. The paint won't become permanent until the glassware is baked.

, Different paints will need to be baked according to different instructions, so check the instructions before putting your glass in the oven.


A glass might go into a 300° F (~150° C) oven for 30 minutes before it's properly baked. Allow the glass to cool adequately before handling.

Let your clear finish completely dry.",How to Paint Letters on Wood," No matter how careful you are, it’s best to cover any surfaces that you don’t want to spill on. This process involves water, dust, primer, paint, and finish, so there are plenty of opportunities to make a mess. Throw down an old towel or some newspaper on the table or floor you’re working on., Even if it looks clean, you want to give the surface a quick wipe-down. Dampen a rag with some warm water, and sweep it all over the surface. If you are painting a piece of furniture or a sign that has any sort of hardware on it, go ahead and remove it before you get started.If there are any holes or big indentations where you want to apply paint, you should apply wood filler at this time.

, This is an important step for several reasons. If you are working with a piece of furniture that has a gloss or lacquer on it, you will use the sand paper to remove it. This will allow your paint to adhere to the surface. If you are using a bare piece of wood that is bumpy and uneven, this will help to create a smooth canvas for painting.Use light pressure, going with the grain of the wood. Do not go against the grain or across the grain, or the wood will look scuffed and rough.
Use 100-grit sandpaper to remove any finish on the wood. Once that is removed, you can use a higher grit sandpaper to soften the surface.

, After you’re finished sanding, there will certainly be dust on your wooden surface. Even if it looks perfectly clean, it’s important to dust it off anyways. Use a large, clean paint brush to brush away any dust on the surface, or grab a spare rag to do the job.Dusting the wood thoroughly will allow the paint to adhere to the surface, not any particles on top.

, Before you start using the fun colors you’ve chosen, it’s important to use a primer. A paint primer creates the perfect base for paint by sealing the pores of the wood and giving the paint something to securely stick to. It will help keep your paint from chipping and fading.If you’re going to be painting a background color, you can use a white or gray primer. If you are only painting letters, grab a clear primer.

, If you are someone who is confident in their freehand ability, you can certainly skip this step. However, if you aren’t confident in your freehanding and want to ensure that you get perfect, even letters, you can design them on a computer. Using Microsoft Word, you can type in your letters and then trace them onto the wood.Open Microsoft Word, click on the “File” menu, and select “Page Setup.” Select the paper size that matches the size of the wood you’ll be painting, or enter in your own custom size.
Type your lettering in the document, however you want it to look on the wood. Because the page is set to the size of the wood, you can design it with the proper measurements in mind.
Print your document.

, There are a variety of ways that you can trace your printed lettering onto the wood, and some will yield more precise results. One method is to cut out your letters from the paper and trace around them. This will only work if your letters are big and easy to cut out. The second method will work for any types of letters.


Flip your printed page over, so that you are working on the blank side. Use a pencil to color everywhere that there is ink on the reverse side of the paper. In other words, you will be rubbing pencil lead onto the back of all your printed letters.Turn the page back over, and put it on your piece of wood. The printed letters should be facing up. Using your pencil again, trace over every line of every letter.
When you are all done, remove the paper. The lead that you put on the backside of the paper will have transferred onto the wood with the pressure of your tracing. Now, you have lines to fill in with paint, and you can create perfect lettering.

, You can find pre-cut stencils at your local craft store, and they are perfect for painting letters on wood. You can also order these stencils online if you are looking for a very particular size or font. For best results, you will also need a stencil paintbrush, as well as spray adhesive.Take your time to line up the stencil onto the wood, exactly as you want your lettering to line up. Use a pencil to mark up the stencil to show where it should lay on the wood.
Shake your can of spray adhesive, and then spray a light coat on the stencil. This will allow it to stick to the wood, ensuring that it doesn't shift or smear during the painting process.
Once your stencil is stuck to the wood, use your stencil brush to gently dab acrylic paint onto the wood, through the stencil.
Allow your paint to dry for a few minutes before peeling the stencil off the wood.

, When it comes to freehanding, it's good have a variety of different brush sizes and textures to choose from. Brushes with firm, square bristles are great for creating the thick, straight outlines of letters, while small brushes are great for details. If you feel more comfortable writing your letters, you can purchase acrylic paint pens at most craft stores.

, If you want your letters to be even across the wood surface, it's a good idea to use a straight-edge first. With a pencil, you can outline a soft line to follow, like lined notebook paper. You can create a top line as well, so you know exactly how big each letter should be. You can create any demarcations you think will help you make evenly-sized, straight lettering.

, Squirt a little bit of paint at a time onto a paper plate or a sheet of paper, and begin painting. Take care to follow any lines or marks you've put on the wood to help – unless you're going for a more whimsical look! Keep a cup of water nearby to rinse your paintbrushes between colors.If you make a mistake, use a clean, damp rag to gently wipe it away. This will remove paint if it is still wet.

, Acrylic paint will dry pretty quickly, but it’s best to give it a few hours just to ensure it’s completely dry. If you need to apply a second coat to any of your letters, go ahead and do that after the first coat is dry. Typically, second coats are needed for any light paints, like white or pastel colors., This is basically a clear topcoat that will seal your painted letters onto the wood. It will help keep them from getting chipped or scratched, and ensure that your handiwork lasts for a long time. You can buy this finish at craft stores or home improvement stores., It’s good to let your completed, sealed project sit for about 24 hours before doing anything with it. After it’s completely dry, you’re all set! Whether you give it as a gift or keep it for yourself, you can take pride in your wooden DIY project.

Cut the end of a cardboard tube to create a fringe.,
Cut fringes on all four cardboard tubes.,
Spread out the fringe on each tube.,
Squeeze four tempera paint colors onto four separate paper plates.,
Place the fan end of one tube into the tempera paint.,
Stamp the fan down onto the paper.,
Place another tube into a different color paint.",How to Paint Fireworks1," Gather four cardboard tubes from around your home. Use scissors to snip a “fringe” on the end of one of the tubes. Start by making a cut at least two inches long. Move over about half a centimeter and make another cut the same exact length. Keeping doing this until you’ve gone all the way around the tube.Toilet paper and paper towels are two good resources for cardboard tubes.;
, Repeat the same process to create fringe on the ends of all four tubes. Give each cardboard tube a different fringe length. This will allow you to create fireworks in four different sizes. Leave a few inches of uncut tubing on the opposite end so you can hold onto the tube easily., Use your fingers to push the cardboard strips back, away from the tube. Do this all the way around the tube so that the fringe opens up and resembles a fan. This fan tool will allow you to create a firework “print,” very similar to the way you'd use a stamp., These colors are for the fireworks, so consider what you want them to look like before you begin.You can use almost any color you want. If you aren't sure, try out any combination of red, white, yellow, blue, green and purple.

Feel free to try additional colors for your fireworks, but avoid dark hues like midnight blue and black.

, Choose the color you want to start with. Press the fringe end of the tube into the tempera paint. Make sure you pick up paint on all of the cardboard strips. Lift the tube straight up out of the paint and carefully bring it over to your paper.Large pieces of white or black construction paper will work great for this.
Don’t use anything smaller than 11x17 or you won’t have much space to work with.

, Choose the location for your first firework print and bring the fan directly down onto the paper. Lightly bounce the tube down, then twist the fan in one direction. Bounce it again and then twist in the opposite direction. As you twist, the paint on the fan will transfer to the paper.Don’t place the cardboard fringe into the paint until you’re ready to make the firework print. The strips can get soggy and fall off.

, Create your next firework print by repeating the actions you just used, except this time use a different color of paint. You could use a slightly smaller size to stamp another print right over the first one. You could also start small and work your way up to the larger sizes.

If you want to start out simply, make single-colored firework prints that don’t overlap with each other.Experiment with different ideas and see which approach you like best!

Store the paint.",How to Paint Fluid Art," It’s important to clean your work space before painting as dust and dirt can easily settle into slow-drying fluid paint. Sweep or vacuum the floor or tabletop that you will be placing your canvas on. Cover the surface with clean plastic sheeting to protect it from stains, and to prevent your artwork from sticking to it., The best choice of canvas for fluid painting is a sealed panel, which can handle the weight of fluid acrylics better than a traditional canvas. Set up your canvas and place your paints within arm’s reach of it. Lay out any spreading tools that you may use to disperse paint.You can purchase paint or spreading tools at an art supply store, or make fluid paint by diluting regular acrylic paint.

, Before embarking on a large fluid painting project, test out your paints and tools on a small, spare canvas to see what effects they produce. Different spreading tools (e.g., palette knives or trowels) may leave unique marks on the paint, and paints may react with each other in different ways given their pigment concentration, finish (e.g. matte, glossy), and density. Observe how the paint looks after letting it dry for several days., If you wish to have full control of how fluid paint is dispersed onto your canvas, place it perfectly flat on your work surface. If you are aiming for a specific dripping effect, place the canvas upright or at an angle. Use an easel or prop the canvas up with something solid (e.g., a large piece of wood) to achieve the angle you want., Before starting your fluid painting, consider painting your plain canvas with one solid paint color (or “toned ground”) to make the end result look more professional. Use regular acrylic paint in an opaque color for this. Dip a large brush in the paint and cover the canvas in broad strokes from left to right, aiming to make the paint as smooth as possible.Let the canvas sit for 2-3 hours to dry before applying fluid paint to it.

, How paint disperses onto the canvas will depend on the method of application you use, the vessel you transfer it from, and the angle and distance at which you apply it. Most store-bought fluid paint is sold in squeeze bottles with small nozzles that allow you to dispense it in fine lines, but you can transfer the paint to any container you choose to create your artwork. Some techniques for getting fluid paint onto a canvas include:Pouring (applying a generous stream of paint to the canvas)
Drizzling (pouring very light stream of paint onto the canvas)
Dropping (e.g., from an eye-dropper)
Puddling (Applying a puddle of paint to the canvas and letting it seep over it)
Splashing (Projecting paint onto the canvas with enough force to bounce back off of it)

, Depending on the design you wish to achieve, you can use spreading tools or a dry paintbrush to disperse fluid paint across your canvas. To ensure greater control, spread or move paint very lightly in multiple, thin coats. Have an empty container or basin on hand to collect excess paint from the canvas, if necessary, using a clean spreading tool.Make sure that your tools are perfectly clean before you start painting.Tools should always be cleaned with warm water and hand soap immediately after use, before paint dries on them., Fluid paint is a very wet medium and requires more drying time than other paints. If you wish to layer paint designs over other work on the canvas, allow one to three days between coats so that the layers can dry thoroughly. Painting over other fluid paint that hasn’t dried completely can cause cracks or fissures on the surface of the paint., Look for clear, squeezable containers that will allow you to see the color of your paint and disperse it easily. Squeeze bottles with a nozzle cap (available at craft stores or online) are the most versatile choice for fluid painting. Purchase the bottles in appropriate sizes for the amount of paint you will be making., To make fluid paint, fill each bottle halfway full with the acrylic paint of your choice (available at art supply stores). Fill the remaining half of the bottle with equal parts water and acrylic medium (e.g., glazing liquid, also available at art supply stores). Be sure to keep this ratio of paint to water/acrylic medium, as further diluting the paint may diminish its ability to adhere to the surface being painted.Opt for artist grade acrylic paint, which has a higher concentration of pigment than student grade paint., Use a coffee stir stick or a small straw to stir the paint without adding air bubbles to it. You can also add a small ball bearing to the container to help with mixing. Make sure that the paint is thoroughly mixed to avoid clumps or uneven coverage., After making or using the paint, clean the nozzle and poke the tip with a pin or toothpick to prevent clogging. Ensure that your paint doesn't dry out by unscrewing the nozzle cap and placing a small square of cling wrap onto the opening. Re-cover it tightly.As a general rule, paint should not be kept for more than two years.Paint should be stored in a cool, dry place, but should not be allowed to freeze.

Paint the surrounding area.,
Put two or three colors on the same brush (optional).,
Brush with short strokes.,
Add highlights where the water reflects the sun.,
Flick paint to add motion (optional).",How to Paint Ocean Waves1," Start with a horizon line, using Prussian blue for a sunny day. Fill the distant background of the sea with dark blue or ocean blue paint, optionally including a little green as well. Leave enough space in the foreground for two or three lines of waves near the shore.


If there is a beach in the foreground, create a layer of yellow sand, then a shade of blue along the water edge, then a line of white foam over that. Prussian blue shading just behind the foam makes it look like the wave is hitting the shore.;
, Start with a flat-edged brush. Dip the base of the brush in blue paint, then the tip of the brush in white or light blue paint. If you like, you can even divide the brush into three parts, using two shades of blue. Painting the waves with this technique automatically gives them some depth and shading.


This works best with acrylic paint. If you are using oil paint, just layer the different colors over each other.

, Move the brush in the same direction the waves are traveling. Each short stroke will create a small, choppy wave.


If you are using a more traditional approach than the two or three color brush described above, paint the waves from the base up, blending a darker blue into a lighter blue, and finishing with a white crest.

, These could be white for afternoon sun, or red and orange for a sunset scene. Also consider white or light blue flecks around the wave crests to represent foam.


Even in a daylight scene, a small touch of orange and white can increase the contrast with the sky.

, For a free-spirited, active painting, try finishing with a splatter of paint from your fingers. This works best on close-up images of the water, or on water in the foreground of a landscape.

Understand drawing.,
Observe eyes.,
Doodle eyes.,
Look over your doodles.,
Redraw the eye.,
Draw with detail.,
Create a simplified drawing.",How to Paint Eyes1," Drawing is a great practice for any aspiring painter. Drawing helps flush out the design properties before taking the design to paint. While drawing and painting are different mediums, the fundamentals are the same., If you want plenty of images and ideas, search google images for eyes and you’ll find more than you can swallow. Immerse yourself for inspiration. If you have a mirror nearby your canvas, then you have the best source for eyes: your own!

, Before going into the long lengths of planning and executing a painting of eyes, try messing around first. A great way to find your style is by doodling. Create a bunch of eyes in a quick manner. The point is to not think about what your drawing; that will come later., Look through the progression of eyes you drew and see how they matured. Select the eye you are most proud of. Don’t necessarily select the eye that most resembles an eye. Instead select an eye that looks best to you.

, Take out a pen or pencil and try your hand at recreating the eye you’re most proud of. Spend a little more time reformulating this eye as to when you were quickly doodling. Try to fill up a page in your sketchbook.


Look over your work and select the eye you are most proud of., Now spend more time recreating the latest eye. This time around, spend more attention to the details of the eye. Incorporate more details into your doodle. This is when you could start looking at real life eyes for inspiration. Incorporate as much detail into the framework you’ve created., Now draw an eye that is a simplified version of the detailed eye you just drew. Draw this onto canvas or whatever you choose to paint onto. This will act as the outline for the eyes you're about to paint.

Paint the entire background black.,
Paint starburst shapes with white paint.,
Paint colored starbursts over the white ones.,
Add sparkly streaks with glitter paint.",How to Paint Fireworks2," Cover the entire canvas or paper with black acrylic paint using a wide flat paintbrush. Use even strokes and spread the paint evenly. Make sure the black looks solid and no canvas or paper shows through. Allow the background to dry before proceeding.It usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes for acrylic paint to dry completely.
Lightly touch the paint to confirm it’s dry. If no paint comes off on your finger, proceed., Dip a flat paintbrush of medium width into white acrylic paint. Touch the loaded paintbrush to the canvas where you want to make your first firework shape. Spread the paint in a small circle to get it off your brush. Then, starting in the center of the white dot, pull the paint outward in all directions to create a starburst shape.Cover your canvas/paper with white starbursts – paint as many of them as you want. You will add color on top of the white paint.
The white background will help the color of the fireworks stand out from the black background.

, Choose at least three different colors for the fireworks. Use the flat brush to paint a colored starburst directly over a white one. Start with the center dot and then brush the colored paint outward. Alternate colors so that you have a variety of different colored fireworks in your painting.Use any combination of colors that appeals to you. Red, white, yellow, blue, green, pink and purple are all great choices.
If you aren’t sure what colors to pick, think about fireworks you’ve seen before, reference pictures or just use your imagination!

, Hold the glitter paint tube directly over the center of one of the fireworks. Squeeze the tube gently until the paint comes out. Create a streak of glitter that extends out from the center of the firework. Accent the fireworks with as many glitter streaks as you want.You can choose one glitter color, like silver or gold, to use on all the fireworks. You could also match the glitter to the fireworks – red glitter streaks for the red fireworks, blue glitter streaks for the blue fireworks, etc.

Squeeze different colors of tempera paint onto paper plates.,
Dip the bottom of a fork into one of the paint colors.,
Dip a new fork into another paint color.,
Cut a regular drinking straw in half.,
Get close to the paint and blow on it through the straw.",How to Paint Fireworks3," Each color should have its own plate and fork so the colors don’t get mixed up and muddy. Choose any colors that you want for your fireworks! Red, blue, green, yellow, purple and pink are all great choices. Make sure you're working on a sturdy flat surface.
The color of the paper you use is up to you. Plain white paper is great. Use dark colored paper if you want a night sky background.

, Then press the fork down firmly to leave a print of the fork’s tines on the paper. Move around in a circle, repeating the same action. This will create a circular starburst effect. Reload the fork with fresh paint if necessary to complete the circle.Feel free to use forks from your kitchen or plastic utensils – they both work well.

, You can press the new color on top of the first to create a multi-color effect. You can also create separate fireworks using different colors that don’t overlap with each other. Experiment with a few different approaches to see which you like the best.

Create as many firework shapes on the paper as you want with as many colors as you desire., Mix a small amount of water with the tempera paint to slightly thin out the consistency. Use a paintbrush to pick up some of the paint and drop it onto the paper. You may need to experiment a bit on a piece of scratch paper until you get the right consistency., This will create a streak effect. Blow at different angles to create different kinds of streaks. Add these anywhere on your paper! Create a variety of effects by experimenting with different amounts of paint, water and blow pressure.Feel free to add any finishing touches you like, such as painted streaks or glitter paint.
Allow the paint to dry completely before moving your artwork.

Brush the white on in light strokes.,
Expand the edges.,
Wait for the white to dry.,
Add shading.,
Use a different dry brush.,
Make the clouds smaller near the horizon.",How to Paint Clouds1," Whether you are creating a graduated blue sky or a sunrise, create the background before adding in the clouds.;
, That is, don't add any water to the brush before you use it. Pour out white paint on your palette. Add a little bit of white to the brush.

, You can do a landscaped painting with clouds just at the top. Alternatively, you can have the clouds be the whole painting.

, In gentle curving motions, brush the white onto the canvas. Keep the pressure light.

, Push the edges of the cloud out with your brush. Try to create the edges when you're running out of paint. That technique will give the clouds softer, feathery edges.

, It will make it easier to add the shading underneath.

, Create a grey for the shading. You can create a dark purple to use for grey with a deep blue, a rosy color, and a brown-red color. You can also create your own grey combination.

, Add a tiny bit of the grey to the brush. Wipe off any excess. Gently brush the underside of the clouds to give them depth.

, Things off in the distance look smaller, so make your clouds smaller and fuzzier as you approach the horizon. To make them fuzzier, add even less paint to your brush when you create them.

Examine detailed ""wave scapes."",
Practice color blending.,
Experiment with different techniques.,
Vary the tones and shades of the waves.",How to Paint Ocean Waves2," If you are painting a crashing storm or a surfer's dream wave, look at similar photographs and paintings before you get started. Look closely to get a sense of the shapes waves form, and how the colors vary in different areas.

, The trough of a wave tends to be darker than the crest. A great way to improve your coloring and practice blending techniques is to use pastels. These are easy to control and do not soak or tear the paper as you blend. Make a pastel painting using the following technique, either for its own sake or in preparation for your favorite medium:


Sketch an outline of the largest wave in light blue, and a few smaller surrounding waves.
Color the lowest third of the waves a slightly darker blue, using strokes in the direction of the wave.
Return to your lighter color and use the same technique to color the next third of the waves.
Tip the waves with white, adding curves and bubbling shapes to represent foam.
Blend the three layers together until it looks natural.

, Some artists paint waves with long, sweeping motions of the paintbrush, while others paint in smaller stages. Also experiment with sponges, brayers, and any other tools you have in your studio.

, If you want the water to be translucent, thin out the paint. To add depth to shadowed areas, use thicker layers of paint.

Paint the eyelids.",How to Paint Eyes2," You will use this as the base to paint the eye. There are different color combinations you can use depending on what skin tone you are going for.Try to recreate your own skin tone for if you’re unsure what skin tone to use.

, Use the outline you drew earlier if you want a guide. Paint two ovals close to each other. This will act as the foundation for the rest of the painting., The sclera is the white part of your eyes.The sclera in the eyes is never a pure white. Mix white paint with a touch of another color like light grey, light blue or light pink. Paint two ovals in the paint you just created. The scleras should be the same shape as the outline of the eyes, but smaller and inside the flesh toned outline.

, Add depth by shading and adding different tints. To make simple eyelashes you can draw with dark brown around the oval, but make sure to blend it well with the skin color. If you want to make more realistic eyelashes, you need a small brush and add the lashes one by one."
"
Create the iris.,
Add shading.,
Create the pupils.,
Add more details within the eye.",How to Paint Eyes3," Paint the iris to your desired eye color, in this example blue is being used. Add darker shades or other tints of the color to make a vivid eye. Start by simply creating a circle of the color you selected.


Paint a very thin line all the way around the iris (on the inside) and then use a dry brush to do spokes inwards towards the center. Think of a CD, the way the colors are angled to head inwards towards the hole in the center.

, Shade the eyes in keeping in mind where the light source is coming from and shade accordingly.Don't worry if the iris goes over the edges of your white paint, as you will add eyelids after the eyes are done so the eyes look well set in the face.

, Make the pupils solid black. Look at pictures for more references. They should be in the center of the iris created earlier.


Add eye sparkles. This is white part of the pupil where the light reflects off the surface of the eye., Add in the corner of the eye a pink tone in the fleshy parts of the eye and add some white. While you are doing that, add some nerves that run across the ovals of your eye. Make sure you use little paint and blend it well with the rest of the oval."
"
Gather the necessary supplies and find a flat, clean surface to work on.,
On a clean, white piece of paper, paint the green grass at the bottom.,
Make curved lines of medium thickness.,
Create the center of the flower.,
Add petals.,
Outline the petals with black or white paint if you'd like.",How to Paint Flowers," For reference, see the supply list near the bottom of this article.;
, Use short, light strokes and make the pieces of grass go in different directions so it looks more realistic. Use regular green and add light green if you'd like to get the 'highlighted' look or dark green strokes for shadow and texture.








, Using a darker shade of green, paint curved lines of medium thickness among the grass. These lines will become your flowers' stems, so make as many lines as you want flowers. The height of the lines should be quite a bit taller than the grass.









The thickness of the stem should be slightly thicker than the grass.
Add leaves or thorns to the stems to make the flowers look more realistic.

, Using whatever color you prefer, create a circle/oval about 1/2 inch above the tip of the flower stem. Leave room above the tip of the stem so that you can add petals.








, What color do you want your flower/s to be? You can mix colors, or just paint single color petals. Pick out the colors you want to use or mix colors to create new ones. Then, determine what shape you want the petals of the flowers to be. You may want to sketch the shape before you pain them. Connect the petals to the center of the flower. Connect the tip of the stem to somewhere in between two petals beneath the center.








,









Another optional step is to use a light blue colored oil pastel and lightly shade in a sky, then blend. Add a sun if you'd like.

Choose your graphite.,
Draw a circle with a compass.,
Paint with the pencil marks as guidelines.",How to Paint Circles1," A very light shade of graphite is ideal to prevent the marks from showing through your paint. This is especially important if you paint with watercolours or other thin paint, which requires a 6H pencil or an even paler option.


It's okay to have faint pencil lines showing through watercolour, as long as they aren't too obvious. Some artists even use this intentionally, sketching in pencil then applying a very thin wash of paint over it.;
, Insert the pencil into a drawing compass. Place the compass point against the paper and carefully rotate the compass to draw a precise circle.


Alternatively, place a circular object flat against the canvas and trace around it.

, Paint inside the pencil marks carefully, with a thin brush. If the pencil lines are dark enough to stand out, you can instead wash over the whole sketch, letting the pencil communicate the shape.

Make sure you have enough paint in your mix.,
Lightly dampen the paper.,
Add a bit of yellow ocher at the bottom.,
Fill your brush with ultramarine and water.,
Paint a lighter swath underneath the first.,
Keep adding lighter layers.,
Dry off your brush.,
Roll the brush across the sky.,
Dry the brush again.,
Add some grey.,
Remember to work quickly.",How to Paint Clouds2," The paint will dry about half as light as it first looks on the paper. So it should look a little brighter than is natural when you're first painting., Paint clean water across the paper, making it slightly damp., Gently paint in a light coating of yellow ocher near the bottom of the sky., Make it fairly dark. Paint across the top of the canvas with it., Add more water to your brush. Add more of the ultramarine. Paint underneath the top color, slightly overlapping. Make it lighter than the first layer., You want to create a fading effect towards the bottom layer. The bottom layer should be a mix of pale yellow and a light bit of blue, as you already painted the bottom yellow ocher., Wash the brush in the water, then dry it out on a paper towel., The dry brush will pick up the pigment and color from the page, leaving white areas for clouds. As you roll, you can curve the brush slightly to create the look of clouds., Between clouds, you will need to dry off the brush again. Otherwise, the brush will leave paint rather than absorbing it., Using a strong grey (such as a purely mix of red and ultramarine), brush it on the underside of one part of the cloud. Leave the other side in white to show where the light is hitting it., Watercolors dry quickly, so you must work fast to create this effect."
"
Create a background.,
Let the oil paint dry.,
Sketch out the clouds.,
Layer over the clouds in lighter colors.,
Add in patches of the background color.,
Add highlights in a cream color.",How to Paint Clouds3," Depending on the time of day, you could choose a light blue or a dark greyish purple. Paint the whole background in broad, even strokes., If you don't let it dry, you'll pick up the background paint in the clouds., Using a dry brush, add some white and black to the background color you used. Sketch out the basic areas where the clouds will go with the brush., Create shapes in the lighter colors. Work in circles to create cloud effects.To create lighter colors, add white to the original paint color as you go.

, If you want to outline the clouds, you can add in areas of the background color., You don't want the final highlights to be too stark against the other colors, so use an off-white or cream. Brush it around the shapes you created earlier, highlighting the tops of the clouds."
"
Find a circular object the right size for your project.,
Dab the paint directly with the object.,
Create a stencil instead.,
Make a piece of tape less sticky.,
Fasten the stencil to your artwork.,
Paint inside the circle.,
Carefully remove the stencil.",How to Paint Circles2," Items such as coffee cups, cereal bowls, and lids from coffee cans or oatmeal containers work well as circle patterns.


If you can't find anything the right size, cut out your own paper circles using a compass and scissors.

, If you're using thick paint and want to go for a textured effect, dip the circular object directly in the paint and place it against the canvas.


Using a glass rim allows you to paint a thin circular line, instead of a solid circle.

, Place the object on a blank sheet of heavy-duty paper and trace around it. Cut this circle out carefully with a sharp pair of scissors, and you'll be left with a stencil.


Alternatively, use a drawing compass to create a circle of any size.

, This may sound strange, but a fresh piece of tape can damage your paper or canvas. First, stick a couple pieces of tape to a pair of jeans, then peel them off. Repeat several times until the tape is only barely sticky.


Other fabric works as well, but jeans are best.

, Place the paper stencil over your artwork, so the circular hole is exactly where you want to paint. Fasten the stencil using the special pieces of tape.

, Apply the paint with a large brush, using thin, even strokes and avoiding drips or spills. You may want to use a thinner brush for the outer rim of the circle.


Before you move on, step back a few steps to get a better view. Touch up the circle if you want more even coverage or a different brush stroke pattern.

, Slowly lift the tape to reduce the chance of tearing the tape or picking up paint. You can reuse this stencil, but you may need to prepare more ""special tape.""

Mix together Pearl Ex and embossing powder.,
Stamp the desired image on your paper.,
Sprinkle the tinted powder over the stamp.,
Heat the area with a heat gun.,
Wipe away excess Pearl Ex.",How to Use Pearl Ex Pigments1," Combine one part Pearl Ex pigment with two parts clear embossing powder, mixing them together in a small bowl with a plastic spoon until evenly blended.The exact amount of embossing powder you need will vary depending on how dramatic you want the effect to be and how thin the paper is. More absorbent paper requires a greater amount of embossing powder.
For use with an average sized stamp and heavy cardstock, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) Pearl Ex pigment and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) clear embossing powder should be sufficient.;
, Load a stamp with clear embossing liquid and press the stamp firmly onto a heavy sheet of paper.


cardstock and other heavy-weight papers work better than light papers do.
Make sure that the surface you want to emboss faces up as you stamp it.
Alternatively, you could spread the clear embossing fluid on a stamp pad instead of applying it directly to the stamp itself. Load the stamp with the treated ink of the pad before stamping it onto the paper.
After stamping the image, thoroughly clean away all of the embossing fluid from the stamp. If the embossing fluid is left on the stamp, it can harden and ruin the rubber.

, Gently sprinkle the enhanced embossing powder over the stamped design. Make sure that the entire design has been covered by the powder.


Lift the paper and carefully tip it upside-down so that the majority of excess powder will fall off. Gently tap the back of the paper to encourage the excess powder to drop.

, Pass a heat gun over the entire design. Continue heating the area until the lines of the design lift above the surface of the paper.


Hold the heat gun 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) away from the surface of the paper and move it around continuously as you apply the heat.
Using too much concentrated heat can result in scorch marks, so you need to work carefully during this step.

, Use tissue paper, tracing paper, coffee filters, or another patch of soft paper to wipe away any excess Pearl Ex powder. Once the excess has been removed, the project is complete.


Allow the area to cool and set for one to two minutes before brushing away any excess powder.
If soft paper is not available, you could brush away the excess with a soft-bristled paintbrush.

Consider the Real Color Wheel.,
Make Red: Use transparent Indian yellow PY:153 (Dioxine Nickel Complex) which has an orange mass-tone, transparent Indian yellow PY:150 (Nickel Azo Complex) which has a brown mass-tone or PY:100 Tartrazine which is water based together with the color magenta transparent PR:122 (Quinacridone).

,
Make Blue: Use transparent magenta PR:122 (quinacridone) mixed with transparent cyan PB:15.3 (phthalocyanine).These colors were made with the transparent primaries.





,
Make Green: Use transparent cyan PB:15.3 (phthalocyanine) mixed with transparent Yellow PY:150 (Nickel azomethine) or PY:100 (water-based Tartrazine).,
Using Transparent Yellow:

Transparent Indian yellow Org/side is a red/brown hue in its mass-tone and has a cad.,
Yellow darkens to brown, Cyan darkens to blue:

In the RGB light model that is used with the computer yellow darkens to a greenish yellow and cyan darkens to a greenish cyan.",How to Use the Real Color Wheel,";
,,,, yellow light hue as its tint-tone. Transparent Indian yellow Brown/side is an ocher/brown hue in its mass-tone and a cad. yellow light hue in its tint-tone. All eight transparent Indian yellows lighten to cadmium yellow hues. PY:150, PY:153 & PY:100 make the brightest yellow, equal to cadmium yellow light or lemon yellow., Neither of these colors represent nature, they just subtract light to get darker. Rembrandt said that yellow goes through red and brown to get darker. In the sky cyan gets darker through blue. Crystal elements and the Real Color Wheel get darker this way also."

Describe cats.,
Depict the cat's body, head, tail and legs, in shorthand, on a practice page of watercolor paper.,
Trace an outline of a circle onto a piece of 11 x 14 inch piece of watercolor paper using pencil and a dinner plate as a template.,
Pencil in cats going around the circle.,Choose wisely for the centermost cat, as all roads will lead the viewer's eye to that bulls eye.,
Activate your paints with water.,
Paint around the cats in a color that will show them off.",How to Paint Cats in Watercolor in a Circular Format," On a piece of drawing paper, get into a cat state of mind by writing what cats represent to you.  Sleek, stretchy, serpentine, elegant, night stalkers, hunters, prowlers, silent, aloof, clean, dainty and self sufficient, and so forth.
, Keep the drawing small, approximately and inch and as simple as possible.

, Add rings to the interior of the circle, using smaller plates, graduating sizes until you come to the center. Use the lid of a bottle to make a 2 to 2 1/2  inch circle.

, Poses that bend, stretch, and elongate will take up space so use them to advantage. Try adding cat accessories and accoutrements such as mice, toys, balls of yarn, kittens, and a soft rug.

,, Use 1/2 to 3/4 inch flat brushes to begin painting your cats.  Block in the cat's bodies with as few strokes as possible. When dry, return with smaller, pointed brushes and add details.

, Step back and view the painting and decide how to treat the area around the circle. It can be kept simple to allow the circle to be the predominant feature

Choose your paints.,
Reserve space in the background.,
Choose the background color.,
Paint the sky.,
Touch up the edges of the canvas with the darkest blue.,
Add the clouds.,
Paint the sun.,
Create the foreground.,
Add highlights to the surrounding clouds and background.",How to Paint a Sunset on Canvas," Oil paints or acrylics are the most common choices for canvas. If using poster paints, mix them with white glue before you begin.

Watercolor paints will not stick to the canvas surface.;
, Before you paint the sky, make sure to save some areas for the clouds, and of course the sun itself. Leave these blank, or paint them very lightly. If you like, use light pencil sketches to outline these areas and mark the horizon line., A late evening sunset typically has a blue background. Pick a blue without a dominant purple undertone, and pick several shades of this ranging from dark blue to sky blue. The start of a sunset can also use blue if you want to increase the contrast between sun and background, but an orange and yellow sky is another option.

If using acrylic paint, start with Prussian blue or another dark blue. Dilute it in stages as you paint to achieve different tints. You can dilute more than you would for paper, since canvas will not soak or tear. That said, eventually the paint will fail to stick, especially on treated canvas.
Some evening skies include reddish or purple undertones. If this is what you're going for, use magenta, Prussian blue, and crimson.

, Start with the darkest color at the top of your canvas. Paint in downward strokes, and gradually move on to lighter shades (or more diluted paint) as you approach the sun. Blend together the shades using water (for acrylic paints) or thinner (for oil paints).

If painting an orange sky, make the area around the sun a reddish orange. Lighten to a yellow sky as you move farther out, then dab and blend in reddish orange here and there throughout.

, If painting a blue sky, put a little of the darkest blue on a piece of cloth or cotton. Dab the edges of the canvas very lightly and blend it into the lighter shades., Dip a bristle brush in white paint and squeeze out the excess. Hold the brush upright and punch it against the canvas to create clouds.

This technique may damage paintbrushes with synthetic hairs.

, Here's one approach you could use:

Paint a dark yellow base coat using a large brush, painting with rough, short strokes.
Gradually add orange in short strokes, scattered throughout the sun.
Outline the circle in red with a small brush.
Dab the wet, red paint with a tissue to blend it into the rest of the sun.

, Remember, any objects in front of the sun should be much darker than they would be in the daylight. Depending on position, some may even be silhouettes. Others may be shaded on on side and cast long, angled shadows., Use the same hue of paint you used for the sun. Blend these highlights into the clouds on the side facing the sun. Add highlights on the foreground as well, especially if you are painting a sunset over water."

Squeeze some paint into the balloon.,
Remove the balloon and fill it with air.,
Knot the end of the balloon.,
Make more balloons.,
Prepare to get messy.,
Pop the balloons over a sheet of poster paper.",How to Splatter Paint with Balloons1," Open a bottle of washable paint and stretch a balloon over the opening. Flip the balloon and the bottle upside down and give the bottle a squeeze. Don't fill the entire balloon with paint.Tempera and poster paint will work the best, but you can use acrylic too.;
, Carefully tip the bottle right-side-up. Pinch the neck of the balloon and pull it off of the bottle. Pump air into the balloon until the balloon is nice and full.


You can also blow air into the balloon if you are careful and have strong lungs.

, Pinch the end of the balloon and pull it off of the pump. Wrap the balloon's tail around your finger to make a loop, then pull the end through it to make a knot.

, Use a different color of paint for each balloon. If you want to, match the color of the balloon to the paint you are using. This way, you can tell what's inside it. Experiment with using more paint in some balloons than others.

, Put on a set of clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Find a spot outside that is easy to clean, or where paint splatters are okay. A driveway would be ideal. Wearing sunglasses or goggles would also be a good idea, in case the paint splatters., Spread out a sheet of poster paper on the ground. Arrange the balloons on the paper. Pop them by stomping on them or poking them with pins or wooden skewers.You can stomp on the balloons barefoot or with rain boots.If this is for an older child, pin the balloons through the tail to a foam core board. Prop the board up, then pop the balloons by throwing darts at them."

Pinch off a piece of white polymer clay.,
Mix in the Pearl Ex.,
Preheat the oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).,
Form the clay as desired.,
Brush on additional color as needed.,
Bake the clay.,
Coat with varnish.",How to Use Pearl Ex Pigments2," Grab a piece of white polymer clay large enough for your intended project. Knead it in your hands for 30 to 60 seconds, or until it becomes more flexible.


You can also experiment by mixing Pearl Ex pigment into pre-colored clay to produce different shades. For instance, you can add a glittery pink Pearl Ex pigment to a matte pink clay to give the clay a sparkle effect.

, Carefully dust a little Pearl Ex pigment over the clump of polymer clay, then knead it into the clay.


You must knead the clay and pigment together for a few minutes, or until the color is evenly distributed throughout the entire piece of clay.

, Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil, wax paper, or parchment paper.


The exact baking temperature may vary depending on the brand of polymer clay you opt to use. Always check the package instructions to determine the right way to bake the clay.

, Use any standard molding method to sculpt the tinted polymer clay into the pieces you wish to make.


Polymer clay can be used to form a variety of pieces, including small sculptures, beads, pendants, ornaments, and containers, among other things.
You can form polymer clay free-handed, or you can use a variety of tools and molds to help you create shapes.
If desired, you can also apply Pearl Ex pigment directly to a polymer clay mold by brushing it on with a soft-bristled paintbrush. Turn the mold over and lightly tap the back to dump any excess before pressing the clay into the mold. This will result in a more vibrant shade, and the pigment also makes it easier to release the clay from the mold.

, If you want to create a bolder shade of pigment on part of the piece, you can do so by dusting Pearl Ex pigment directly over the area with a paintbrush or cotton swab.


Press the pigment into the clay with just enough force to make it stick. The best way to do this is by gently rubbing it in with your ring finger. You need to apply a gentle amount of pressure to avoid damaging the shape of the clay as you work.

, Place the clay on your prepared baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the oven. Allow the clay to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until hardened.


As with the baking temperature, the baking/curing time can vary based on the brand of clay you use. Check the instructions before proceeding.

, After the clay cools, brush or spray clear varnish over the surface to seal in the surface pigment. Once the varnish dries, the piece is finished.


Note that varnish is only necessary if you coated the surface with Pearl Ex pigment. Pigment that has been kneaded into the clay will remain in place even without varnish, but clear varnish can still be used to give the piece a glossy sheen.
For best results, spray the varnish out over the surface and allow the mist to fall onto it from above. Spraying the varnish directly onto the surface can cause the powder to blow away and may also result in uneven coats or spray marks.Liquid varnish can be applied directly to the surface with a paintbrush. Use a sponge brush if you want to avoid the risk of brush stroke lines.

Combine Pearl Ex with gum arabic.,
Blend with water.,
Paint as desired.,
Reconstitute with water as needed.",How to Use Pearl Ex Pigments3," Mix four parts Pearl Ex pigment with one part powdered gum arabic. Stir the two powders together until evenly blended.Consider mixing the paint in a plastic well palette, just as you would mix most traditional paints.

, Slowly add water to the blended powder, mixing continuously, until you achieve the paint consistency you desire.


The exact amount can vary, but usually, you will need four parts water for every one part gum arabic. This also means that the amount of water you use will be similar to the amount of Pearl Ex pigment used.

, Use this paint as you would use any other watercolor paint.


If necessary, you can lightly trace designs and outlines onto cardstock or heavy paper using a pencil. These traced designs can serve as a guide, so you can paint over the pencil marks with the Pearl Ex based paint.
When painting a picture with more than one color of Pearl Ex paint, you should mix all paint colors first before you begin painting.

, As the paint sits, it may start to dry out. You should be able to reconstitute the paint by slowly mixing more water into it.


You will not need to add the same amount of water as you originally used, however. Start with a much smaller amount and gradually increase it until the paint returns to the correct consistency.

Throw the balloons at the paper.",How to Splatter Paint with Balloons2," Fit a water balloon over a bottle of washable paint. Turn the bottle over and squirt some paint into the balloon. Don't fill the entire balloon with paint, however. You need room for the water.Liquid watercolor, acrylic, tempera, and poster paint will all work great.
This method will give you a watered-down, tie-dye effect.

, Tip the bottle right-side-up and pull the balloon off. Stretch the end of the balloon over a faucet or hose. Hold the balloon by the bottom, then turn the water on. Let the balloon fill slowly, then turn the faucet off., Pinch the end of the balloon and pull it off of the faucet. Place the balloon down into the sink, then carefully knot the end.

, Fill each balloon with a different color of paint. Experiment with using different amounts of paint and water. You can also shake the balloons to dilute the paint further.


Keep the balloons in a bucket or plastic bin. Be careful not to pop them!

, Put on a set of clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Head outside where the paint won't ruin anything. Tape a sheet of poster paper against a wall or fence. You can also prop a foam cord board up against a wall/fence instead.If you aren't allowed to use the wall or fence, spread the paper on the ground, and stand up on a bench or chair.

, The balloons will burst open when they hit the paper and splatter it with paint. The water will mix with the paint and create a cool, tie-dye or watercolor effect.If you are standing on a bench or chair, simply drop the balloon onto the paper.

Cover paper with your desired stencil.,
Apply spray adhesive to the area.,
Let the adhesive set slightly.,
Brush on the Pearl Ex.,
Remove any excess.",How to Use Pearl Ex Pigments4," Choose a stencil design that appeals to you, then place that stencil on top of a flat sheet of paper.


Keep the stencil flat and in place by holding it with paper clips or tape.
Protect any background area beyond the perimeter of the stencil by covering it with scrap paper. Tape this scrap paper to the stencil to prevent it from falling off.
Note that you may wish to cover the entire working area beneath the paper with a Teflon pressing sheet or cookie sheet to help catch any excess Pearl Ex pigment. As long as the pigment is not contaminated by adhesive or other debris, it can be reused for other projects.

, Lightly coat the stenciled area with spray adhesive, holding the can approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the paper as you spray it.Always apply spray adhesive in a well-ventilated area.
Alternatively, you could apply standard PVA (white) glue to the paper using a paintbrush. Apply an even coat of glue to each opening in the stencil design.
To create fine lines, dots, or other raised features, draw them on using the tip of a standard PVA glue bottle.

, Allow the adhesive to set for two minutes before continuing. After it sets, remove the stencil.


Giving the adhesive time to set minimizes the risk of smudging the stenciled design. Even so, you should still remove the stencil, scrap paper, paperclips, and tape very carefully to avoid smears.
Do not let the adhesive dry completely. It should still be tacky to the touch.

, Coat a dry paintbrush with Pearl Ex pigment, then brush the powder over the adhesive until you fill in the entire design.


Note that you can use multiple colors of Pearl Ex pigment, but you will need to apply each with a different paintbrush to avoid accidental blending.

, Allow the adhesive to finish drying. After it dries, dust away any excess powder with a dry, clean paintbrush.


Once the adhesive dries, the project is complete.

Emulate famous food artists.",How to Use Food for Art," Still life painting is a classical form of studying inanimate objects. Take an acrylic or oil still life class at your local community college, university or community center and you will find yourself painting fruit, cheese, place settings, cornucopias and many other edible subjects.


After you have taken a still life class, you can begin to set up your own still life studies at home. Place a few different types of food on a wooden table and begin painting. Challenge yourself to paint a new food-based still life every day.;
, Although they may seem like a child's project, both children and adults can creatively color Easter eggs with a number of different art supplies. Try 1 of the following Easter egg art projects:


Hard boil eggs. Take them in an oven mitt when they are still hot and apply crayon wax to the surface. The wax melts to the hot surface creating a marble look. Apply different colored crayons to accent your first color. Allow them to dry by creating a small ring out of paper and setting it on top. Once they are dry, you can display them on Easter or during mealtime.
Hard boil eggs and allow them to cool. Wrap rubber bands around the eggs horizontally and vertically. Try many different patterns to create different abstract patterns. Stop when you have created a net around your egg. Soak the egg in Easter egg dye or a mix of water and food coloring and white vinegar. Remove the egg and allow it to dry, then take off the rubber bands. Put new bands on and place it in another dye color for a two toned effect.
Hard boil eggs. Allow them to cool and dry. Tear off small pieces of dyed crepe paper. Soak each paper individually in water and place it on a section of the egg. Repeat that with other colors and shapes of crepe paper until the egg is covered in moist crepe paper squares. Allow the squares to sit for 5 minutes and then remove them. Allow the egg to dry, and it will look like a stained glass egg.
Repeat any of these egg decorating methods with hollowed, sometimes called ""blown-out"" eggs. If you are a good painter, study Ukrainian egg painting, which uses small brushes to create intricate designs on empty eggs.

, This type of photography is a difficult art and a skill you can leverage in the business world. Take a photography class at a photography school, read books and practice the best way to convey the delicious look of food through the lens.

, Search online and specifically on You Tube for vegetable and Thai carving tutorials.


Find an ebook or library book on food carving. Some culinary schools also offer classes on learning to do decorative fruit and vegetable carving.

, Once you learn to make cappuccinos and lattes, you can learn to draw faces, designs and shapes in the top of the foam. Search for ""latte art"" on the Internet to find good examples of this rare food art.

, If you've ever made Christmas cookies, then you know that cookie cutters, icing and piping bags can create a number of intricate cookie decorations. Construct your own cookie cutters from plastic, tin or milk carton cardboard, and then experiment with frosting colors.

, With this child-friendly art project, your food is your art supply.


Clean and dry potatoes. Cut them in half across the narrow section. With a knife, carve a shape into the freshly cut end of the potato. Repeat this with other potatoes and other shapes. Once you have carved your shapes, children can join in the craft.
Ready fabric paint to stamp on shirts or bags. Ready acrylic paint to stamp on paper. Dip the stamps in the paint and push them onto the paper or fabric. Repeat with other stamps to create a design.

, This fairly well known food art can be as intricate, abstract or specific as you want to make it. Search for images on the Internet, find patterns or simply hollow out a number of pumpkins as they are harvested and practice.

, With the interest in food art growing, images from dozens of pioneering artists can be found on the Internet. Look up 1 of the following artists and try to create similar artwork according to your artistic prowess.


Search for ""Foodscapes"" by Carl Warner. Using a mixture of food, photography and graphic design, Warner emulates natural landscapes with broccoli, mushrooms, garlic and more. Take a landscape photograph and try to recreate it with food.
Find Jim Victor the food sculptor. Victor carves butter, chocolate, cheese and even sandwich makings to look like people and places. If you like this kind of art, you can enter it into contests across the country.
Search for images of jelly bean art by Pete Rocha. By gathering gallons of jelly beans, you can plan an image and create it with colors, similar to making mosaics with tiles. Make sure to glue them on to a hard platform.
Look up ""Food Play"" by Joost Elffers and Saxton Freymann. These creative artists create animals using a mixture of different produce. They create pigs from zucchini, penguins from eggplant and sheep from cauliflower.

Use matte finish in high traffic rooms.,
Use dark or bold shades of matte paint.,
Think about using a matte finish to create stripes.",How to Use Matte Paint1," While you can technically use matte paint anywhere in your home, it's particularly helpful to use matte paint in high traffic rooms like kitchens and hallways. Matte finishes are very durable and tend to conceal imperfections and smears, making them ideal for areas prone to damage.Matte finishes also hold up well under humidity, making them a great choice for the kitchen.;
, Matte paints work well if you want darker, bolder colors. Glossier paints can make bold shades, like bright reds, look overwhelming, but the played down look of matte works well with such colors. Darker colors turn out great with matte paint as well. Try matte paints in deep blacks, purples, and blues ., Matte paint can be used to create stripes on a wall. You can either use two different shades of matte to make stripes over a wall. You can also use the same shade, but use a matte paint with a semi-gloss paint. This will create an illusion of stripes, as the stripes will be marked by texture rather than color.If you want a very dramatic look, try varying the finish and the color. For example, try black and white stripes. Paint the white stripes in a semi-gloss paint and paint the black ones with a matte finish.

",How to Use Glass Paints," Glass paint for small art projects like painting designs on wine glasses, mugs, and cups can be acquired at most local arts and crafts stores. Easy to use oven curing glass paint is best for small artistic glass painting projects. Pebeo glass paints work well for small artistic glass painting applications. These paints are inexpensive and are widely available in small bottles, paint pens, and markers. Small projects, like those listed above, can be performed at home with minimal supplies. General supplies needed include:


Glass paint
Artistic paint brushes
Paper towels
Small work table;
, It requires permanent bonding. These paints must resist various weather conditions, UV rays, temperature fluctuation, mineral deposits, chemicals, cleaners, and more.


There are a small group of companies who offer finished “back painted glass” for the glass industry. Most of these companies are located outside the USA such as Decoglaze Glass Splashbacks in Australia and Glass Kitchen Splashbacks in the United Kingdom. Back painted glass is also available in the USA through companies that use glass paint with permanent glass surface bonding properties.
Some companies use a large format oven baking process to bond specialty powder coat paints to glass, others use specialty foreign glass paints combined with heat lamps for curing.

, The most advanced glass paints available today are formulated with an active glass surface molecular modifying technology better known as “nanotechnology”. This technology ensures a true permanent glass bond in one easy step. These paints can easily be sprayed or rolled on any glass surface and cured at room temperature. In the USA, glass paint such as self priming glass paint contains this nanotechnology.

, Painting glass for the above applications requires more stringent handling and application procedures. These paints have solvent based organic odors that should not be inhaled and require ventilation and the use of organic filtered half face respirators.


Air supplied hoods need to be used if you must work in an area with low ventilation.
Solvent resistant gloves and full body Tyvek suits should also be worn when painting to avoid over exposure.
Glass can be painted in almost any location such as outdoors, in paint booths, in garages, and really anywhere that you can stand up a piece of glass.
A good method for painting glass on-site is to wet the surrounding floor and walls with water from a hose. This will hold down any dust that could cause a problem while painting.

, They include:


Permanent bonding glass paint
Paint mixing cup
Disposable paint filter screens
Proper respirator
Gloves
Tyvek suit
HVLP spray paint gun
Air filter
Air compressor
Acetone
Paper towels
Rubbing alcohol

Experiment on doors and trims first.,
Clean your walls.,
Add your matte paint to the walls.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Use Matte Paint2," Apply matte paint to small, unnoticeable corners of doors and trims. This way, you can let the matte paint dry on to see the effect. Make sure it's the effect you want before applying matte finish to your walls., Walls should be free of any noticeable mess before you begin painting. This will remove any dust or debris, ensuring that dirt and grime does not get trapped under the wall.You don't need to do anything special in regards to cleaning your walls. Clean as you normally would during a routine house cleaning, using your regular cleaning supplies.

, Use a narrow brush first to paint around the trim, windows, and doors. Then, use a roller to paint the walls by rolling the paint on line by line.When dipping your brush, only dunk it about a quarter of an inch into the paint. Then, swipe any excess paint off the brush using the sides of your paint can.
Make sure there's enough paint on your rollers that paint is applied easily, without a patchy or faint look. However, do not glob paint onto your rollers. If your rollers are dripping with paint, you're using too much.

, Drying times for paint vary greatly. Refer to your paint can to see how long it will take your paint to dry. In general, it's advisable to wait roughly 28 hours."

Look into semi-gloss options for a bolder look.,
Try a satin paint for something subtle.,
Avoid single-stage paints.,
Go for a double-stage matte paint in most circumstances.",How to Use Matte Paint3," The majority of matte finishes used for a car are semi-gloss, so this is a versatile option that should work well. This type of finish does give your car a slight shine, like other semi-gloss finishes, but reflects significantly less light. Your car may look a little polished, but it will not be a bold or flashy look.If you go the semi-gloss route, be careful when waxing your car in the future. Traditional wax can harm a semi-gloss finish, so go for waxes specifically designed to be used on matte paint.

, Satin paint is a type of matte finish that has a subtler effect than semi-gloss options. It reflects even less light. This can be a good option if you want something very played down.Usually, satin finishes are done in black. However, you can apply them in other colors if you really want to, but it may be more difficult to find colorful satin paints.

, A single-stage matte paint is applied without a clear coat on top. While this can save some time and money, it provides less protection from dust and damage. Dual or multi-stage matte paints are covered with a clear coat that shields your car from potential damage. In general, they're easier to maintain and provide more protection than other single-stage paints., A double-stage matte paint is usually sufficient to give your car gloss while protecting it from damage. Multi-stage paints aren't necessary for protection and are primarily used for aesthetic purposes, such as creating bolder colors. Unless you want a very bold look, a double-stage matte paint should be sufficient. This will save time and money."

Sand the car.,
Clean your car.,
Do a test swatch before applying your matte paint.,
Tape off the areas you don't want painted.,
Apply your matte paint.",How to Use Matte Paint4," Before applying matte paint to your car, you want to make sure you sand away any rough surfaces. This will help the paint adhere properly. Examine your car carefully for any rough spots like scratches. Use a #220 sandpaper to buff out any imperfections.Use circular motions when sanding for the best results., Never apply any type of paint to a dirty vehicle. Surface dirt, dust, and grime can easily get trapped under the paint if it's not washed off first. Either clean your car in your garage by hosing it down or take it to the car wash. Make sure there is no dirt, debris, road dust, or other grime on your car prior to cleaning.If you've never cleaned your car yourself before, test out your cleaner on a small portion of the car before applying it to the full car.

, Find a small, unnoticeable portion of your car. Apply the paint there and allow it to dry so you can see the kind of color your matte finish produces. If you like the effect, you can apply a layer of matte paint to your car., Use masking tape, duct tape, or painting tape to tape off the areas you don't want painted. This usually includes areas near the tires, doors, handles, and so on., Paint is usually applied to a car using a sprayer. Spray paint across your car by holding the sprayer's nozzle six inches from the car and moving the nozzle in side to side motions. Keep going over your car until the full surface is covered with matte paint. You should only hold down the trigger of the spray gun while you're actively moving the gun sideways. Do not hold down the trigger when changing direction as this can cause paint to run.Refer to your instruction's manual to see if more than one coat of matte paint is required. Usually, you need to apply at least two coats. If multiple coats are required, you usually have to wait anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour between coats.

Apply the first coat of chalkboard paint and let it dry.,
Apply a second coat of paint and let it dry.,
Remove the painter's tape.,
Prepare the surface for use.",How to Use Chalkboard Paint1," You can turn almost any wooden surface into a chalkboard, or you can use chalkboard paint to create labels on boxes and storage containers. This section will not only teach you how to paint a wooden surface, but also how to prepare it for painting.;
, The texture of the wood will still show after you have painted your piece, so if you want a smoother finish, you will need to sand it down with 120 to 200 grit sandpaper. Use a sanding block, and sand along the wood grain.Once you are done sanding, wipe the surface clean with a tack cloth to get rid of any of any dust caused by the sanding.

, This will help you get a nice, sharp edge. You can create different shapes by using adhesive stencils, or make your own out of thin sheets of plastic.

, Once you have sanded your piece, apply some primer to the area you are going to paint. You can use a regular, flat paintbrush, a foam brush, or a paint roller. You can also use a spray-on primer as well. Once you are done painting, wait for the primer to dry. This can take anywhere between two to four hours. Refer to the instructions on the can for specific drying times, as each brand is different.


If you are using a spray-on primer, hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface, and apply the primer on using light, even strokes. Make sure that you are in a well-ventilated area.

, Depending on how textured the wood grain is, you may need to sand the primed surface. Once the primer has dried, use a fine-grit (120 to 220 grit)sandpaper to gently sand the surface down. Make sure that you go with the grain. Wipe away any dust with a tack cloth, and reapply the primer., After the primer has dried, you can apply the first coat of paint using a regular, flat paintbrush, a foam brush, or a paint roller. You can also use chalkboard spray paint as well. When applying the paint, make sure that you go along the wood grain. Most paint will dry within two to four hours. Read the manufacturer's recommendations on the container for more specific drying times.


If you are using a spray-on chalkboard paint, make sure that you are in a well-ventilated area. Hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface and apply the paint in light, even strokes.

, Once the first coat of chalkboard paint has dried, apply a second coat, but this time go against the grain. If you cannot see the grain, then paint in the opposite direction—so if you painted up-and-down the first time, paint left-to-right the second time.

, Once the paint has dried, use a craft knife or scissors, to lightly score the edges where the tape meets the paint. This lessens the chances of the paint ripping when you remove the tape. Once you have scored the edges, pull the tape off, slowly and carefully.


If the are any uneven areas, either fill them in with paint using a fine-tipped brush, or scrape them off using your fingernail or a craft knife.

, Let the paint cure for three days. Once the paint has cured, rub white chalk over the entire painted surface, then wipe it off using a damp cloth. You can now write or draw on your surface.Refer to the manufacturer's directions on the can for more specific curing times. Some craft-grade paints are ready to be used in as little as 24 hours, while others may require more than three days to finish curing.

Prime the surface by covering it with chalk.",How to Use Chalkboard Paint2," You can turn most walls into a fun, interactive surface with chalkboard paint. This works great in kitchens, offices, and playrooms. It allows you to write recipes and shopping lists. It can also be used as an outlet for your creativity. This section will teach you how to apply chalkboard paint to a wall.

, If the wall you are planning has anything on it, you will need to move it out of the way. If you are unable to move large items, such as appliances, then consider covering them with a protective plastic cloth.

, You can either remove the light switches, outlet covers, and baseboards, or you can cover them with painter's tape. Cover any window sills with painter's tape as well. Be sure to seal the tape using a pallet knife or a flat painter's knife.

, Unless you will be screwing something back into the hole, you will need to fill it in using wall filler. Any holes or dents in the wall will remain after you paint the wall, so you will need to fill them in.

, In order to help create a smooth surface and help the chalkboard paint adhere better, you will need to prime the surface of your wall. There are two ways you can do it:


You can sand the wall using a sanding pole. Once you are done, make sure to seep and mop up any dust. If your house is from the 1970s or older, the walls may contain lead-based paint. Be sure to use respiratory protection so as not to get yourself sick.You can also paint it with primer instead.Simply apply the primer with a paint roller and wait for it to dry. This will take two to four hours, but refer to the can for more specific directions.

, If your wall is still bumpy and textured, even after priming it, you may need to apply wall liner. Heavily-textured walls, such as brick and drywall, will retain their texture even after painting. You will need to cut the wall liner down to the width of your wall (not the height). How you apply the liner will depend on what type of liner you buy:If you bought a wall liner with an adhesive backing, you will need to soak it in water for about 10 minutes. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more specific directions, as each brand will be different. Once the back of the liner is tacky, start applying it to the wall. Align the first piece with the top of the wall, where the ceiling begins, and be sure to smooth out any air bubbles or ripples. Apply the next piece just below it. Keep doing this until the entire wall is covered.
If you bought a plain wall liner, without any adhesive, you will need to apply the adhesive to the back of the liner yourself. Some adhesives come premixed, while others need to be mixed with water. Once the adhesive is ready, spread it onto the back of the wall liner, then press it to the wall, just where the ceiling begins and the wall ends. The paper should extend the entire width of the wall. Be sure to smooth out any air bubbles or ripples. Apply the next piece just below it. Keep doing this until the entire wall is coated.

, Using a paint brush, start applying the paint around the windows (if they are in the wall you are painting) and around the wall edges. This means that, if you are painting an entire wall, you will be painting the crease between the walls and the crease where the wall and ceiling meet. Wait for the paint to dry, about two to four hours, and apply a second coat.

, Do not pour all of the paint out at once. Not only will you be painting in small sections, but the paint may dry before you have finished using it. Whenever you refill your paint pan, be sure to stir the paint so that the particles do not settle.

, Apply the paint using an up-down-up-down motion. Work in small sections at a time. Wait for the paint to fully dry. This will take two to four hours, but refer to the manufacturer's instructions on the can for more specific drying times. Be sure to clean your paint roller before setting aside while you wait for the paint to dry. If you don't, the paint may dry on the roller, ruining it.

, Once the first layer has completely dried, you may apply a second coat, using the same up-and-down motion as before. Let the paint dry for three days; this will allow the paint to cure and make it ready to be used as a chalkboard.

, Once the paint has dried to the touch, you can start returning any appliances to their former positions. Wait until the paint has cured, however, before removing the painter's tape.

, After the paint has dried and cured, you will need to prepare the surface for use by covering it with chalk. Once you have the entire surface covered, wipe it clean again with a damp cloth. Your wall is now ready to be used.

Use chalkboard paint to personalize candle holders, mason jars, and wine glasses.,
Clean the glass surface with rubbing alcohol.,
Block off any areas you don't want painted with painter's tape.,
Prime the surface of the glass.,
Paint on the first layer of chalkboard paint and wait for it to dry.,
Apply a second coat and let it dry.,
Remove the painter's tape.,
Prepare the surface for use with chalk.,
Wash your glass surface with care.",How to Use Chalkboard Paint3," Chalkboard paint will adhere to glass surfaces, but you will need to handle the piece with care after you have painted it so that the paint will not chip. This section will instruct you on how to apply chalkboard paint to glass.


In order to paint porcelain mugs and plates, you will need special chalkboard paint for porcelain. Most such paints will require longer curing times, or will need to be baked in the oven once the paint has dried. Paint your porcelain mug or paint, and then refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more specific curing times and baking temperatures.Some paints need several weeks to cure, while others must be cured for a few days and then baked in your oven.

, Soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe the surface of the glass clean. This removes any oil and residue that might prevent the paint and primer from sticking properly.If you do not have any rubbing alcohol, you can use glass cleaner instead.

, In order to get sharp, clean lines, you will need to cover the areas that you do not want painted with painter's tape.


You can also use adhesive stencils, or make your own by cutting shapes out of thin sheets of plastic.

, In order to get the chalkboard paint to stick to the glass, you will need to prime it. There are two ways in which you can do it:


Prime the surface you want painted with spray-on or paint-on primer. Be sure to use one intended for glass surfaces and to let it dry completely. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions on the can for more specific drying times, as each brand is different. Most primers will dry within two to four hours.
Buff the surface of the glass with steel wool.Be sure to wipe the surface down again with rubbing alcohol to get rid of any dust caused by the buffing.

, You can use a regular paintbrush or a foam brush. You can also use chalkboard spray paint instead, which will give you the smoothest finish, but it may not be as durable and be prone to chipping and scratching.Wait until the paint has dried before moving on to the next coat. Refer to the paint can for specific drying times; just because the paint feels dry when you touch it doesn't mean that it has completely dry. This can take anywhere between two to four hours, although some craft-grade brands might be ready in less than an hour.


If you are using spray-on paint, hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface you are painting, and apply a light, even coat.

, Once the first coat has dried, apply a second coat. You will need to let the paint cure for three days before you can use it as a chalkboard.

, Lightly score the edges of the painter's tape with a craft knife or scissors, and pull the tape off. By scoring the edges, you lessen the chances of the tape tearing the paint when you remove it.


If the are any gaps along the edges, fill them in with paint using a fine-tipped brush. If there is any excess paint, scrape it off using your fingernail or a craft knife.

, Before you can use your chalkboard surface, you will need to let it cure for three days. Once the paint has cured, you will need to ""condition"" the surface by rubbing white chalk over it, and then wiping the chalk off. Your surface is now ready to use.Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for more specific drying times. Some surfaces will be ready to use in less than three days, while others will need to cure for longer.

, Do not put your painted glass in the dishwasher or let it soak in water. Doing so may cause the paint to chip or flake off. Instead, wash the glass using dish soap and a sponge or a dishcloth. Do not scrub the painted areas, or they may scratch off.

Emphasize fine details with a 'round' brush.,
Draw straight lines with a ‘flat’ brush.,
Soften your edges with a 'filbert' brush.,
Use the ‘Bright’ brush.,
Also differentiate between HOG & SABLE brushes.,
Before using the paint brush on the canvas, utmost care should be taken to soak the brush properly in water or turpentine.,
Another piece of advice, never use the same brush for water and oil paints.

",How to Use Different Brushes for Fine Art Painting," They should be used with great control, as it is not able to hold much paint.;
, That is because it can hold a lot of paint because it has longer bristles. One of the primary uses of a ‘flat’ brush is to draw a straight line.

, It is flat on sides and round at the top and is used for making softer edges, but strictly not for straight lines.

, It is another type of brush which is flat in shape with shorter bristles., ‘Hog’ bristles are hard in nature and are mainly used for oil paintings as the oil paints are hard. ‘Sable’ bristles are flexible and comparatively soft than ‘hog’ and are primarily used for acrylic style of paintings. Watercolor brushes are mostly made from synthetic fiber and is incapable of holding a lot of paint.

, After soaking, the brush should be dried up well with the help of a cloth. Keeping the brush in a perfect condition is very important and should be cleaned after using a new set of color.

Pick the right tip.Choosing the right tip can be as important as having the right pressure gauged on your sprayer.,
Thin the paint.,
Strain your paint.,
Set up the siphon hose.An airless sprayer draws paint from a hose.,
Prime the pump.All airless sprayers require priming before they're ready for use.,
Give your sprayer a quick check before each use.",How to Use an Airless Paint Sprayer1," Larger tips generally require more pressure, but can cover more ground effectively. Narrower tips, on the other hand, are best for precision work. If you're unsure about the sort of tip you should be using, contact a hardware professional and give her the details of your project.;
, Latex paint works for airless sprayers, but it must first be thinned out in order to flow easily through the nozzle.Add 1/4 cup of water or chemical thinner for every gallon of paint you're using, then mix the two together thoroughly. You may have to experiment with different thicknesses of paint. Load some into your paint sprayer and check the coverage. If it's not spraying evenly, you may need to add more thinner.


Latex paint is the default paint for airless sprayers.
Chemical thinners are available from paint and hardware stores as well. These work more effectively than water and don't work against the paint's default properties.
The type of paint you use for your project will depend on the surface.

, No matter how well you mix the paint, there may still be little clumps of solid paint. It doesn't take much to clog an airless sprayer nozzle. Take a strainer and strain your paint into another bucket, catching the solid bits and discarding them.

, Attach your siphon hose to the back and place it gently in your paint bucket. It's a good idea to do this prior to priming. That way, you'll be able to tell priming is done because paint will start coming through the nozzle.

, Luckily, this is a fairly straightforward operation, as many airless sprayers will have a ""Prime"" setting. If your airless sprayer isn't priming successfully, it may help to give the device a slight tap with a hammer.This can loosen any clogged paint inside the sprayer.


Keep the nozzle face downward in a bucket to account for paint drips while you're getting the sprayer ready.

, Making sure your sprayer's in working order before you use it can help prevent big messes. Check the hose for microfractures. Check the nozzle and make sure the filter is clear. Give the paint a quick test run on a surface to make sure the paint's being distributed evenly.

Make your painted surface magnetic by painting it over galvanized steel.",How to Use Chalkboard Paint4," You can paint labels on bowls, ceramic pots, and even dressers using chalkboard paint. You can then write whatever you want using chalk. When the contents of the container change, you can simply wipe the chalk off with a damp cloth and write something new.

, You can paint walls, table tops, and even refrigerators with chalkboard paint. Not only do these make great outlets for creativity, but you can also use the chalkboard surface in your kitchen to write down recipes and shopping lists.


Make sure that your wall is smooth before you prime and paint it. A bumpy, porous surface, such as brick or drywall, will make it difficult to write on it with chalk later. You will also need to use painter's tape to mask off anything you don't want painted, such as window trims and baseboards.

, Your painted patch of chalkboard does not have to be square or rectangular. You can use adhesive stencils, or make your own, to make your painted area look like a heart, circle, or oval.

, You will be left with a patch of unpainted wood or glass.

, Once your chalkboard paint has dried and cured, you paint a grid or title onto it with regular paint. This works great for calendars, charts, menus, and anything that you want to have a permanent grid or title on.You can paint your grid or title using regular paint and a small brush, or you can use paint pens.
Do not use a water-based paint or paint pens. Your design will come off when you clean the board with water.

, Add two tablespoons of unsanded tile grout to one cup of acrylic or latex paint. Stir, and paint your surface as you would with store-bought chalkboard paint. Once it is dry, sand it lightly with 150 grit sandpaper. Condition the surface by covering it with white chalk, and then wiping the surface clean with a damp cloth., Label your herbs and plants in your garden by painting garden plant markers with chalkboard paint, and then writing the herb or plant names on the surface with chalk.

, You can use squares, rectangles, circles or ovals. You can even create fancy markers by buying wooden shapes with flourished edges and corners.

, Apply five to six coats of magnetic paint onto your surface, waiting 30 minutes for each coat to dry before adding another.Refer to the instructions on the paint can before applying the chalkboard paint, as some require only three days to cure, while others require up to five. Once the last coat of magnetic paint has dried and cured, apply your chalkboard paint and let it cure for three days before conditioning it with white chalk.


You can condition your chalkboard by rubbing white chalk all over it, and then wiping it off with a damp cloth.
Be sure to stir your magnetic paint often to prevent the particles from settling.Magnetic paint is not very strong, and may not be able to hold larger magnets.

, You can also create a magnetic chalkboard by painting over a sheet of galvanized steel. Make sure that your sheet of metal is magnetic before painting it."

Prepare the surface for painting.,
Hold the sprayer's trigger to spray.,
Adjust the pressure if you need to.,
Maintain a steady distance while you spray.You should keep your sprayer between 10-12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the surface you're painting.,
Keep your aim moving.,
Release the trigger to stop painting.",How to Use an Airless Paint Sprayer2," As with all paint surfaces, painting something with an airless sprayer should involve some prep work in the surrounding area. If there are part of the surface you do not want to have painted, cover them with masking tape. Lay tarp down on the ground to account for any drips.


While airless sprayers have a lot of positives to them, one drawback is how much the paint can get everywhere. If you're painting outside, wind can pick up your paint and carry it to other nearby walls and surfaces. It's a good idea to keep other surfaces covered with tarps to make sure this doesn't happen., Airless sprayers are used like any traditional gun. If this will be your first time using a paint prayer, you should practice on a throwaway surface first.If you want to get some practice, you can do a practice spray with water., If the paint isn't spraying evenly and thickly, it's a good sign you need to increase the pressure. There should be a dial on your airless sprayer to control this with.However, as a general rule, you'll want to keep the pressure as low as possible without resulting in a weaker paint job. Unnecessarily high pressure wears out the sprayer faster., This will make it close enough to apply effectively, but far enough away to cover a good range of surface.

, If you hold down the trigger in one place for too long, you'll run the risk of overspray and dripping. To avoid this issue, make sure your hand is always moving over the surface you're painting. Make sure that the speed you're moving at is relatively consistent. You want to make sure your paint-job looks even throughout.


If the paint doesn't look like it's being applied evenly, you should slow down your movements.

, When you're done a certain round of painting, simply release the trigger to stop painting. You should account for the split second between the time you release the trigger and the point paint will stop being applied at.

"
"
Clean the sprayer after each use.,
Check hoses for breaks before use.Checking hoses is an important part of maintenance for your airless sprayer.,
Replace filters when necessary.A filter is the mask at the front of your sprayer's intake.,
Keep safety in mind.",How to Use an Airless Paint Sprayer3," The paint in a sprayer will harden if it's not dealt with promptly. It's a good idea to clean out your sprayer after every use. Remove the nozzle from the sprayer and clear the paint out of the nozzle with a damp paper towel. Dry out the nozzle afterwards to make sure the moisture doesn't affect the next load of spray paint.


Don't leave the sprayer idle for more than 20 minutes. If you do, the paint will begin to harden., If there's a micro-fracture somewhere in the hose, it will shoot out paint and lower the effective pressure of the device. This is best done by feeling out the hose as well as looking for visible breaks.

, If it's punctured or at least 20% clogged, your filter is a good candidate for replacement. Many airless sprayers come with a couple of replacement filters, but you can purchase them fairly inexpensively wherever you got the sprayer from.

, Airless paint sprayers operate at very high pressures and can very easily cause injuries if you spray directly onto your skin. You may actually inject paint into your tissues or bloodstream without having an obvious cut or bleeding. The skin can open up and allow the passage of the paint through and then close off again making it appear that nothing is wrong. This is a ""fluid injection injury"", and should be treated by a professional immediately.

Choose subjects that are appropriate for both a sketch and a painting, depending on your style.,
Carry a sketchbook with you at all times.",How to Turn a Sketch Into a Painting1," This can be anything from a person, landscape, object, animation, etc. Consider your skill level and the amount of detail to see if it will be suitable for a painting.

, Be on the lookout for subjects you know will make good paintings. Focus on detailed areas separately if you want to include them in your finished piece.

Purchase or make a viewfinder.,
Look through your viewfinder.,
Roughly draw the same proportions as the aperture of the viewfinder on your sketchbook paper.

,
Divide the space into quarters.,
Start from the bottom right quarter.",How to Use a Viewfinder for Artwork,";
, Note what you can see at each of the corners. Flick your eyes from corner to corner to corner and look carefully, so that when you take the viewfinder down, you can still see the parameter of the image that you will be working on in your mind's eye.

,, Quarter it vertically and horizontally, so that it is split in half both ways. This breaks down the complexity of the image that is in front of you into four smaller elements that are going to be easier to control.

, This is an information gathering exercise; you are making a map from observation of what will be the painting. Think in terms of the design, the pattern and the overall composition. This step gives you thinking time before you set about the process of painting and transferring the image to the painting surface.

Brushes can be expensive, so take care of them.,
Clean your brushes thoroughly.,
Never leave your brush in water with the bristles down for an extended period of time.,
You can buy brush holders that keep your brushes from resting on the bottom of the container, and will keep the paint-covered bristles off of the table, or easel.,
If your brush bends, it will permanently warp the brush.,
If you haven't got time to clean the brush properly, put it in the freezer and thaw it out later for thorough cleaning.

,
Don't use warm or hot water to rinse off the bristles.",How to Take Care of Paint and Brushes1,";
, If the acrylic paint hardens around the bristles, the brush may be permanently ruined.

, The bristles may fall out, and it will not be a good thing!

, Paint may stain, so keep the brush off the table.

, It is like jelly. It warps and then hardens.

,, The heat causes the glue inside the ferrule (metal part holding the bristles to the handle) to weaken, causing the brush to fall apart.

Use a full piece of watercolor or drawing paper to make a larger version of your picture.,
Draw grid marks on your stretched watercolor paper or canvas for your final piece.,
Paint over the sketched image once you've completed drawing it to size on your surface.",How to Turn a Sketch Into a Painting2," Draw marks on the sides of the paper at an equal distance. Lightly connect these marks with a ruler to make grid lines.;
, It should have the same number as your drawing. Use a ruler to connect the marks, creating a grid with the same number of cells as on your sketch. Beginning in the upper right corner, concentrate on each section of the grid separately. Draw to proportion only what you see in that particular cell.

, Let yourself get creative by adding, subtracting and changing details, using your drawing as a reference.

Your sketch can be enlarged via scanner and then scanned and printed directly onto a plastic film for use in a professional projector.


If you're at home instead, this method can be easily replicated with some low-tech tricks, such as tracing over your sketch with a marker onto a plastic pocket, then creating a makeshift frame for the plastic pocket to stand on.

, Make sure to have drawn all lines before moving your canvas.

, Once drawn on with pencil, your painting is ready to paint! Your lines can be drawn over with a marker, black paint, fine liner, etc. The rest of the painting is up to you!

Work indoors if possible.,
Protect your floors.,
Remove any hardware from the furniture you’re painting.,
Sand rusty or high-gloss surfaces.,
Apply shellac to untreated wood.,
Clean the surface with soapy water.,
Tape off areas you don’t want painted.,
Get enough paint.",How to Use Chalk Paint1," Chalk paint adheres to surfaces best at room temperature, so working inside is best if you can. If you work outside it might be too hot or too cold for the paint to adhere properly., Spread newspaper or brown paper on the floor under where you’ll be painting. This protects your floor – whether a hard surface or carpet – from paint drips., This includes things like handles, knobs, or hinges on furniture or cabinets, and glass or pads. Use plastic baggies to store the hardware you've removed until you're done with the project. That way you don't lose anything and you can get your furniture reassembled more quickly., Chalk paint will adhere to most surfaces without any kind of prep. However, if your furniture has a high-gloss paint or a lot of rust, lightly sanding it can guarantee good paint coverage. Use a 150-grit or finer sandpaper and lightly rough up the surface of the piece you’re painting., This gives the chalk paint something to adhere too, rather than it just soaking into the wood. Apply the shellac with a cloth pad, covering the entire surface of the piece in a thin layer, and let it cure according to instructions on the shellac., You should do this after any pre-treatment dries but before you apply the chalk paint. Drop a few drops of liquid dish soap into a bowl of warm water and use a soft cloth to clean the surface. Rinse it with a cloth dipped in clear water, and then let it dry fully before you paint it., This is especially important if you’re painting something like a cabinet, since you don’t want paint on your counter surface. Place the tape at the very edge of the thing you don’t want to paint, creating a barrier between your brush and the surface you don’t want painted., There’s nothing worse than starting a project and running out of paint halfway through. One liter of chalk paint can cover about 140 square feet (about 13 square meters). Make sure you measure the surface area you’re painting before you buy the paint."

Get a brush with long flexible bristles.,
Dip the brush into the paint.,
Apply the paint in one direction.",How to Use Chalk Paint2," This allows the brush to pick up a good amount of paint. It also gives you a longer stroke, which means you can cover more area before you need to reload your brush., Only dip the brush about halfway in to the can; you don’t want so much paint on the brush that it drips a lot. Tap the brush against the side of the can to remove excess paint., For example, if you’ve decided to paint starting at the left of your piece, always move left to right. When you run out of paint, re-dip the brush, and then start by placing your brush just inside the paint you just applied and continue painting in the same direction."
"
Pour paint into a paint pan.,
Use a high density foam roller.,
Scrape the brush on the grid of the pan.,
Roll on a thin layer of paint.",How to Use Chalk Paint3," Don’t totally fill the pan, since you’ll just have to pour it back in the can if you don’t use all of it. Pour enough to cover the roller brush when you place it in the bottom of the pan., A high-density roller will soak up a lot of paint without it dripping. For most chalk paint jobs, it’s probably best to use a four-inch (10 cm) mini roller. Dip the roller into the paint in the pan and roll it back and forth until it’s coated., This gets rid of any excess paint on the surface of the roller. Don’t scrape the roller brush too hard since this will get rid of most of your paint., Then roll the brush back in the opposite direction, and once more in the original direction. This gives you good coverage that should cover up any brush lines."
"
Water down the paint if necessary.,
Operate the gun at high pressure.,
Hold the gun approximately 3 inches (7 cm) away from the furniture.",How to Use Chalk Paint4," Not all paint guns can handle chalk paint because it can be a little thick. Add 2 tablespoons (1 oz) of water to every cup (8 oz) of paint that you use in the paint gun., This is especially necessary if you choose not to water down the paint. Test the gun on a small, out-of-the-way area on your piece of furniture to get used to the pressure., Apply the chalk paint evenly, sweeping your arm back and forth in long, even movements."
"
Apply a second coat as necessary.,
Let the paint dry.,
Distress the surface.,
Seal with wax.,
Buff the wax for a shiny finish.,
Replace the hardware.",How to Use Chalk Paint5," A second coat of chalk paint is not usually necessary, but it can help cover imperfections. It can also give you a two-tone look if you use a lighter shade or the same shade for the second layer. The bottom layer of paint will show through slightly, altering the color., Chalk paint dries relatively quickly, but if possible give it about two hours to dry totally., If you like the matte look of the dried chalk paint, keep it as is. For a more distressed look, use a medium-grit sandpaper and gently rub the surface, especially at the edges., You can use clear or tinted wax. Gently massage wax into surface of the piece you painted with a soft wax brush. You should use a 500-mL tin of wax for every 3 to 4 liters of paint you used. Work the wax in with the grain of the wood. Let the wax cure for at least 30 minutes., You can do this with a soft, clean cloth. Rub the cured wax surface in small, even circles until the surface shines., Once the wax is buffed, you can replace any hardware you removed to paint the piece. Be careful not to overtighten any screws, as this can scrape your paint up."

Look for sponges in fun shapes.,
Create your own shapes.,
Cut out basic shapes for young children or older children interested in ""building"" pictures.,
Give your kids more variety by cutting out more complex shapes.,
Use the sponge painting activity for educational purposes.",How to Sponge Paint With Kids1," You may have your kids paint at the table, on a hardwood floor, or on the wall. Regardless of the area you choose, spreading newspaper beneath the area protects your surfaces from accidental paint splatters.;
, Tempera paint works well for most applications, as does any paint marked “kid proof,” “children’s art paint,” or “washable.”

, When working with paint and kids, you can almost be certain that someone will get paint on themselves. Even when using paints that wash out with water, you may still run into a few stains.

, Seasonal sponges are especially common around various holidays, but you may be able to find more standard shapes throughout the year.

, Buy craft, kitchen, or bath sponges. You may also use packing foam, in a pinch. Draw out your desired shapes and cut them out using a sharp utility knife or scissors.


Sponges that are about 1/2-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick may be the easiest to cut, and they may also be the easiest for tiny hands to pinch and grip. Larger sponges can also work, however, but you may need to create a handle for kids to use them.

, Toddlers can find enjoyment out of the simple shapes alone. Other children can combine simple shapes into slightly more complex pictures, like flowers or snowmen.

, Butterflies, stars, hearts, and flowers are among the many possibilities. If you do not feel comfortable drawing these shapes from scratch, you can trace them onto the sponges using stencils or cookie cutters.

, Cut out letters of the alphabet or numbers to help young children learn the alphabet, count to ten, practice their spelling, or perform basic addition and subtraction problems.

Set up the canvas you want to print on.,
Choose a stencil.,
Squeeze a little bit of paint onto a palette or a foam plate.,
Use a stencil brush.,
Dab the brush over the canvas, inside the stencil.,
Continue until you've covered the stenciling area on the canvas.,
Allow to dry completely.,
Remove the stencils when done.",How to Stencil with Acrylic Paint1," If you want a colored background on the canvas, paint this first.
, The stencil design will need to fit on the canvas. If you're overlaying stencils, plan this out in advance.

If your stencil is made from a thinner material (like printer paper), be sure to cut the edges precisely.
Use thin slivers of tape under any edges that may fold over or stick up during the paint application, to avoid smearing or paint bleeding over the edges.

, Always add less rather than more; top up as needed., Dip into the acrylic paint but here is the trick––only dip just the edge of the brush and do not apply too much paint. Thin layers are the most effective for acrylic paint stenciling. Rub off any excess paint if needed, using paper towel or an old rag.

A stencil brush has a wide, flat surface. It's ideal for picking up a thin layer of paint. A soft stencil brush with natural bristles is the best choice; do not use synthetic ones or any other sort of paintbrush.
Use a large stencil brush for large canvas areas, a small one for daintier and smaller areas.

, Take a lot of care at the edges; do not push the brush under the stencil., Remove the brush., Apply other colors or areas only after the first one has dried, to avoid accidental smudging from your hand movements. Fortunately, acrylics dry quickly., Carefully pull away. The stenciled print will now be completed."

Find a flat, well-ventilated area to paint in.,
Use paper plates or other round objects for the planets.,
Outline your planets.,
Fill in your planets.,
Add texture.,
Create the sky.,
Add stars.,
Take off the plates to see your finished painting.",How to Spray Paint Art1," Exposure to the pigment, binder and solvent in spray paint can cause eye and throat irritation, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness and nausea, so care must be taken when using this medium.


Set up outdoors to cut down on your exposure to the spray paint vapors. If there's a breeze, be sure it's at your back so that it doesn't blow the fumes into your face.
Open a window if you spray indoors and set up a fan to blow the vapors out.
Wear a full-face or half-face respirator to greatly minimize your exposure to solvent fumes; this is strongly recommended. At the very least, consider wearing a paper particle mask.;
, Can lids, old Frisbees, buckets and empty plastic containers work well. Compose your painting by laying the plates out where you want the planets to appear on the poster board.

, Use black spray paint and lightly mist around the edges of the plates to create the outlines of the planets.

, Remove the plates and spray the inside of your planets with whatever color you'd like. Red, yellow and orange are good choices, but it's entirely up to you. Don't worry about staying inside the lines; overspray a bit and go over your outline to ensure the color is completely filled in.

, Spray a light layer of black over some areas of your planets' color. Gently place a piece of magazine on top of the black layer while it's still wet. Take your hand and run it across the magazine, tug from one corner about an inch, then pull away from the poster board. You should have a pretty cool texture on your planet.


Get creative with materials. Besides magazine pages, you can use paper towels, plastic bags, sponges, pieces of terry cloth towels and lots of other items to create different textures.
Keep it nontraditional. Stay away from brushes or other tools associated with traditional oil painting; these are frowned upon by purists of the spray art genre.

, Put the plates back in place and spray around them to create the sky. Fill in all the space between the plates with black and spray around the plates again to make the planets complete circles. Spray some blue in places to add another layer of color.

, Grab a can of white paint, hold it at an angle and mist lightly. It can be challenging to know just how much pressure to apply in order to create a light mist, so practice on some scrap paper first. Another option would be to spray some paint directly on your finger and flick it onto your painting.

, This first planetary painting should give you a good idea of what you can do with spray art. Keep practicing to perfect your techniques.

Pour a small amount of paint onto paper or styrofoam trays or plates.,
Add a little water to the paint, if necessary.,
Quickly dip the sponge into the paint, covering the entire bottom.,
Hold the sponge over the tray for a few seconds to allow excess paint to drip off.,
Firmly press the sponge onto the surface.,
Demonstrate this process to your kids.",How to Sponge Paint With Kids2," You should only pour a small puddle of paint into the tray. Putting too much in at once increases the likelihood of spills and messes.

, Many ""kids"" paints are spreadable enough and do not need water, but tempera paint is thick and can be hard to work with. Only add a little water, though. Adding too much will make it too runny and just as hard to work with.

, Do not hold it in the paint too long, or else it will become too saturated and will not produce the airy, ""spongy"" look.

, The more paint that drips off, the less thick it will appear on whatever surface you and your kids use it on.

, The entire bottom of the sponge must come into contact with the paper or painting surface. Do not press so hard that you ""squeeze"" the paint out of the sponge, however.

, Eager children may want to jump in after seeing it once, preferring to learn through trial and error. Other kids may ask to see the process multiple times in order to learn through observation.

Create pictures on paper or poster board.,
Use fabric paint and create pictures on tote bags, hats, and t-shirts.,
Decorate a ""treasure chest"" together with your kids.,
Use sponge paint instead of dye to color Easter eggs.,
Create wall art.",How to Sponge Paint With Kids3," Thick stock paper works better than thin printer paper, since the heavy paint has a tendency to soak through and weigh the paper down. You and your kids can create as many pictures as you want, and you can dispose, save, or display the artwork as you see fit.

, Older kids will love creating their own wearable designs. You may want to have them practice their pictures on plain paper before applying them to the fabric, though.

, Depending on how many kids you have, each child can sponge paint a design onto one or two sides of a wooden or heavy paper mâché box. You can use sponge paint to decorate the lid. By the end of the project, you will have a box that you can store any artwork, cards, or mementos your kids give you.

, Coloring eggs is typically a family event to begin with. Instead of working with messy liquid dyes, you can sponge paint pictures and designs onto the eggs, instead. You may need to craft stands or hold the egg for your kids as they paint, since holding and painting might be difficult for younger ages.

, Use painter's tape to section off a rectangle on your child's bedroom wall. Allow him or her to use sponge paint to create his or her own room décor inside the taped off space.


Instruct your children to practice the picture on plain paper before painting it onto the wall.
Stick with paint that can be removed with water. If your kids do not like what they design, you can wash it off and have them try again.
Seal finished designs with a clear coat of gloss, or hang a backless frame over the area.

Quin Shou or animals, birds and insects.

Hua Hui or flowers and blossoms.

Hua Niao or a combination of flowers and birds.



,


Brush
Ink cake
Water
Inkstone
Paper or silk. For your first time, it will be better to practice on paper until you get the hang of brush painting.

, The amount of water varies depending on the consistency of the ink that you want. Thick ink will appear glossy and deep on your paper. Thin ink (made with more water) will be more lively.

,, Remember to make bold strokes - if you go too slow, the ink will bleed, but going too fast may result in mistakes. Find a speed with which to paint that is somewhere in the middle.

"
Find a strong, scrap piece of paper, board, or canvas.,
Select the paint that you need to know the drying time for.

,
Paint on the scrap piece or inconspicuous spot.,
Have a general idea of drying times for paints:

Acrylics tend to dry a lot more rapidly than other paints, depending on the surface used.,
Be aware of factors that can impact paint drying times.",How to Test Paint Drying Speed,"


Alternatively, you can locate an inconspicuous spot of the surface that you intend to paint and test here.;
,,


Test the paint using different consistencies (thicknesses) straight from the tube, palette, or can.
Add water or omit water where applicable. For example, try one sample moistened with water, one sample mixed with water, one sample brushed out with a wet wash (all depending on the paint type, of course).

,
Latex paint can take around 30 minutes to 3 hours to dry but still needs around 2 weeks to cure (so that you can be sure it isn't bubbling)
Watercolours tend to dry quickly.
Oils can take about one to two weeks to dry completely.
Poster Color can already be dry to the touch around 30 minutes, dry to handle around 2 hours. But when it's re-coated it will dry up around 8 hours. It will take longer to dry under colder or more humid conditions.

, The environmental elements that can impact the usual time needed for dry paint include:


Humidity
Surface absorbency
Wetness or dampness
Temperature.

Choose a stencil.,
Use a semi-damp (or dry, both work well) sponge instead of a brush.,
Lightly press the sponge onto a thin layer of paint.,Gently dab the sponge over the stencil until you're satisfied with the coverage.,
Let dry.",How to Stencil with Acrylic Paint2," The stencil design will need to fit on the fabric. If you're overlaying stencils, plan this out in advance.

If your stencil is made from a thinner material (like printer paper), be sure to cut the edges precisely.
Use thin slivers of tape under any edges that may fold over or stick up during the paint application, to avoid smearing or paint bleeding over the edges

, Sponging will cover more area and lessen the risks of smears from difficult edges/angles. Mainly all types of sponge works––kitchen, makeup, etc.,

Don't apply too many layers. Over application of acrylic is what leads to that bulky stiffness.

,, If you'd like, once you're stencil has dried completely, run through the quick cycle in your washing machine for extra softness."

Understand the structure of a spray paint can.,
Keep the can from clogging.,
Make thin lines.,
Learn how to fill in.,
Create small dots.,
Purchase an assortment of spray can caps.",How to Spray Paint Art2," There is a little tube going from the valve at the top of the can to the bottom. The tube must sit in the paint so the paint can be drawn up through it and out the cap.


Hold the can vertically to ensure an even spray; otherwise, you might spray mostly or only propellant.
Experiment to see what works. When there is plenty of paint in a can, you should be able to hold it whatever way you’d like—even upside down for a few seconds.

, When it sits around, the spray paint pigment separates from the solvent and thickens, causing clogs. To prevent clogging, shaking the can hard is a must.


Keep in flowing. Cans have a “pea” inside that breaks up and redistributes the paint particles so the paint mixes well and can flow freely. That “ping-ping-ping” sound you hear when you shake a can of spray paint is the sound of the pea hitting the sides of the can.
Hold the can upside down when you shake it; this gets the paint particles back into the liquid solvent quicker. Shake for about a minute.

, Being able to create thin lines will allow you to add detail and outline objects in your painting. Follow a few simple techniques to get your lines nice and thin.


Stand closer to your paper to get your lines thin. If your paper is mounted to the wall, you may need to tilt the can to come in really close.
Get very sharp lines by holding the can so that the upper side points in the direction you’re painting. In other words, hold the can vertically when you’re drawing vertical lines, horizontally for drawing horizontal lines.
Move quickly. You must paint fast to create very thin lines. Besides, spraying too long on the same place will leave drips.

, Thick layers applied at once tend to get flaws when drying or after being exposed to weather. The key to filling in is to use fat lines and to layer the paint. In fact, spray paint art in general is all about layering, so this is an important technique to learn.


Fill in using lines. Don’t release a continuous stream of paint when filling in an area. Use lines to gradually cover the space.
Release the cap after each line to avoid patches with a thick layer of paint.
Embrace thin layers. They dry more quickly and result in a finish that lasts longer.

, This is difficult because it can't be well controlled, but with some practice, you should be able to create the effect you want. Hold the can upside down and spray as if you’re blowing the cap clean. Stop spraying at the moment the paint stops flowing and only propellant is being expelled. With the can still upside down, press down on the cap to spray a perfect dot. Practice several times before using this technique. The trick is to stop the spray at exactly the right moment before spraying again to create a dot.

, Sure, your can of spray paint comes with a cap, but that doesn’t mean it’s the cap you have to stick with. A number of specialty caps that will give you the effect you’re looking for are available for sale.


Spray paint cans have “male” or “female valves, so before you purchase a cap, be sure it’s compatible with the brand of spray paint you’re using.
Whether the spray paint is a foreign or domestic brand will also determine its cap compatibility. Here are a few of the popular cap styles:

Fat caps are good for creating medium to fat lines and are considered to be all-around useful caps, especially for filling in.
Stencil caps are used to create ultra-thin lines. They actually sit in front of the nozzle and stop the flow of most of the paint being dispensed from the can and create the thinnest possible line.
Outline caps do exactly what their name suggests; they're used to outline and add details.


Remove and replace caps properly. Twist or screw the cap off of or on to the can. Cover the dot with one finger to avoid a spray of paint from escaping during this process.

"
Experiment with different surfaces.,
Look for legal places to paint.,
Offer your work for sale.",How to Spray Paint Art3," One way to get your work seen is to put in on articles that have a public profile. Spray paint artists work on high gloss surfaces or surfaces that are semi- to non-porous. That means you can create not only on poster board but on windows, skateboards and car hoods.

, Creating with a can of spray paint is not necessarily seen as vandalism; in some cases, it’s considered to be an important contribution to a city as a form of public art.


Look for mural art projects to be a part of. Many cities have mural art programs that create wall art as a way of beautifying neighborhoods. These groups may not use spray paint to create their art, but they’re worth investigating.
Cities around the world have designated areas where graffiti and spray paint artists are welcome to work. These include Venice, California; Queens, New York; Melbourne, Australia, Warsaw, Poland; Paris, France and Taipei, Taiwan to name a few. Do some research to find areas where your artwork is welcome.

, Since spray art is a fairly new genre, many traditional galleries don’t accept it, but you can take a more DIY approach to getting paid for your paintings.


Rent a booth at a local arts fair or flea market. Many areas have art shows that are well-attended annual events. In some cases, you’ll have to submit your work to a panel of judges in order to be accepted. In other cases, you simply have to pay the fee for a booth. Many communities have weekly or monthly flea markets. Double check that the one you’re interested in allows for artwork to be sold.
Create a website or online gallery to showcase your canvases. This allows people from all over to browse through your work and find something that appeals to them. You can also offer your work for sale on eBay.
Set your sights high. Find inspiration in the story of Hugo Montero, one of the major innovators of spray paint art. At the peak of his popularity, he had shows at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center and the Smithsonian in Washington DC, collaborated with MTV and continued painting on the street. A journalist gave him the nickname CanGogh, which stuck with him from that time forward.

Squirt a pea-sized amount of lotion into your hand.,
Run your paint brush through the lotion.,
Wipe off the brush with a towel.",How to Soften a Paintbrush1," You can use any type of baby lotion. However, if you don’t have baby lotion, any hand/body lotion that you have in your home will work. The lotion ingredients aren't important, but you should try to use one that dries cleanly. Any greasy residue may damage the bristles.Baby lotion is recommended because of its extra moisturizing properties.;
, Do this as if you are painting your hand. Bend the brush back and forth, making sure you coat the brush in lotion up to its ferrule (the metal end of the handle). This should take about a minute and a half until the bristles loosen.

, Once you are happy with the state of the bristles, remove any excess lotion with a towel. Scrub the towel gently over the whiskers of the brush, starting at the base and moving in circular motions towards the tip. You want to keep medium pressure to avoid plucking or bending any of the bristles.


Keep in mind, dried brushes may never get soft. This treatment might help if it is done a few times.

Find a work space.,
Set up your canvas.,
Protect the surroundings of your workspace.,
Protect your clothing.,
Set up your paints and palette.,
Limit the area of the splatter.,
Add paint to a brush.,
Position yourself.,
Splatter paint onto the canvas.,
Continue painting.",How to Splatter Paint," Paint splattering can get messy, so it’s important to find a work area that is open, and contains very few objects that could get ruined by splattered paint.

Some good work spaces include garages, backyards, basements, attics, etc.;
, There are many options for situating your canvas. You can lay your canvas on a table, on the floor, mount the canvas to a wall, position the canvas on an easel, or even prop the canvas on a chair. However you position your canvas, but sure that it is secure, and won’t move.









If you are painting an object rather than a canvas, still make sure that the object is secure where you position it, and won’t move out of place.

, Now that you have the focal point of where the paint is going to be splattered, protect the area around your canvas from getting splattered with paint.Plastic tarp and drop clothes work well for covering large areas behind your canvas such as walls and the floor.If you are working on a smaller canvas, consider laying out newspaper behind your canvas.
If your canvas is positioned upright, rather than lying on the floor, protect the area behind the canvas, as well as below it. Paint will surely get on the floor when you’re splattering, and with gravity, paint may even drip down off the canvas onto the floor.

, When preparing to splatter paint, wear clothes that you wouldn’t mind getting paint on; an old t-shirt, work pants, raggedy shoes, etc.









Consider wearing an apron if you want to protect your clothing even more.
Some people wear protective gloves when splatting paint, since the paint gets everywhere, but wearing gloves is optional.

, Thicker paints work best for splattering paint. However, most of the time, splatter patterns turn out better when the paints are watered down a little bit.When splattered onto the canvas, looser paint will have more of a splatter effect, as opposed to gloopy blob patterns made with thicker paint.









To loosen your paints, simply pour out your paints and keep them separated using a paint plate or plastic cups. Be generous with the amount of paint you use, splattering tends to use up more paint quickly. Then add a small amount of water to the paint (approximately 1 teaspoon) and mix the paint and water together.Test the consistency of the paint. You can always add more paint to make the paint thicker, or add more water to make the paint looser.
Make sure that every color you plan to use has it’s own paintbrush. This will ensure that the paints stay separate, vibrant, and true to color.

, If you want your splatters to only be on a certain portion of the canvas, use painters tape to surround that section, and cover up the surrounding canvas.For example, if you want to make a painting where one side is splattered with reds and oranges, and one side is splattered with blues and purples, use tape to split the canvas in half, and then cover the portion you don’t want to work on just yet. That will leave the section of the canvas you do want to focus on as the available canvas space to splatter.

This step is optional since you might not want to section off any parts, and just want to splatter all over the canvas.
However, if you do want to focus on splatter a specific portion of the canvas, you first must restrict that space before you start painting.

, Dip your paintbrush into the paint. All the bristles of the brush should be saturated with paint. If the paint drips off the brush before you move toward the canvas, you may want to thicken the paint.








, Stand back from your canvas. Once you get started painting, you can experiment with the distance you stand from the canvas. If you want thicker splatters, try standing closer to the canvas. If you want smaller splatters, stand further back.

When you’re ready to splatter paint onto the canvas, pull your arm back near your head.

, With a quick whipping motion, bring your arm down toward the canvas, and flick your wrist.The quick movement will throw the paint from the brush onto the canvas, creating the splattered effect. Since splattering paint is free form, experiment with various ways of splattering. Stand at different distances from your canvas, use bigger and smaller brushes, move your arm at various speeds and directions, etc.Using your arm and wrist is a general way to create paint splatters, but splatters can be made in a various other ways:









Scooping – Scoop up a small amount of paint with a plastic spoon (don't use a spoon you'll eat with afterwards, as even traces of the paint could be bad to ingest). Turn the spoon away from you, so the paint is facing the canvas. Hold the handle of the spoon with one hand, and pull back the top of the spoon with your other hand. Then let go of the top of the spoon to sling shot paint onto the canvas.
Wrist flicking – Load an ample amount of paint onto the brush and simply use your wrist to flick the brush toward the canvas. This will create harsh, concentrated splatters rather than the spread out, looser splatters made my using your entire arm to splatter the paint.
Straw blowing – Dip one end of a straw into the paint. Bring the straw over to your canvas, and place your mouth on the other (clean) side of the straw. Hover the straw about an inch above the canvas, and forcefully blow through the straw to transfer the paint from the straw onto the canvas. This method to splattering paint makes small, concentrated splatter marks, spreading on from a focal point.

, Continue to use different brushes and paints to create your splatter painting. You may want to consider allowing each layer of splattered paint to dry before adding on more paint, and possibly blending the colors.

Examine the condition of the canvas, and figure out the reason it got damaged.,
Repair the canvas yourself.,
Hire a professional to repair the canvas.

,
A local marine canvas shop can provide a more professional-looking result.",How to Repair Canvas1," Some examples of damage include stitching deterioration from exposure to sunlight, tears or rips from sharp objects, or tears and damage from rubbing against the boat's frame or fittings.;
,


Purchase a canvas-repair kit. Kits usually include cloth swatches, thread, and needles. Sew the cloth swatches onto the weakened area. The damage may repeat itself in the future, so reinforcing the worn out area with leather or isinglass is recommended.
Stitch it back together with a thread and needle if it is a tear, cut, or deterioration of the stitching. Patch the area by sewing on another piece of canvas to reinforce it and prevent further damage.

,, The shop can ensure that your canvas has clean seams and a waterproof finish.

Boil white vinegar in a small-medium saucepan.,
Place your brush/brushes in a heatproof jar.,
Pour boiling vinegar into brush container.,
Scrape off any remaining paint.,
Rinse and apply lotion.,
Condition your brushes.,
Place the baggie in a bowl of hot water.",How to Soften a Paintbrush2," The amount of vinegar you use may vary depending on how many brushes you are attempting to soften. However, you should have enough vinegar to coat your brush/brushes from the tip of their bristles to the ferrule or handle base. Keep in mind that the vinegar will start to evaporate once it begins to boil, so you may need to add more.If you aren’t sure how much to use, aim for 2-3 cups.

, You are going to need to stand your brushes up, bristle side down, so make sure whatever container you choose has enough height. You can try using something like an old mason jar, or even an old, clean paint can. Just be careful as both of these items will be hot to the touch once you pour the vinegar.


You can also place your brushes directly into the boiling pot of water, but be extra safe!

, Once the vinegar has begun to bubble, remove it from the heat and pour it into whatever container you chose. You want to make sure you only pour enough to cover the bristles. If you pour past the brush’s ferrule it can loosen the glue that keeps the bristles together.


Let your brush/brushes soak for 20-30 minutes., If there is any excess paint leftover, gently remove it with a brush or a comb. You can use either a plastic brush or an old hair brush comb. However, avoid using anything metal as it can bend and ruin the bristles. Start at the base of the handle and slowly comb downwards.


If you can’t get all of the paint off, simply return your brush/brushes to the vinegar and allow them to soak longer.

, After you’ve soaked and combed through your brushes, rinse them off in warm water. You can softly massage the bristles as you run them under water. Afterward, take a pea-sized amount of baby lotion and work it through the whiskers of the brush in a similar fashion.

, If you still feel like your brushes are hard after rinsing them and applying lotion, cover the whiskers of the brush in hair conditioner. Then, place your brushes in plastic baggies, with all the bristles facing one corner. Once they’re all in one bag, seal it tightly.

, You don’t need to boil this water, just run the hot water tap to bathwater temperature. Then, make sure the water covers the bristles. This will heat up the conditioner, letting it penetrate the bristles better. Leave them to soak for about an hour, replacing cold water with more hot water as it cools down.


After they’ve soaked, rinse your brushes off.

"
Scrape off any excess paint.,
Mix fabric softener and water in a large bucket.,
Swish your brush/brushes through the mixture.",How to Soften a Paintbrush3," Before you start soaking your brushes, make sure you try to remove as much paint as you can. You can do this with a brush cleaning tool or with a plastic hair comb. Just make sure that you aren’t pulling too forcefully, as this can cause some of the bristles to loosen and fall from the brush.

, Any typical fabric softener will work. Pour a ½ cup of fabric softener for every gallon of water. For example, if you are using a 5-gallon bucket, then you would use two and a half cups of fabric softener. Of course, if you are only softening one or two brushes, you definitely won’t need 5-gallons worth.Fabric softener is better than dish soap because it lowers the surface tension between liquids and solids, which means it makes water “wetter.”

, Taking one brush at a time, swirl them in the fabric softener/water mixture. You want to put them into the solution up to the ferrule and then flick them back and forth quickly, counting to ten. The paint should dislodge from the bristles and fall to the bottom of the bucket.


Once the paint is clear, set the brushes aside to dry.

,,, Make sure the linen and adhesive strip are placed properly over the tear or rip. Remove the linen strip. Remove the paper backing on the adhesive, and place it back over the tear or rip without the linen under it.

,,


If you need to heat up a hard-to-reach part of the adhesive, heat up a metal spatula against the surface of the iron.

, Place the other linen patch over the fitted linen patch to prevent scorching during the heat transfer process. Use the iron on top of both pieces of linen and apply heat.

,, After the area is dry, use a putty knife to scoop out acrylic gesso and fill in the indentations so that the repaired area is even with the surface of the canvas. Allow the acrylic gesso to dry.

, Apply the paint, and allow to dry.

Treat the paint spot immediately.,
Rinse the spot with warm water.,
Use a mild soap to wash the area.,
Repeat and dry.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Skin1," If you’ve just gotten paint on your skin and it hasn’t yet had time to dry, treat the area right away. Once the paint has begun to set up, it will harden and solidify in place, making it much harder to remove. Paint that is still wet should wash away without much trouble.


This is especially important for bigger spills, as they will be more unsightly and harder to get out once they dry.;
, Run some warm water over the affected area. The heat of the water will loosen paint that has begun to dry, and much of it should wash away on its own. Rinsing the skin also weakens the paint’s hold as the skin grows slippery.You may be able to completely get rid of fresh paint spots this way.
Acrylic paint is a water-based emulsion, meaning they are designed to be soluble in water., Mix a mild hand soap or liquid detergent under with the water until it creates a lather. Wash the area thoroughly, applying firm pressure with the hand or washcloth.Regular dish soaps are ideal for this type of job, as they contains abrasive elements and compounds that cut through dried-on stains.

, If the soap and water successfully take out the paint stain on the first try, dry the area and call it a day. Otherwise, you may need to make another pass until the remaining paint fades and washes away. Try soaping up again. The surfactants in the soap combined with repeated scrubbings should be able to get out whatever’s left.

Wash with soap and warm water.,
Rub the baby oil into the skin.,
Rinse away the loose paint.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Skin2," Wet the affected area with warm water to loosen the paint and lather up with a mild liquid detergent. Get as much of the paint off as you can using the soap and water. Dry the area thoroughly with a towel before applying baby oil.


Due to the repellent relationship between water and various oils, the baby oil will have trouble working if the skin is still wet., Squeeze an ounce or two of baby oil directly onto the paint spot and massage it into the skin. Work the dried paint away with the tips of your fingers, or with a cotton ball or sponge if the stain is particularly stubborn. Baby oil is proficient at breaking up and dissolving dried-on acrylic and oil-based paints.Baby oil is one option that is much gentler and more beneficial to the skin than paint removers that use harsh chemicals as their primary agents.Using a mildly abrasive implement like a cotton ball or sponge will help scour paint out of the deeper contours of the skin.

, Run some warm water over the area again to wash away the dissolving paint. If necessary, use another dab of baby oil on remaining stains. In addition to erasing tough paint spots, the baby oil will also leave your skin feeling smooth and moisturized."
"
Wash the area with soap and water.,
Apply rubbing alcohol to a cloth or cotton ball.,
Swab the paint spot vigorously.,
Wash and dry the skin.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Skin3," If the paint has already dried on the skin, you will need additional measures to remove the stain. Start by washing the area with soap and warm water. Loosen the paint as much as possible to weaken its hold on the skin. Scrub the area lightly as you wash.


Pat the area with a towel before proceeding to treat the spot so that the water on your skin doesn’t dilute the alcohol.

, Take a washcloth or large cotton ball swab. Douse the cloth or cotton ball with roughly an ounce of standard rubbing alcohol. Alcohol is a solvent for acrylic paint, which means it will start to break down the paint once it’s applied to the skin.For ease of application, press the cloth or cotton swab to the mouth of the alcohol bottle and turn it upside down, soaking a compact circle perfect for scrubbing.
Pure rubbing alcohol is one of the most highly recommended methods for removing paint from various surfaces., Dab the area with the washcloth or cotton ball to wet it and give the alcohol time to begin acting on the paint. Then, go over the paint spot with alcohol using small, circular strokes to coax the paint out of the crevices of the skin’s surface. Scrub the area until all paint is gone, reapplying alcohol as needed.You may have to scrub quite forcefully to reach paint that has settled deep into the skin.

, Once all traces of paint have been removed, wash and dry the area to clear it of any leftover rubbing alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol is a mild irritant to the skin, and can cause redness and irritation if it is not rinsed away.

"

Run some warm water over the paint spot.,
Soak the corner of a hand towel with acetone.,
Press the towel to the paint spot.,
Wipe away any remaining paint and wash the skin.",How to Remove Acrylic Paint from Skin4," Loosen and re-wet the paint using warm water. Scrape away any flakes or thicker areas with a fingernail. Rinse the area until the bond between the paint and the skin beneath it begins to give way.

, Find a thick, soft hand towel and dip one corner into a container of acetone. Let any excess acetone drip off the towel before using it to treat paint spots on skin. Fold or bunch the rest of the hand towel up under the soaked corner to create a scrubbing surface.Acetone is a harsher substitute for the gentler rubbing alcohol, and should be used only when soap and water and alcohol have failed to remove the stain.
One of acetone’s most common uses is as nail polish remover, which means it’s been proven to work effectively on dried on acrylic paints., Apply the acetone-soaked towel to the paint spot and hold it there for thirty seconds to a minute. The acetone may cause a slight burning or irritated sensation; this is normal. As you hold the towel over the spot, the acetone will eat away at the dried paint stain.Because of its mildly caustic properties, acetone is irritating to the skin, but is usually not dangerous. Make sure you have no known allergy or intolerance to acetone before using it to treat skin.

, Scour the spot with the corner of the hand towel. Once most of the paint has come away, rinse the towel with warm water and scrub again. This will continue to break down the paint stain while also removing the acetone from your skin. When the paint is completely gone, wash the area with mild soap and warm water and dry.


Always wash skin after it has come into contact with acetone."

Prior to work with the all in one arrangement, remove all the traditional painting tools from the working area.,
Preferably on a workbench in the workshop, display all equipment, paint & tools, including the all in one arrangement bucket.,
Unseal the all in one arrangement bucket hinged lid and flip it open.,
Install the paintbrush inside the lid.,
Install the paint roller onto the support inside.,
Open the paint can you have already chosen at the paint store.,
Consider seriously this step if you are to work a great deal on a ladder or stepladder.,
 Only after you are sure you will never need that paint again, there seems to be two ways to go.,
Calculate the increased performance.",How to Protect Your Painting Supplies with the All in One Paint Bucket," Removal includes the paint tray, the paint tray trolley, the paint can, the can lid, the screwdriver to open, the hammer to close, etc. Keep working area clear & free from all objects. This will help performance when painting and upgrade the all around safety factor. Shift heavy furniture to one side forecasting opposite shifting at execution mid point. If you are working outside, to impose yourself the same discipline is good practice.    ;
, (the table in the kitchen or the picnic table will do the same). For security matters, it is best to keep the room area to be painted totally clear and free from all unnecessary object. Concentrating on one task at a time highly contributes to remove stress & fatigue. This is the road of the easiest execution and for the finest results. No stress no mess.

, The front part is easy to flip while the rear part stands sturdier with the container. The inside of the lid provides a hook for the paintbrush. The bucket inside shows a composed horizontal & vertical rolling surface serving also to support the roller. The holes in the rolling surface are made for roller traction also returning excess paint to the container for continuous mixing paint effect preventing separation of the paint. There is full access for brush & roller to reach the paint in the bottom. The arrangement makes for quick move and no spill compared as with the traditional paint tray.

, There is a clip inside the lid provided for the paintbrush.  Grab the lid with one hand four fingers outside while pushing the spring clip inside with the thumb. This easily opens the spring clip so you may put the paintbrush handle between the clip's' two jaws. Then release pressure from the thumb and the paintbrush will hold solid inside the lid. Whenever you need the paintbrush it will be readily available in a second. This way you will stop experiencing the lost paintbrush syndrome and repetitive solid dry.(old timers understand what I mean) Paintbrush can be clipped into place whenever clean, dry, wet or fully paint loaded and instant ready anytime to resume.

, Just deposit the sleeve part of the roller onto the inside rolling surface and then deposit the handle on the rear support. This way the roller will always be available within a second. Anytime the paint roller drops onto place may it be clean, dry, wet or fully paint loaded and kept instant ready to paint.

, Poor the paint into the new bucket. This is the hard part because if you ever experienced some kind of discomfort when dropping the first paint into a new and clean traditional paint tray, well this could give you an even stronger scary discomfort feeling. Don't worry it is for the better. Pleasure will come accordingly ten time folds and even stronger with the new set-up. Close the lid now. Most important is all done. You have reached the set up final point..You may feel to start painting right away do it, or later maybe. It is now fully up to you and in no time, with no paint lost, no paint dry skin, no tools dry out or paint tray dry out. You may have a coffee break or even come back next day or next week and always at no extra time cost or material lost. You are now Paint Time Master. Always ready to paint or to stop with instant paint & tools protection. (Do not throw the paint can to the garbage you may need it later)

, The bucket with ladder hooks is strongly recommended. Maximum one gallon paint capacity. It hooks in the outside part of the ladder respecting painter's body safety space entirely. Inside paint-bucket arrangement set-up is similar as explained above and same preparation is recommended from step 1 to step 6.


Allowing the safe traveling up and down the ladder with one hand for load, one hand for safety hold and to be open when ready to paint at the appropriate level. The arrangement can stay hooked unattended in the ladder for a minute or for a month and be always ready provided it is not cooking under the sun. Closing the lid takes a second. Simple basic logic tells that the painter must not hold a paint can or tray in one hand while concentrating with the other with a paintbrush or a roller. It is only more evident in the ladder where the free hand shall be used for safety purpose. Working with good safety habits always comes to big pay someday. Always use the extra hand for holding safe. A painter can imitate a clown but not a bird without damage.  

, One is just as good as the next but for sure do not throw the paint away to garbage neither to a reseller. Put the left over paint back into the original paint can and seal it for your own further use. Wash the tools using the bucket as a sink for soaking. Second best way is to leave all the left over paint in the bucket with all the tools paint loaded and always instant ready. Give it to the neighbor and make a new friend if not already. This way there will be more than one happy people and we go for a better world. This is the path to saving some more fresh water, sink, sewer, river and paint too. Thank You.

, Count how many steps you eliminate not traveling in stairways or ladders because all tools are at hand always. Multiply the saved time by your hourly rate. Evaluate and compare with the tradition way. This exercise will convince you about the quick and reliable pay back of the arrangement. The Instant Protection is 1sec. for all Paint & Tools. Traditional runs ou 10min.= 600sec.= 600 times fold. Compare Bolt is 27 mph (43 km/h) versus Ferrari is 337 mph (542 km/h) = less than 12 times fold).

Plan out your chevron pattern.,
Draw a grid on a blank sheet of paper.,
Do the same thing with horizontal lines.,
Begin creating an outline for the stripes.",How to Paint Chevron Stripes1," Before you start painting, it’s best to decide how you want your stripes to look. For example, do you want them to be vertical or horizontal? You can also decide on their thickness, number, and shape. The thinner your stripes, the more of them you will be able to put on the wall.
, To get the cleanest and most accurate lines, draw a graph to plot out your design before your start. Using a ruler and a pencil, draw a straight vertical line down the center of the sheet of paper. Then, draw two additional vertical lines on either side of the first line. Each line should be halfway from the middle line to the outer edge of the paper.








You should now have three equidistant vertical lines going down the sheet of paper.

, Using the ruler, draw a horizontal line in the middle of the sheet of paper. Then draw two additional horizontal lines above and below it to create 16 equal-sized squares on your sheet of paper. You will use these as points of reference for your stripes.








, Starting on the square at the upper left-hand corner of the page, draw a diagonal line from the upper left-hand corner of the square to the lower right-hand corner of the square. Repeat this on each of the three squares directly below it.









Then, move onto the next column and draw a diagonal line from the upper right-hand corner to the lower left-hand corner.
Continue alternating directions and columns until you have completed filling in the remaining squares. You will then have the outline for your chevron stripes.

"
"
Use a base coat.,
Paint each stripe separately.,
Wait for the paint to thoroughly dry.",How to Paint Chevron Stripes2," An easy way to paint in your stripes is to apply a base color to the entirety of the paper (retrace lines afterward, if necessary). Then, once your base coat has dried, you can paint different colored stripes over it.

To keep your lines clean when painting the stripes, try using painters tape on the borders.Keep in mind that you should mark which stripe gets which color as it can get confusing. You can do this by dotting each line with the color it will take, or by marking them with bits of tape.

, This is a good method if you plan to paint each line a different color - or at least more than two. For example, if you want to alternate shades of blue, you could start with a light blue at the top and then paint each stripe a darker blue until the bottom. This would give you an ombré look.









Make sure your lines are clearly marked so your colors don't run over and into each other.

, Depending on the thickness of your paint, this can take anywhere from 10 minutes to a half hour. Once it has dried, gently pull up the tape if you used any. You can also take the time to erase any remaining pencil marks from your original grid.

Plan out your chevron pattern.,
Use a blank sheet of paper to lay out your design.,
Paint the wall a base color.,
Mark off a grid on your wall.,
Paint in your chevron stripes.",How to Paint Chevron Stripes3," Before you start painting, it's best to figure out the size and style of your design. To do this, first, measure the height and width of the wall you want to paint with a measuring tape. Once you've made note of both numbers, decide how many stripes you want to paint and in what fashion. For example, let's say you want 5 stripes on your wall with 5 peaks on each line.

This will help you graph the pattern of your design in the future.

, This drawing doesn't have to be exact, but it will help you figure out where and how to space out your stripes. Simply draw a mini-version of your wall with the height and width clearly marked along the side and bottom. Then, draw in the horizontal and vertical lines of your grid and make sure they are relatively even.

If you are concerned about getting an exact number for the spacing between your horizontal stripes, try using this simple formula - ceiling height/2x. For example, take the height of your ceiling divided by 2x to get the number of inches between each line. The 'x' in this equation would be the number of chevron stripes you'd like on your wall. So, if your ceiling is 90 inches and you want to paint three stripes, then the formula would follow 90/2(3), and you would get 15 inches (38.1 cm) between each stripe., Keep in mind that this base color will be the color of one of your stripes. You also need to make sure you cover the wall in at least a coat or two and let it dry overnight. Depending on the condition of the wall, you may also need to first use a primer before applying a coat of color.

Be sure to follow the directions on whatever paint you choose.

, Use measuring tape, a yardstick, and a pencil to draw horizontal and vertical lines in a grid pattern across the surface of your wall. Then, use painters tape to mark the boundaries for each chevron stripe. You may also want to use any extra bits of tape to label which stripe gets colored in.

Refer to your drawing to make sure you are spacing correctly.

, Once the base coat has dried and you've set up your grid, simply paint in the areas between the painter's tape. These should be the lines you've marked with bits of tape. Go over each area with a thick paintbrush or thick roller, and then let it dry.Once all the paint has dried, carefully pull off the painter's tape and voila!

,
Also, write down what kinds of things you can paint with these new colors.,
Dip them in some paint and make various lines and shapes.,
After you've had practice with mixing colors, using the brushes, and painting lines and shapes, and you think you've gotten the hang of it, look back at your canvas.,
Start with something small.",How to Prepare for Painting," You need to have a visual image of it in your head. Then, once you know what you want to paint, take a pencil and make a very light sketch of it on your canvas. Erase any mistakes. Just draw a simple outline to get you started.;
, If you're unsure, try to find a real life object or model of your sketch. If you do find one, compare it to your sketch. Any changes you want to make? Do you want to use the same colors or some of your own? Decide. Think about it for a few minutes. If you can't find a model of what you're trying to paint, don't fret. Try to find an image online to help you. If there is nothing online or around you, you should probably choose something else to paint, unless you think you can do it.

, By doing this, you can learn how you can make new colors.

,, If you have various-sized brushes, good! See what they can do.

, Paint straight lines and study the thickness of it. Paint wavy lines and determine which brushes make curls easiest. Then, paint flowers. Not detailed flowers. Just a circle in the middle of petals. Then try painting these symbols: ? + % # @ & if you have enough room.

, Do you think you're ready? If you feel that you might make a mistake, copy your sketch onto a blank canvas, if you have at least one more. Then pick where you want to start. If you're unsure, pick somewhere that seems easiest.

, Or start with something large, that only requires one or two colors. Then work from that. If your sketch does not include these, wash your hands from any paint that might have spilled on them. Dry them completely. Then return to your canvas. Close your eyes, point your finger, move it around in front of your canvas, and touch your canvas in a random spot. Open your eyes and see where your finger landed. Do you want to start there? If not, do this again and again until you find a comfortable starting place. If this doesn't seem to work, try asking other people where they think you should place your paint brush first. If this is not an option for you, sit back and study your sketch for about 5-10 minutes, adding anything that may seem necessary. If you still can't seem to decide, take a break. Watch videos online of people painting. Take notes. Then when you feel ready to resume your project, return to your canvas. Once again, practice with the paints and brushes, to get the feel of it again. Then, find your starting place. And don't worry. If your painting doesn't turn out to look the way you were hoping it to, use the second sketch and try again. Many famous painters have to try again and again to get the look they were wishing for.

To paint a sky use two of the Real Color Wheel transparent primary colors, transparent cyan PB15 and transparent magenta PR122.,
Wet the substrate gesso so you don't get any lines when you paint the first color in, either as an opaque or as a transparent wash. Darker cyan at the top and thin lighter cyan at the horizon line.,
Paint the sky color gradient that goes from light cyan at the horizon line and an equal amount of darker cyan and magenta at the zenith.,
As you get real close to the sun corona there is no cyan so that the tint of magenta is all that is seen.,
Paint in the clouds over dry sky colors or wipe them out from wet sky colors.",How to Paint a Sky Using Acrylics," Adding white to the transparent colors makes them opaque, painting transparent washes will give the same colors because of the white background.

The easiest way to paint the following gradations is to make a set of opaque acrylic colors first, ready to be blended. Wet the support first to make blending easier.

For the skilled acrylic artist, it can be done fastest using the transparent washes of these two transparent primary colors, magenta and cyan. The painting above was done with transparent washes,
;
,

A layer of jar white over the gesso and dried will make your gradations even smoother.
There is no cyan in the corona of the sun.

Let the transparent cyan dry before adding the transparent magenta, wet the support again. The darkest magenta corresponding to the darkest cyan. The magenta is darkest at the top and non-existent at the horizon line and just a very light tint in the sun's corona.


, The zenith will be an ultramarine blue hue.
, For an opaque application a tint of magenta is another pre-made color, or you can add white to transparent magenta. Transparent magenta will work fine.
,


Keeping the opaque colors or transparent colors moist will allow you to ""wipe out"" clouds when the sky colors are done. It's always best to under paint white first on the gesso and let it dry. Your next colors will go down smoother and a wipe-off will have finished paint under it.


Clouds can be made with opaque white over the dry transparent or opaque paint. Two coats of jar white acrylic, which is thinner and smoother than tubed white are necessary to block any color underneath from showing through.


To make the dark underside color of a cloud, add the third transparent primary, yellow PY150. All three transparent primaries mixed together will make a neutral dark, a tint of this neutral dark will make the neutral gray seen under clouds.


Burnt Umber and Ultramarine Blue will also make a neutral dark as the ""under cloud"" color. I use this same neutral dark for my shadow colors in a morning painting because it's very easy to move it to the cool side. Because of this great feature I also use this combination in foggy and rainy day paintings.

My afternoon shadow colors are a combination of magenta and green, evening shadow colors are a combination of red and cyan.

Shake each paint well.,
Put a dab of each colored paint on the paper plate far enough away that they will not run together.

,
Use yellow paint to create a straight horizontal line either just above or just below the middle of the canvas.,
Make a circle sun in the middle of the canvas just above the horizon line.

,
Pull yellow outwards from the edges of the sun toward the edge of the canvas.,
Clean your brush in between the color changes in the water cup and dab it dry on the paper towel.

,
Add orange above the yellow.

,
Blend the orange into the yellow by pulling it slightly down into the yellow.,
Add red the same way you added the orange.,
In the left and right top corners of the canvas add some purple.,

,, Stay going left to right with your brushstrokes.

,,, Pull the yellow into the orange to give an even blend. Notice the left side of the image is blended in while the right side is not.

, Make sure to blend it like you did the orange and yellow.

, Pull some of it down the sides of the canvas and into the middle of the top of the canvas, but be sure not to pull it too far that it no longer can blend.

, Pull the white into the surrounding colors. If it starts to fade into the colors too much you can always add more.

,, This one was finished with water. It was made with the simple brush strokes and blending just like the sunset was made. You could also finish it with black to make a silhouette painting. Or you could make the sunset the whole painting. Just some suggestions!

Finish the stem and leaves.",How to Paint a Sunflower," Before you start painting your sunflowers, you have to be sure that you have the paint colors on hand. You’ll obviously want yellow paint for the flowers’ petals, but it helps to have several different shades available so you can shade them to add dimension. For the center of the flower, you’ll need a couple of shades of brown paint. You should also have at least one shade of green for the stem and leaves.You can use whatever type of paint you prefer for painting; both oil and acrylics work well for painting on a canvas.
Don’t forget the background of your painting. If you’re painting the sunflowers in an outdoor setting, you’ll need blue to fill in the sky or green to represent grass and other plants. For an indoor setting, you’ll want a background shade for the wall.
It’s a good idea to keep white and black paint on hand. That way, you can lighten and darken up the yellow, brown, and green paints that you have to create additional shades for the painting.;
, Finding the right sized brushes for your painting will depend on the size of the canvas that you’re using. With a standard size canvas, though, you can usually do the job with a ¼” brush for larger areas and a ⅛” brush for detail work.If you’re planning a large background for your sunflower painting, you may also want to have a wide, flat brush on hand. It will allow you to fill in the background shades more quickly than a ¼” brush.

, While you probably have a pretty good idea of what a sunflower looks like, it always help to have a point of reference while you’re painting. Look for a photo of sunflowers online that appeals to you, and print a copy so you can refer to it while you’re working. If you are unsure of any of the flower’s details, you can consult the photo.If you have access to actual sunflowers, you can use a real flower as your guide.
If there is a painting of sunflowers that you admire, such as van Gogh’s “Sunflowers,” you can use a photo of it to help inspire you.

, If you want to paint the flower from the front, make a circle, using dotted lines rather than a solid line. For a sideways flower, create a thin letter “C” so the flower’s center has more of an oval shape.When you’re trying to decide how large to make your circle or “C,” take the size of the canvas into consideration, as well as many flowers you want in your finished painting. If you’re painting a single sunflower, you should probably make the center fairly large.
If you’re creating a sideways sunflower, make sure to leave the oval open to create the “C” shape. You’ll use that open area to add petals.

, Once you have the first sunflower’s center drawn, you can start to add the petals. The easiest way to create the right shape is to make triangles that have all of the sides slightly curved. Keep in mind that all of the petals don’t have to look identical, though. You’ll get a much more realistic looking sunflower if they’re all slightly different. Line the entire center with petals.Make sure to vary the length of the petals and to create some that overlap.
For the best looking sunflower, create at least two layers of petals. You can have the tips of the back row just peeking out over the first layer.
If you’re creating a sunflower that faces forward, the petals will fairly large. On a sideways facing sunflower, the petals near the open area of the “C” will be smaller than the others that line the center.

, Once you’ve finished drawing in all of the petals, you can add the stem. Depending on whether you want to paint a sunflower that’s growing outside or that is cut inside a vase, you may want to create a stem that’s slightly curved near where it attaches to the bloom or one that is entirely straight. Have the stem go all the way to the bottom of the sketch.Let the size of the sunflower’s size help guide the thickness of the stem. Larger blooms require a thicker stem to support them.

, To give your sunflower a more realistic appearance, it helps to add some leaves to its stem. You can place them wherever you like on the stem, but start with a curved line to create the top edge of the leaf. For the bottom edge, though, make the line slightly ridged so it resembles a real leaf.Depending on the size of your sunflower, it may be enough to add one leaf to the stem. However, if the stem is very long, you may want to add multiple leaves, placing them on both sides.

, When you’re happy with the sunflower that you’ve drawn, you can decide whether you want to paint additional flowers. You can use the same techniques to draw them as you did for the original flower, though you’ll need to vary the size and the direction that they’re facing. Adding some in the foreground and others in the background can help give the finished painting more dimension.Keep in mind that background flowers will be smaller than the original flower, while those in the foreground should appear larger.
You don’t have to add complete flowers. You can just sketch in top, bottom, or side of a sunflower to help fill out the painting.

, Once you’ve finished your sketch of the sunflower(s), you need to transfer it to the canvas before you begin painting. The best way to transfer the sketch is with artist’s transfer paper, which is coated with graphite that transfers to the canvas when you trace over it. Take a piece of transfer paper that the same size as your drawing, and tape it to the canvas, with the graphite side face down. Place the drawing on top of the transfer paper, and trace it onto the canvas with a pencil.It’s best to use artist’s archival tape to attach the transfer paper and drawing to the canvas because it is easy to remove and doesn’t leave any residue behind.
Make sure that you position your transfer paper and drawing on the canvas in the exact spot that you want to paint your sunflowers.
A mechanical pencil usually works best for tracing the drawing because you don’t have to worry about the point getting dull.

, After you transfer the drawing to the canvas as a guide for your painting, start by painting the background behind the flowers first. You can use the larger brush to fill in most of it, but take care around the flowers and other items that you might have included in the drawing, such as a vase. Around those areas, you may want to switch to a smaller brush.If you’re using multiple colors of paint to get the right shade for the background, you can usually mix them directly on the canvas. However, if you’re making a drastic change, such as taking a color extremely dark or extremely light, you may want to mix the paint on a palette first so you can be sure to get the right color.

, With your smallest brush, start filling in the petals around your sunflower(s). In most cases, it’s best to start with your brightest yellow shade for this step. Next, use a similarly sized brush to fill in the center of the sunflower with a brown shade. Just as with the yellow, it’s best to start with a lighter brown or tan color.If you don’t have a yellow or brown shade in acrylic paint that is light or bright enough to use as a base color, thinning a darker color with water can help lighten it. With oil or acrylic paint, you can mix in some white to lighten the yellow and brown shades.

, To give your painting dimension, you’ll want to incorporate other shades of yellow on the petals. Shade some areas with mid-tone and dark yellows so the petals don’t look as flat. Do the same with the sunflower’s center by working in mid-tone dark shades of brown.To decide where to use the darker shades, consider where the light would hit the flowers and where shadows might fall.
Depending on the look that you’re going for, you may also want to incorporate subtle touches of red and orange paint in the petals’ shading.
You can also use a small amount of white on the petals to act as a highlight.
For the center, you may want to have some black paint on hand to darken certain areas.

, The final step for your sunflower painting is to fill in the stems and leaves. You usually want at least two shades of green: a brighter green and a darker forest green shade. Use your smaller brush to fill in the stems and leaves to keep your strokes more precise."

Paint musically.",How to Paint a Picture," The most widely-available, cheap, and easiest to use variety of paint is watercolor, which is available either in tubes or small plastic cases with multiple color palettes. Depending on the quality of the paint, watercolors can be light and pastoral, or quite vibrant and vivid. It's a beautiful and effective way to start, especially for landscapes and whimsical still-life paintings.In it's basic state, watercolor paint is thick and heavy, and is made workable by wetting the brush and thinning out the paint with water, or by otherwise mixing the paint with water on a palette. It's a thin and light paint, easy to work with for beginners, though somewhat difficult to control.
Having a good-quality paint to start with will help to avoid frustration when you get started. Sennelier paints are watercolors available in both pan and tube form, of a much higher quality than your garden-variety school-supply watercolors. Try the pan to avoid having to buy lots of paints separately, and having the convenience of all the paint in one place. Schmincke and Windsor & Newton are also quality brands that are widely available at craft stores.;
, Quick-drying but just as versatile as oil paint, acrylics are the most common paint for amateurs and professional painters alike. Water-based, acrylic paints are easy to use and widely available at craft stores and specialty art shops, perfect for use with intricate details and abstract masterpieces. They're much less expensive than oil paints, but no less professional.Acrylic paints most regularly are sold in tubes, like oil paint, and can be mixed on a palette with simple water to thin out and mix to create new colors. Because it dries very quickly, it's the perfect paint to layer, creating base tones to create depth and detail in landscapes, portraits, or other pictures.

, The most versatile, professional, and vibrant paints available are oil paints. They're also the most expensive and take the longest time to dry, but offer all kinds of advanced mixing techniques and layering options for professional painters. It might not be the best place to start, but it's something to consider for the future, or to experiment with if you're looking for a challenge.


Oil paint is also frequently sold in water-soluble bricks, which can be worked similarly to watercolor, and can be somewhat quicker-drying than traditional tube oil paints. Get a variety of primary colors and learn to mix your own shades to cut down on the cost.
Unless you want to glob the oil paint right from the tube onto the canvas in thick, visceral blobs like the impasto paintings of de Kooning (awesome looking, yes, but super-expensive), in addition to the paint itself, you'll also need to get some solvent to use as a paint thinner.
If you paint with oil paints, you need to prime the surface first with basic acrylic primer, otherwise the paint will eventually destroy the canvas or paper. Any surface the paint touches, the palette or the mixing board, likewise should be primed to extend its life.

, Who ever said you needed to buy paint? Using berries, tea-emulsions, or even ashes on your canvas are all perfectly appropriate methods, depending on the picture you want to create.


Food-based paints can change over time (or rot, depending on how you want to look at it). This can give your picture a time-based element, changing over the days and weeks after you finish it. Document your egg-paint before it starts to stink and throw it out in time, or acrylic-paint over it to keep it finished.

, Depending on the kind of paint you end up choosing for painting your picture, you'll need to get brushes appropriate to work with it.Use rounded-tip brushes for water-color painting. Flat-tip synthetic brushes are best for acrylic paints, while filbert-tip brushes are best for oil paints. You can experiment with different brush fibers, picking something that's appropriate for your price range.

, To keep your clothes clean and your paints organized, you'll need a few more things other than paints and brushes to get started on your picture.


Choose a canvas appropriate for the type of paint you've chosen. Use stretched canvas for heavy acrylic or oil paints, and watercolor paper for painting with watercolors. Watercolor paper will hold up to the dampness of the paints without curling or weakening.
Keep a variety of cups set aside for the purpose of wetting your brushes, cleaning them, and keeping water close at hand if you're using watercolors. So you won't have to clean them quite as thoroughly as your drinking glasses, set aside some old glasses for the purpose.
Get a palette or paint tray. The best surfaces on which to mix your paints, thin them out, and check their consistency is either a white plastic or enamel paint tray. This allows you to have a nice white background to check the accuracy of the color against, and you can get one with user-friendly paint wells around the edge for a few dollars. Glass plates are a common alternative., Dress in old clothes and get out all your supplies to get started. Any painting project will likely result in a bit of mess, so it's important to prepare for it to avoid impossible-to-remove paint stains on your carpet or other surfaces. To get started painting, find an open area with plenty of light to set yourself up.


It's common to use an easel to paint, but not necessary. Find a hard surface, like an old clipboard to clamp your watercolor paper to, or prop a canvas up on a desk, covered with an old sheet or newspaper.
Lay down an old sheet or newspaper on the floor, and any surface that'll be in contact with the paint. You won't have to worry about spilling if you've got a paint trap already set up, letting you concentrate on making.

, While it's not a required step--you could always just start painting--it's helpful to sketch out the basic shape of the subject to use as a guide. If you want to paint a pot of flowers, you don't have to get into the tiny details of the pollen in the center, but it's a good idea to have the basic outline of the petals on the paper before you start adding color.


Use contour lines to sketch the basic shape, and gestural lines to start getting a sense of the spatial relationship between the objects in the subject. The object will be made up of many little shapes, like many little paintings. Try to focus on the relationship between things.
Locate the source of the line illuminating your subject and start looking at how the shade is cast upon the subject, and how you'll need to capture it with color and line.

, On your palette, spend some time mixing your paints and trying to get the kind of colors you want to use to capture your subject. Some painters will be really concerned with getting the value as accurate as possible, so it looks like ""real life,"" while other painters might want to change things up a bit. There's no right way to do it.


Blend a small amount of color and paint a few test strips to see how it looks on a white background, rather than mixing up a whole tube of white and blue together to make light blue. Only make as much as you'll need.
Tint your bright colors with a small amount of white to soften them, or add black to create different shades of the color. Adding the opposite color from the color wheel to one paint will create a different ""tone,"" giving you an endless range of possibilities.
Using a variety of contrasting value in your painting will help to create a more dynamic sense of color in your painting. Use many tones, shades, and tints, thinking seriously about color.

, Learn to use, clean, and care for your brushes before you start painting. Before you're knee-deep in your masterpiece, get some experience getting the brush to hold an appropriate amount of paint and practice painting smooth, even lines with it. Don't worry about what you're painting, just paint some scratch while you're mixing up colors or thinning the paint out.


Use short little brush strokes and long even ones. Use as little paint as possible on your brush to get the value you're looking for. Don't saturate the page with paint. Use different brushes for their different effects, blotting, drawing, and stippling with them.

, Usually, you'll want to get the background in first, working from the back to the front of the painting. This lets you move from the general to the specific details, adding layers to create little details, rather than the other way around. If you start on the petals, the painting can end up looking out of balance. Experiment some to see what works best for you.


Bob Ross, everyone's favorite television painter, was excellent at starting his paintings with backgrounds on the fly and using the imagination to get started. He usually found complementary colors and dry-brushed the background in nice sunset colors, then started filling in trees and other natural scenes without planning much of anything. It's an excellent way to get started on a canvas.

, Just start painting gently, using tiny amounts of paint on your brush to start forming shapes. If you're just painting from your imagination, let the paint create the shapes and follow the shapes. If you've already started with a sketch, once you've got a good background of colors on your page or canvas, you can start overlapping colors and shapes to create a sense of space.


As you start in on painting your subject, you need to work hard to make the flat surface look more dynamic and three-dimensional.
Create perspective by spacing the objects appropriately. If everything is equidistant and the same shape, it'll look flat on your paper, rather than dynamic. Things farther back in the subject should be proportionately smaller, while things closer up should be larger.Some painters find it effective to put their painting upside down to examine it. The mind supplies a symbolic version of what you're painting--in your mind, you know what an apple is, so you'll tend to paint that version of the apple, rather than what you're seeing in front of you. Looking from another perspective sometimes can help you see the shapes for what they are, rather than the symbols.

, Identify the light source and the shadow to start adding value to the painting. Start adding the lightest colors and gradually create the darker tones. It's much easier to layer darker colors over lighter colors, rather than the other way around. Don't paint yourself into a corner. Mix small amounts of paint as you go, adding color judiciously and slowly.

, Vary the amount of paint on your brush and the kinds of strokes you use with the brush to make different textures. Short little strokes can look like fur, while longer smoother strokes will flatten out the paint. Using less paint can help ""age"" the subject, while using more can thicken it and create density.


If you screw up a part by adding too much paint, don't panic. Embrace happy accidents and integrate them into the painting. Don't spend too much extra time layering over it, just let it be and look back over it at the end to see how it effects the composition. Keep moving forward.

, It's a good idea to focus on one part of the painting, working it through, before moving around. But figure out what works best for you. Some painters jump around the page, painting in different regions, depending on the shapes and the subject being painted. It'll depend on you. But in general, keep working on one part of the painting before moving elsewhere.


It's also important to stand back and appreciate the ""big picture."" Pay attention to how your little moments affect the overall composition and the painting itself.

, Even if you're just painting a stack of books or a bowl of oranges, it needs to force the eye to move around it. Everything from the composition, to the use of color should be varied and textured, something that takes time and practice.



Try studying color theory a bit to get more of a sense of how to use color, if you feel like your picture is looking flat.

, Painting is hard work! Don't get frustrated when you're first getting started. Now that you've got all the materials and the space set up, experiment with painting different subjects and keep developing your craft. If you tend more toward one type of painting, switch it up every now and then and paint different types of pictures. Keep making things.

, Landscapes are one of the most universally-beloved and classical subjects for displaying your skills and appreciating the natural world. Landscape values perspective and depth, finding an angle into the natural world and capturing it in paints. It's a task to which some artists devote a lifetime.


You don't have to live at the foot of a mountain or in the middle of the desert to paint beautiful landscapes. Head to the backyard and find a good angle on the shed, or an adjacent field with an interesting perspective to start your landscape.
With the rise of Transcendentalism and Naturalism in the 1800s, landscape painting became elevated to a high level of appreciation and status, though painting the outdoors has been common since the Minoan period of art history. Nowadays, it's common for landscapes to portray human influence--roads, billboards, even cars.

, Find a human or animal subject, light them well, and place them against a blank backdrop to study the form of life. This will take a steady pencil to get the details right, or you can take a more impressionistic approach to the subject and try to get at their essence, if not a picture-perfect representation.


In general, the portrait is all about detail: some of the most successful Renaissance portrait artists were even originally trained in etching and gold-work to become accustomed to working small.There's no wrong way to paint a portrait.

Study life drawing to learn about capturing the human form in the proper proportions and movement. Consider working from a photograph to avoid making your subject stay still for hours at a time. Or, go the old-fashioned route and sit them down with a glass of wine and some classical music to keep them relaxed.
Self-portraits are also a common and vibrant form to explore. Set up a mirror and paint what you see in it. Find your inner Rembrandt.

, Assemble a directly-lit group of objects on a table to study and paint. Flowers, fruits and vegetables, toys, and other various and sundry items are all perfect for a modern still life. Assemble them in an aesthetically-pleasing way on a table, with enough lighting to cast shadow and create depth, then get to work.


Classical still-life painting involves its own particular symbolic tradition and themes, with simple-looking table scapes representing complex metaphorical tableaux, called vanitas--Latin for vanity.The collection of flowers and foods, ephemeral and natural things, are sometimes meant to signify mortality, while the classical Golden age of still life painting use opulent displays to celebrate wealth. In some regions, harvest collections would be assembled to celebrate the completion of labor and agriculture.

, Break the rules. Paint abstract-expressionist experiments. Put some hard bop jazz on the record player and paint what you hear, mixing your colors on the fly and providing visuals for sounds, or capture other abstractions in color.


Whatever your materials or your subject, feel no pressure to paint representatively, or ""accurately."" Want to paint caricature or exaggerated cartoonish versions of your subjects? Go for it.

Dip the paintbrush in water, then blot away the excess on paper towel. To load the brush, stroke it into the blending gel instead of dipping it in.
Gently touch the flat edge of the brush to the surface when applying it. You only need a light layer of gel.
Clean the excess blending gel off the brush before continuing.;
, Load the brush with your main color and paint a rough circle. If you spread a layer of blending gel, paint directly over the gel.


The color you use in this step will be the color of the rose. In other words, paint a red circle to create a red rose, a pink circle to create a pink rose, a yellow circle to create a yellow rose, etc.
Clean the excess paint off the brush before continuing.

, Dip one corner of the brush into your main color, then carefully dip the clean corner of the brush into white paint. Blend the colors together until the brush is well-coated.


After loading both colors onto the brush, stroke the pools together on a palette or piece of scrap paper. Add more paint to each corner and stroke again over the same spot.
Repeat as needed to coat the brush, but make sure that two distinct colors remain when finished.

, Paint an upside-down ""U"" shape over a small part of the outer edge.


Press firmly as you paint so that both colors go down evenly.
The length of the stroke will vary the overall appearance of the rose. Try to keep the length no larger than one-eighth to one-twelfth of the overall perimeter.
For this first stroke, you do not need to add any tails to the finishing edge of the curve. Keep the brush as flat as possible throughout the duration of the stroke.

, Paint additional curved strokes in the same manner, continuing until you cover roughly one-third of the outer perimeter. Create tails on the last stroke of either side.


You'll need four or five strokes total. Each of these strokes should be the same upside-down ""U"" shape, and each should be approximately the same size. Use the same technique to create all of them.
Make distinct, separate strokes, but overlap the edges slightly. Do not leave blank space between them.
For the end strokes, start the stroke in the same way as the others, then gradually shift the brush to its chiseled edge as you curve it. The stroke should thin out into a comma-like tail pointing toward the center of the rose.

, Paint a second layer of curved strokes inside the first, positioning it roughly halfway down the first layer.


You should be able to see the main color of the previous layer, but it should only be partially visible above the white edge of this layer.
The curves do not need to be evenly sized or placed, but you'll need to follow the same basic procedure and technique for this layer. Finish to last stroke on either end with comma tails, too.

, Paint one comma stroke on either side of the current form, finishing each stroke with its own comma tail.


These strokes should surround the current two layers like armrests, and the curves might be slightly larger than the largest of the previous curves. Note that they will also curve inward and upward, looking more like tilted parentheses instead of upside-down ""U"" shapes.
Keep the main color on the inside and the white on the outside.

, Fill the bottom of the circle with several shell-shaped scallop strokes. These strokes should occupy the remaining space around the perimeter of the circle.


To paint a scallop stroke, press the chisel edge to the surface with the white side out and the main color in. Wiggle the brush to create a shell shape that curves only slightly toward the inside of the rose., Paint another upside-down ""U"" shape over the second layer along the top edge, then connect the tails of that layer to a large upright ""U"" stroke around the diagonally opposite bottom side.


The third layer at the top edge may not be necessary, so you'll need to evaluate the way your rose looks and determine whether or not to include it.
When completing the bottom ""U"" stroke, try to line up the chiseled edge of your brush with either side of the comma tails on your lowest upper layer.

, If you wish to add more depth to the rose, add small upright comma strokes on either side of the lower ""U"" stroke.


Place these strokes on the bottom of the ""U"" stroke. They must be very thin and should curve around the shape of this lower ""U"" stroke, not away from it.

, Take a step back and look at the rose. If you're happy with how it appears, allow the paint to completely dry before handing the surface any further.

If you have never drawn a portrait before, do as Van Gogh did: draw yourself!,
Find a piece of paper that is larger than your head so your drawing will be the same size as your portrait subject, in this case yourself.,
Look at how the upper lid is in relation to the lower one.,
Don't worry about the rest of the head, hair or neck for now, but leave room on the paper for them later.,
Draw a very light plumb line down the center of that space between the eyes to the bottom of the chin and up to the hairline.,
Measure your eye-width unit and compare that distance to the distance between the inside corner of one eye to the bottom of the nose.,
Look for the width of the cheekbones and make a light mark to indicate those, then work sideways to the ears.,
Indicate the character of the chin and jawbone.

,
Indicate the height and width of the hair, and carefully draw the outline of it, adding masstone in the value of lightness or darkness of the hair.,
When you have your proportions indicated, look at areas of light and dark in your subject.,
Notice the shape and proportions of the upper and lower lids of the eyes.,
Indicate the shape of the skull and the curves of the flesh that cover it by gradually shading the sides of the face and jaw, the eye sockets, the dip in the skull above the eyes, then pick out some of the lighter areas in the masstones of the hair.

,
Gently shade the shadow side of the nose and try to capture the unique shape of it, especially the tip.,
Notice the dip between the two halves of the upper lip and gently shade the shadow side of that and the shadow side of the upper lip, toward the corner of the mouth.

,
Notice the areas of light and dark on the mouth and gently shade those; then the receding area below the lower lip.,
Don't work from photos!",How to Paint a Portrait," Using a drawing paper pad, or even some xerox paper taped to a sturdy board, a conte crayon or piece of vine charcoal (a soft pencil will do, too) and a mirror, sit in front of the mirror and study your features. Set up your working area so that there is a light coming from one side. If you are right handed, the light should be on your left side and slightly above you.;
, Hold your head steady while drawing. Use your eyes, not your head, to look down at your paper. Don't move your head from side to side. There are several approaches artists use. I will start with my favorite portrait artist's, Richard Schmid's: look at one of your eyes. Study it carefully. You will draw the eye first and work gradually out from there, comparing proportions and measuring carefully.

, Is there a prominent fold above the eyeball or not? Are the eyebrows bushy or thin, arched or straight or sloped? Very lightly draw an oval on your paper that is approximately the proportion and shape of your left eye.

, It's easier to draw a face the first time if you are looking straight-on to the mirror. Most faces are fairly symmetrical but not perfectly so. Notice the distance from the right eye to the left. Using the width of the eye as a basic measuring unit, gauge the width of that space between the eyes and carefully draw the outline, lid and iris of the left eye, then mark the space between the eyes; then draw the outline and some detail of the right eye. Indicate the direction and width of the eyebrows.

, This will help keep your drawing symmetrical.

, Make a light, short line at the bottom of the nose. Compare the width of the eye to the width of the nose. Make a mark on either side of your plumb line indicating the width of the nose. Then compare the distance between the bottom of the nose and the separation of the lips. Keep checking those proportions! Getting those proportions right is what makes a good portrait or likeness.

, The ear is a very complex thing to draw, and quite unique to each person. The top of the ear is usually somewhere around the level of the eyebrows, but again, look carefully before you draw. Each person's face is unique!

,, Don't worry about details! When you look at someone's hair, you notice the color and shape, not the individual hairs. It should be the same in your drawing.

, Gently shade some of the darker areas to get a sense of dimension. Work on the darkest areas first -usually the iris. Leave white for the curved highlight on the iris. Notice that the eyeball is curved and that one side of the eyeball is slightly in shadow. Look carefully at the proportion and location of the highlights.

, Don't worry about lashes - they can be gently indicated by a darker line later on.

,, That is another characteristic point of the face.

,, The lower lip casts a shadow but don't make too much of it. Finally, indicate the shadow side of the jaw, indicate the neck and collar, with some shading on the neck to make it believable and pick out a few lights in the hair with the corner of your eraser. You're finished! But don't stop there! Keep at it! You will only get better!

, Keep doing self-portraits until it comes easily to you, then ask a friend to sit for you for an hour or so. They can watch tv, which you can set up behind you, perhaps? Or have them read a book. Their eyes will be looking down and not towards you, however. Working from life is always better than working from photography, especially at the beginning. Photography doesn't show all the detail or the subtle changes in value that are essential to a good portrait.

Choose a hollow piece of glass.,
Find the perfect spray paint at your local craft store, hobby shop, or hardware store.,
Clean the glass thoroughly to be sure it is free of any residue, dirt or dust.,
Cover the exterior of the glass object.,
Spray the paint inside the object.,
Allow the paint to dry.,
Apply layers to meet your preference.,
Try acrylics.",How to Paint a Smooth Finished Effect on Glass2," For this this effect we are going to be painting the object on the inside, so you want to find a jar, vase, glass, or even a decorative glass object or animal which has access to a hollow inside.

, Some suggestions might be a light blue or green to create a transparent, antique glass look. You may prefer a bold red to add a modern pop of color to your home.

, White vinegar and water will give you the best clean finish. Drying with a microfiber towel ensures that no lint is left behind., In order to avoid any paint adhering to the outside of your project, wrap the object in a piece of plastic or a plastic bag and tape it well around the opening with painters tape., Insert the nozzle of the spray paint can through the opening of your object and coat the inside with a layer of paint. If it is an oddly shaped item, make sure that the hole is large enough to allow you to manipulate the nozzle in every direction to be able to reach all angles. Rotate the object as you go to ensure full coverage. If excess paint is collecting in one area, roll the object to spread the paint and avoid drips.

, Place the object with the opening facing down. Drying takes at least five minutes to be dry to the touch. Make sure the paint is completely dry before applying a second coat.

, For a more transparent look, you can use only a couple of layers. If you want a solid color, continue repeating the layering process until you reach the desired coverage.

, If the hole in your object doesn't fit the spray paint nozzle, consider pouring acrylic paint instead. Some acrylic paints are designed to be used on glass.These can be found at most hobby shops. They take longer to dry, but some can be baked to dry more quickly than air drying.


One benefit of using acrylics over spray paint is that you can get a nice opaque look using only one layer.
Another benefit of acrylic is being able to control where the paint goes as you roll it around the inside of the object. If you leave some of the glass clear, you can create a design with the paint.

Paint the basic rose shape.,
Draw separate curves over the edge.,
Build additional layers of curves.,
Apply white paint to each curve.,
Draw a swirl in the center of the rose.Clean the brush again, then side load one corner with your darkest color again.,
Let the paint dry.,
Lightly wash the rose with the original shade, if desired.Clean the brush, then dip it into a very small amount of your light shade.",How to Paint a Rose2," Load a flat paintbrush with paint in a light shade of your main color. Apply this paint to your work surface, creating the basic shape of the rose.


This light shade will serve as the actual color of the rose.
Essentially, the basic shape will look like a lumpy circle or uneven cloud. Create shorter, more pronounced lumps along one side of the upper edge. Progress into longer, shallow lumps along the diagonally opposite lower edge.
Clean your brush with water and paper towels before continuing to the next step.

, Side load your brush with a darker shade of your main color, then apply the paint in curves to the inside edges of your rose base.


This new color should simply be a darker shade of the previous hue. It will create the appearance of shadows on the rose.
To side load the brush, only dip one corner of the brush into the paint. Alternatively, you could switch to a thin liner brush.
These curves should roughly follow the lumps you created around the perimeter of the base, but leave some room in between the curves and the actual edge. Place tight curves along the short, pronounced lumps at the upper edge. Draw loose, open curves along the lower edge.
Place each curve at a slightly different level to prevent the tails from connecting with one another.

, Fill the inner space of the rose with additional curves, gradually connecting the space between your lower petal curves and your upper ones.


As a general rule, fill two-thirds of the rose with upper curves that mimic the flow and direction of your original upper curves. Fill the remaining third with lower curves.
Note that each set of curves should gradually become tighter as it nears the center of the rose.

, Clean your brush, then side load white paint onto one corner. Apply this paint to the outer edge of each petal.


The white paint should be used to mimic the appearance of light on each petal.
For each defined petal, apply the white paint over the outer edge. It will typically lie opposite the dark paint on each petal section.

, Use this paint to draw a tight spiral in the center of the rose.


Place the spiral inside the tightest set of curves.
The spiral will usually curve upward, but may not depending on how you painted the surrounding petals of the rose.

, Add any desired touch-ups to the appearance of the rose, then allow the paint to completely dry before handling it further.


If you're satisfied with the way the rose currently looks, you can stop here and skip the final step.

, Apply a very thin and even layer of this paint over the entire rose.


This final layer washes out the other colors, making the variations seem less dramatic and more evenly blended. This step can be difficult, however, since it is easy to apply too much paint, thereby covering desired details.

Take your paintings off the wall and place them on a flat, stable surface.,
Make an ""X"" across the front of the paintings with masking tape if they are framed with glass.,
Cover the glass or top of the painting with a piece of heavy cardboard.,
Wrap the paintings in a thick layer of bubble wrap.,
Look for boxes that are appropriately sized for your paintings.,
Place paintings one at a time inside the boxes.,
Gently move the box back and forth to see if the painting can move.,
Close the boxes and use packing tape to seal up all the edges.

,
Write ""Fragile"" with thick black marker on the side of the box so the people moving it will know that something breakable and valuable is inside.

,
Use a telescopic box if your painting is too large for the average sized boxes that you get from shipping supply stores or other retailers.",How to Pack Paintings,";
, This will protect the paintings and keep the glass in place in case it breaks or cracks when the paintings are moved.

, This could be part of a box that you are not using. The cardboard should be large enough to cover the glass, but not bigger than the entire painting.


Use mat board, foam or even loose carpet padding if you do not have any cardboard. The purpose is to reduce the amount of static cling that can develop between the bubble wrap and the painting.

, Depending on the shape of the paintings, you can wrap horizontally or vertically, or both, whichever keeps the paintings more secure.


Secure the edges of the bubble wrap with masking tape, at the back of the paintings. The paintings should feel tightly wrapped and secure once you are done.

, Most moving and shipping companies sell mirror and art boxes.


Get boxes that are a bit larger than the paintings you will be packing. You will need to factor in the room that bubble wrap and other packing materials might take.

, If there is extra space inside the box, stuff newspaper, rags or other filling into the box so the painting has little room to move.

, If it can, fill the box with more packing material.

,,, This type of box is actually 2 boxes that fit inside each other. They work well for paintings that are larger than 30 inches by 36 inches (76 cm by 91 cm).


Fill the spaces between the telescope boxes with wadded newspaper, bubble wrap or other packing materials.

Look up the requirements for your portfolio.,
Choose finished or unfinished pieces, based on the requirements for your portfolio.,
Include observational drawings.,
Highlight your best pieces.,
Ask a friend to look over your art.,
Include supplemental articles, publications or awards.,
Use other portfolios as examples.,
Tailor your portfolio to the institution.,
Organize your portfolio.,
Keep it simple.,
Stand out, but don't be overzealous.,
Create a virtual portfolio.,
Practice presenting your portfolio.,
Gain feedback once you have completed your portfolio.,
Update your portfolio on a regular basis.",How to Make an Art Portfolio," Every organization is different and so they may require different things within your portfolio or a different format for your portfolio. Your portfolio will also depend greatly on the type of study or career you are interested in pursuing. For example, if you are applying to a film school or animation school, your portfolio will likely be digital and consist mostly of work that you have done within that field. On the other hand, if you are applying to an architecture school or to an art gallery you may have more sketches and drawings.
Some institutions suggest only using about 10 to 20 pieces in your portfolio. If you have really strong pieces, fewer is better because the more pieces you have the more likely it is that the quality of the pieces will drop. Always check what the organization expects before you begin piecing together your portfolio. You don't want to waste time creating a portfolio one way, and then have to redo it because it's not in the right format.;
, Many schools in the United States require that all of your work be finished, but some in other areas such as the United Kingdom want to see your process and development.


Check the requirements for your portfolio before you do one or the other. If you are allowed to use unfinished pieces, do so. This reveals your skills, commitment, and depth of knowledge as well as gives context to the creation and thought process behind your work. A piece of art is often more than just the finished product, but greatly depends upon the process and experimentation of the piece.Make sure all pieces, both finished and unfinished, are perfected. Remove any smudges, fingerprints, or defects that have been left on the piece.

, These pieces prove that you are able to observe something in real life and create your own replica of it on paper. Observational drawings or paintings can make up a substantial part of your portfolio.


The purpose of these drawings is to show those looking at your portfolio that you are able to record shape and form, detail, perspective, proportion, and surface qualities. When drawing something from observation, aim for a sense of realism, without creating a rigid, mechanical copy of it. It may help to select a subject that's important to you, because you'll begin to think about the themes and motifs behind the drawings, rather than what's right in front of you.

, If you have been an artist for awhile you likely have an array of pieces, from the best, to really good, to mediocre, to poor. It may be tempting to choose your really good work along with your best work. However, these two need to be separated. You don't want to just showcase your really good work. You want to showcase only your best, the pieces that you are certain without a doubt show quality, ability, artistry, and creativity.


Be selective with your work and don't choose pieces just for the sake of variety. It's better to have solid pieces of art that vary less in medium or style than it is to have a lot of different mediums and styles but mediocre art.If it's difficult to be unbiased or edit your own work, ask a friend or two what pieces are your best pieces. It could also be helpful to find a mentor in your own field. Look for someone with artistic talent who has been in your shoes before who can help you make difficult decisions like these. And, the good thing is you know you can trust their judgement because they have experience in artistry as well.
Never choose art that is an imitation of someone else's art. Admissions offices and employers have seen thousands of portfolios and will likely be able to recognize if you have created artwork from a photograph or another piece of art. This also reveals your lack of creativity and inability to create art from real life., After you have picked out a significant body of work, have a friend or mentors look over it, asking them to give feedback on the different pieces you have picked out.


Some of your art may need to be redone or improved, so give yourself enough time before the portfolio needs to be submitted to improve your artwork.
Build in time after you've chosen your pieces to reflect and come back to those pieces once you've been able to process. It's important to give yourself this time because you will be able to better evaluate your work and will come back to it with less bias.
Sometimes friends can be biased towards your work as well, so it may be more beneficial to bring in someone that doesn't have a personal relationship with you. It may be easier to receive constructive criticism from them as well.
Learn to take constructive criticism well and know that it's not an insult or derogatory comment, but given so that you can improve as an artist.

, Some institutions will not ask for this, so once again, check the requirements for your portfolio. However, this can be helpful to show that your work has been recognized by others and that it has has previous exposure.

, The best way to begin a project like a portfolio is to find other successful portfolios online and use those as your guide. This doesn't mean copy the format, or follow the portfolio piece by piece, but it means to use it as a reference as you being making yours.


Note how the artist organized his or her pieces. Pay attention to the style and design of the portfolio. Are your eyes drawn more to the design of the portfolio or are you drawn to the art? If it feels intimidating or daunting to look at other portfolios, remember that only the best work is what is displayed. Art is made up of technical skill as well as creativity, so even if your technical skill isn't as advanced as those you see, your creativity can make up for it.

, A university and an art gallery may have very different ideas about what they would like to see in your portfolio or the design of your portfolio. It's important that as you begin assembling and organizing your portfolio that you keep the audience in mind.


For example, if submitting your work to an art gallery, visit the gallery and make sure your work will fit in well in the gallery. Choose pieces, design, and organization of your portfolio that show you are familiar with the gallery and are aware of the art they carry.If applying to a university or job, always look up the requirements for the portfolio, but tailor your portfolio to the type of institution as well. You may be applying to a more prestigious art university that values technique and style, or maybe you are applying to a school that places a higher emphasis and creativity and experimentation. Keep these things in mind as you design and organize your portfolio.

, Group pieces by style, subject, media, technique, etc. You want to make it as easy as possible for your reviewer to find the important information, or to determine if you are a good fit for their institution. By organizing your pieces you will give your reviewer an easy path to follow. You want your portfolio to tell a story.


Group by medium. It's valuable to use different types of mediums in your portfolio to show you are well rounded and capable of doing different art forms. It can be helpful to group these mediums together so that your portfolio clearly shows your different abilities and how you've used each medium in your art. For example, you might group pastel art together, and then group charcoal drawings and pencil drawings together, and then you might group paintings together.
Group by subject. Another way to group your artwork is by subject, which will likely combine different mediums, but will show your ability to accurately depict different things. For example, you may group by figure drawings, drawings of landscape, abstract art, etc.
Group by technique. This is similar to grouping by medium, but instead you are focusing on your range of abilities to use not just paper, but digital media, photography, web design, animation, etc.
Use a scrapbook or portfolio binder found at any art or craft store to organize and present your artwork.

, As an artist, you may be tempted to have a really extravagant, creative portfolio. While it's great if your pieces are this way, the portfolio that holds and displays your pieces should be professional, organized, and simple.


The purpose of this is because you don't want a very busy portfolio to distract your viewer from the artwork. You want the focus to be on your artwork, because that's what you are really trying to showcase.Space out your portfolio. Don't have too many pieces on one page and don't go overboard with the information you include.

, With an industry that is so competitive, it's important for your work to stand out. You don't want to be grouped in with the hundreds of people who have also submitted their portfolio, so try to create a portfolio that highlights your pieces so well in a creative way that the reviewers can't help but notice. Be careful about overdoing it, though. If your attempts to stand out lead you to creating something corny, or trying to be humorous but failing, you may go unnoticed, or be noticed but in a negative way.
The benefit of a portfolio is that you aren't just a name on a piece of paper like a resume. Your work really speaks to who you are and it is easier for an employer to grow attached to the creative impressions in your portfolio than a written set of job skills.
Don't overthink your portfolio. Once you have completed it, have a mentor give you feedback, go over it a few times to make sure it is organized well, and clear of any mistakes, and then leave it. By continually trying to edit and improve your portfolio, you run the risk of changing it to ""make it stand out"" that may lead to a decrease in the professionalism of your portfolio.

, While it's handy to have your portfolio in a hard copy, having a virtual copy of your portfolio will be helpful when submitting your portfolio online, which is likely what you'll have to do for most applications.


Photograph or scan your artwork. After you have chosen the pieces for your portfolio, use a good quality camera to take pictures of your art, or ask a professional to take the pictures. Make sure the pictures are clear and high quality so that when viewed online the resolution is good. Choose a setting with excellent lighting and no glare, and never use a flash. When scanning artwork, make sure there are no wrinkles on the page and that it lies flat on the scanner so the picture comes out exactly like the hard copy.
Input these pictures into Indesign or another program that allows you to create a clean cut portfolio that is easy to continually edit.
This not only provides you with a digital copy to use online, but also serves as a backup in case your hard copy is lost or destroyed.

, If you have the opportunity to show your portfolio in person, it's important to practice going through it, knowing what you will say for each piece and how you can effectively communicate why you think your work stands out and is valuable.


Once you've practiced it on your own a few times, present it to a friend or mentor who can give you feedback on your presentation and how you are communicating your art.
Once again, your art should speak for itself. When presenting a portfolio you shouldn't have to go in depth on every piece to explain it, it should explain itself for the most part. However, there may be pieces that were inspired by an event in your life or mean something to you. Use those as an opportunity to show your creativity and passion behind your work.

, Ask a mentor or friend to look over your completed portfolio, making notes on the organization, themes, format, and final work you have chosen.


You can also attend a portfolio review. There are National Portfolio days in which college admissions counselors will come to high schools and college campus events to review students' artwork. Seek feedback on how you can improve your portfolio, and use this as a trial run to prepare you for officially presenting your portfolio.Little details matter too. If you have text in your portfolio, always check for grammar mistakes. It can be easy to focus on just the art, but employers and admissions counselors want to see that you have reviewed all of your work and that you take this submission seriously. You don't want to spend all your time making a fantastic portfolio that an employer or admissions counselor loves, and then lose all chance of being chosen because you misspelled the name of the institution or used incorrect grammar., Even if you have already submitted your portfolio to several institutions, always be ready to update and revise your portfolio with new and better work. Save time doing this as you go, so that you won't have to do a major project of revision the next time you submit your portfolio.


This will keep your work relevant, and up to date with your abilities and awards.
Continually ask yourself, ""Am I in this?"" Your art should reflect yourself and your passions so as you update and revise your portfolio make sure it still conveys the story you hope to communicate.

Make a fitted bodice, the better for the ballerina's partner to lift her for the gazelle-like leaps.,
When the whole painting is dry paint from the waistline to the hem a few strokes of either orange or pink to create the illusion that the skirt is gathered at the waist.,
Don't forget her slippers, ribbon laces and headpiece.,
Allow your painting to dry.,
Admire your work of art.",How to Paint a Ballerina in Watercolor," Aspiring fashion designers use these figures to trace to avoid having to draw a new figure each time. Go to one of the copyright free, stock sharing websites and find pictures of ballerinas in standard poses.  Or, search for free, printable ballerina coloring pages for a figure. If the figure is clothed, just trim away the edges of the clothes to achieve a clear silhouette and reveal the body's contours. Enlarge the figure on the printer to approximately 9"" tall.  Glue this figure to a piece of tag board and cut it out.;
,, Now for the fun!  Classic ballet costumes come in a wide variety of styles, some short and puffy, known as a tu tu.  Others can reach the mid-calf or be longer.  Rehearsal skirts can be almost any length and are often nothing more than a couple of layers of netting with an elastic waistband. 

, The lid of your paintbox is where can mix your colors. Wipe it off and change your water as needed, trying to keep each color clear and clean.

, Start with any color, but for this lesson, let's use yellow. Paint the skirt by loading your brush thoroughly with the color and gliding it over the skirt area. Try for a layer that lets the white of the paper shine through. Leave little skips of white paper showing. Let it dry thoroughly.

Start the strokes at the waistline and pull the color down toward the him, keeping the brush wet and loaded with plenty of color., Draw this second layer of skirt fuller and slightly longer than the yellow underskirt. Let dry and repeat with another color, say pink. Again, juxtapose this third layer of skirt. Have the hemline not match with the underskirts. The legs showing through the skirt add to the illusion of transparency.

, Perhaps add small, off the shoulder strips of gathered netting suggesting fallen straps. Paint these items colors that coordinate with the three colors of netting on the skirt

, .jpg.jpg|center]], Use Glitter glue sparingly. Apply a tiny spot and rub it with your fingers to spread it over the costume.

, Stand up your artwork.  Step back and imagine what kind of background it needs. If this is one of your first ballerina paintings, you might be tempted to put in a complicated background, but remember, the dancer is the focus. Keep her the most important element. Your imagination will kick into gear and you will think of many possibilities.  If nothing comes, page through a magazine or look out the window for ideas from nature.  Sketch the background, but simplify the shapes as a scenic designer might.  Doing washes around the figure will look like colored lights.  Possibly wash around the figure in lavender, as if she is in the spotlight. Another possibility is to wet the background with water and drop colors onto the wet areas. They will merge and create a magical background.

, This ballerina will be suitable for framing.  Hang it in your room to enjoy each day.  It will make you smile."

Paint the cardinal’s legs with black paint.",How to Make Handprint Cardinals," The size of your piece of paper doesn’t matter too much, as long as it can comfortably fit your hand. If you want to add more background detail though, you should use a 9”x12” (23cm x 30cm) sheet., Using scissors, cut a branch out of brown construction paper. Make sure the branch is large enough to hold the bird you’ll be painting on later. Use white craft glue to glue the branch onto your background, near the bottom of the page.Instead of construction paper, you can also paint a branch onto your blue construction paper using brown paint., Dip a paintbrush in white paint. Dab the paintbrush on the construction paper to make white dots for snowflakes. You can also paint snow onto the branch by running the paintbrush along its length.


If you have a bit more skill, you can paint more intricate snowflakes, using linear strokes to create snowflake patterns.Instead of painting snowflakes, you can make them out of paper and glue them onto your piece.

, Use a paintbrush to cover the palm of your hand with red paint. Cover the underside of your fingers with paint as well. Place your hand on the paper horizontally and press firmly, leaving a red handprint. This will be the main body of the cardinal. Make sure to stamp the paper slightly above the branch, leaving room for the cardinal’s legs.Rinse your paintbrush under the tap, or a container filled with water, before moving on to the next step.
Allow the handprint to dry before moving on.

, Dip a paintbrush into black paint, then paint a dot on the handprint, a bit below where the thumb meets the palm of the hand. This will give the appearance of an eye. Rinse the paintbrush after painting the eye.Instead of painting on an eye, you can use a googly eye., Paint a small triangle where the wrist would connect to the handprint. This will give the appearance of a beak. Rinse the paintbrush after painting the beak., Paint two long lines, starting at the bottom of the handprint and stopping just above the branch, to make the legs. Then paint three smaller lines at an angle, forming the cardinal’s toes at the tip of each leg. The toes should overlap the branch slightly."

Transfer the design onto your stencil surface.,
Place the photo paper or poster board on a piece of cardboard or foam board and cut out the image with a sharp utility knife to create the stencil.








,
Flip the completed stencil over and lightly cover the back of the stencil with a spray adhesive.,
Use masking or painter’s tape to secure the edges of the stencil to the fabric, and to protect the fabric from over-spray from the airbrush.








",How to Make Airbrush Stencils2,"









Print designs from your computer onto glossy photo paper. The weight of photo paper makes a sturdy stencil that can be reused, and the glossy finish makes it easy to wipe off excess paint.
Use tracing paper to transfer original drawings or hard copies of images onto a piece of poster board. Poster board also makes a sturdy, reusable stencil.

,, Let the spray sit for 1 to 2 minutes before applying the stencil to your fabric surface, or the adhesive may leave a residue on the fabric.

Gather bristle materials.,
Select a handle.,
Choose an adhesive and binding materials.,
Apply the glue.,
Apply your bristles.,
Bind your bristles in place.,
Let the glue dry.,
Cut and shape the bristles.",How to Make a Paintbrush," Decide what you you want to make your brush out of and gather the necessary materials. You can use any material that will hold paint for a brush tip. Below are some suggestions for possible materials..


You can use hair, such as horsehair from a horse's mane or tail, human hair, or other animal hair, available at sporting good stores for fly-tying.
Plant materials such as tree needles, grasses, or straw also work well.Larger fibrous plants like yucca or cattail stems can also be shredded to create bristles.You can also use household items such as pieces of foam, cardboard, cotton clumps, shredded strips of cloth, broom bristles etc.Craft materials like yarn, pom poms, or crepe paper can also work as bristles.;
, There are likewise many materials from which you can make your brush handle.Try sticks from the yard, bamboo, tongue depressors, or a yardstick.


For a more professional and finished look, you can use doweling.If you are using string, yarn, or some other material with long fibers for your bristles, you can pull your bristles through a wide plastic straw.If you are using small items like pom poms or cosmetic wedges for the head of your brush, or if you aren't concerned about your brush being precise or lasting a long time, a quick shortcut is to just clip your brush material into clothes pins, and use the clothes pin as a handle. This is a great approach for young children., To make sure your brush holds together, you'll need to select an adhesive material (i.e. some kind of glue) and a binding material to wrap around bristles.For a durable, long lasting brush, use a strong, waterproof glue.
For binding the bristles to the handle, there are many different materials you can use, including string, twine, elastic, rubber bands, or wire., Place the glue about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch around the bottom of the stick where the bristles will go.

If you aren't concerned about creating a long-lasting brush, you can skip the glue and just affix your bristles with your binding material.

, Cover the end of your handle (where the glue is) with about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) of your bristle materials.


You can vary the thickness of your brush by applying more or less of your bristle material., Tie string, twine, or other binding material around the bristles and handle.


Make sure the binding is tight so your bristles do not slip out, especially if you aren't using glue.You may want to add more glue over the top of your binding to create a stronger, more durable brush., The amount of time necessary for this will vary depending on your glue and the amount you used. Follow the instructions that came with your glue, and if in doubt, wait a longer than might be necessary.

, Once the bristles are firmly secured, you can cut them to the length and shape you want.You'll probably want to keep about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) in length. The width will vary according to how thick you'd like your brushstrokes to be.


For a more precise brush, cut the bristles around the outside a little shorter than those in the center, so the bristles come to something of a point."

Choose the proper glass paints.,
Apply the paint.,
Prepare the glass.,
Add a finishing touch.",How to Learn the Art of Glass Painting," There are 2 different types of glass paint- water-based and non-water based. Both have good range of colors and are inter mixable within their ranges. Water based paints can be diluted with water, tools are easy to clean, drying time is 20 minutes, fully dry in 2 - 3 days.


Non-water based paints can be diluted with ceramic thinner, brushes can be cleaned in white spirit, drying time is 2 hours,fully dry in 8 hours.;
, When filling in areas between outlines with a brush, apply paint generously by puddling the paint or using a pipette. This will give a flat,stained glass effect. To get a lighter color paint,dilute with water for water-based paint or gloss varnish for the non-water based paints. Always pour paint into a palette rather than using straight from the jar. This prevents colors becoming dirty or diluted.


Sponging is another way of applying glass paint,this is good for covering large areas and blending colors while wet. The first coat can also be allowed to dry,then over sponged with a second color.







, Before starting to paint,remove any traces of dust and grease from the surface to ensure good adherence. Use a solvent such as white spirit or methylated spirit.

, You may want to protect your solvent based paint with a coat of varnish. Glass paint varnish comes in a gloss or matte finish. The gloss varnish can be used as a colorless thinner to obtain pastel shades, without affecting the transparency and depth of color. The matte varnish gives a finish like frosted glass. To add finishing touches to a project,while painting is still wet, you can use tweezers to add beads or sequins. The wet paint will act as a glue.You can also add glitter by sprinkling it over the wet paint. Well, congrats! You have mastered the art of glass painting..

Clean the surface.,
Fill in holes or major flaws.,
Choose a painting instrument.",How to Hide Wall Flaws with Textured Paint1," Before applying any paint to a damaged wall, you need to clean the surface. If you don’t clean the surface, your paint job won’t be as effective as you want it to be. In the end, you might create textures you don’t want to create. Clean by:


Removing any dust, pet hair, or other grime from the surface. For example, take a vacuum or shop-vac and vacuum up spider webs or dirt.
Using a damp rag to wipe down the wall before you paint it.
Making sure to use soap or vinegar to remove any substantial dirty or scum from the wall.;
, While texture can hide minor or even moderate wall flaws, some flaws require you to fix them before painting. Fortunately, you won’t have to spend too much time fixing the hole because your textured paint will hide imperfections.


Either cut a new piece of drywall or use spackle to fill the hole.
Use joint compound to smooth over the patch.
Apply a second coat of compound, if you want.
Either smooth over or leave the compound or spackle textured., After you’ve cleaned the surface and fixed any major issues, you’ll need to choose how you’ll apply the paint to the wall. This is perhaps one of your most important decisions, as its perhaps the simplest way to add texture to your paint job. Decide what you want to use and:


Pick a roller with the type of texture you want. You can choose a smooth roller and apply your own texture after painting or you could pick a textured roller.
Use a brush to paint your wall. The brush will leave a light texture and you can go back later and add more.
Spray your paint on and apply more texture later."
"
Use a paint that contains texture.,
Add texture to regular paint.,
Apply an orange peel texture.",How to Hide Wall Flaws with Textured Paint2," Texture paint is one of the simplest ways to hide wall flaws. Texture paint, though, is a lot like drywall mud and may take extra time to apply. However, it should be able to hide a lot of minor flaws like dents, chips, nail holes, and more. Start by priming the wall and picking your favorite textured paint.


Paint an entire wall quickly. This is important, as texture paint dries relatively fast. If one area dries before you’ve finished the wall, lines may appear where the paint dried first.
Use a regular roller, brush, or a sprayer if you’re painting a large area.
Use extra paint on a flawed area, to fill it in or obscure it.
Apply two coats of your texture paint., While texture paint may be a simple way to go, there are not many color options available. To get around this, you can purchase texture additive and combine it with your paint before applying it. In the end, you'll find that chips, nail holes, and other mild or moderate flaws will be obscured. Pick your paint color and:


Pour your paint into a mixing container.
Add about half a cup of additive to your paint at a time. Mix the additive in and then add more additive.
Prime the wall.
Paint the wall. Use extra paint around a wall flaw. This will help obscure it., Orange peel texture looks like that of an orange peel. Thus, it is a great way to hide a variety of wall flaws including larger dents, scrapes, and small or medium sized holes. To apply orange peel texture, buy or rent a hopper gun and fill it with plaster.


Spray the plaster over the wall until you get your desired texture. If you need, spray extra plaster over flaws.
Prime and paint the wall any color you want."
"
Create texture with old paintbrushes.,
Dab sponges on your paint.,
Embrace faux painting.",How to Hide Wall Flaws with Textured Paint3," Old brushes can add to your existing paint brush or roller work and create a rich texture that hides minor wall flaws like scrapes and chips. In the end, you’ll likely have fun by using your brushes to add extra texture to your wall. Start by gathering different sized brushes from around your house.


Wash your brushes so there is no dirt or other debris attached to them.
Take your brushes and brush texture in all over your wet paint. Leave enough brush marks so the wall damage blends with your newly created texture.
If you need more paint, feel free to use it.
Try to complete one small section of wall at a time. For example, paint and texture one 8 foot (2.44 meter) by 10 foot (3 meter) section before moving on to another., By dabbing sponges on your wet paint, you’ll create a texture that will conceal wall damage or wall flaws like a poor mudding/taping job, indentations, and more. In the end, you’ll have a unique paint job that reflects your personality and taste. Start by taking sponges and lightly dabbing them on wet paint.


Make sure your sponges are clean and don’t have any dirt or other debris attached.
Repeat your dabbing over the entire surface of the wall. Create any pattern you want.
Do some extra dabbing around wall flaws so they seem like they're just part of the overall pattern.
If you need, dip the sponge into more paint so you can create a richer texture over your wall., Faux painting is a great way of concealing flawed wall by making it seem like a deliberate part of your overall design. Thus, faux painting offers a unique opportunity to use large and small wall flaws to enhance your larger paint scheme.


Paint a color lightly over a bright base coat, like a white.
Take a cloth and wipe down the wall unevenly. In addition, take a brush and brush some uneven lines into the paint. Do this so it mimics any pre-existing wall flaws. That way, wall flaws will seem like they're just part of the faux paint job.
To add more texture, use a sponge with a darker shade and dab over the wall flaw. For example, if you’re main wall color is a cream color, use a slightly darker cream color to accent wall flaws and other textured areas.
If you need to repair the wall, don’t spend a lot of effort smoothly out your putty work."

Remember to be fair because we are not all natural-born artists! When evaluating a painting, get some background information on the artist. If you are evaluating a student (for teachers) then consider other artwork the student has done.;
, Consider the theme of this painting. Does it have a unique theme, or is it a common idea? If it is different, appreciate that the artist is trying to be unique.Consider other artwork the person has done to look for a theme in the paintings. Themes can include:


Abstract
Cubism
Portraits
Landscapes

, If the painting has a common theme, consider how well it interprets the work of others.

, The quality of the painting is very important. The ideas behind it can be very creative, but the painting itself has to be up to par. Quality depends on the medium you use, and the type of canvas. To evaluate quality, consider:


Is the painting sloppy? (Messy lines, fading paint traces, paint marks all over the painting)
Has the paint been well-mixed together?

, Do the colours complement each other or contrast each other? Does this work well with the painting?

, Is the painting well-proportioned or are there blotches of paint and shapes in random corners of the painting? You have to look at the painting from further away and see if the painting is balanced. Also, consider the sizes of the images in the painting. Are they big/small enough? Do you have to squint to see the images?

, Is there detail in the painting?

Choose a non-textured, plain ceramic tile.,
Purchase ceramic tile paint or an oil-based paint.,
Select appropriately-sized brushes for your project.,
Set up your workspace.",How to Do Tile Painting1," If you are simply painting a tile as a stand-alone art piece, the simpler the tile the better. You can also, however, paint any ceramic tile that already exists in your house, though textured tiles require a bit more precision.


Both glazed and unglazed tiles will work fine for this process.;
, It is extremely important that you use the correct type of paint in order for it to adhere to the ceramic tile and not be affected by exposure to elements such as water.

, If you are painting an intricate scene or design on your tile, you'll most likely need several different sizes of brushes. If you are painting a large bathroom wall, for example, you can use a larger brush.

, Make sure to lay down newspaper or a drop cloth over any surface that you do not want to get paint on.


Keep damp rags nearby in case you need to fix any mistakes and have water ready to clean your paintbrushes if necessary.

"
"
Prepare the tile or the surface for painting.,
If necessary, obtain an orbital sander to prep any rough surfaces to be painted.,
Apply an oil-based high adhesion primer to home surfaces.,
Allow your surface to dry before beginning to paint.

",How to Do Tile Painting2," You'll need to extensively scrub home surfaces using a toothbrush and a bathroom cleaning product in order to remove any stains or discoloration before beginning to paint. For single tiles, simply wipe the surface clean using a rag and soapy water.


Use bleach or hydrogen peroxide to remove any mold.
Vinegar works well for removing soap scum and shower residue.

, Use 1800 grit sandpaper to smooth the tile and remove uneven gloss.


Clean up the grit and shavings with a vacuum before continuing.

, Oil primers are efficient at preventing stains and holding on to ceramic and/or oil-based paint. Apply two coats if necessary.

,"
"
Decide on your colors and/or design.,
Transfer your design to the tile very lightly using a pencil before you start to paint.,
After you've outlined your designs (if any), paint the surface following your template.,
Let the paint dry for 48 hours on large home projects and 24 hours for small, decorative art pieces.

,
Coat with a final layer of clear urethane to seal in the paint.",How to Do Tile Painting3," If you are painting existing tile in your home, make sure that the colors you choose complement the rest of your design scheme. It is usually best to choose light colors when painting your tile, as dark or bright colors can overwhelm a room.


Ask yourself aesthetic questions. Do you want to fill up the entire tile space or simply paint one part of the tile? Both ways can be effective. One centered image of an animal, face, or object can look striking while a country scene, landscape, or cityscape would be a good way to fill the whole tile.
For a home surface, maybe you want to include an accent tile or a row of accent tiles that contain a pattern, picture, or word. Accent tiles can add beautiful variation and subtle color to a home tile surface.

, This is especially effective for intricate scenes or patterns. Be sure to press the pencil very lightly so that it is easy to hide with paint and/or erase if necessary.

,


If you are working on a whole home surface, apply several thin layers of paint, allowing the paint to dry in between coats.

,, You can apply several coats if desired.

Mix your colors together.,
Thin the paint with water to dilute it.,
Set up your canvas.,
Start painting the top of the canvas.,
Continue adding colors and let the paint dry.",How to Drip Paint1," Runny paints work best for drip painting. Liquid acrylics are generally cheap and can be found at general stores and art supply stores. Combine colors to personalize your palette, such as by adding brown to darken a color.A drip painting can be done with only one color. You can also layer multiple colors to create unique effects. How many colors you use is up to you.
The colors you choose also depend on your artistic vision. Some colors commonly go well together. Red, yellow, and blue are primary colors that stand out on their own and can be combined into other colors. Colors like yellow, red, and orange will give your painting a warmer feel. Colors like blue and purple will give your painting a cooler feel.;
, Water changes the consistency of the paint. You’ll need to do this to most paints to help them drip. Add the amount of paint you need to a plastic cup. Slowly pour in water. Mix the paint and add water until it reaches the consistency you desire. More water will thin the color and cause the paint to drip faster.More expensive acrylic paints are paste-like. Mix them with an equal amount of water and a medium such as Golden Clear Tar Gel or Liquitex Pouring Medium. Alternatively, opt for fluid acrylics.
Fluid acrylics pour well enough on their own, but you may thin them out further by mixing them with water.

, Lean your canvas upright against a stand or wall. For acrylic paints, cotton canvasses are a popular choice. Some artists also choose wood boards or thick paper. Any of these surfaces work well for drip painting. It’s also useful to have newspaper or other thick material beneath the canvas to catch paint runoff.You may also lay the canvas flat on the ground. Gravity won’t cause the paint to drip, but you can practice techniques such as spattering or dripping.

, Place paint at the top of the area you wish to drip paint. Paintbrushes, turkey basters, or other objects can be used to apply different amounts of paint. You can also squirt or pour paint directly onto the canvas. When the canvas is held upright, the paint will quickly begin to drip., How long you let the paint dry is up to you. To establish a solid color layer, allow the paint to dry completely. If the paint is still wet, new paint will drip down and mix into it. This is a good way to get very unique, organic designs. When you’re finished, allow the paint to dry."

Hammer a nail into the wall.,
Place the frame on the nail.",How to Frame a Canvas," Use a tape measure to determine the length, width, and depth of the canvas. Write the measurements down and keep them handy; this will help when you’re shopping for a frame.


Most tape measures have markings in 1/16 increments, so pay careful attention when measuring.
Being off by even 1/8 of an inch can mean buying the wrong frame size.Double check the measurements to make sure they are exact.;
, Frames are just as varied as the canvases they hold, so select a frame based on how you want the finished product to look. Some contrast between the canvas and the frame is pleasing to the eye.


Avoid frames that are very similar in color to the canvas.Contrast the style of the canvas with the style of the frame.Simple paintings will look good with ornate frames, and edgy modern art will look good in plainer frames.
In general, less is more.Don’t choose a frame that detracts from what is on the canvas.

, Now that you have the canvas’s measurements and know what style of frame you want, you can shop for a frame. Find one that is the same length, width, and depth of your canvas.


The standard frame sizes are 8×10, 11×14, 16×20, 18×24, 20×24, 24×30, and 30×40, but some stores will have other sizes like 10×20.If you’re shopping in-store, call the store to see if they carry the size you’re looking for. This will save you from making multiple trips to different stores.
Keep a list of what prices stores offer. This will help you find the best deal.
Shopping online for a frame is another good option. Websites will have the exact dimensions of the frames they sell online.

, These usually come in packs of four and can easily be found in a store or online.One pack of four is enough to frame one canvas.


Usually, the canvas clips do not require screws.
The types of canvas clips that require screws come in seven sizes: 1/8, ¼, 3/8, ½, ¾, 1, 1 ¼.Measure the frame back to the back of the stretcher bar to find out which size you need., Lay the frame face down on a flat surface, and place the canvas inside with the decorated side down.


Ensure that you do not scratch the decorated side of the canvas when setting it into the frame.
The canvas should sit on the frame's inner lip.
If the canvas is bulging out of the frame or is uneven, rearrange it so it sits perfectly inside the frame.
Keep in mind that every frame will be different; some fit very tightly, and others are looser., Pick one side to start with. Notice where the edge of the canvas meets the edge of the frame. Slide the pointed end of the clip in between the frame and the canvas’s edge. Then, pull the clip over the stretcher bar and press firmly in place.


The stretcher bar is what the canvas is stapled to.
Push down on the clip hard enough to ensure it stays in place.
Attach the other three clips in the same way.
Space the clips evenly around the canvas.

, Position the clips where you want them on the frame.One in the middle of each stretcher bar will work.


Then, use a pencil to draw a mark in the holes of the canvas clip, and draw marks for all four canvas clips.
Ensure the marks are dark enough for you to see, then drill a small pilot hole at each mark, taking caution to not drill through the frame or stretcher bar.Set the clips over the holes, and use screws to secure them.

, Now, you can check the finished product. The frame should fit snugly around the canvas. If the canvas slides out, you probably need to push the canvas clips down more tightly.

, The decoration should be right side up. If you are not sure the canvas is right side up, lift the canvas to check. With a pencil, draw a small mark on the stretcher bar that is the top side of the decoration. This will allow you to remember which side is the top. The wire will be in the right location if you keep the canvas right side up.

, Beginning from the top stretcher bar you just marked, draw a pencil mark 1/4 to 1/3 of the way down the canvas’s side stretcher bars. Look at the measurements of the canvas to determine how far down the mark should be.


For example, a painting that is 16 inches (40.7 cm) in length will have a mark about 5 inches (12.7 cm) from the top.Divide the length by 3 to figure this number out.
Use the tape measure to draw a mark 1/4 to 1/3 of the way down both sides.
Make sure both sides have a mark at the exact same spot., Screw each eye screw into the stretcher bar at the two points marked. Do not damage the decorated area of the canvas while attaching the screws.

, Add 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) to the width of the canvas to determine the length of wire you will cut.For example, if your canvas is 24 inches (61 cm) wide, then your hanger wire will be 30 to 32 inches (76.2 to 81.3 cm) long.
Measure out the wire length you need with a tape measure.
Use long-nose pliers to cut the desired length of hanger wire.

, First, lay the wire down horizontally on the back of the canvas. Beginning with either side, make a knot by first pulling one end of the wire underneath and through the eyehook. Now, pull the wire half an inch through the eyehook.Then, take the edge of the wire, and make a “P” shape by pulling the wire underneath itself. This should still be using only half an inch of the wire.
Push the tip of the wire through the circle of the “P” shape.
Then, pull the wire tightly. The “P” shape will disappear into a knot.
Repeat on the other side.
The wire should be slack enough to move 1 inch (2.5 cm) when hung on a nail.

, A dust cover is essentially a piece of paper, usually strong kraft paper, taped to the back of the canvas. This is a cheap and easy way to protect your canvas.Make sure the sheet of kraft paper you buy is bigger or equal in size to the framed canvas.
If the kraft paper curls after you cut it, flatten it under a heavy, flat object such as a book or glass pane.Once the kraft paper is flat, you can now attach it to the canvas.

, Using an ATG tape gun, apply double sided tape to each stretcher bar 1/8 of an inch from the edge.Do this for all four sides, and try to keep the tape in a straight line.

, Place the kraft paper firmly on top of the stretchers, ensuring that each edge of the kraft paper lines up with the edge of each stretcher bar.


Press the edges firmly down.
If there’s excess paper, you can trim it with a knife or scissors.
Now, you’re ready to hang the canvas!

, If you want the picture to get more attention, hang it in a busy area like a doorway or the middle of a room. If it isn’t an important picture, put it in a less busy area like a hallway or the corner of a room.

, For small to medium pictures, it is not necessary to find a wall stud, but for larger frames, a wall stud is necessary to hang it safely.From the center of a wall, wall studs are usually spaced 16-24 inches apart.Use a measuring tape to find out where your wall stud is likely to be.
Some people can hear wall studs by knocking on a wall with their knuckles. When the sound changes, there is a wall stud nearby.

, Grasp the nail with your thumb and first finger, and strike the nail with enough force for it to enter the wall.Remove your fingers once the nail is steadily inserted into the wall, and continue hammering until only a few centimeters of the nail is still outside of the wall.


A standard 16-ounce hammer will suffice.One 2-inch nail will support most pictures.Try to hammer the nail at a 45 degree angle.Hanging pictures 57 inches off the ground is standard. This is the average human eye-height and is regularly used in galleries and museums., Lift the frame, and place the hanger wire on the wall over the nail. Remove your hands slowly, and the frame should hang.


Ensure that the frame hangs safely and is not too heavy for the nail.
If the frame is too heavy, use another nail to support it.
Check that the frame hangs straight. If not, adjust it.

Wet the paint.,
Hold the paper upright.,
Dab paint onto the paper.,
Trace drip lines with water.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Drip Paint2," Inexpensive watercolor sets can be found at general stores and art supply stores. To prepare the paint, add water to it. Many watercolors come in containers, so all you need to do is dip your brush in water and dampen the paint., Set the paper upright to take advantage of gravity. You can use a slanted workstation or an easel. You may also hold the paper up after you’ve applied the paint. Watercolor paper, a rough paper like cardstock, or a watercolor canvas works best here since these options absorb paint evenly.Remember to place more paper or other material beneath the paper to catch paint runoff.

, Color your brush with the paint. Dab the paint onto the spot above where you want drips. The key to dripping is to add more paint to that spot. Continue adding paint until it begins to drip. More paint will lead to a longer drip line.Another way to do this to use an object like an eyedropper to pick up the paint. It can pile up a lot of paint in a single area., Clean off your brush in water. Take the wet brush to the paper and use it to make a drip line. Dab the brush in a little paint, then touch it to the top of the water line. The paint will quickly run downwards and fill the line. Water is useful for guiding the paint and creating precise drip marks., When you are finished, lay the paper flat so the paint can dry without dripping. When the paint is wet, it can drip into other wet paint. Watercolor dries quickly, but you can still combine wet colors to create unique effects."

Spatter paint for small drips.,
Pour paint for large drips.,
Use a knife while pouring for thinner drips.,
Squirt paint to create less controlled drip marks.,
Experiment with different painting tools.",How to Drip Paint3," Dip a brush into watery paint. Hold it over the canvas and flick your wrist. Also try flicking bristles with your fingers or striking the brush handle. You can use a variety of brushes and other objects, including toothbrushes and sticks, to get different effects.Different objects, such as sticks or rods, can give you a less uniform drip than a paintbrush. They may have cracks and crevices the lead to a less controlled spatter.

, Use liquid acrylics or thin out thicker paints. All you need to do is tip over the paint container and let the color flow onto the canvas. You can customize this in many ways, such as by pouring more paint, pouring a new color onto wet paint, and tilting the canvas. Pouring turns paint drips into broad, controlled shapes.Think of how you want to apply your paint. Every detail, including how high you hold the paint container, the angle, the volume, and your wrist movement, will change the effect the paint has on the canvas.
For example, holding the paint container higher will cause more of a paint splash. Tilting the container more causes thicker paint drips. More paint in the container can help you get longer lines. Wrist movement can help you make paint lines thicker or thinner as you pour.

, Hold a palette knife up to the container as you pour your paint. This will thin out the stream, causing the paint to look stringy and drizzled. Try it to get thinner paint lines with the same control as regular pouring., You can load the paint into a squeeze bottle or turkey baster. Squeeze the paint out over the top of an upright canvas. This will lead to very unique drip marks. You won’t have as much control as you would by dabbing areas with a brush, but no painting will turn out the same., Anything you have laying around can be repurposed for painting. Like how fingerpainting can give you more rounded paint lines, other tools will have their own effects. Sponges are useful for making clean, square-shaped marks. Fly swatters and potato mashers can give you patterned marks.Other examples include rolling pins, corn cobs, marbles, cookie cutters, metal rods, knives, rollers, and cards. They all help you apply different amounts of paint in unique patterns. The paint can be put on the canvas directly, splattered, dripped, or more.

Listen to music.,
Get ideas from other people's art.,
Take a break.,
Learn all over again.,
Reflect on your approach to making art.",How to Have Your Own Art Ideas," If you find that you need some help getting inspired, try listening to music as you create art, particularly music that you like, and music that suits the atmosphere of the piece you are trying to create.

For example, try not to listen to something upbeat if you're trying to paint someone crying, or listen to something slow and sad if you want to draw a picture of flowers in a meadow.


This method of overcoming artist's block works well for some, however others might need complete silence in order to work. Work to your own preference, with or without sound.;
, Observe how other artists do their artworks. You can then attempt to replicate the style, but with a twist of your own, to help get you inspired. Watching how other people shape and uniquely craft their art can help to inspire you and may help you to improve in drawing.

For example, try drawing a horse in a pose that somebody else has drawn and change it up a little, such as: make it gallop, add fire, etc.

, If you've been trying too hard to be inspired and keep drawing a blank, it's time to pull back. Even if you take a break for a month or so, you will come back refreshed and ready to create again., Learn to do new things with your art. If you're having artist's block, the problem might just be that you've run out of things to do and you find yourself creating the same thing over and over again. If this is the case, its time to look up some tutorials or do the copy from reference method., Think about artworks you've made that you're particularly proud of and consider the qualities of individual finished pieces that give you the most satisfaction. Reflect on the process by which the idea for the work was originally generated and how this evolved as you proceeded. Take some notes. The purpose of this is not to encourage the creation of duplicate artworks, but to help you identify the aspects of your own art practice that are unique and interesting.

Be specific about strategies and techniques you've adopted that made a difference: e.g. limiting or extending a colour palette, applying novel textures or finishes, refining or exaggerating physical forms, adding or removing depth, following or breaking established rules, using contrast or incongruity, trying to express joy or despair or humour or anger through the artwork, spending more time on the work or stepping away from it earlier, etc...

Choose a canvas or surface onto which you will place your design like a tabletop or onto a wall as a mural, directly.,
Depending on the size of your chosen canvas or surface, you will need to adapt the quantities accordingly.,
Start by priming the surface in black - two to three coats, allowing each to dry before applying the next.

,
Using your tape measure and pencil, divide the canvas into a grid of squares by measuring equal points along the edges.,
This is where your reference material comes in and where you should take the most time.,
Make sure your tape is stuck firmly, and give the whole canvas* another two to three coats of white paint.,
Leaving all tape in place when the white paint is dry, begin filling in blocks of colour as you wish.,
When all paint is dry (overnight to be sure) - the big reveal!",How to Make a Mondrian Pattern," Ensure that it is clean, dry and free from oil (as these marks may show through the finished piece).;
, The tape used to mask will need to depend on the proportion to this surface also, for the most authentic Mondrian ""feel"". You will need the following:


Reference material - or a sketch of your own design
Canvas or flat surface to decorate on.
Pencil
Tape measure
Tape for masking off square areas and lines
Sharp scissors
Acrylic paints in these colours: White, black, cobalt blue, cadmium yellow, red madder (or an orange-red)
Brushes - any will work, you will need one large brush for priming in black, and perhaps one for each colour will save you washing out thoroughly between colour changes.
(Optional) Varnish to seal your work - vital if your design is going on to a work surface or somewhere that gets heavy wear and tear.
Room to step back from the painting at the masking stage and check your lines!

,, Mark these lightly along the sides, and then rule out straight lines across the canvas, corresponding point to corresponding point.

, Apply your tape to the black surface, using your pencil lines as guides, to create the blocks we will later fill with colour. Be sure to cut the tape neatly and as squarely as possible, and as you apply it place the cut end of the tape up to the outside edge of the last piece of tape to 'box in' the colour and ensure clean, crisp lines.

, Until it is a solid, uniform white. Patience is needed here!*If you want black blocks of colour in your designs, obviously do not paint past the taped lines in these areas, leave them black.

, Remember - less is more until you're sure you're happy with the design. Keep looking back to Mondrian's work for guidance, or use your imagination! This bit is up to you!

, Carefully peel away the tape to reveal the black lines and complete the work - et voila! Protect your new design with appropriate sealer or varnish, and once dry, stand back and admire!

Lay down newspaper in your work area to keep it clean.
Use a glass of water and a soft rag to clean your paintbrushes between colors.;
, Size and shape are up to you, but larger or mid-sized canvases are easiest to paint.


If you just want to practice, you can also create paintings on large multi-media art paper.
Your local art supply store should carry paper and canvas.

, To create your Cubist-style painting, you’ll need sketching materials, a canvas, brushes, paint, and plenty of inspiration.


You can use any type of paint to achieve a Cubist style, but acrylic works well, especially for beginners. Acrylic paints are versatile, often less expensive than oil paints, and make it easier to create crisp lines.Pick paintbrushes that are labeled for acrylic paints. Get a few different sizes for versatility while you paint.
Make sure you have a pencil and gum eraser on hand to sketch before you begin to paint.
You may also need a ruler or yardstick to help guide your lines and make them crisp and straight.

, Though Cubism was an abstracted form of modern art, most Cubist painters drew from real life in their work.Though their paintings were highly fragmented and geometric, a subject was still discernible within them.


Decide whether you want to paint a human figure, a landscape, or a still life.
Choose something that you can look and study in real life at while you are painting. For example, if you want to do a figure, see if a friend can pose for you. If you’d like to paint a still life, arrange a group of objects or an object, like a musical instrument, in front of you.

, Don’t worry about capturing the details. Use broad, gestural strokes to capture the movement of whatever it is you are studying.


Once you have a general sketch, use your ruler to sharpen the edges.
In any place you’ve sketched soft, rounded lines, go back over them and change them into sharp lines and edges.
For example, if you’re sketching a person, you might go over the rounded line of the shoulder and make it look more like the top of a rectangle.

, You want the geometry of your painting to be more than just a basic outline of your subject. Think about different ways you can further break down the shapes in your painting.


Look at the light. Instead of shading and blending, in Cubism, you will use the light to create shapes. Outline, in geometric shapes, where the light falls in your painting.
Also, use geometric lines to show where you would generally shade in a painting.
Don’t be afraid to overlap your lines.

, Within Cubism, artists focused on the form in a painting, rather than color.They often used neutral browns and blacks. In Braque’s painting “Candlestick and Playing Cards on a Table,” you can see his use of neutrals to emphasize form.If you want to use bright colors, choose to use between one and three main bright colors so that your painting retains its striking geometry.
You can also use a monochromatic palette in a single color family. For example, Picasso did many paintings mainly in shades of blue.
Put your paints onto your palette or a paper plate in front of you. Use white to make shades lighter. Mix the colors that you want.

, Use darker colors to thinly outline the individual geometric shapes that you created while sketching.Unlike in a traditional painting, you don’t need to blend all your colors into each other. You want your lines to be distinct.


With acrylic paints, you can layer colors to make your paintings feel more dimensional.
If you need to do so, use your ruler to guide your paintbrush, like you did your pencil. You want your paint lines to be just as crisp as your pencil lines.

,


Washable acrylic paints work well for painting with kids. You can also create a “painting” masterpiece with markers, crayons, or colored pencils.
Choose a large sheet of art paper or a notebook of paper to make your Cubist style painting.
You’ll also need paint brushes, and a pencil and eraser.

, This could be something simple like a vase of flowers or even a single flower.You’ll first draw this subject, and then use lines to break it up.


Choose something you have on hand. You want to practice drawing from life instead of just drawing from your imagination.
Practice making small sketches of your subject in a sketchbook. You want to decade exactly how you will draw it for your final painting.

, You should draw lightly with your pencil so that if you make a mistake, you can erase it and start again.


As you are sketching, remember that your drawing doesn’t have to be completely realistic.
It’s okay to overlap lines and exaggerate features. You’re just going to make it even more abstract.

, Use a pencil and a ruler to draw straight lines in all directions. Use your creativity to decide where to place them.


You don’t want large areas of blank space in your drawing.
You also don’t want to create too many areas with a bunch of tiny geometric shapes.

, Experiment with using your brush in different directions to create texture.


Use black or brown paint to create thin outlines around the shapes you made.
Try to stick to using only a few different colors.

, Add any final touches, and remember to sign your name on the bottom of your Cubist style painting.


These paintings make great decorations for children’s bedrooms.
They are also good gifts for Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, or Grandparents’ Day.

, Glass colors are available to paint on glass. They come as water-based and solvent-based. You can use either one (try experimenting). Acrylic and oil colors can also be used but the oil paint takes a longer time to dry (glass colors are really fun to work with and gives a translucent appearance, so don't miss it). Usually Glass Liners are used to draw the outlines. Be sure to use glass liners if you are going to paint with glass colors.

, If you're confident enough, you can go ahead and draw freehand. If you've got a printed design, place the design under the glass (so that the design is visible through the glass), secure it with a tape or clip and trace it.

White;
, Use a mixing palette or whatever surface you have available. A good alternative to a mixing palette is a sturdy piece of cardboard. Create a blob of each color onto your palette.

, Using your brush, mix an equal portion of red, yellow, and blue. Clean your brush in a cup of water after gathering each color. Mix together the three primary colors to create the base.


The result should look dark, but that is what you are aiming for. It is easier to lighten the tone., Have the prospective skin tone that you are trying to emulate nearby. Compare the base you've created with the tone you are shooting for. If you're using a photograph, be aware of the lighting from the photo.

, If you need to make adjustments to lighten your base, use a combination of yellow and white. White will simply lighten your base, and yellow will create a warmer tone. Add small portions of paint to the mixture. Fully mix the colors together before adding more., Use the same process of lightening the base, this time using red. If you've already achieved the desired color, skip this. Be aware of the red qualities in the skin tone you're looking at. Red will sometimes occur more sporadically in skin tones.


Don't add too much, unless you're aiming to create a sun burn.

, Pay attention to the color you are trying to reach. Adjust in small increments. You might have to start over if you get the color too far off. If it gets too light, add red and blue bit by bit.


Create multiple skin tones and use the most similar for your painting.

Secure the mats.",How to Cut a Picture Mat," Take a look at the picture and get an idea of what size mat and/or frame you'll need. The completed project will consist of your picture sandwiched between two uniformly sized mats, with the center of the frontal mat cut to display the picture. You'll need at least two pieces of mat board: one to serve as the backing for the picture and the other to cut a ""window frame"" that wraps around the front side of the picture. Larger pictures, like artwork headed for exhibition, will obviously require larger mats, but the exact specifications of the mat will also depend on how much of it you want to be visible around the picture.;
, Mats come in many different colors, designs and thicknesses. Pick a mat (or a number of mats if you choose to utilize multiple layers) you like that is a good look for the picture you'll be framing, then decide whether the mat will go around the edges of the picture in the frame or serve as a frame itself. If you think the picture you're framing might benefit from the added depth of multiple layered window frame mats, select the mats in color and texture combinations that complement each other.Mat board comes in many different thicknesses. The thicker the mat you choose for cutting, the wider and deeper the ""white line"" created by the mat's inner material will be around the edges of the finished piece. Consequently, thicker mat types might look better in plain white to hide the cut inner edges.
Mat board is also available in two general quality ranges. Standard mat board is fine for photographs and prints that aren't meant to be professionally displayed, while archival mat board is exhibition quality and therefore costs more. Archival mat board should be used with original artwork, especially when they're done on archival materials with artist-grade art supplies.

, To cut the mat, you'll need a sharp blade capable of cutting perfectly straight lines. The most readily available and least expensive option is a standard razor blade or box cutter with a fixed handle. You can also purchase a specialty sliding mat cutter tool, but these tend to be more costly and require more of a learning curve to use without making mistakes.


Razor blades, X-Acto knives and box cutters all make use of extremely sharp exposed blades. Be very cautious when handling these tools.
Mat cutting kits can be purchased at most art stores and make it easier to measure, align and cut mats in a single station, but will run you considerably more money., The ruled edge will be used to measure the mat to fit the picture and frame and to assist in cutting straight edges. The T-square has the added benefit of enabling you to measure precise angles. You'll also need the ruler or T-square to keep the width of all sides of the mat consistent.


Heavy metal rulers will work better, as they provide some weight to hold the mat steady beneath them and you won't have to worry about damaging them with your cutting tool.

, Use the ruler to measure the height and width of the picture you'll be cutting the mat to fit. Both of the mats you cut should match the dimension of the picture exactly; the inner area of the second (window frame) mat will need to be cut at least a half inch smaller than the picture itself to hold it in place. Write down the picture's dimensions and set it aside for now.During this step you can decide how wide you want to cut your window mat to go on top of the picture. If only a portion of the picture needs to be visible, a wider mat will fill in the non-focal area around the edges and let you center the picture exactly where you want it.

, If you have a frame picked out that you want to use, remove the glass or plastic from the front and extract the backing board. The backing board is what you will be using for reference as the mats will be measured and cut to fit the inner part of the frame where the picture sits. Copy down the dimensions of the frame, making sure to differentiate what the various measurements are for.Most frames you buy will already have their specifications listed. Disregard this measurement and take your own. Since it's imperative that the mat you cut be able to fit the frame, it's better not to take chances with sizing.

, With the dimensions of the picture or artwork in mind, decide what size will work best for cutting the window mat. The window mat will be placed around the edges of the front side of the picture and will usually overlap the picture slightly, so settle on a window mat size that doesn't obscure too much of the picture. On the back of the second mat board, trace the measurements of the picture where you plan to cut the window frame.For most small-to-medium sized pictures, a window mat with a width of around .5""—1.5"" will provide a nice frame for the picture without covering too much of it.

, Refer back to the dimensions of the frame backing board you measured earlier. Using these measurements, place the ruler or T-square along the first edge of the mat and mark with a pencil on the back side of the mat where the cutting edge is to be. Start at the top edge of the mat and make a small notch every few inches. This will give you a dotted line to follow as you cut, and can help you realign the cutting trajectory if the ruler is to slip at any point.


Always mark and cut from the back side of the mat. That way, none of your marks or cutting imperfections will be visible on the finished mat surface.

, Take the razor, box cutter or mat cutter tool and line it up with the edge of the ruler. Make sure the cutting edge is flush with the ruler; if you're using a mat cutter tool, it will be a sliding attachment with its own ruled edge to ensure that the cutter doesn't slip. When cutting manually, be sure to press firmly against the ruler or T-square to keep it from moving as you cut. Cut the mat with a slow, steady motion, applying equal pressure throughout the whole movement. Repeat the cutting process on the remaining three sides of the mat, checking again that the length and width are accurate and that you're cutting the right amount.Bear down hard when cutting the mat. It's best to go all the way through on the first pass to keep the cut clean and straight, but if that's not possible then make several lighter passes, watching for crooked cuts.
To continue a cut that is only partially complete, push down vertically with your blade until you go all the way through, adjust the angle of the blade, and resume cutting.

Remember: safety first. Severe injury can result from improper use of cutting tools. Cut slowly and keep all appendages out of the path of the blade.

, Cut the second mat board to the exact specifications of the first. You'll be using this mat as the window frame for the front of the picture. If you've selected a mat of a fanciful color or design, it should be the one you use for the window mat, as it will be front and center in the frame and complement the aesthetic of the picture. Once again, let the ruler edge guide you as you carefully cut out the four sides of the window frame.


The outer dimensions of the window frame should be the same of the backing mat, as they will be fitted together. The inner dimensions are a matter of preference, but generally a .5""—1.5"" window frame looks best.

, If you want to create a more complex layered look, cut multiple window frame mats, each approximately .5"" to 1"" smaller than the previous one. Arrange the mats concentrically around the picture. When using layered mats, you can alternate various colors or designs, making the space around the picture deeper and more ornate.When layering mats, be sure that you're measuring and cutting each mat separately, and unless it's part of the design, keep the size variations between the mats consistent.

, Place the picture against the backing mat and then center the window frame mat over it. Once you've lined up both mats and made sure the picture is centered, take small strips of artist's tape and lightly stick the mat halves together. Flip the matted picture over and tape across the back edges. You can then remove the strips of tape from the front and the mats will be secured around the picture. That's it! Insert the newly-matted picture into the frame or let the mats act as a rough frame themselves if you prefer.Stick the tape to a piece of fabric before applying it to the mat. If the tape is too tacky, you might tear the mat or picture when removing it.
It's recommended that you find an actual covered frame for original artwork once it's been matted. Otherwise, you risk damaging or smudging the art if it's left exposed.

, For dark fabrics, you can use a white chalk pencil to trace your design.









Opt for tracing a stencil if you want to follow a precise, pre-made pattern or picture. Tape your stencil down with masking tape to prevent it from moving.
You can also free-form draw on your fabric before you paint if you are confident enough in your artistic ability.

, Be sure to cover the outline with paint so that it doesn't show through.








, Dip a relatively thin brush in the mixture and paint brush strokes in a horizontal motion.









Spray water lightly on the fabric surface using a mister bottle after painting to allow the brush strokes to bleed lightly while switching between colors.
If the paint begins to bleed too much or too quickly, grab a hair dryer and dry the spot to stop the process.

, Fabric spray paint dries more quickly than other types of fabric paint and allows you to easily fill in intricate stencils.








, You can add variation and create depth simply by combing paint in small sections. Be careful not to blend undesirable colors together.

Make your fabric sparkle with glitter.,
Add three-dimensional embellishments like rhinestones and buttons.,
Cut a design out of a sponge using scissors and dip the soft side lightly into fabric paint.",How to Do Fabric Painting4," Simply sprinkle the glitter of your choice on top of the paint while it is still wet. Allow the paint to dry fully.








, Adhere to the fabric using a small dollop of fabric paint that matches the color of the embellishment. If the fabric paint does not seem strong enough, try fabric glue.








, Be sure to press down firm and straight.

Add blue.,
Compare colors.,
Add red as needed.,
Create a darker olive tone.,
Experiment until you're satisfied.,
Paint your picture.",How to Create Realistic Flesh Tones2," You'll need to experiment more with combinations because mid-tone skin contains more color variations. Have the following colors handy:Red
Yellow
Blue
White
Burnt Umber
Raw Sienna

, Use a mixing palette or whatever surface you have available. A good alternative to a mixing palette is a sturdy piece of cardboard. Create a blob of each color onto your palette.

, Create an orange color by mixing equal portions of red and yellow. Clean your brush after gathering each color in a cup of water., Slowly mix in blue paint, in small increments. Depending on how dark you are aiming for, consider using a very small amount of black paint.

, Have the prospective skin tone that you are trying to emulate nearby. Compare the base you've created with the tone you are shooting for. If you're using a photograph, be aware of the lighting from the photo.

, Add small amounts of red if needed at all. It's always easier to add in small amounts than to start from scratch.

, Mix equal parts of burnt umber to raw sienna. This combination will create a darker concentrate. Slowly add this mixture to your base as you see fit. Use this combinations as an alternative to blue. For a greater olive effect add the smallest amount of yellow mixed with green.

, Keep creating different colors until you have about five different skin tones that you like. It might be easier for you to have a few colors to choose from then limiting yourself to one.

, Use the color or colors you've created as a skin tone for your painting.

Yellow
Red
Purple

, Use a mixing palette or whatever surface you have available. A good alternative to a mixing palette is a sturdy piece of cardboard. Create a blob of each color onto your palette.

, Mix equal parts of burnt umber and raw sienna. Separately mix equal parts of red and yellow together. Then slowly add your red and yellow mixture to the other mixture.

, Have the prospective skin tone that you are trying to emulate nearby. Compare the base you've created with the tone you are shooting for. If you're using a photograph, be aware of the lighting from the photo.

, For darker skin, add small increments of purple. It's best to use dark purple. To create dark purple, add small amounts of either dark grey or black to the purple. Mix until you're satisfied.


Black paint can ruin your base quickly. Use black paint in very small increments. Experiment to find your best mixture.

, For a dark skin tone that feels warmer, mix burnt umber instead of purple. Use small amounts of the mixture to gauge what color you're working with.

, You can lighten the color by adding orange. Orange will hold the realistic tone while lightening the color as well. You can mix yellow and red together to create orange. White paint will throw the colors off too much., After creating the desired skin tone, paint your picture. Keep gray around to adjust shadows and lighting. It'll also be convenient to keep multiple swaths of skin tones available for your painting.

Gather your supplies.,
Draw the bottom half of a large planet in the top left corner.Put your pencil on the left edge of the paper, then draw a semi-circle that ends at the top left edge of the paper.,
Draw a rocket and a few tiny planets on the page.,
Trace the lines of the drawing with a Sharpie.After all of the objects have been created, use a black Sharpie to trace over all of the lines of the drawing.,
Add stars with a white crayon.Fill the background up with plenty of stars by drawing lots of tiny X’s all over the paper with a white crayon.,
Paint the rocket and planets first.,
Fill the background in with black paint.Once the paint for the planets and rocket has dried, fill the background in using plenty of black watercolor paint.",How to Create Space Art1," You will need at least one sheet of watercolor paper, a set of watercolor paints with basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and black), a paintbrush, a black Sharpie and a white crayon. This is an easy and fun drawing of outer space that a young child will enjoy.;
, It will look like a very large planet that is only partly visible in the top left corner of paper.


This is much easier for kids to draw than a perfect circle.
Make sure the entire planet isn’t visible! Only the bottom part of the planet should be visible in the top corner.

, These don’t have to be perfect, so use your imagination! Put the rocket approximately in the center of the page. To create it, draw a skinny rectangle and then add a triangle on top. Then draw flames coming from the bottom of it. Next, create 3 planets of various sizes by drawing a medium circle and 2 smaller circles. They don't have to be perfect circles!


Spread the objects out over the page so that it looks full.
Add craters and rings to the planets to make them a little more interesting.

, Be sure to use a permanent marker, since regular water-based markers will bleed when the watercolor painting begins.

, You must press down very hard with the crayon if you want the stars to be visible after the background is painted black with watercolor paint.

, Choose whatever colors you want for the objects, just make sure you reserve the black paint for the background only. You could paint the large planet orange, the rocket blue, and the tiny planets red, green and purple. Any other variation works great too! Allow the paint to dry before filling in the background with black paint.If you don’t wait for the paint to dry first, the black paint will bleed into the colored objects and vice versa.
It should only take about 10 minutes to dry enough to proceed.

, The white stars drawn all over the background with crayon will show through the watercolor paint. Once complete, give the painting about 10 minutes to dry fully.

Find a canvas.,
Choose your paints.,
Gather brushes and other tools.,
Change into painting clothes.",How to Create an Abstract Painting1," You can buy a ready made canvas of any size in a craft store. It will be prepared for immediate use; however, there are no rules saying you have to use a primed and stretched canvas. In fact, abstract artists often use unstretched, unprimed canvases.If you prefer a colored background, buy a jar of Gesso to prime the canvas and give it a touch of color. The primer should dry quickly.;
, Decide whether to use acrylics or oil paint. Acrylics have no odor and are easy to work with since they dry fast and can be painted over if you make a mistake. Oils, on the other hand, aren't usually used because they take longer to dry, have an odor, and do not allow you to paint over mistakes.

, Pick whatever brushes you like to use with the paint you've already chosen. You might also consider using a palette knife to apply paint, giving it a textured look. While some artists like to use an easel, many abstract artists choose to place their canvases directly on the floor in order to be closer to the work.If you're unsure about what colors work well together, think about picking up a color chart/wheel. This will actually show you which colors compliment each other.

, Depending on how messy you're planning on getting, it's wise to change into an old shirt or painting smock. Wearing something you're not worried about will allow you to focus more on the painting or process of abstract art.


You may want to lay down newspapers to prevent drips or spills, especially if you plan on flicking paint or laying the canvas on the ground.

The truth is, everyone is an artist--they just need to harness their creative sides. If there is a specific type of art you would like to learn more about, go for it, but don’t be afraid to branch out and try other mediums as well. Some of the most basic forms of art include:



Drawing: This medium can range from the most basic of sketches to intricate architectural designs. Drawings are generally created with a pencil, pen, charcoal, or crayon. Drawings can be of objects placed right in front of you, or images out of your imagination.

Painting: This medium uses paint brushes to create both real life and imagined images with paint. Painting often delves into the abstract--a painting made in red and purple hues might be a representation of a feeling--such as love--that the painter was feeling while he or she worked.

Photography: Photography uses a film or digital camera to capture a moment in time. Photographs often tell us about what the world was like at the exact moment that the photo was taken. Photos can reflect great beauty or great horror--just as the world can too.

Sculpting: Sculpting is the process of taking a material (clay, wood, metal, etc.) and shaping the material into a work of art or a functional tool (and sometimes both at the same time.);
, Once you have tried out all of the mediums, decide which ones you are stronger at. Often someone who is fantastic at creating sculptures out of clay cannot paint to save their life. Of course, there are other people who seem like they were created solely to be fantastic artists and excel at every medium.


Another important thing to keep in mind is which medium you enjoy working with most. If you are fantastic drawer but feel yourself pulled toward sculpting, why not give this new medium a try.

, Pick up some books on the medium(s) you have chosen to focus on (for now). Learn as much as you can about the medium—read books and articles, watch instructional videos, and research various methods and approaches other artists in your medium take. One of the best ways to learn is by studying the work of others who have come before you. It is completely possible to teach yourself how to be a great artist, you just have to put effort into learning the basics. If you feel like you need a little help, you can always supplement your research with an art class (see Part Two of this article.)


Part of researching your medium means learning the basics about that medium. Learn about the color wheel (primary colors vs. secondary colors, how shading works, etc.)
A key part of your research should consist of what supplies you will need to actually create art. If you can’t seem to find a specific list, you can also use an internet search engine and type in something like ‘basic art supplies needed for drawing.’

, Sadly, art supplies can be pretty costly--but very worth it. You can buy the supplies you need at large art and craft stores like Michaels, or you can find a local, smaller art store in your area. To find a smaller art store near you, pull up your favorite internet search engine and type in “art supply stores in .”


If you are not sure of what you need, or how necessary a particular item it, be sure to ask an attendant. Chances are they will turn out to be deep wells of artistic knowledge (they may even be able to point you in the direction of some art classes.)

, A key part of being an artist is observing the world around you and reflecting it in your art work. Notice how the light changes during the day, how colors affect you, how an interaction makes you feel. As the saying goes, it is actually really important to stop and smell the roses. Take the time to become fully aware of your surroundings and let your observations seep into your work.


For instance, if you see a couple sitting under a tree, notice how their bodies interact with the nature around them. What is the light like? What colors are predominant? How would you frame the scene--would you focus on their faces, on the colors, on the tree? Paying attention to how you see the world will help you to translate your observations into art.

, Many artists dedicate their lives to creating art. While you do not have to spend every single second of your day working on a painting, do try to dedicate some time each day (or every other day) to working on your project, whatever it might be. Make creating art a priority.

, Don’t be afraid to show your work to people. Value someone’s honest opinion, even if it is compiled of constructive criticism. Ask a few people whose opinion you value to look at your art. Don’t be discouraged if they aren’t gasping in awe--for most people it takes time to really develop a talent for creating art.


Ask them what they think you could get better at. Maybe you have a hard time drawing hands, or you can’t seem to get the handle of a clay mug quite right. A second pair of eyes will help you to see what needs work.

, The best way to define yourself as a unique artist is to create your own style within the medium that you have learned. No one can teach you your own style--you need to discover it for yourself. Try experimenting with different techniques. Break yourself out of your comfort zone.


For example, if you like to paint still-life paintings, try painting a still life by adding your own touch to it rather that simply replicating what is in front of you. Change the colors, make the subjects look cartoon-y or distorted in some way--play around with it.

, Perhaps the easiest way to learn the basics of any medium is to enroll in an art class. Art studios, schools, co-ops, and other groups will often hold art classes that can last anywhere for one night to many months. You will be taught by other artists who can show you how to master the basics of your medium, while also helping you to follow your own artistic path.


To find art classes in your town, you can look at local newspaper event listings, talk to friends you might have in the artist community, or simply run a search for ‘art classes in ’ on your favorite internet search engine.

, Visit museums and peruse books on all sorts of art and design. Learn from the masters by looking carefully at their works. A great way to hone your skill is to try to imitate the art of someone considered to be a master the world over. Try motifs and techniques that catch your interest.


A great way to improve in your artistic medium is to select a work by a master and try to replicate it as best you can. For instance, if you want to improve your painting skills, pick a painting by Vincent Van Gogh, such as “Starry Night” and try to paint it. When you have painted it as close to the original as possible, paint it again, this time allowing yourself to go a little outside the original. Add details that you think you would have added, had you been standing next to Van Gogh looking up at that starry sky. Perhaps the colors would be different, the tree more (or less) defined, etc.

, If you want to take your art career to the next level, you could consider going to art school. Some things to consider when picking an art school include reputation, costs, strength of the courses and professors, location, and facilities (do they have a dark room? a kiln? etc.) Consider if you think this school will bolster your strengths and improve your weaknesses. You will have to apply for any art school you want to attend. Find out how to do that here.You should also consider going to an art school vs. attending university. Some universities have excellent art programs. The main difference is that art schools will tailor their general education classes around art (for instance, a history GE course that might normally be ‘History of the United States’ would instead be ‘Artists in the American Revolution.’

, Making friends that have the same passion for art that you have is a great way to really immerse yourself in the world of art. Having artist friends can be beneficial because they can offer you criticism on your work (and actually know what they’re talking about,) teach you new techniques, and inspire you with their own work.


To find like-minded artists, see if your town, school, or church has any artist clubs that you could join. You could look in newspaper event listings, or search for local groups on the internet. You could even consider joining a virtual art group--there are many online forums that you can become a part of and chat with people who love art as much as you do.

, Another great way to see what other artists are creating in your medium is to go to art gallery openings in your area. Art galleries are great places to meet people and see other artists’ work. You may find that you are inspired to try a new technique.

, A portfolio is a collection of your best work that you show to potential employers, clients, galleries, etc. It is essentially a reflection of what you are most proud of about your art. Only select the pieces you feel are your best work and reflect your style best.


If you are a sculptor, take photos of your art to put into your portfolio. This is much easier than carrying a bunch of sculptures around with you wherever you go.

, As an artist just joining the art world, you will want to make as many connections as possible. Your network can consist of your family, friends, classmates, professors, bosses, mentors, etc. Ask these people in your network if they know of any artistic opportunities that you may be able to get involved with (ie. gallery openings, free classes, places that like to show local art work, etc.)Look for art networking events in your area. Run an internet search of art events and networking opportunities in your area.
Go out of your way to meet people who you think may be able to help you become a better artist or boost your career. If a professor says her world-famous painter friend is coming to town, and you are an aspiring painter, ask your professor if you could perhaps briefly meet with her friend. Don’t be let down if she says no--there are truly thousands of opportunities for you to build your network.

, Showing your work is one of the best ways to get recognition for the pieces you have created. Find out if any local coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc. ever hang the work of local artists on their walls. If they do, bring in a portfolio and show them some of your work. Find out if they would like to hang up your pieces for a set amount of time.


You could also talk to local galleries and see if you could get some of your pieces into their next show. Galleries often like to promote local art.

, In this case, internships are more like apprenticeships. Being a studio helper for a great artist in your medium can be one of the best ways to learn more about your medium (while also lodging you in the inner circle of the artist community.)


If you have gone to art school, find out if any of your professors need a studio assistant or any help with projects that he or she is working on. Professors can be a great link to the more prominent art world, and working with them in their studio will help you to practice what they have taught you in their classes.

Create a new document and make the background color black.,
Add stars with a small soft brush tool.,
Create a new layer and add colorful space clouds.,
Use the Noise filter to create space dust.,
Create a planet by opening planet texture.,
Add color to your planet.",How to Create Space Art2," Launch Photoshop and set up your document. The size is your choice, although the bigger it is, the more room you have to work with. 3000 x 2000 is a comfortable size.


Set the background color to black.
This will give you the backdrop you need to begin building your space scene., Select this tool and begin adding white stars to the background. The stars should vary in size, so change up your brush size as you’re creating. Make stars that range in size from 1 pixel to 4 pixels. The amount of stars is up to you.


Scatter the stars in a few choice places if you’re planning to add a lot of additional elements to the scene.After you’ve got your white stars in place, feel free to add a few that are blue, red and yellow. They should be mostly white, though.

, Be sure your foreground is set to black and your background is set to white. Go to Filter > Render > Clouds. This is your new cloud layer. Go to the layer styles dialogue box and select Gradient Overlay. Choose a colorful gradient that appeals to you and include colors like blue, pink, yellow and green.


After you’ve completed this, set the blending mode to Overlay.This will darken the image, so that the colors look are slightly muted.
Your image should now have textured, colored clouds with a gradient.

, Start a new layer and make it entirely black. Select Filter > Noise > Add Noise. Once you’re in the Add Noise Dialogue Box, choose a noise level that’s between 12% and 17%. Set the distribution to Gaussian. Select Monochromatic. Then set the Blending Mode to Color Dodge.You can adjust the appearance f the space dust by pulling up the Level Adjustment Dialogue Box.
From there you can play with the settings, increasing or decreasing the amount of ""dust"" until it looks the way you want it to.

, Make a new layer and use the Clone Tool to get rid of the four black lines on the image. Press Control-Shift-Alt-E. This will merge the background and the clone layers into a new layer. Use the Elliptical Marquee Tool to grab a circle on the merged planet layer. Go to Filter > Distort > Spherize.


Drag the planet that you just created into your main document.
Use Ctrl-T to scale it down to your preferred size., Make a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. Bring the Saturation value down to -87 and then use a Curves adjustment layer to decrease the lightness. Then create a Color Balance adjustment layer and choose your planet color by changing the Midtones settings.Add additional colors or shadows by creating new layers and brushing them on.

Brainstorm and sketch out your idea.,
Begin by painting the background black.,
Create nebulae with green paint.,
Paint a large orange circle on one side of the canvas/paper.,
Paint a small white circle on the opposite side of the canvas/paper.,
Darken the side of the planet that is away from the sun.",How to Create Space Art3," Think about what type of scene you want to make. Will it have planets, stars, nebulae, asteroids, or galaxies? Look through pictures in science books for ideas. Do a quick, preliminary sketch of the space scene you’re envisioning. The sketch doesn’t have to be perfect! Its purpose is to help you decide where you want everything to go before you start painting.


Be sure to include a light source, whether it's a sun or a self-lit object, like a galaxy.Draw arrows showing which way the light is traveling. Remember that light travels in straight lines out from the source.
If you are having trouble visualizing your scene, use a light bulb and a ball to help you see the shadows and light.

, Fill in your background with black paint, then add tiny white stars all over the black background. Be sure to make your stars different sizes. There should be small ones and large ones. Use white initially and then tint a few of them blue, red, and yellow.


Create space dust by loading your paintbrush with white paint and flicking it onto your painting.
If you are using water-based paints like tempera or watercolors, white areas are a bit more difficult. Plan out what will need to be white ahead of time, and don't paint anything over those parts.

, Space art always includes funky colored nebulae, so pick a vibrant color like green to work with. Paint wisps of green around the stars, working in a diagonal direction across your canvas/paper. Then paint wispy black strokes through and around the green wisps, which will add depth. It's perfectly fine to cover some of the stars with this.Covering up some of the stars will make them appear to recede, creating the illusion that the nebulae is in the foreground. This adds additional depth to the image.
Choose a few other shades of green, such as lime green and greenish yellow, and add a few strokes of these colors here and there in your nebulae.

, This will be a giant gas planet. Just make it a simple color, like orange, for now. Paint some wisps in shades of gray, red, and brown around the planet. You’ll go back to the planet to add details a little later, but leave it like this for now.

, This will be the sun lighting the planet. Place it diagonally across from the planet – about 1/3 distance from the side and up a little from the center. Don't worry about drawing rays coming out of the sun. A simple white ball will do.


By making the white circle smaller than your planet, you are creating the illusion that the planet is in the foreground.
This means the planet is ""closer"" than the sun in the image.

, You want your light source – the sun – to appear accurately in the image. By darkening one side of the planet, you are creating the shadow that the sun’s light would cause. Make the outer edge really black and go lighter and lighter until you have a good shadow on the dark side of the planet.Add a small white crescent on the lit side of the planet.
Make the thickest part of the crescent in line with the sun, so that it looks like the sun is lighting the planet.

Get a color wheel.,
Understand primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.,
Learn about warm and cool colors.,
Work with color harmonies.",How to Create an Abstract Painting2," Quite simply, a color wheel is a circular tool that features a variety of colors. It's useful for showing the relationship between colors - what looks good together, what clashes, and so on.Find a color wheel at a local artist supply store, craft store, or paint department.

, At their most basic, a color wheel is divided into three parts: the primary colors (red, blue, yellow). Secondary colors are created by mixing these primary colors together (green, orange, purple). Tertiary colors can me made by mixing the primary and secondary colors (yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green & yellow-green).To become familiar with color creation, try making your own color wheel.

, Warm colors, such as reds, yellows, oranges, tend to create a sense of movement and advance in space. Cool colors, like blues, greens, purples, recede or show little movement. They are calming colors.White, black, and gray are seen as neutral colors.

, Several formulas exist for choosing colors that work well together. Try:

Analogous colors: Choose two or three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. One of the colors will probably stand out, but all three will look great together.






Complementary colors: Choose two colors that are directly opposite of each other on the color wheel. These colors can really pop out.






Triadic colors: Choose three colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel. If you drew a line to connect the colors you chose, you would have a triangle. These colors will really stand out.

Create a textured background.,
Tape lines at intersecting points across the canvas.,
Mix your paint colors.,
Paint in the spaces between the tape.,
Remove the tape.,
Fill in the blank space from the tape, optional.",How to Create an Abstract Painting3," One of the easiest ways to do this is to apply artist-quality Gesso, a thick gel-like primer.Apply it like paint, or spread it around with a palette knife, if it's thick enough. This will allow you to control the style of the texture.


You could also leave the canvas smooth and blank. Again, there are no rules for abstract art saying you must have a textured background. Many artists simply start painting on a blank canvas.

, Use blue painter's tape and place several lines, creating geometric shapes, such as triangles, squares, and rectangles. The goal is to create images that aren't representative of reality. The taped lines will help you paint Painter's tape will ensure that your painting has crisp, clear lines and shapes.


Use rulers and pencil lines instead of tape. If you don't want to deal with the gaps that the painter's tape will cause when you remove it, try marking your canvas using a ruler and pencil. Again, lay your ruler down across several points to create geometric shapes.

, Decide which colors you'll be using to complete your painting. Mix them on an artist's palette or plate. You could also mix the colors directly on the canvas, but this will take away some control over the finished look.

, Don't worry if you happen to get paint on the painter's tape. Also, don't feel as though you must fill your entire canvas, or all of the shapes, with color.


Some abstract artists will outline the colors of each shape before they begin painting. Others simply paint and decide which colors to use as they go along.

, As soon as you've decided the painting is complete, remove the painter's tape. If you'd like crisp, clear edges, remove the tape while the paint is still wet. If you remove the tape from a dry painting, it's liable to pull paint away with it, creating slightly rough edges., Once you remove the tape, you'll notice white lines from where the tape was covering the canvas. While you can leave it, you could also paint the lines in.

"

Create a textured background.,
Use a ruler and pencil to create lines.,
Paint the lines.,
Paint only a few squares and rectangles.,
Leave the white space.",How to Create an Abstract Painting4," One of the easiest ways to do this is to apply artist-quality Gesso, a thick gel-like primer.Apply it like paint, or spread it around with a palette knife, if it's thick enough. This will allow you to control the style of the texture.


You could also use heavy paper or poster board. If you do this, you won't need to prepare or prime the surface.

, You should make several horizontal lines with varying spaces in between, as well as vertical lines. Mark as many as you like, but be aware that fewer lines will mean larger squares and rectangles.

, Use black paint to create bold lines. You can make some lines thicker and others thinner. Your painting will now look like a grid with black lines.

, Use primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and fill in several shapes with paint. While you could fill in every shape, this will make your painting look busy and overwhelming. Instead, choose just a few shapes to paint in. They'll stand out more.

, The white space will make your primary colored squares pop."
"
Move your canvas to the floor.,
Clear your mind.,
Mix your paint directly on the canvas.,
Pour paint onto the canvas, optional.,
Splatter or drip paint onto the canvas, optional.,
Try closing your eyes and painting.,
Stop when the painting feels complete.",How to Create an Abstract Painting5," Many abstract artists say that this allows them to be closer to the work. Also, if you're creating a gestural, or action, abstract painting, it will be easier to apply the paint in a variety of ways.


Don't feel as though you can't move the canvas while you're painting. In fact, you may create unique designs by starting on the floor and then moving the canvas upright while the paint is still wet.

, With gestural abstract art, you're not attempting to represent an image. Instead, focus on the process of applying the paint. Try a variety of applications and see what you like.

, Since this is more about the process of painting, you don't need to worry about creating a specific palette to work from before you begin. Instead, work on the colors as you're painting.

, Pouring paint on the canvas is simply one way to create a totally unique and unplanned image. Pour as much or as little paint as you like.


You can also vary the distances from which your pour paint onto your canvas. Pouring from a great height will most likely create splatters, while pouring closer will offer more control and precision.

, Use whatever implement you like and dip in the paint. Then, flick the tool in order to splatter the paint or hold it over the canvas, allowing the paint to drip.


You can use brushes, straws, squirt bottles, or old toothbrushes to splatter or drip the paint.

, If there's one thing that most abstract artists agree on, it's that an abstract painting shouldn't represent reality. One of the best ways to remove yourself from accidentally painting a recognizable form is to paint with your eyes closed.


Allow the brush and paint to move over the canvas without worrying about the image you're creating. This type of painting is more about the experience than the outcome.

, Do not go back to improve or touch it up. Abstract artists don't think about the outcome; they just stop when they feel ready. Do not overwork your painting, but learn to finish it the moment you feel it is finished.

Clean the sheet of glass.,
Use fine grade sandpaper to sand the edges of the glass.,
Clean the glass.,
Acquire the image that you want to paint.,
Attach your image and the glass to cardboard.,
Slide an unmarked sheet of tracing paper between your traced image and the glass.",How to Create a Reverse Painting on Glass1," This glass will be your canvas for the image you want to paint. You should clean off this glass thoroughly and make sure that there aren’t any scratches on it.;
, This process will make the glass safe for you to handle while you’re painting it and afterward. However, be careful not to scratch the glass.

, Use a cotton rag to thoroughly clean and rinse the glass with an abrasive cleanser and warm water. After you clean it, make sure that there are no streaks in it. If there are streaks, wash it again. When you rinse and dry the glass, it should be perfectly clear., Print it so that it is exactly the same size as your piece of glass. Trace the image onto tracing paper.

, The cardboard will provide a sturdy base to work from. It will also prevent tracing paper from tearing.


Use two 4-inch strips of masking tape to attach the traced image to a piece of white cardboard, larger than your glass pane. Place the strips over the top corners of the traced image.Attach the glass to the cardboard with small (2-inch) masking tape rings on the underside of the glass, so that you do not cover your painting surface with tape. As you handle the glass, consider wearing gloves to avoid leaving oily fingerprints on the glass face.Make sure the image is centered under the glass.
Use white cardboard so that the lines from your image are visible and un-muddied by a dark color behind them.

, This will prevent line doubling, when viewed from above."

Try drawing basic shapes.,
Let them experiment freely.,
Use multiple pom poms.,
Have the children spell out short words.,

Collaborate on a picture.",How to Do Pom Pom Painting," Have your young painters grip the frilly fabric balls between their thumb and forefinger. This will allow them to hold onto the pom poms securely while also strengthening their dexterity and precision.Let the kids figure out for themselves whether they would prefer to use their right or left hand.This type of art project will lay the foundation for the basic handwriting skills that will become indispensable later in life.;
, You can also clasp the teeth of a wooden clothespin over the outer edge of the pom pom to turn it into a makeshift paintbrush. The pom pom can now be held more like a pen or pencil, which will be a valuable learning experience for kids who haven’t yet started primary school. Just be careful not to grip the ends of the clothespin too hard, or the pom pom may fall out.Clothespins are also useful when you're trying to keep little fingers clean during an arts and crafts session.
To replace a dirty or dried out pom pom for a clean one, simply stick a new one in the clothespin.

, Set out a palette of paints to choose from. Cover one side of the pom poms with paint. The textured fringe will soak up and hold paint better than the slender bristles of a brush.Matching up the pom poms and paint can help keep kids from getting their colors mixed up.Select your paint colors based on a particular theme. For instance, you can create Valentine’s Day projects using red, pink and white paint, while red and green can be offered around Christmas time., Now all that’s left to do is to get painting! Use a large piece of paper or canvas that will give the kids plenty of room to play around without the color running off onto the table or floor and making a mess. Dab some fresh paint onto the pom poms when it has all rubbed off or dried out.It may be a good idea to line the painting surface with newspaper underneath to prevent troublesome spills, smears and stains.
Cut construction paper or posterboard into special shapes that kids can paint over, like letters or animals, to give them a dual lesson on art and other subjects., Get a feel for the paint by pressing the pom poms directly into the drawing surface. The paint-soaked pom poms will create bright, colorful globs that practically explode off the drawing surface.Place the pom pom flush against the drawing surface to make sure that the color comes off in an even circle.
Dots are good practice for more sophisticated designs later on.

, From dots you can progress to longer lines and strokes. Drag the pom pom across the drawing surface to leave a continuous streak of color. Learning to brush lines and curves will open up an infinite number of possible objects for the kids to paint.After learning straight and curved lines, move on to more advanced techniques like parallel and perpendicular lines, angles and spirals.
Use lines to connect some of the dots they made when they first began painting with the pom poms.

, For especially young children, this can be a great opportunity to teach them to form and recognize geometric figures. Draw and label circles, squares and triangles, then have the kids attempt to recreate them. When they feel comfortable, they can start outlining shapes of their own.Fill in the outlines of shapes using the dots and lines you just practiced.
Encourage your artists to incorporate shapes into their paintings. A triangle, for instance, could be the roof of a house, a circle the sun or a rectangle the trunk of a tree., Once they've gotten the hang of elementary painting techniques, give the kids some time to do their own thing with the pom poms and paint. This type of abstract exercise can be very good for nurturing a child's creative capabilities. You might be surprised at some of the things their young minds can come up with!Give small children a hand with the paint and other supplies, but otherwise let them make their own decisions.

, When you’re buying the pom poms, pick up a few packages of various sizes. That way, kids can choose to make their dots, lines and shapes large and bold or small and precise. The more options they have, the more freedom they’ll enjoy to create unique artwork.


Pom poms are inexpensive and can be found at most arts and crafts supply stores.

, Depending on the age of the child or group you’re working with, you might have them try their hand at strings of letters. Help them by demonstrating how each letter is spelled and have them mimic your handwriting underneath. Begin with easy 2 and 3 letter words, such as “me,” “you,” “dog,” “cat” and “mom” and “dad,” and gradually increase the complexity from there.Guide each child through the process of learning how to spell their name.Try spelling out words in both upper and lower case letters.

, Pom pom painting can also provide an opportunity to teach young learners about primary and secondary colors. Swirling together blue and yellow, for instance, makes green, and purple can be produced by mixing red and blue. See what other interesting colors you can invent using a set of ordinary paints.Quiz the kids the see how many colors they can correctly identify.Mixing new shades can help you add more colors to your palette.

, Rather than simply painting individual collections of shapes, instruct the children to work together to create a larger scene. This can include things like stick figure people, animals, trees, houses and anything else their imaginations can conceive. Once the painting is finished, hang it up for display or have them go through and explain the action piece by piece.Assign one color of paint to each child so they can keep track of their contributions. This will also force them to think critically about how the different colors should best be used.
Come up with different themes for picture projects, like jungle animals or a day at the beach.

Make sure the paint is dry.,
Purchase a soft-bristled brush.,
Brush off the surface of the painting.,
Dust your paintings regularly.",How to Clean an Acrylic Painting1," The most important thing to keep in mind when preparing to clean an acrylic painting is that the paint must be completely dry. If it’s still wet, you may smudge the outermost layer of paint, dulling the colors and wearing down distinctive features, such as the artist’s brushstrokes. Once acrylic paint has cured, you can carefully clean the outer surface without worrying about causing damage.Wait at least 24 hours before attempting to clean newly-completed paintings.
The slightest blemish on an original piece of artwork may be enough to depreciate its value.;
, Look for a brush with a wide base and fine bristles made from natural materials like hair. You can use this tool to whisk away loose dirt and debris clinging to the acrylic paint. In many cases, a good dusting every now and then is all a painting will need to keep it in good condition.A makeup brush or hand duster will work well for this purpose.
The brush should be clean and dry before it comes into contact with the acrylic painting., Go over the exterior of the painting lightly using long, fluid strokes. Work from one of the upper corners of the painting across and down until you’ve dislodged all visible dust and dirt. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as this may leave behind marks on the soft acrylic.Don’t forget to address dust that’s built up on the frame or surrounding surfaces, as well.To remove a heavier layer of dust, hold a vacuum cleaner hose close to the painting as you brush it.

, Acrylic paintings should be dusted thoroughly every couple of months. This is especially important if the painting is being stored or displayed in a private residence or somewhere else that doesn’t provide the benefits of highly-regulated storage conditions. Frequent dusting will reduce the chances of dirt being absorbed into the acrylic paint as it undergoes textural changes.When it comes to preserving works of art, prevention is always more effective than cleaning."

Cover the surface where you will be working with newspaper.,
Dis-assemble the entire firearm and clean all pieces thoroughly, making sure there is no trace of oil on any piece.,
Use denatured alcohol for a final wipe down of the parts.,
Use blue painter's tape to mask off any parts that will not be painted.

,

Set up the air sprayer and set the compressor to 30 psi.

,
Mix the Duracoat paints to get the color you desire.,
Combine 1 part Duracoat Hardener to 12 parts Duracoat paint.,
Hold spray tip 4 to 8 inches (10.2 to 20.3 cm) from the parts and spray Duracoat with sweeping passes from left to right.,
Set parts aside to dry and cure.,
Clean up work area.",How to Apply Duracoat,";
,


One of the best cleaners you can use for this job is MEK or methyl ethyl ketone, an industrial solvent. Pour MEK into a disposable aluminum foil pan and soak the parts. If necessary, use air pressure, brushes or rags to reach every surface of the firearm.

, Even a single drop of oil will cause the Duracoat to peel.

,, This will also facilitate spraying Duracoat and allowing drying time between coats.


A pegboard will work as a holder for hanging the parts. Cover the pegboard with heavy plastic to protect the surface from over spray.

, In case of a painting mistake, dip the part into the pan to remove the paint. You can also use it to clear the air-sprayer tip if necessary or to clean your hands of excess paint.

,, Test spray on a scrap piece of metal to check color.

, Shake thoroughly for at least 3 minutes, and pour into the paint receptacle on the air-sprayer.

, You can go back for another pass or 2 before allowing it to dry. The ideal final thickness of Duracoat should be 1 mil, applied in 1 to 3 passes.


When spraying Duracoat on parts that receive more wear, such as parts that rub against holsters and slings, aim for a coating 1.5 mil for added endurance.

, They will be dry enough for light use in 24 hours, but ideally they should be allowed to dry for 2 weeks.

, Do not dispose of Duracoat and other chemicals in sewer lines. If you will not use up the Duracoat within 18 months, take to a licensed disposal facility.

Decide which parts of the painting you will do that day.,
Get your desired paint colors ready.,
Blend quick dry gilding size with the paint.,
Pour the paint from your palette/mixing station into a small cap or cup.",How to Create a Reverse Painting on Glass2," You will need to paint in sections, allowing different areas time to dry. Drying typically takes 24 hours. For this reason, only mix colors that are needed in a specific area, to avoid having wasted, unused paint on your palette. The first colors to pour are those for line work and small detail. The last colors you will want to do are the background of the image, like the sky.

, You should buy oil paint; 37 ml tubes should be sufficient, unless your glass is very large.If you do not have the exact paint shades that you would like for your painting, begin by mixing paints to get your desired colors.


Squeeze the amount needed (small for a small area, more for a large area) of a light color onto palette paper, wax paper, aluminum foil, or a mixing palette. Add a small dab of the darker primary color to the light color. Mix well with a palette knife or brush. Keep adding small amounts of dark or light until you get the desired shade.

, Once you have the desired color/shade, add gilding size to your paint to help it adhere to the glass. Because glass is non-porous, it does not take paint well. You must use gilding size to help the paint adhere to and dry quicker on the glass.


Pour a small amount of size directly onto your already-mixed paint and begin blending it in. Add size as needed to larger paint piles. The desired ratio is 1/2 paint to 1/2 size. Blend thoroughly with a palette knife or paint brush., Separating the paints will help you avoid accidental color mixing.

"
"
Begin painting.,
Paint all lines first.,
Paint the smallest areas and details first.,
Paint medium areas.,
Paint large areas.",How to Create a Reverse Painting on Glass3," Reverse glass paintings must be painted from front to back (reverse painting order) because of how the image is viewed through the glass.Keep this in mind when setting up paint colors and selecting brushes. You want to start with the small details and end with the big things. It’s the opposite of how you would paint a typical painting.
Use a variety of brand-name, good quality paint brushes to avoid streaking. You can go to an art store and ask the people who work there which brushes are best for your purposes.

, The lines are important because they will help you fill in the rest of the painting. Try using radiography pens for extra fine line work.Use the original image as a reference to make sure that you only paint solid lines where they should be. Sometimes, you may trace lines in an image because they indicate a color break or change, but you must remember they may not be actual solid lines.
Once all of the lines have been painted, wait 24 hours before continuing. This will allow the paint to dry properly and avoid smudging., You want to paint the details before you paint the foreground. You want to paint the background last.


As you paint, make sure that you avoid painting adjacent areas at the same time. If there are areas close to each other that are included in foreground but are different colors, wait for the first area you paint to dry before continuing. Placing different colors of wet paint next to each other may cause unwanted color mixture.Allow the painted areas 24 hours to dry.

, Paint the medium sized areas that are larger than the detailed foreground. This is generally the main image within a painting. The “main image” should not be the small details of a painting or the background of the painting.


Make sure that you wait 24 hours after you complete this section.

, The last area to be painted on a reverse glass painting is the large background, such as a landscape.


If the background is a landscape, paint grassy areas first. Allow drying time before doing sky and water."
"
Fix any mistakes immediately.,
Frame your painting.,
Work at developing more advanced painting techniques.",How to Create a Reverse Painting on Glass4," Because you layer the paint on top of itself, you cannot just paint over a mistake. You should take it off and fix it immediately.


Dip an angled shader brush in lighter fluid, wipe it on a paper towel, and then brush it over the mistake. Doing this will remove unwanted paint from the glass. Carefully blot the area dry with a clean, cotton rag or allow it to air dry before reapplying paint., After the paint has dried, make your masterpiece eye-catching by putting it in an image-complementing frame.Take the painting to a craft store for professional framing, or construct your own frame.

, After you finish this painting, look into perfecting more advanced techniques. Once you have perfected basic “reverse order” painting, try adding depth.


Adding the different elements of image stippling, blending, and shading to your work will make a more completed, three dimensional painting."
"
Be aware of the risks of cleaning the painting yourself.,
Combine soap and water in a large container.,
Dampen a cloth or sponge.,
Wipe down the painting carefully.",How to Clean an Acrylic Painting2," Even though they’re less temperamental than other types of paint, acrylics can still be ruined with inappropriate materials and techniques. Before you employ DIY cleaning methods, understand that tampering with a painting may ultimately lower its value.Consider having valuable works cleaned professionally by a qualified art restorer. Though it will cost more, you’ll be able to rest assured that the painting is receiving proper treatment.
Never use harsh chemicals or abrasive tools to clean a painting. This includes traditional substances such as mineral spirits and turpentine as well as commercial cleaners.

, Fill a sink or bucket with clean, warm water. Add a few drops of a non-astringent liquid dish detergent and stir the mixture by hand until it forms a mild solution. You can use this solution to spot-clean cured acrylic paintings.The detergent will help emulsify dirt and grime to lift them from the surface of the paint while the water flushes them away.

, For best results, use a cloth made from a soft material like cotton or microfiber. Saturate the cloth with the soap solution, then wring out as much excess water as possible. If you’re using a sponge, give it a good shake before you begin. It should just barely be damp.


Make sure there’s no heavy soap residue on the cleaning cloth.
Some types of acrylic paint are water-soluble. If there is too much moisture in the cloth, it may begin to dissolve the paint, creating a blotchy, fuzzy appearance., Go over the painting with long, smooth strokes from top to bottom and from side to side. Clear away as much accumulate grime as you can. Don’t scrub or apply too much pressure, as this is practically guaranteed to strip the paint off. If necessary, make multiple passes, allowing the surface of the painting to dry between each attempt.Fold the cloth a few times to create a wider surface area. This will help distribute the moisture more evenly over the paint and help you avoid pressure smudges.
Test the soap solution on a corner or another out-of-the-way area to see what effect it has before wiping the entire painting."
"
Apply a varnish.,
Store paintings in a dust-free environment.,
Limit the amount of light the paintings receive.,
Keep acrylic paintings cool and dry.,
Do not handle the paint directly.",How to Clean an Acrylic Painting3," Varnish is a type of resin-based clear coat that can protect painted works from dust, dirt, moisture and other factors that can cause deterioration. Brush or spray a thin coating of varnish over the unprotected surface of the painting, then let it dry overnight. Afterwards, the painting will be more resistant to dust, making it easier and safer to keep clean.Make sure you select a varnish that has been specially formulated for use on acrylic paints. If you choose the wrong kind, it may severely degrade the paint.Brush off the surface of the painting before you apply a varnish to keep dust from becoming trapped in the clear coat.

, Because acrylic paints are slightly tacky, they can easily trap dust particles floating around in the environment. For this reason, it’s best to keep prized artwork somewhere with a minimal amount of dust. Make an effort to vacuum and dust high traffic areas on a consistent basis to cut down on the amount of dust in the air that might find its way onto nearby paintings.Paintings are more likely to gather dust when they’re mounted higher up on the wall.If you’re forced to store your paintings in an attic, basement or garage, wrap them in bubble wrap then cover them with brown paper or plastic garbage bags to keep dust from settling on them., Prolonged exposure to UV light causes almost all types of paint to fade over time. To delay natural deterioration, display paintings in the interior of your home, business or gallery away from windows and other openings. Whenever possible, avoid positioning paintings in direct sunlight.When using a separate light source to illuminate a painting, make sure it’s not intense enough to cause fading to occur.Always cover paintings while transporting them to minimize the amount of time they spend in bright natural light.

, Acrylic paints can soften up in elevated temperatures, making them more vulnerable to damage. It’s a good idea to keep the surrounding temperature moderate (between 68-80°F, or 20-27°C) so that the paint doesn't overheat. You should also make it a point to hang your paintings a safe distance away from kitchens, restrooms and other places where there's likely to be more moisture in the air.Run a dehumidifier periodically in the room where you store or display your paintings to keep environmental conditions optimal.
High humidity can also result in the growth of mold and mildew., Aside from a brush or cleaning cloth, try not to let anything come into contact with the surface of a finished acrylic painting. Doing so can lead to smears and smudges, along with more serious destruction like chipping and cracking. This can ruin both the appearance of a painting and its monetary value.Always grip the painting by the edge of the frame when mounting or moving it."
"
Find a suitable workspace.,
Lay out your paper or canvas.,
Prepare your paints.,
Use the two brush method.,
Use the tapping method.,
Use the toothbrush method.,
Use the glue gun method.,
Use the stencil method.,
Let the canvas dry.",How to Do Splatter Art," Splatter art can be quite sloppy due to the inability to control where the splatters of paint will land. You will want to find a workspace in which you can make a mess without worry, such as an art studio or classroom, basement, garage, or outside. If this is not possible, you can lay down newspaper or old towels around your workspace.
, Make sure that there is plenty of space for your canvas and supplies. Use a flat surface for your canvas if you do not want your splatters to drip. If you do want them to drip, wait until you have finished creating the splatters, since it would be too difficult to splatter on a tilted canvas.

You can use canvas, cardstock, or posterboard. These can all be purchased at local arts and crafts stores, such as Michael’s or JoAnn’s Fabrics.

, Acrylic paint is best for splatter painting since it is heavily pigmented and will show up well on any color paper or canvas. However, you can use watercolor or another type of paint that you enjoy using. Squeeze some paint onto a mixing palette, bowl, or cup and dip your brush into the paint as needed., To add plenty of paint splatters at one time, use two brushes at once. Dip both brushes into the paint, using the same color or different colors, depending on what you prefer. Quickly hover the brushes over your canvas after you have dipped them into the paint so that you can get all of the paint onto the canvas, rather than dripping it elsewhere. After most of the paint has splattered your canvas, dip the brushes into the paint and start again., You can use one brush to dip into the paint and a second brush to tap the brush with paint on it, thereby spraying the paint all over the canvas. With this method, you will be able to cover a large area and get large paint drops, if desired. The downside to this method is that you will not be able to control to control where the paint splatters very well., This technique can be very messy for your hands, since you are using your fingers to run along the bristles of the toothbrush. You can wear gloves to minimize the mess on your hands. The benefit to this method is that you can get smaller splatters that are localized to the area you are working on.Hold the toothbrush in one hand.
Dip the toothbrush into the paint.
Hold the brush so that the bristles face downward, facing the canvas.
Using your free hand, slowly run your finger along the bristles of the toothbrush, spraying paint onto the canvas.

, To try something fun and different with splatter painting, use a glue gun and crayons on your canvas, instead of paints. The glue gun will melt the crayons and the warm wax will fall onto the canvas, creating a unique version of splatter painting. This method is quite engaging and will require a bit of focus to make sure that crayons are properly feeding through the chamber of the glue gun.

Peel the crayons. Crayons that come with wrappers on them will need to be peeled first before using them in the glue gun. Soak the crayons in a container of water for about ten minutes, or until the wrappers are soft. Once the wrappers are soft, you can begin peeling!Plug in the glue gun in and wait for it to heat up to the desired temperature. You will want to use a medium to high heat for melting the crayons.
Hold the gun firmly in one hand.
Insert a crayon into the chamber.
As the crayon begins to melt, push it through the chamber while simultaneously guiding the dripping crayon around the canvas to create the desired drip effect.

, The use of a stencil for splatter painting will allow you to paint a certain area of your canvas, perhaps in a certain shape, while preventing the rest of the canvas from being painted. Your imagination is the limit for the stencil design you would like to use. For example, you could cut out a heart or star shape. Make sure that you cover the rest of the canvas that you do not want to be painted with paper if your stencil is not big enough to cover it.

Cut out the desired shape for your stencil. You can use construction paper or another kind of paper, as long as it is easy to fold and cut.
Once the canvas is ready, you can lay the stencil on the canvas and begin splatter painting. Be careful not to get the paint onto the areas of the canvas that you do not want to be painted. If you paint the canvas before you begin splatter painting, let the canvas dry completely before using the stencil so as not to smudge the base paint.

, After you have finished splattering your canvas with melted crayon or have used the stencil method, place it somewhere where it will not be disturbed and allow it to dry. Give it at least 24 hours for the wax to set before framing or hanging on a wall. Try to keep it out of direct sunlight to prevent the crayon from melting or the color from fading.

Assemble your materials.,
Know your tools.,
Prepare your paint.,
Test your paint.,
Practice controlling atomisation.,
Practice cleaning the airbrush.,
Sketch your drawing.,
Start working on your painting.,
Seal the painting.,
Wash out the airbrush.,
Improve your skills.",How to Airbrush," Successful airbrushing requires more than a few items. Check out ""Things You'll Need"" below and make sure you're prepared. Set the hot press board up on the easel or draft table, fill the bucket with water, and lay out your other tools so that they are easily accessible.






;
, Successful airbrushing requires knowledge of how each component of the airbrushing system contributes to your desired effect.

Airbrushes come in two types: single-action and double-action. Double-action will offer greater control whereas a single-action has less moving parts and is easier to clean.













The nozzle is the part of the airbrush where the needle rests. You may wish to use different needles depending on the project.













Your air source is what supplies the air pressure needed for the airbrush to properly spray. Most art projects will require an air source that can deliver 100 P.S.I. at a constant rate. Consult a professional to choose the proper air source for your project.














, Using the airbrush bowls or jars from your set, mix your acrylic paint with a little bit of water, such that it has an inky consistency. (If you're using inks, you generally won't need to dilute them.) Remember, you can always add more water but you can't take it back out - add only a few drops at a time. Developing the right consistency can take practice.

Each project will require different paints. Consider the surface you are painting and adjust accordingly. For example, textile painting will need a paint that is soft and flexible that won’t crack after being worn or washed. Conversely, a harder, less pliable paint would be better suited for airbrushing onto a metal surface.














, Adjust the needle cap on the airbrush so that the needle does not quite touch the cap, leaving just enough room for air to escape. Try spraying your paint on scratch paper to check the consistency, and practice using the lever and button on your airbrush. For the smoothest effect, keep the airbrush about 20 cm (8 inches) away from the surface.








, Atomisation refers to how finely the paint particles are sprayed. Higher pressure will create a finer atomization of paint.

Paint type and viscosity will affect atomization. Experiment with different paints and consistencies to find your desired effect.













For precision spraying, a finer airbrush needle and low-viscosity paint will be needed. Use low air pressure for this task (15-40 P.S.I.).














, Detach the airbrush bowls or jars, and immerse the airbrush in the bucket. Move air through it to wash out paint. This will prevent your colors from mixing in the airbrush. Then, blow water out of the airbrush by directing it at a rag or piece of scratch paper.








, Sketch out a light outline of your work on the hot press board using a pencil. Use the eraser to eliminate any stray lines, and try to lighten the ones you need as much as possible. Take a step back and check to see if your sketch resembles what you have in mind.








, As you paint, go one color at a time and try to build from the bottom layer up. Generally, you'll want to move from light to dark colors. Fill in general areas first.









Mask off areas you don't wish to paint. Apply a frisket (a plastic sheet with adhesive backing) to your painting. Using the craft knife, cut around the area you wish to cover and remove the extra frisket. Peel the frisket off the covered area when you're finished. You can also use tape and cut-out pieces of copy paper to achieve sharp, clean edges.
Finish with a fine needle to create details. As you’ve already learned, you will need to lower air pressure to 15-40 P.S.I. for this task.

, When you're done with the artwork, spray a fixative over the paint to seal it in.









Stand 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) away and spray using continuous horizontal strokes. Be careful not to overspray.
Let dry and then apply second coat if desired using vertical strokes.

, Clean the airbrush almost immediately after you're finished painting, so that the paint won't dry inside and gum up the needle. To make sure you've cleaned everything, disassemble the airbrush (being careful with the fragile needle).








, To learn different airbrushing techniques, search for videos online. Next time you're in a big city, keep an eye out for people making airbrush paintings on a sidewalk easel near popular tourist stops. As you observe other people's methods, you'll be able to incorporate them into your own unique style of airbrushing.

Think about the art you’ll be making before setting up your studio.Jewelry making can be done in a smaller area with just a table.
Painting needs space for an easel and floors that are easily cleaned
Sculpture creating would need a larger area.;
, Having a dedicated place to create your art can help your brain switch gears into creative time. Find a space in your home to dedicate as an art space.A garage or basement make great art studio spaces.
Clear some space in the corner of a room to keep an easel or a craft table.
If you don’t have any space, you can just keep a filing cabinet filled with your art supplies in the kitchen and use the kitchen table to work.

, You need a place to keep your work after it’s finished so it doesn’t get messed up. Create a mini gallery in your home studio to show off your finished work.Use a blank wall to hang paintings on.
Keep shelves to display sculptures, small pictures, and pottery.

, Organization can help help keep your space clean and keep your mind focused on being creative. Use file cabinets, drawers, art caddies, pencil holders, bins, buckets and baskets to organize all of your supplies.Use utensil dividers in drawers to organize small art items like pens, pencils, markers, and erasers.
Consider purchasing a rolling cart or caddy to hold all of your supplies.
File cabinets can make great organizers for different types of art paper.

, It’s a good idea to keep food, drinks, and electronics like cell phones out of your art studio. Food and drinks can easily spill and mess up something you’ve been working on, so make sure you eat and drink outside of your art space. Electronics like cell phones can distract you from creating your art and interrupt your creative process., It’s a good idea to have an art studio in a room with lots of natural light. Natural light creates a bright and airy atmosphere that will help get the creative juices flowing. Rooms with light colored walls also help brighten the room.Add floor lamps to add more ambient light.
Install track lighting or spot lights to accent specific areas.

, Surround your studio with things that inspire you and get you thinking. This can be anything from pictures on the wall to comfy furniture.


Many artists like having their favorite music playing while they create so consider having a radio or music player in your studio.
Hang pictures of things that make you feel happy, relaxed and intrigued on your wall.
Keep a beanbag chair or a floor pillow in a corner for you to relax on and envision your art.
Put up motivational quotes on your wall or desk.
Make a vision board filled with magazine cut outs of inspiring things.

, Check out books from your local library about the basic concepts of art. You can also buy books about art at your local bookstore or from garage sales to build a home library of references.

, Lines are the most basic concept of art, and used in every artistic creation. Lines can show movement, define when a shape ends, lead a viewer’s eyes in a certain direction, and do many more things. The different thickness of lines can also create different looks within an art piece. Understanding the different ways you can use a line in art will help you convey your vision., Shapes are created when lines connect. There are the basic, geometric shapes that we all learn in primary school like circle, square, triangle and rectangle, but there are also other shapes you need to learn about to create great art.Organic, or free form, shapes are shapes that don’t seem to follow any rules. Unlike geometric shapes, organic shapes can’t use math to understand them. Shapes like an inkblot, a tree, or a cloud would be considered organic, free form shapes.
Positive shapes are the shapes of an object that lines have made.
Negative shapes are the shapes of the area around an object.
Static shapes are shapes that appear to be at rest.
Dynamic shapes are shapes that appear to be moving.

, Form refers to an shape that is 3 dimensional. This can be an actual 3D object like a sculpture, or a rendition of a 3D object in a drawing or painting. When creating form in a drawing or painting you need to understand highlights, midtones, and shadows, and how they work together to give a shape its form., Color refers to the spectrum of light being reflected off of an object and into an eye. The color theory is made up of three parts that build upon each other, and understanding them will help you chooses the right colors to create your art.Part one of the color theory is the color wheel. It'll takes the rainbow (Roy G BIV) and puts it in a wheel. The wheel is made up of the primary colors red, blue, and yellow and the secondary colors green, purple, and orange. The primary colors can be mixed to make the secondary colors. For example, red and blue mix to make purple.
Part two of the color theory is color values. Color values refer to the darkness or lightness of a color. These are referred to as tints or shades. You get different tints by adding small amounts of white to a color. You get different shades by adding small amounts of black to a color.
Part three of the color theory is color schemes. Color schemes are the ways different colors are put together to contrast or compliment each other. Using colors from a specific color scheme can make your art pleasing on the eyes.

, Space is the area around, above, below, or within an object, and it is important to create space to give depth to your artwork. There are 6 ways to create space in two dimensional artwork like a drawing or painting.Overlapping objects.
Placement of objects on the paper. Objects placed higher on the paper will appear further away.
Size of the objects. The smaller the object, the further away it will appear.
Detail of the objects. If you want an object to appear further away, it should have less detail.
Color and value. Objects that are further away should have lighter colors than objects appearing to be closer.
Perspective of the objects.

, Freely sketching on paper whatever comes to your mind is a great way to get your creative juices flowing. Drawing with pencil and paper whenever you have spare time will help you expand your artistic abilities.


Carry a notepad and paper with your wherever you are so you can sketch freely when you have any down time.

, If you have a vision of painting a canvas, creating a sculpture, or even sewing a shirt, you can sketch your ideas first to explore your ideas. This will help you create multiple options within your design concept., If you make all of your sketches in the same sketchbook you can use it as a reference when looking for inspiration for your next piece. You can sketch in the same book every time, or you can keep a file cabinet or folder with your sketches in it.

, Different art sells to a different demographic of people, so consider who you think will buy your art before trying to sell it. When you know who your demographic will be you can market your art for them to sell more of it.Is your art geared towards kids or parents?
Do you create fine art that would best be sold in a gallery for art collectors?
Would your art sell best to the indie crowd at festivals?

, There are many avenues to sell your art, so you need to pick one that will target your art’s demographic. You can try selling in a couple of different avenues and then decide which one your art sells best at.Online on websites like Etsy, Ebay, or Artpal.
Art festivals
Art galleries
Your own personal website
Garage sales
Local businesses

, You need to market and promote your art to get it notice and create a buzz for sales to start happening. This is sometimes hard for an artist because it takes some business know how to accomplish it.


Promote yourself online. You can start a blog to promote your art that talks about your inspiration, your creative process, or art tips. You can also promote yourself on social media sites to gather a following.
Join your local art community. Most places have art communities that actively host events to promote art. By joining and volunteering with your local art community you will make contacts with people who can help you get your art noticed. This is also a good way to find people in the business to learn from.

Prime your canvas.",How to Stretch a Canvas," Canvas frames are also sometimes referred to as stretcher bars, which feature pre-cut slats that you can slip together to create the frame. This is the easiest way to customize the frame to fit your purposes and put it together quickly. Most professionals use stretcher bars.


DIY frame kits like EasyWrappe are prefabricated in a variety of different sizes that will allow you to quickly fix a canvas to a frame with no outside tools, other than an X-Acto knife to trim the excess canvas. While you have to pick from a limited variety of sizes, you can stick the pre-cut wood bars to the canvas and fix them in place in less than five minutes.;
, Get enough canvas to fit around the frame by at least six or eight inches on each side, depending on the width of the frame. It's essential that you have enough overlapping canvas to attach to the back side of the canvas, or the stretching won't work. Measure the dimensions of the frame you have, or of the eventual canvas that you want and purchase or cut a larger size of canvas, accordingly.









Unprimed, sometimes referred to as “ungessoed” canvas is easier to stretch than primed or “gessoed” canvas. For the best results, buy ungessoed canvas and prime it later.

, You'll need a few basic tools to complete a canvas stretching job properly. Try to get the following supplies:









A spray bottle filled with plain water. It’s common to dampen the back of the stretched canvas. As it dries, it will shrink and thus tighten the canvas even more.
Gesso. This primer is commonly used to treat the canvas after stretching. It's a white paint mixture, made of gypsum, chalk, and other ingredients, available at most art supply stores.
Specialty pliers used for canvas stretching. Available at most art supply stores, canvas pliers have flat surfaces that can be used to easily stretch canvas without pulling holes in the material.
Staple gun. Regular desk staplers are not sufficient for stretching canvas. You need a heavy-duty staple gun to plant staples into wood and carpentry staples capable of gripping into the frame.

, The canvas should be cut several inches wider than the dimensions of the stretcher bars, taking into account the width of each side of the frame, as well. You'll need this extra canvas to have something to get a grip on to be able to pull and stretch it. After you've got all your supplies, frame and canvas, cut the canvas to shape using a very sharp utility knife, or an X-Acto.









Tearing the canvas will make a straighter line than cutting it will. Get the cut started along the appropriate line using your knife and consider tearing along the grain to make an accurate shape.

, Lay the canvas out flat on your work surface and center the frame on top of it. Take a minute to smooth out and clean up the canvas as much as possible before you get started.









Make sure that the grain of the canvas is lined up straight with the stretcher bars on the frame. If they don't, the bars will twist and two opposite corners will lift up.

, Start with the longest side of the canvas closest to you and fold it in. Insert three staples in the center of that side of the frame, along the bottom edge of the frame. In other words, you want to wrap the canvas all the way around the bar and start fixing it onto the bottom edge of the frame. The canvas around the corners should still be quite loose. You’ll tighten it up later.









Rotate the canvas and frame, or move around the table to the opposite side and do the same thing. Pull the canvas tight, fold it over the frame, and insert three more staples into the stretcher bar on the opposite side.
You always want to secure the canvas from the middle to the corners. Never start inserting staples close to one of the corners, or the canvas will twist slightly on the frame, making it pooch out.

, If you're trying to stretch an ungessoed canvas, it's common to use a spray bottle to gently dampen the canvas with some water, which will help to tighten the canvas as it dries. After you've fixed the long sides to the canvas, mist the canvas gently to promote shrinkage as you work.








, Go to one of the unstapled sides and give the canvas a good solid pull, fold it over, and insert two staples, attaching the canvas to the frame. Do the same thing to the other short side.








, Go back to the first side you started stretching and work from your center staples out to each corner. Pull a piece of loose canvas, stretch it down, and insert a staple. Go slowly, stretching a little bit from the opposite side of the bar at a time. Continue pulling and stapling pieces of the canvas moving around the canvas edges in the same order as before.









If you want, you can staple near the corners and then place a staple between the center and the corner instead. Continue until you have about four inches of unstapled space from the corners.

, Tuck one side of the corner under the other, pulling tight, so that one straight edge is just even with the corner. Pull the corners very firmly. This is the final tightening, making it the most important. Be firm and even.









Sometimes, it's helpful to make a little slit along a diagonal in the canvas, to help stretch it tight and make it flush with the sides in the corner of the frame. You want the corners to look as clean as possible, so follow the shape of the canvas and cut it if necessary.

, Go around the canvas and pound all your staples with a hammer to make sure everything is flush with the frame. You don’t want rough staples around the edges while you’re working. If you see a need for more staples, take a minute to fix a few more in.








, Once you're finished, flip the whole canvas over and tap it with your finger. It should sound like a drum and feel quite taut. If there is any creasing or strange pulling, you'll be able to see it from here. If you mis-stapled or don't have the canvas particularly taut, pull the staples and fix it by repeating the steps in the previous section. The canvas will sag far worse once it is painted, if the canvas is loose.








, With some canvases, it's appropriate to insert shims into the corner joints to further stretch the canvas. This won't always be necessary, but if you want the canvas to be especially tight, or you think it could be tighter but don't want to take the time to remove all the staples and start over, this can be an excellent way of tightening it a bit more.








Wooden shims are very thin shards of wood that you can buy in packs at the hardware store for a few dollars. They usually come in a variety of sizes, which means you'll be able to customize the stretch and fill in the gap if necessary.

, After stretching your canvas, it's important to let the canvas rest and tighten up on the frame before you attempt to prime it or paint on it. In a room-temperature area free of excess moisture and humidity, a canvas should tighten up and be firm in about a day or two.








, After you've stretched your canvas, you're ready to prime it, using gesso or the primer of your choice. Sometimes ""tightener"" will be added to the canvas and allowed to dry before the primer, and sometimes not. Then, canvas needs to be primed by painting even, thin coats using the brush in one direction. Most canvases should be primed with three coats.









Apply one coat and let it dry thoroughly to the touch, then go back over the canvas with another coat. Use extremely fine-grained sandpaper to go over the paint before priming the canvas one more time.
Painting the primer on in the same direction allows the canvas to look fairly clean and simple, a great backdrop for your painting. Use sandpaper to flatten any texture or bumps of primer on the canvas.

Clean up.",How to Paint," What types of painting and art are you hoping to create? Do you need a lot of time to work on a single project, or do you hope to fully finish pieces in a single sitting? Do you have a spacious work area that is well ventilated, or a small area that might cause fumes to build up? How much money do you hope to spend on supplies? These are all important things to consider before committing to a type of paint.;
, Watercolors come in cases or small tubes of pigment. When used alone, they are thick and opaque, and do not cover much area. When used in combination with water, they will thin out and become transparent. Watercolors are used on specific paper made for use with watercolor; any old piece of paper will not necessarily work very well. These paints don’t allow thick layers of color, but give the beautiful effect of thin, translucent layers of color.


Watercolor paint sets begin for as little as $20 and can range to prices far above $100. For a quality beginners set of paint, expect to pay between $50-$80 to start.
Because watercolor can only be done on special paper that won’t wrinkle and curl when it comes into contact with water, there are limited options for things to use as a “blank canvas,” unlike acrylic and oil paints.

, Acrylic paints are another water-based paint option with a fast drying time and low fumes. These are a great choice for anyone interested in whipping up a completed painting in a single day. Thick layers of paint can be stacked up for a beautiful 3D effect, and because they are water soluble they can be wiped off surfaces and washed out of textiles. The downside is that because they dry so quickly, blending and wet-on-wet painting techniques can be difficult.


The application style and overall appearance of acrylic paints is most similar to oil paints.
Acrylic paints are typically less expensive than oil paints, and require many less additives. They are a bit more intuitive in terms of layering and technique than watercolor paints, though.
Acrylic paints are much less toxic than oil paints, as they don’t give off fumes or require heavy ventilation. If you are working in a small space or have pets and children around, acrylic paint is a safer option than oil.

, Arguably the most advanced option of the three painting mediums, oil paints are slow-drying and thick, they offer dozens of specialized techniques. These take about three months to dry completely, making them the best option for someone who needs or wants a lot of time to work on a painting to completion. On the downside, they are slightly toxic and require a great deal of ventilation when being used.


Oil paints are the most expensive option of the three paint mediums, and require several additional supplies including mineral spirits and gels.
Oil paints have the richest color of the three paint mediums, and will dry true to the mixed color., When you’ve decided on which type of paint you want to use, you will have to select a brand to go along with it. As a beginning painter, it is tempting to want to purchase the cheapest available brand. However, you will save yourself time and money (in the long run) by purchasing quality supplies. There are higher levels of pigment in good quality paint, meaning that a single stroke is all that is required while 2-3 may be needed to get a solid coat of paint with a cheap paint. You’ll end up using a cheap tube of paint much faster (and with much more frustration) than a more expensive tube of paint.

, There are two primary things to pay attention to in choosing a brush: the shape of the bristles, and the material of the bristles. Bristles come in three shapes: round (with a pointed cylindrical tip), flat, and filbert (like a flat brush that comes to a point). The bristles can be made out of sable (mink), synthetic, synthetic mix, hog, or squirrel. hair.


For watercolor painting, the best brushes are sable or squirrel, with a round tip.






The best paint brushes for acrylic painting are synthetic or synthetic mix with a flat tip.






For oil painting, the best options to use are synthetic mix and hog with a filbert tip.







, Stretched canvas is the best option for acrylics and oils, as it is relatively cheap. However, thick drawing paper, canvas board, and watercolor paper are all good options as well. Oil and acrylic paints can be used on most smooth surfaces, including wood and plastic, but the surface must be primed first to allow the paint to grip. Watercolor paints can only be used on special paper or fabric.


Don’t use regular printer paper or another thin paper for painting, as the paint will be too heavy and wet and will cause it to curl and warp.






If you plan to paint on wood or plastic, you will have to prime it first so that the paint sticks.







, In addition to those primary supplies, you will need a pallet, jars full of water (two is good - one for washing your brush and getting the color out and the other for wetting your paints), and a rag, an old shirt or apron to wear. Other specialty supplies are required for oil paints, but are not needed for watercolor or acrylics. It is helpful to get gesso as well; it is a white primer that preps any surface (canvas and paper included) to create the best painting surface.Not necessary for most painting but often desired, an easel can be used to prop up your painting. Otherwise, any flat, stable surface will work for painting on.







, The color wheel is a map of colors, showcasing the ways new colors can be created. There are three sets of colors present: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary colors are: red, blue, and yellow. These are colors that come straight from a tube; they cannot be made from mixing other colors. However, secondary colors (purple, green, and orange) can be made from the primary colors. Tertiary colors are in between primary and secondary on the color wheel (think teal or peach).


Red + Yellow = Orange






Yellow + Blue = Green






Red + Blue = Purple







, If you would like a more varied choice of colors then you may choose to mix a range of colors to make your choicest one. Nothing is worse than creating a painting using colors only straight from the tube. Mix your colors together to create new variations; mix the two primary colors in equal amounts for a true color, or add a little more of one color than the other. For example, making purple with slightly more blue than red will result in a bluish indigo color, while mixing with more red may result in a deep maroon.

, Adding a small amount of white to any color will make it lighter, turning it into a tint. Most from-the-bottle colors are very vibrant and bold, and can be made more pastel-like by adding white.


It is harder to add white to a color, so try adding a bit of your color to white paint first. You will have to use less paint to make a tint in this fashion.

, The opposite of a tint, a shade is when you mix any color with black. This makes the color slightly darker, i.e turning red into burgundy or blue into navy. It is easiest to add a small amount of black to your color (rather than adding your color to black paint) to accomplish your shade. In this case, less is more - always start with the smallest amount of paint possible to avoid making a drastically different color right off the bat.

, If a color is too bright for your liking, mix the color’s opposite into it to dull the vibrancy. Doing this is changing your hue (true color) into a tone; you’re toning the color down. A color’s opposite is the one directly across from it on the color wheel. For example, the opposite of red is green, yellow is violet, and blue is orange., The most basic type of line used in art is a contour line; this is the line drawn to outline an object. Some painters include contour lines around their subject, while others only use patches of color to show shapes. Determine whether or not or intend to use very obvious lines (such as contour lines) in your painting or not., Every object that can be painted is a culmination of several shapes put together. The biggest issue beginner painters have is trying to see one subject as a single shape, rather than a layering of many shapes. Instead of focusing on drawing the outline of a figure, consider it as multiple shapes that can be connected., Value is what color your figure is when converted to the gray scale; how light or dark a certain color is. Value is important when mixing paints, as colors can be deceptive when mixing unless thought of in terms of lightness and darkness. Realize that most paintings will only contain a value range in the bottom third (mostly light colors), the middle section (mid grays/medium tones), or in the top third (mostly dark colors) of a gray scale.Unless there is heavy contrast, the values in your painting should all be similar to each other.

, Because you’re working on a flat surface, you need to create the illusion of distance through the use of space. To maintain a flat surface, keep objects the same size and spaced out. To create depth, overlap shapes and make things further away smaller while things close to the viewer should be larger., For things to look touchable in your painting, you need to create the illusion of texture. Texture is created by using different brush strokes and moving the paint in different ways on the canvas. Short, quick brush strokes will add fur-like texture while long, flowing brush strokes will make things look softer and longer. You can physically build up the paint on the canvas to create texture as well., Movement is like the continuation of texture, but on a larger scale. Movement is created when a texture pattern is repeated over and over on the entire canvas. Not all paintings require movement, but if you are trying to create a realistic painting, then movement is an important element to incorporate., The layout of your painting, the placement of objects and figures, is known as the composition. In order to create an interesting composition, figures must be placed in such a way as to cause the viewer’s eyes to circle the entire painting. Avoid putting a single figure in the center of your painting, as this composition is the most basic. Create interest by putting a single figure on an intersection of thirds, or by adding other interesting objects to the background., The most important decision of your painting is deciding on a subject to focus on. For most beginner painters, it is easiest to choose an image (which is already flat) and painting a copy of that rather than choosing a 3-D object. To start, find something with basic lines and shapes, without too many colors, that would be easy to test your painting skills on. Common beginning painting subjects include:


A bowl of fruit
A vase of flowers
A stack of books

, Although it is not a requirement, many painters find it helpful to draw a rough outline of their figure on their canvas prior to painting it. Use a light graphite pencil to gently sketch the outline of shapes and figures on your canvas. You will be painting over this, but having a light outline will help you to keep your paint in the right areas.

, The colors your mix and the placement of paint on your canvas both rely on one major thing, its light source. Look at your subject, and determine where the lightest areas and the darkest parts are. Mix your paints with these in mind, creating several shades or tints of a single color to effectively blend colors together if necessary.

, When painting, it is best to work from the back to the front. This will help you to accurately layer objects and create the perception of distance. Paint with a single color at a time, going back and adding other layers of color as your work. Your background should be painted first, and you can add objects closest to the foreground later.

, When you’re happy with the background, you can add in objects and shapes. Work with layers of paint, similarly to the way you added the background in. Your subject is the center of attention for your painting, so it is important that you spend plenty of time paying attention to incorporating all the elements of art into it. Analyze it from all perspectives, and focus on recreating shapes rather than the entire figure.If you’re having a difficult time painting your subject accurately, flip your painting upside down. Painting it from a different angle will force your eye to look at the shapes that make up the figure accurately, rather than the symbol of the shapes your mind creates.
Start with the lightest colors, and then work with darker colors. It is difficult to layer dark colors over light ones, so start with whites and pastels before moving onto hues and tones.

, As you begin to finish your painting, add in the details you want for your background and figures. Many times this includes adding texture with your brush, a wash or glaze, and small or intricate figures as an overlay. This is the time for you to really get minute and focused on finishing touches.

, With the completion of final details, your painting is done! Touch up any mistakes on your painting, sign the corner, and clean up your work materials. It is very important to thoroughly clean your paint brushes so that they stay in good condition and will work well for future projects. Save any paint that you have left in containers, and store away your art supplies.

Get reliable squirt guns.,
Consider a pump squirt gun.,
Choose based on the gun’s reservoir.",How to Paint with Squirt Guns1," There’s nothing that will interrupt the fun quite as quickly as a dud squirt gun. Accordingly, avoid the cheapest squirt guns, as they tend to break (not to mention leak). You don’t need to get the fanciest guns on the market, but look for options that feel solid to the touch and have triggers that are easy to pull.If you do go the dollar store route, be sure to get extra in case a few don't work out.
Generic options from large retailers are often just as good a name-brand options.;
, Depending on the age of your children and the specific activity you have planned, squirt guns that fire by way of a pump instead of trigger may be preferable. For instance, young children may struggle with a trigger, but be able to pump a small squirt gun.Whether trigger or pump-powered, simple pistol-style guns will be sufficient for most projects.

, The reservoir that will hold the liquid paint is important for two reasons. Second, the reservoir closure is a good indication of the quality of the gun.


Smaller reservoirs, of course, will be better for stationary art projects, in part because the guns will be lighter and easier for children to aim.
Be sure to check the seal on the reservoir's closure. Cheap plastic plug closures are unreliable, and indicate that the toy is low quality in general. That said, these may work fine for a one-time project or party, especially if you get extra.

Choose a journal or sketchbook, or make one.,
Make the journal your own.,
Start putting stuff in it.,
Try new techniques in your journal.,
Think of something that happened during your day which made you happy or angry.,
Turn off the filters and the inner critic.,
Put your ideas on paper as soon as they form, or as soon as you can.,
Review your older entries occasionally.",How to Use an Art Journal," You can get an inexpensive notebook and just concentrate on the content of the book, or a fancier blank book if you're more serious. Check out the stationery department of your favorite store or an art shop.


Don't get anything too fancy if you're just beginning drawing. ""Too fancy"" is anything that makes you feel guilty about writing in it, or worry that you might mess up and ruin the journal. On the other hand, if you prefer to draw or paint, choose a paper quality, texture, and thickness that are suitable for your preferred medium.
There are pocket journals, for when inspiration hits, or for when something happens and you must draw it right away.
Choose the paper size you prefer. There are suitable books of normal size paper, poster size, and miniature size.
Check whether the book you choose will stay open by itself. It's no fun to try to draw or write when the book is flopping closed under you.
Some people prefer spiral bound sketchbooks because they lay flat. Others dislike them because the spiral gets in the way when they draw. This is completely a personal preference thing, so choose what works best for you.
Notice what's involved in getting a page out of your chosen book, especially if you think you might ever want to take a work out and display it.
;
, At the very least, lay claim to it by writing your name (phone number is good, too, in case you misplace it) in it or on it. You could also decorate the cover, recover it, add color, or attach interesting objects to it.

, Don't spend too long worrying about exactly what to do. Just start doodling or doing whatever's on your mind. You may find that some of your best work happens almost accidentally.


Leave the first page blank if you're not sure you can draw well enough yet, or if you'd like to make an index as you go. If you do the first page last, your art skills will have improved by the finish and you'll give it a gorgeous introduction.
Choose a middle or back page and chart your paints, pens and other art supplies. One function of an art journal is to learn what your supplies can do. Starting at the back with color charts and mixing tests makes them easy to find for reference later.

, Feel free to try out techniques you see in art videos, online articles and magazines. That's part of the fun of having an art journal. Write down your thoughts about the experiment, this will make the page a mini-article about what happens if you mingle poured watercolors or if you use glitter glue instead of putting down glue and shaking glitter over it. These texts about the process are fun to read and the next time you want to use those materials, you can look for inspiration right in your journal.

, One of the main points of an art journal is to vent emotions and opinions in a healthy way. You can put down things that happened in your life you can't talk about, things that make you laugh, sketches of funny outfits you saw - anything, really.


Treat it like a real diary if you want, or simply use it to collect your works and practice. The whole point is that the journal is for you, by you, and its contents are completely up to you.
Try reflecting on other art and design you see, especially if it makes an impression on you or grabs your attention. You can draw or create your impression, or just write about it.
Create in your journal frequently. It's good practice if you're learning new techniques or perfecting old ones, and it helps to keep you in that frame of mind..


, Don't hesitate to experiment in it or make mistakes. This is your journal. Put in it what you want. If that's strictly drawings, fine. If that's a mixture of drawings, paintings, writing, collage, and pasted-in prints of your favorite photographs, that's fine, too. Doodle aimlessly on a few pages or try out a new medium or technique. Your artistic journey might not even happen all in one book.

, Perhaps you made what you thought was a funny joke during school or at work, but no one laughed. You can draw that many different ways. You can draw it like a comic book, complete with the joke and the awkward silence where no one laughed, just one picture with the punchline that didn't work. Or you can split the page into halves or fourths with the key points of what happened. It doesn't matter, so long as you create your impression of it.

, You might find new inspiration in old pieces, things to try drawing again or varying, or simply memories. You may also see a pattern of your work progressing through different interests and moods, or of your techniques evolving and improving.

Find a strong, new rubber band.,
After opening up the paint can, wrap the large rubber band vertically around the can.,
Prep the brush and practice using the rubber band method to remove excess drips of paint.,
Continue to use this method as you paint.",How to Prevent Paint From Dripping Outside of the Can1," It needs to be a large rubber band that can be stretched vertically around the paint can. It needs to be a rubber band that won't break, so discard any bands with rips or tears.;
, Place the band so that it hovers across the middle of the can. This allows you plenty of space on either side to keeping dipping in the brush to get more paint without bumping the band.


If using various cans at once, consider placing rubber bands on all cans you plan to use beforehand to avoid having to stop mid-painting.







, Dip the brush halfway into the can of paint. Next, run the base of the brush (where most of the paint has gathered) along the rubber band to remove the excess paint. This should be enough to remove drips and leave an even coat of paint on the brush, ready to begin painting.


Paint a piece of paper or an area you can use as a trial. This will let you know if the trick is working properly.







, It'll soon become second nature to run the brush along the band. Replace the band if it gets too clogged up with paint or in the event of it breaking or sagging too much. And be sure to use a new rubber band every time you paint. Using old rubber bands, caked with paint from past projects could mix old paint with the new paint.

Smooth everything out.",How to Paint a Portrait of a Dog," Take a piece of paper and draw randomly spaced dots around the edges. Practice drawing straight lines between all the dots––this will come in handy when you are finding the proportions and placing the features of the dog’s head.;
, Use a simple computer painting program to print out a sheet of small, randomly-colored squares. Mix small portions of these colors as accurately as you can with your chosen opaque paint.


Even if you work digitally, buy some cheap paints and practice mixing. Being able to identify the mixing components of a color is extremely helpful for matching the colors of your subject.
If you are doing opaque painting, you need to try coloring on the actual material that you want to paint on. This will allow you to foresee how the material absorbs and paints diffuse which can help you to create different effects.

, Creating a painting that looks three-dimensional is easier if you can accurately judge the forms of your subject. Good lighting is a key factor to doing this well.


Choose a reference image that features a single, strong, direct light source that creates a clear separation of light and shadow. You can identify a direct light source by looking for hard-edged cast shadows.
A simple, uniform background makes it easier to see the outline of the subject.

, Ensure that the proportions of your painted subject are correct by mapping out key features in the reference for comparison.


Look for major lines of action (red lines) such as the center line of the head or the tilt of the eyes. When sketching in other features, compare their placement and orientation to these lines.
Note the angles (blue lines) that parts of the head make with each other - these angles remain the same regardless of the size of your painting. Pick out spots that are easy to keep track of, such as the points of the ears, the nostrils, and hard corners where the jaw and collar overlap with the neck.
Negative space (yellow area) is the shape created by the area around the subject. In many cases, negative space is far simpler and easier to judge than the shapes inside the subject.

, Begin by drawing the major lines of action.


Draw straight lines between the key features, making sure the angles are accurate.
Using simple lines makes it easy to adjust proportions before drawing in more complicated forms.
Resist drawing small details and focus instead on correctly placing the biggest forms.
The sketch should show accurate proportions. Keep adjusting your guidelines until all the forms are the correct size.

, Understanding how light is hitting your subject is the most important factor in making your painting look three-dimensional. Light value areas are most directly facing the light source. There are two types of medium value areas:


Planes of the form that are turning away from the light and about to go into shadow.
Light is bouncing off of objects behind the subject and hitting them from the opposite side, but much less strongly than the direct light. This is called “reflected light.”
Dark value areas are where the least amount of light is shining on the subject because the planes of the form are tangent to the light sources, so they aren’t getting light from either the front or back. They occur between medium value areas and are called “core shadows.""

,


Mix 4 neutral (gray) values: light, medium, dark and a background value. Don’t try to perfectly match any values because this under-painting will be completely covered by the final colors. The different value areas are only an organizational tool.
Apply the values using the sketch as a guide. Working with only four values makes this step simple and fast.
Use a large brush.
If you have trouble placing the medium values, try painting only light and dark first before adding medium.
Step back 10 feet/3 meters from the painting to get an overall impression. The painting should begin look like a three-dimensional form with light shining on it.

, This is where the painting begins to really look like the dog reference. Using the reference for comparison, mix colors for each value section defined by your under-painting, and lay in the colors within the pre-mapped areas with a large brush.


After the biggest areas are painted, layer on additional colors, but keep using the large brush.

, With all the large shapes in place, switch down to a medium brush and start refining the edges of major forms, such as the jaw and large skin creases.


It may be useful to sketch guidelines into the painting, as they can easily be covered up with a new layer.
Step back 10 feet/3 meters from the painting. The illusion of light should be very strong. You might forget the shadows are only painted.

, As with the rest of the body, the tongue and nose can be broken down into larger planes to plan out the form. Once you have them looking as if light is shining on them, go in with even finer details.


To make the snout look wet, look at your reference for the placement of small, bright, hard highlights. These are called “specular reflections”. They occur where the light source is being completely reflected off the surface.

, Note that the “white” of the eye is rarely white under normal lighting conditions because it is recessed into the head and cast into shadow by the skin around it. Capturing these shadows is the key to making the eye appear to be set in the face and not just painted on the surface.


Small, bright specular highlights give the eye a glassy sparkle.

, The ears are composed of a few large planes that turn up at the edges.


Be sure to establish the forms before adding graphic elements like spots, and remember that the spots are affected by the light and shadow of the plane they are on as well.

,, Now that all the forms are in place and sufficiently detailed, you can go back and blend rough patches of color together if you want a smoother, slicker look to the painting. Keep plane boundaries fairly sharp, though, or the painting may start to look blurry and flat. Then step back 10 feet/3 meters from the painting and enjoy the finished product.

Default to washable paint.,
Try tempera paint.,
Make your own liquid watercolors.,
Store paint in recycled condiment containers.",How to Paint with Squirt Guns2," Whatever the specific type of paint you use and how much you water it down, you probably want to choose a washable option. This is true even if you’re hoping your kids will focus on painting a canvas instead of one another.

, Washable tempera paint works especially well. It often comes in liquid form already, but you can also get it in powdered form to be mixed with water. If you get the liquid type, mix it with at least equal parts water. Follow the directions on the packaging of powdered tempera paint, and use roughly twice as much water as they call for., You can purchase washable liquid watercolors, but they’re also very easy to make. You’ll save money by making your own too. Simply purchase a small plastic tray of different watercolor paints. Pop out the colors you want to make into liquid paint and add them to individual containers of water that is just below boiling.Use as much water as you want. The more you use, the less bright the color of the paint will be. For an art project, start with about a half a pint of water for each color.

, Plastic condiment containers with a flip-top lid and small opening are ideal for storing your liquid paints. Not only do they facilitate easy dispensing, they are also the hardest to spill.If you don’t use all of the paints, store them out of the direct sunlight. Shake them before their next use.

Provide funnels for filling.,
Submerge squirt guns that are hard to fill.,
Use watercolor paper or canvas panels for paintings.,
Experiment with the way you shoot.,
Use painter's tape to make shapes on the canvases.,
Dye t-shirts with older kids.,
Allow the paintings to dry.",How to Paint with Squirt Guns3," Unless you have storage bottles with nozzles that can fit into the squirt guns’ reservoirs, funnels will be necessary to help fill the guns. Direct children to take their time while filling their squirt guns, and not to overflow the funnel., If the hole to the squirt gun’s reservoir is especially small, there may be trouble filling it. In these cases, put the paint and liquid mixture into a plastic container that is slightly larger than the gun. This will allow users to submerge the gun, and allow water to replace the air in the reservoir.Food storage containers such as Tupperware work especially well.
Note that this filling method is more likely to lead to paint all over everyone’s hands, etc.

, For art projects, prop a canvas panel on an easel or suspend a piece of watercolor paper from a similar apparatus. Be sure to do so ahead of time, so there's something to shoot at as soon as the kids get their hands on the arsenal., For instance, the squirt guns will have a different effect upon the canvas when the shooter is standing closer or further from their work. In general, shots taken near the canvas will be easier to aim, and paint will disperse less before it hits the canvas. Meanwhile, shots from further away will provide a sprayed effect., Before painting, block off a section of the canvas in whatever shape or pattern you want. When the tape is removed, the shapes will be preserved within the splashes of color., Consider using clothing dye in squirt guns to make custom t-shirts or other items with older kids. Since the dye will be permanent, make sure everyone understands that they shouldn’t spray one another, or anything other than the intended target.Clothing dye is available in powder and liquid forms at many grocery stores and other large retail stores.
Follow the directions on the dye’s packaging.

, Once everyone is finished painting, carefully take down the canvases and store them horizontally to allow them to dry. Allowing the works to dry vertically is also an option, but be aware that the paint will likely continue to run downwards and may saturate the bottom of the canvas."

Each of these mediums has a different effect on the canvas and conveys a different kind of atmosphere.Spend some time at your local museum observing these styles. Inquire with museum staff about the method and training that artists you particularly enjoy used.
Explore different kinds of painting through art lessons at a community center or school for fine art.;
, Since you'll be painting all the time as a career painter, you should purchase high quality supplies. These will ensure that you are able to produce the best possible work you can. General supplies you'll want to have on hand include:


Brushes of various size, shape, and purpose
Easels
Paints (acrylic, oil, watercolor)
Palettes
Paper (canvas, watercolor paper, wet strength cartridge paper (130gsm/180gsm)), It's no secret that art supplies can be expensive. Learning to upkeep your brushes and preserve your paints while learning your medium will make your life easier. You can find compounds designed to remove artistic substances, like acrylic or oil paints, at most specialty art stores. Familiarize yourself with:


Removing acrylic paint from brushes
Removing oil paints from your brushes
Maintaining your palette
Refreshing your paintbrushes

, Even if you consider yourself to be a mostly acrylic painter, you never know when you'll need to use a certain medium, like watercolor, for effect or to fill an order from a client. Additionally, you may find out you enjoy a certain style more than you initially thought.Try painting a variety of objects. You might discover that you like watercolors best for landscape painting and oil paints more for portraits.

, You may consider your style to be of the utmost importance, but in the words of the Dalai Lama, you should ""Know the rules well, so you can break them effectively.""Color theory will help cultivate your intuition of how different colors work together and the emotions these evoke. Studies in shading will provide you with a better understanding of how to bring out depth in your paintings, and so on. There are many different approaches to art theory, and the broadest education you receive on the topic might come from an art theory class at a university, community college, or community center.
Some techniques work well across many mediums, some techniques only apply to a single medium. Art theory can help you determine which technique will help you achieve your goal best.

, The kind of location you choose for a studio might be limited by many factors, like income and availability, to name a couple. You might also find that your taste in studio changes over time. For example, you may find yourself most productive working in a studio in a lively part of town in your youth, only to prefer a more remote and quiet location later in your life.


Windows that allow natural light can be an asset to your work as a painter. You can always put up a sheet or curtains to block out excess light in the event you need a dimmer ambiance to work.
Be sure your room is adequately ventilated. Some paints, like many that are oil based, give off fumes that can be dangerous in enclosed spaces.

, School can be both a place to receive an education and a place to receive training. Some programs focus on imparting knowledge to students, while others focus on the application of skills. Many fine art programs offer broad exposure to many different kinds of fine art, which help you create richer art. Some areas you might be trained in:


Painting
Drawing
Printmaking
Sculpture

, Even if you were born with a gift as a painter, your skill can always be sharpened. Experts agree, by duplicating a difficult piece by a master, you can train your skills as an artist and gain insight into the process of the master you are studying.Some of your imitation work might even be chosen by organizations, like the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, for an exhibition.Some classes may stress a certain aesthetic, like cartooning or portraiture, and can improve your problem areas rapidly.
You may benefit from doing a masterwork study every month. Choose one painting per month from a master you admire and try to imitate it.

, Most, if not all, professional artists find themselves drawn to a particular concept or subject. This can be as simple and definite as ""octagons,"" or as complex and nuanced as ""the divine expressed in man."" Look through your art and honestly search yourself to find what resonates with you. This is your theme, and should be developed.Themes can often turn into the hallmark of an artist, such as the Art-Nouveau designs of Alphonse Mucha and Gustav Klimt.Your theme can also keep you inspired in your pursuit of artistic excellence.

, Every artist has a different approach to their artistic process. You'll have to spend some time trying different things and soul-searching to find how to consistently motivate yourself. Some ideas to consider:


Go for a nature walk and draw inspiration from the natural world.
Search the web for photos that resonate with you.
Search for artists in the same school or time period as artists you admire.
Visit an at museum. Bring along a sketchbook and jot some ideas down to develop later., Artistic jobs are sometimes looked at as being subject to the whims of creativity. But just like an account must crunch numbers every day to earn his salary, so too must you pick up your paintbrush and soldier through the uninspired times of your career to preserve and improve your skill.

, Unfortunately, apprenticeship has fallen out of popularity in many parts of the world, but this is a small obstacle you can overcome. Visit local artists and choose one that you connect with both personally and artistically. Then:


Trade your time or effort (cleaning, stretching canvas, etc.) for use of the artist's studio and her direction.
Volunteer your time assisting the artist. She might not be able to afford to pay you, but while volunteering, you'll get an insider's look at her process and business model., This does not have to be the final goal of your art career, but should instead be something to keep you artistically engaged while paying the bills. For many painters, this translates to portraiture. Sign up to do 15 minute portraits at a local fair or outdoor event. You might also:


Paint local or iconic scenes and print these on postcards. You could sell these online, or to a local boutique.
Bid to paint public art installations, like murals.
Sell pieces to a local gallery.

, While you are going to school or during your apprenticeship, you'll meet other artists, art collectors or buyers, and other people associated with fine art. Make up some simple business cards with your information and exchange these with people who might be able to help you in your goal of becoming a painter., Once you figured out the theme you are passionate about and the medium you prefer working in, devote time and thought to the people who will buy your art. You'll need to do some research, as every situation will be different for each artist, but you might look into:


The people who have bought your art in the past. What features do these people have in common, and how might you use that information to sell your art?
Artists similar to yourself. Look at the business model of these people, who they are marketing to, and how they are marketing., There are also hosted sites you might go through, like Etsy and Patreon, but having your own website can accomplish two purposes for you. First and foremost, you can include your portfolio and post pieces that are for sale as well as a shopping cart feature for those who would like to buy your art outright. Secondly, your business website will give you more of a presence as an artist, making you look more professional to prospective clients., It might be a while before you can afford to open your own gallery to sell your work, but you might be able to snag an exhibition at a gallery that focuses on new and emerging talent. These venues are frequently found in urban and semi-urban environments. Submit your art for review with the gallery manager.Schools can sometimes be a profitable place for you to start, or in some cases offer cheaper spaces for exhibiting the work of beginning artists.

, Though many artists create work as a labor of love, you should still treat your work as a business. It is, after all, the thing you hope to make a living off of. Don't offer freebies unless for a reason, like for marketing purposes.Though people might think, ""it's easy for her to paint,"" those people don't realize how much time, effort, and money you've spent developing that skill.
Always treat your time and skill as a resource and make it clear you expect appropriate compensation for your efforts.

, Or use a paper plate if you want to dispose of it rather than wash the paint off.

, Lift up and allow any loose paint to drip off before using.

, Simply press down the base of the bottle gently and lift up cleanly. You will see blossom imprinted where you have pressed––there should be five outer dots and possibly an inner circle dot too, depending on the pattern of your soda bottle.

, Try different styles, some with more blossom, some with less, until you get a picture that you like the most.

, The soda bottle can be turned into something else, like a candy dish or a volcano science project.

, Find a pretty place in your room to hang up the picture. If you're a teacher doing this with a class, have the children place them around the classroom as decorations to celebrate springtime.

With your highlight color (White, or a lighter shade of your base color), lightly color the highlights and surrounding areas of your picture.

,
Finish off your pencil sketch.

,
Using a medium to small soft paintbrush, paint water over your picture.,
Once your initial layer of water has dried, you can dip the pencils themselves into the water to add areas of intense color or details.,
If you wish to, you can go back over your picture now with another layer of shading colors.",How to Use Watercolor Pencils," It does not need to be too detailed, but do include major lines and points. Do not shade the picture.;
, With each of the colors of pencils that you will be using, shade a small square and paint over it with water. This will allow you to see how your colors will look, as some colors look completely different once water has been added.

, Blending colors in this method can produce beautiful effects and add dimension to your picture.

, Do not worry about shading yet.

, This time, leave blank the areas of highlight and shade in your shadowed areas.

, Using more than one color to shade your picture will give it dimension.

,,, Make sure that your brush strokes go with the contours of your subject. Start out with a little bit of water, and add more to produce a more washed out effect. The more water is added, the lighter the color will become and the less you will see your pencil lines. However, if too much water is used, the colors will run. Use a smaller brush for detailed ares.

, Doing this provides a very strong color, and it is difficult to hide mistakes.

, You may or may not want to add water to this layer.

Group the markers by color.,
Remove the end caps from the markers.,
Pull out the ink inserts.",How to Make Watercolors Using Magic Markers1," Gather up all of the markers that you plan to use for the watercolors, and separate them according to color. For example, place all of the red markers or all of the blue markers in a pile.This project is ideal for dried out markers. While they may no longer write, there is still plenty of ink inside the inserts for the watercolors.
Brand new markers will also work for the watercolors.
The markers don’t have to be exact color matches when you organize them. For example, you might group together reds, pinks, and burgundies or greens and teals.;
, To get the ink inserts out of the markers, you’ll need to remove the end cap. With some markers, you may be able to simply pull the cap off the end with your fingers. Other markers will require using a pair of pliers to snap off the end of the marker.With some markers, it may be easier to remove the bottom of the marker where the tip that you write with is.
It’s not necessary to remove the ink inserts to make the watercolors. You can simple place the tips of the markers in the water and the ink will leach out. However, the watercolors will not be as pigmented as when you use the inserts.

, Once you’ve removed the end cap, turn the marker upside down. The ink insert, which has a sponge-like texture, should fall right out. Keep them organized by color.The ink inserts may be a little messy, so it’s a good idea to line your work surface with newspaper or foil.

Obtain a field box or palette.,
Purchase a good quality brush.,
Purchase water soluble graphite pencils.,
Buy some sketchbooks.,
Choose good watercolor paper.,
Assemble together various miscellaneous items.,
Watercolor easel, folding table or drawing board.",How to Put Together Equipment for Watercolour Painting," To begin with, you can use a portable lightweight field box. It should be small and sturdy; easy to travel around with. You buy it empty and fill it up with your own choice of colours. It makes a good investment and if you change your mind about the colours that you have bought, it is easy enough to change them.


Alternately, watch for artist grade field box sets on clearance or deep discount sales. If the color range has two yellows, two reds, two blues, a gold color like yellow ochre, a reddish brown and a dark brown then the set will give you the basic colors you need. One or two greens in it may be useful. White is ""body color"" that may be useful for adding light details on dark areas. If you want to change the colors later, ""half pans"" of pan watercolor are all the same size so you can pull out a color you don't use much and replace it with a new one you've learned to love.
Sometimes a set with a good field box is cost effective even if it's more than getting the same colors in a simple box if it's well designed and has extra features like a water bottle, snap in travel brush, folding palette sections. Watch for those on sale and if you're not fond of the paints, feel free to swap in half pans of good paint in other brands. ""Full pans"" are larger and take the space of two half pans in a watercolor box.
You can also refill empty half pans from tubes of watercolor paint. If you change the color or brand, be sure to rinse out the remnants of the old paint before adding more. Fill it, let it dry and see the surface sink. Then add more till it's filled up by pouring. If it's the same brand you can add more before it's completely empty.
If you live in a very hot and dry climate, the best option would be to purchase tube colour paints. Or if you're fond of using paint strong, direct from the tube. Some painters prefer using tube paints for their consistency.

Use tube watercolour paints on a plastic, lightweight palette; it's easy to hold and not too heavy. These palettes are also good if you prefer bringing more colors out into the field, they have many small slants to hold paint and large mixing areas in the middle once open.


At home a large palette with a cover may be convenient. Porcelain palettes are expensive in large sizes but also come in smaller forms like the traditional seven well ""flower palette."" Porcelain has the advantage that it never stains, weighs more and is less likely to get knocked off the table. Plastic is lightweight. Covered palettes may let you keep paint moist rather than letting it dry out completely, though most watercolors will reactivate if you put water on the dried blob and let it soak for an hour.
The bigger boxes are more suitable for indoors, as they are too bulky to cart around with you on field trips. This depends on your transportation, your setup and the weight of the box. Judge how compact the box is and its weight when full against how far you'll walk carrying it before you settle down to paint. A tin with 48 half pans might be quite small compared to a large metal palette with forty or more slants in it.;
, You need one good brush; spend a bit of money on getting good quality. Buy a few more if you can afford it but you don't need a huge selection of brushes.
If you can afford it, Kolinsky sable brushes are lifetime brushes when properly cared for. If not, consider looking for top quality synthetic or synthetic/sable blends. You may replace good synthetics more often but they can be just as good for a year or two.


For your brush, look for one that has a wide ""belly"", so that it will hold and carry plenty of colour and that also comes to a fine point.
You can make a handy holder for your brushes out of a bamboo mat. This allows you to roll up the brushes and tie them together for ease of carrying.

, These are very useful for a watercolor artist.


Ensure that you also get a propelling pencil, one that has a reasonably soft lead.

, You can never have too many sketchbooks, in different shapes and sizes.


But whatever the size, the best type is spiral bound, as these are easier to use outdoors. You can open them out flat and they come in different sizes and different qualities of paper; heavier paper will take colour well, so that you are able to experiment with your paints. Look for ""multi media"" journals that have sizing on the pages to accept water. They allow more big washes and more freedom in your watercolor sketching than drawing paper.

, Watercolor paper comes in sheets, pads or blocks. Each of these forms have different advantages. 100% rag watercolor paper is best, although some good mixed papers can also be effective. Get the best paper that you can afford because good paper will respond better to your early efforts. Many beginners get discouraged when cheap materials don't give good results.


Full sheets can be cut to half sheet or quarter sheet size for large finished paintings, suitable for your portfolio or framing and placing in galleries. They allow you to work large and are sometimes less expensive, though buying by mail order or online you may need to buy a minimum number of five or ten sheets. The disadvantage of loose sheets is that they need to be ""stretched"" - soaked in water, then taped or stapled to dry out on a drawing board that's wood or Gatorboard. This is a lot of physical work for a beginner but useful to know. Stretching watercolor paper also removes some of the sizing and makes it more absorbent.
You should also get some watercolour paper in pad form, spiral bound with loose sheets which you can remove once you've done your work. This is handy and convenient but presents a problem you might notice in some sketch books too. Large wash areas and using a lot of water on it may make it ""Cockle"" and bubble up irregularly. Sometimes it won't even dry flat. One way to help reduce this problem is to sketch out a picture area smaller than the size of the pad by an inch or two on all sides, so there's dry paper around the wet area to help flatten it. Another is to weight down the edges of the paper while it's drying by stacking books on it.
Watercolor blocks are extremely convenient, especially for working outdoors. They're bound like a pad on all four sides with a little inch on one side left unbound. With all four edges gummed down tight, they may bubble up but will dry completely flat.
Look at the weight of the paper. It will say 90 pound, 140 pound, 300 pound or even 400 pound. This is the weight of a stack of 500 sheets of a certain really big size, not how much your pad weighs! 90lb paper is very light, common in student papers and multi media sketchbooks. It's not suited to very heavy washes unless you leave plenty of space to the edges and you may have to flatten it afterward but it's fine for watercolor sketching. 140lb watercolor paper is a good standard weight - quite thick, heavier than cardstock and will usually flatten out again even if it cockles. 300lb paper and heavier is almost like cardboard and has a different feel, it's useful for some types of paintings because it can be very absorbent and you almost don't need a backing board for it.
Choose the surface of your watercolor paper. Hot Press is very smooth, like computer paper. It's good for illustrations and styles where you may use fine line pen drawing with watercolor effects. It's hard to get broken color or dry brush effects on Hot Press. Cold Press is standard and it's what most inexpensive pads are. It has a medium texture that gives some broken color and texture interest but the peaks and valleys aren't so large that you can't work small. Rough watercolor paper has very large texture patches, big dips and peaks in the surface. It's good for working large, creating texture effects and doing various other special effects techniques. Each of these textures has its own best techniques and its own look when painted, so test them and discover what suits your style - or whether you like choosing the paper to fit a specific painting.
Watercolor boards are another possible surface. They're either paper bonded to an archival board or a special water-absorbent gesso formula applied to MDF or archival boards. They have the advantage they don't need stretching and will not cockle at all.
Watercolor ground can be applied to different surfaces to create a surface you can use watercolors on. This can be useful if you want to put a painting on the cover of your hardcover sketchbook or something.

, There is no need to spend a fortune on these extra items. Keep it simple:


a bottle of water; and
a collapsible pot for outdoors. Use two pots of water - one clean for adding water to washes and wetting your brush, one dirty for cleaning brushes. Some artists use three so that as the clean one gets dirty there's a second clean one to rely on.
At home these water pots can just be jelly or peanut butter jars, cups, short fat drinking glasses, anything handy. Some artists find some of their favorite water containers at yard sales!
Indoors, you may find a brush washer system useful. It's a plastic square or rectangular water bucket with two or three compartments. One will have angled notches where you can rest your brush with the hairs under the water but not actually leaning on the hairs, the other side has ridges to scrub your brush against to clean off thick paint. These are useful for watercolor and acrylics, for oil paints the brush washer systems are different. It's similar to the two jar system but has some perks to make brush washing easier.
Set out a mixing dish or palette. The plastic palettes for use with tube paints have mixing areas and so do field boxes. At home though, you can supplement these or just use a cheap ceramic or glass plate. Plastic plates can also work but these may become stained a lot easier than ceramic, glass or Corelle.
Extra cups for mixing large washes like sky color are useful. Choose a clear cup or one with a white interior so you can accurately judge the strength of the wash. For pouring effects you may need several of these, yard sales are a good choice.

, Each has its advantages. A watercolor easel is designed so that it can tilt completely flat or at any angle - this allows an experienced painter to let paint deliberately run, or colors poured into earlier washes to move in the direction you want. A table is just convenient. Outdoors, field easels are usually lightweight and can double for holding other types of painting equipment outdoors. Indoors, a multifunctional easel that can lay flat will serve for watercolors as well as oils, acrylics and pastels. Or just work on a table indoors. If you use a drawing board with stretched paper, you can put it at a slant to let water run by stacking books under the high end and prop something heavy in front of it so it won't slide off. Watercolor easels work very well with watercolor blocks. The lightweight outdoor ones are cheaper, so the budget minded could just use the outdoor easel at home and tuck it away in the closet when you're done.

Regard your work.",How to Paint With Watercolors," Watercolor paints are available in either tubes or shallow pans. Choosing tubes enables you to customize your collection a bit more, while pans usually come with an array of pre-selected colors.









Watercolor paints are delineated by property: some are transparent and others are opaque. Transparent colors allow you to see the white of the paper, giving the paint strokes a luminescent quality. Opaque colors can also be quite vivid, but they have a tendency to look dull since they block the light from coming through the paper.
Watercolor paints may also be either non-staining or staining. Non-staining paints stay on the surface of the watercolor paper, making them easy to lift or blend with other non-staining paints. Staining paints seep into the paper permanently and they're more difficult to blend with non-staining paints.;
, You'll probably want a basic set that includes the following primary colors: New Gamboge, Hansa Yellow Medium, Pyrrol Scarlet, Quinacridone Rose, French Ultramarine Blue, Phthalo Blue (GS), and Quinacridone Burnt Orange.Once you learn how to work with these fundamental colors, experiment with other paints.








, You'll want to pick up a handful of sizes, ranging from number 5 round to number 10 round. They should have a nice point in order to hold paint easily. You might also buy a flat brush. This has a long straight edge which is useful for doing washes or applying a base layer of paint.









Some artists will tell you to invest in good brushes right away while others recommend starting with inexpensive brushes until you decide if you want to stick with watercolors. With this confusing advice in mind, choose brushes according to your budget and your own desire to watercolor paint.

, There's no going around this one if you want paintings that won't bubble when you start to work. Watercolor paper is heavy and slightly textured. It's made to withstand the application of a considerable amount of water and paint.










Watercolor paper comes in three different textures: hot-pressed, which has a slick surface, cold-pressed, which has a medium surface, and rough, which has a bumpy surface. You'll also want to choose a thicker, heavier paper when starting out., When you're starting out, you can typically find items around your house that you can use to start painting. Once you've decided to really stick with watercolor painting, you can invest in purchasing higher quality items, if you like.

, If you're using household items, consider using a large plate. This will allow you to drop several colors of paint and mix puddles. If you're looking to purchase a palette, be sure to choose one with large wells so you can mix in water. You can buy one palette with a lot of wells, or buy several to use for designated colors.







, When starting out, this can be as simple as a sturdy piece of cardboard propped up against a wall or board. If you're purchasing a board, choose a wood, plexiglass or foam board to which you can affix your watercolor paper. You may also want to buy an easel to hold the board upright while you paint. This is a matter of personal preference, as some people like to paint on a flat surface, while others like painting at an angle.

, These will vary, depending on what you personally need. Many artists keep water containers, paper towels, pencils and erasers handy. You may also want to change into an old t-shirt or smock while painting.








, This should be a comfortable space that you'd like to spend time in. Choose an area that gets a lot of natural light. If you'll be working in the evening or don't have access to very good light, you may want to set up a strong desk lamp.









Look for a bulb or lamp with full-spectrum lighting. This will keep your lighting from being being too warm, making it difficult to paint accurately. Also, make sure your lampshade is pure white. This will keep your lighting more natural., Once you start painting, you won't want to stop and search for supplies. Keep them close to your painting, but give yourself enough room to maneuver comfortably.









If you're right handed, set up your palettes, brushes, and water containers on the right side of the desk, with the paper towels and other equipment on the left side. Reverse this if you are left handed.
Lay your brushes flat on a paper towel when you're not using them. Never leave brushes sitting in your water containers. They won't stay clean and you can ruin the tips of your brushes., Tape your watercolor paper to your board using masking tape and set it in the middle of the table. Tilt your desk upward, if possible, or raise the back of the board by placing a block underneath it to give you a good angle.









You can lightly sketch your subject or landscape onto the paper with a light pencil. Many artists like to paint without a guide, but it can be useful when starting out. Keep erasers nearby to correct mistakes.

, Pick a red, a yellow, and a blue to use as your primary colors. These colors will be mixed and blended to create some of other colors you'll use when painting, giving it a nice coherence. You can then choose other special colors to make each painting unique. Many artists use the same three primary colors in all of their work.








, Warm colors, such as red, orange, and yellow, tend to look as though they are moving forward on the paper. Cool colors, such as blue, purple and green, appear to be receding.









Complementary colors that appear opposite each other on the color wheel, such as yellow and purple, appear to advance in equal measure when they are next to each other - in other words, they seem to fight for attention.

, Pick a color of paint and dab a drop or two in your mixing tray. Dip your brush in water and mix the brush into the paint in your tray. If you're using additional colors, create two more paint puddles in two separate mixing trays. Be sure to wash out your brush between puddles.









Don't use too much water. Start with just a little, then add more if necessary. It's more difficult to achieve a richer color by adding more paint than it is to dilute a color by adding a little water.
Fill your palette with the different colors you are using. Squeeze just a bit of each color into the individual palette wells.

, This way, you'll understand how they work together. Having the ability to mix and layer colors so precisely is part of what makes watercolor so unique. The first few times you mix colors, you may be surprised at the outcome.









Watercolor paint dries several shades lighter than it appears when it is still wet. Keep this in mind when you're figuring out how to make a color lighter or darker.
Try not to overmix your colors. They don't need to be totally blended. One brushstroke may contain distinct gradations of color, rather than a solid blend. That's part of the beauty of watercolor.

, To fully load it, slide your brush through your paint puddle so that it gets completely saturated. Lift the brush and slide it across the rim of your mixing tray to remove the paint drip. Otherwise, slide it across the rim several times so that the brush isn't so saturated with paint.








You may want to blot after loading your brush. To do this, simply touch it to a paper towel to remove some of the excess paint. You can also blot lightly or blot well.

, Dip your brush in a container of water and lightly thump it on the bottom of the container to open up the brush hairs and release the paint. Continue until the brush is rinsed clean.









If you're cleaning several brushes, you may want to change the water. You won't be able to clean brushes with dirty water.

, This is the technique used to fill in a large shape with even, consistent color.To begin, draw a square or rectangle on your watercolor paper and fully load your brush with the paint you want to use.








, Using a light touch, paint two small strokes about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to make a corner.When you lift your brush you should have a bead of watercolor standing on the surface of the paper. Touch your brush to the bead a few more times to release more color and increase the size of the color bead.








, Lift your brush, releasing more paint. You have now established what is called a watercolor bead.








, Paint a new line from right to left, this time using the body of the brush instead of just the tip. About halfway across, stop, fully load the brush again, and continue to the left edge of the box.







, Continue painting down the sides and then across in half-inch increments until you've filled in your square. Remember to move from right to left and left to right when filling in the square.








, Charging colors refers to mixing two colors on the watercolor paper, rather than in the mixing tray, which can create a smooth transition from one color to the next.







, You may want to practice making a controlled wash that you can use to charge the colors. For example, paint about halfway down your controlled space or square with your first color.









Make the bottom of the bead an irregular line, rather than painting it straight across. Rinse out the brush.

, Touch the tip of the brush to the edge of the watercolor bead you established. Lift the brush to release the paint. The paint will immediately blend with and enlarge the bead.









The paint on your brush will become tinged with your first color. You may want to rinse out your brush again and load it with the second color you chose. This will give you a clearer transition between the colors.

, To create a blurred edge or transition color values, you'll need to carefully apply water.







, Rinse out your brush and blot it until it's moist, but not dripping wet.








, Make sure to work while the line is still wet. You can make one continuous swoop or several short strokes, which creates an even softer look. The color will charge into the wet area.








, Rinse out the brush and repeat, again painting a wet line along the wet edge. Do this until the color stops charging into the wetted area.








, You can simply blot the area using a paper towel, or you can use the flat or tip of your brush for more precision.

, You don't want a whole lot of water or you'll have less control over the color you lift.









Use the flat of your brush for a slightly larger area. Use the tip of your brush if you only need to remove a small bit of color.

, Use precise strokes and avoid going back over the area.

, This will remove some of the color you've lifted from the brush.

, Do this only if you want to lift more color.

, Use a pencil and a ruler to draw a straight line about 1/4 of the way up from the bottom edge of the paper. The landscape you paint will flow above and below this single line., Use clear water and apply it from top down till you get an inch away from your horizon line. Prepare several puddles of a single color on your palette. Vary the amount of water you mix into them, so you have several shades of your color.

, Load a medium brush with a vibrant shade of your color and paint from the top down, stopping about an inch away from the horizon line.The color should gradually lighten as you paint lower towards the horizon line. You can leave a little space between these variations in saturation.
You can leave an unpainted area in the sky to give the appearance of the sun rising above the mountains. Be sure to soften the edges of the paint surrounding the unpainted area.

, This will further distinguish the sky from your horizon.Use a paper towel or tissue to lift paint from the paper in a few places, creating the appearance of clouds and shifts in color.

, You can either let it sit till dry to the touch or blow dry it. This speeds the process up, just make sure you're using watercolor paper or it will drastically bubble., Start a few inches above your horizon line and use a dark concentrated shade of your color to paint a craggly line across your paper. Keep your line running a few inches above your horizon without touching it.


Don't worry about making the paint look even and consistent within the mountains; having uneven spots will be reminiscent of real mountains.

, Paint down towards the horizon line, but stop 1/2 inch above it., This is the area between the base of the mountains and the horizon. Dip a stiff brush in the same puddle you used to paint the mountains and hold it horizontally like a chisel, dabbing paint here and there across the horizon., Keep holding the brush firmly like a chisel and vary your layers of paint, making some darker and lighter. Your lowest line should be darker, since it will be the edge of a lake.Create texture by making the horizontal strokes slightly uneven.
Leaving little gaps and bits of white space among the lines for a natural appearance.

, This is the part closest to you in the painting. Load a wide, stiff brush with paint and a lot of water to create a lighter shade. Using one precise stroke, drag your brush from one side of the paper to the other without stopping.To give the impression of sunlight on the water, use the brush very lightly on the part of the lake that falls just below the horizon line, so that bits of white paper show through the strokes.
Repeat this broad strokes as you move down your paper, stopping an inch from the bottom of the paper.

, Again, you can air dry or blow dry., Load your brush with a dark shade of your color and again dab horizontally to paint a dark, thick, uneven line across the bottom of the lake. Fill in the foreground in this dark color, leaving it a little lighter where the lake and sky are also light.To add reeds, dry the same stiff brush, load it with your darkest paint, and make downward vertical strokes along the shoreline. Avoid painting reeds across the whole line. Instead, just pick a portion of the lake to line with reeds.

, Your first painting is complete, and you can sign it, mat it and have it framed. Practice more and move on to more advanced techniques, like sponging, splattering, using salt, dry painting, and much more.

Fill up two cups of water and put them next to your workstation.,
Squeeze out the tubes of paint on your palette.,
Wet your brush in fresh water.,
Dip your brush into the paint, and create a “puddle” on your palette.,
Apply broad strokes and get a feeling for the watercolor.,
Allow your painting to dry for at least 30 minutes.",How to Paint With Watercolors as a Novice1," You will need a lot of fresh water if you plan on painting with watercolor paint. Place at least two cups of water next to your workstation so you don’t need to constantly get up and down. Leave one cup of water so you can wash the paint off your brush after you are done with a particular color, and then dip it in the other cup to wet it.


When either cup of water gets murky brown or black you should empty it in your sink and get fresh water.;
, If you are using a pan set, you don’t need to do this step, but you may still want to use a palette so you can mix your colors. Separate the colors into their own zones, and use extra space on your palette to mix the colors. You can create more colors than the ones you bought by mixing them together.


You can get a wooden or plastic palette that you wash after use, or disposable paper palettes that come in a book.
The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, and are impossible to achieve by mixing other colors but can be mixed together to create secondary colors.Secondary colors are orange, violet, and green, and can be further mixed to make six tertiary colors., It might be instinct to just dip your brush into the paint, but watercolor requires you to add water first. Make sure your brush is saturated, and dedicate one of your water cups to wet your paint-less brush.









Weaker colors require less water, while richly pigmented paint can handle a lot of water without losing vibrancy.To get a fine tip on a round brush, hold it in your hand and flick your wrist while it’s wet. You should do this over a paper towel so you don’t get paint and water everywhere.

, If you are using tubed paint, dip your wet brush into the color you want to use. Then transfer the paint on your brush to the palette in a circular motion. Add more water until you create a puddle of watercolor that can soaked up by your brush. If you’re using a pan, you should see a small puddle form on top of the colors you want to use. Keep adding water to your brush until this happens.









When mixing, create a puddle exclusively for your new color.

, Go from one side of the paper to the other in a thick line. Tilt your easel or workstation backward so that the watercolor bleeds down, and doesn’t get built up on the surface of your paper. The watercolor should be lighter than the color in your tube paint, and should uniform in tone. If you want to achieve a darker result, apply more paint to the same area.









You can fill in a pencil drawing with water color or just do it free form.
Watercolor may not feel as intricate as other paint like oil or acrylic, but that's what makes it so unique.
Before you try to make a painting of an object, just get the feeling of painting with watercolors first.

, Avoid rubbing or touching the surface of your painting because it will smudge. Keep it in a dry area, and wait to see the results. When watercolor fully dries it typically looks lighter than when it’s wet.


Unlike oil paintings, usually watercolors are done in a single sitting.

Fill some plastic cups with water.,
Secure the matching colored inserts together.,
Dip each set of inserts in the water and soak them.,
Squeeze the inserts into the water before removing them.",How to Make Watercolors Using Magic Markers2," Count the number of color groupings that you have for the ink inserts, and arrange an equal number of plastic cups or glass jars on your work surface. Depending on how much watercolor paint you want to make, fill each container ½ to ¾ of the way full.You can use plain tap water for the watercolors.

, To make it easier to soak the inserts, it helps to secure them in a single bundle. Use rubber bands or pieces of string to keep all of the matching color inserts together.If you prefer, you can use a pair of scissors to cut the inserts into several pieces to make it easier to fit them in your containers.

, When the inserts are all secured together, place them inside the containers with the water. Allow them to soak for 24 hours to a week to allow all of the ink to leach out of the inserts.Be sure to keep the containers that you’re soaking the inserts in out of the way of children and pets so they aren’t accidentally knocked over.

, When the inserts have soaked for at least a day and the water has been colored, lift the inserts out of the water. Squeeze them to push any remaining ink out of them and into the water before discarding them.Wrap plastic wrap or paper towel around the inserts when you’re squeezing them to avoid getting ink on your fingers.

Pour the watercolor liquids into an ice cube tray.,
Paint with the watercolors on paper.,
Store leftover paint in a covered container.",How to Make Watercolors Using Magic Markers3," When you’re ready to use the watercolors, use an ice cube tray as a palette. Pour a little of each color into the compartments so they’re easy to dip a brush into.If you want to make the colors go further, you can dilute each shade with several drops of water.

, Dip a paintbrush into the watercolors, and paint your chosen design on a piece of paper. Be sure to have a cup of water on hand, so you can dip the brush into it to rinse when changing colors.You can also use the watercolors on wood.
For simple artwork, use a medicine dropper to drip the watercolors on coffee filters and watch how the colors spread.

, Transfer any leftover watercolor paint to glass jars or other containers that have a lid to store them. If any of the shades dry out, simply add some water to the containers to revive them."
"
Draw an outline of your painting with a pencil.,
Color your painting by filling in the shapes with the watercolor pencils.,
Dip your brush into a cup of water.,
Apply the wet brush to the filled in areas.",How to Paint With Watercolors as a Novice2," You can use a mechanical or traditional no. 2 graphite pencil to do this. Start off with something easy, like a bottle that you have sitting on your desk, or a simple shape like a triangle or square. Avoid a lot of detail because watercolor is a skill you need to develop, and the paint has a tendency to bleed, making your details difficult to paint.


If you’re not confident with your drawing skills the only way to get better is to practice. Start by drawing simple, flat shapes.
Draw other static objects you find in your house to further develop your drawing skills.
If you’re not confident, you can draw lighter lines so you can easily erase mistakes.
Don’t try to scratch at your drawing with the pencil. Use confident and long strokes.

, This will feel a lot like a coloring book. For this, you can use a simple back and forth motion until you’re satisfied with how much color is on the painting.


The color from your pencils will look much darker and more vibrant once wet.You can give your painting the illusion of depth or shadow by coloring some areas darker than others. Use multiple pencil strokes on a concentrated area of your painting to make it darker.
Try more than one color so you can see how each one blends and interacts.

, Make sure to fully saturate your brush with water to make the colors on your painting pop. You should keep two cups of water near your workstation at all times. One for cleaning your brush, and the other for wetting your brush once it's clean.


If you don’t fully rinse your brush in water before switching colors, they will blend together and give your painting a muddy appearance., Using a back and forth motion, brush over the colors in your painting. Go slow, and try to use long strokes, until your brush needs more water. At this point you should start to have a feeling for how the pencils work, and how your paper reacts to water.


Use a smaller brush for more intricate areas.
To remove paint that's gone out of the lines, paint over unwanted areas with a wet, paint-free brush.

"
"
Buy a size 5-8 round watercolor brush.,
Purchase watercolor pencils, tubed paint, or a pan set.,
Purchase watercolor paper.",How to Paint With Watercolors as a Novice3," Some watercolor artists only use a single brush. The most common brush you’ll use water coloring is a size 5-8, round brush.A round brush has rounded bristles that come to form a fine tip at the end. They are versatile brushes, and can paint detail and larger areas. A good watercolor brush will be able to hold a lot of water and paint.


Sable brushes are the best but most expensive brushes to use for water coloring.If you’re on a budget, try buying a synthetic brush.

, Watercolor pencils are a great alternative to real paint if you’re a beginner. They work like regular pencils, but interact with water on paper to create paint. Tube watercolor paint looks similar to acrylic paint and needs to be diluted with water as well. Tubed paint is necessary if you want to paint on larger canvasses, or want to give a deeper and richer feeling to your watercolor paintings. Pan sets on the other hand are hardened paints that come as a box set.Pan sets are great for smaller paintings, or if you’re on the go.


If you are brand new to painting all together you should look into watercolor pencils. If you’ve painted using other mediums however, tubed paint will probably feel more familiar to you.
Pan sets are great for beginners as well.

, There are different varieties, weights, and textures of paper that you can get. Heavier paper is more expensive, but will be able to hold your paint better, while lighter paper might buckle or wrinkle when touching water. Rough paper will take your paint and water well and gives your painting luminosity.There is students’ and artists’ quality paper. Artist quality is higher grade and will stand the test of time, while student grade paper may yellow over time.
The difference between regular paper and watercolor paper is the level of absorbency. Regular computer paper is too absorbent and will cause your paint to spiderweb.Some paper is also tinted off white which can give your paintings a different effect.

Paint the earth beneath the tree by using a technique called ""dry brush."",
Do the sky with diluted blues.,
Allow the piece to dry thoroughly and take a good look at it.",How to Pay Tribute to Earth Day by Doing a Watercolor of a Tree," You'll need watercolors, a round, #10 pointed brush, a long, narrow haired, liner brush, a piece of 11 X 14"" cold pressed watercolor paper (either pulp or rag content,) a rigid support board such as foam core, slightly larger than your paper, clear water and a piece of cast-off terry toweling to catch drips and wipe your brush.  Optional;  a ""rake brush"" for grass, a natural sponge and a shaker of salt finish the supplies.;
,  If using tube paints, squeeze out primary and secondary colors, plus brown, on the edge of your palette, keeping the center of your palette clear for mixing.

,  This tree could have delicate blossoms, as well.  Look at your paper and use either format, horizontal or vertical.  Picture a tree with approximately a 3/4"" trunk and, without drawing first, fill your brush with clear water and make three long strokes of water.  The water should almost be rising off the page.

,  Use a partly water filled brush to gently touch the water already there and pull it down for the tree's base.

,  This will exploit the action of the brush and make graceful, tapering branches.  Using a slightly wet brush, pull from the existing trunk shape and pull water into three large limbs.  If the water is drying up, just add more with your brush.  Remember, wet areas will remain enclosed where you have put them if you are careful not to jiggle the paper.

,  As things begin to dry, just continue to add more water, going back over the same places that are already there.  Taper and make smaller and smaller branches until you have a full umbrella of branches.   If you run out of paper on some edges, let the branches continue, don't try to cramp them to fit them onto the paper.

,  Fill your brush with one of the colors and touch it to the tree you've drawn in clear water.  The color will be carried by the water to other wet areas of the tree.  Immediately do the same with blue and yellow.  You are mixing brown directly on the paper.  If a pigment is hesitant to mix, just add more water and coax it along with your wet brush.  Let the water do the work for fresh and lovely results.

,  If necessary and for fun, gently lift the painting, on the board, and rock it gently to move the water to all parts of the tree.  Again, help it along with more water and more diluted pigments if you need to.  It will start to dry and be a lot lighter, so now is the time to hit it again with color.  Soon the entire tree will be appearing on the page.

,  Try to keep tapering them to be smaller and smaller at the ends.

,  The shine will begin to diminish and go dull and that is the moment to salt the tree trunk.  Leave it alone and as it dries, texture will begin to appear as the salt draws the moisture to itself making star like patterns.  You can use the hair dryer to speed up the drying.

,  Wet the sponge piece you have torn from the larger sponge and wring it out.  Touch it lightly, letting only the highest fibers contact the green and yellow.  Dab the ends of the branches with this sponge, turning your hand as you go to avoid stamping the same pattern each time.  Allow the leaves to dry.

,,  This is simply a flat brush with undiluted paint on the ends and running that brush quickly over the grass area.  It will skip leaving some areas unpainted and paper showing.  Do the same thing again, going in a side to side direction.  Use a ""rake"" brush to make grass and weeds.   Use the liner brush to make wild flowers and dandelions.

,  Pull a small dab of pigment onto the mixing part of a clean palette and add water.  Use your round, pointed brush, holding it at a steep angle to get a wide, side stroke and put water on the sky areas of the paper.  If thoroughly dry, the under painting will not be disturbed, if you use a gentle touch and go quickly.  Flood the light blue paint onto the sky, working the color in and around the branches.

,  Go back in with a darker value or shade of the base color to accent the leaf clusters, the blossoms, the tree trunk, and the grass clumps.  Find a gray color on your mixing area and use that to ""ground"" your tree.  Paint an amorphous shaped, transparent, shadow under the tree quickly and in one or two passes.

Buy tubes of gouache painting, making sure to purchase at least a basic red, blue, yellow, white and black, as well as any other colors you may want. Purchase a palette that has small, indented compartments for colors, as opposed to a flat palette. Buy brushes of varying sizes, as well as watercolor paper or a canvas or board on which to paint.Make sure to purchase a white pastel at an art supply store.
You can paint with gouache on a variety of different surfaces. Many artists use watercolor paper because it is inexpensive and portable. You can also use illustration board or watermedia canvas, which is an especially absorbent canvas designed for gouaches and watercolors.;
, After you purchase all your materials, it’s a good idea to set up your space for painting. Start by spreading newspaper over a table so that you won’t stain the surface. Fill up a cup with water and place it at the workspace.Keep a spray bottle of water and a roll of paper towels at your work station.
Use a disposable cup or a cup that you don’t drink out of for holding your water. You will be cleaning your brushes in the cup so you don’t want to use one that you drink from.

, Squeeze out a small amount of each gouache color into the indented compartments of your palette. If you know that you aren’t going to use certain colors, you don’t need to add them to the palette., Before you embark on your painting, it’s a good idea to get used to working with gouache. Dip a brush into a color and draw a line on a piece of scrap watercolor paper. Dip your brush briefly into the water, then draw another line. Notice how the opacity of the color is affected by adding water.Keep experimenting with adding water to the paint. Make washes of colors by squeezing color into a compartment of your palette, then dipping the brush into water and swirling the brush around in the color, releasing the water and mixing it with the paint on the palette.
When mixing water with gouache on your palette, always start with the gouache, then add water with your brush.
Dilute the paint gradually. It’s better to add too little water than too much, because you can always add more.

, Think about what you are planning to paint. Mix colors in your palette to create the colors that you will need for your design. Always clean your brush by swirling it in the water before you change colors to avoid contamination.

You can mix paint by squeezing two colors into the same compartment of your palette and mixing with a brush.
You can also mix colors by scooping up some paint on the brush, depositing it in a clean compartment of your palette, then cleaning your brush and dipping it into another color. Transfer the other color into the compartment and mix the colors together with the brush.
You should able to make all the colors you need just by using red, blue, yellow and white.

, If you have considerably watered down some of your gouache colors, add a few drops of Gum Arabic to the paint and mix with a brush. Gum Arabic binds the gouache color to the paper so that the pigment doesn’t wipe away after the water has evaporated., Many artists find that it is useful to lightly sketch their design onto the surface that they are going to paint on. This can allow you to fully flesh out your idea before you use paint to set it in stone. Use a graphite pencil to lightly draw what you are going to paint., Before you add paint to your design, first use a white pastel to color any areas on your design that you want to remain white. Because oils naturally deflect water, your water-based gouache will not adhere to any areas of paper colored with white oil pastel.Coloring with white oil pastel is not the only way to have white in your design. You can also use white gouache paint to add areas of white. However, if you are painting a very light and delicate design, you may not want to add a heavy layer of white paint to your painting. This is why some prefer to use white oil pastel instead of white gouache.
If you do not plan on having white in your painting, you can skip this step.

, Gouache paint is best used in thin layers. Paint the basic colors of your design, filling in the drawing that you made earlier. Do not use the gouache color straight from the tube; instead, water it down with several drops of water in the palette so the paint glides on the page.For instance, if you are painting a tree, fill trunk with brown and the leaves with green.
Some artists only choose to use one or two watered-down layers in their work to create a sheer, watercolor-like effect. Others prefer to use many layers to add detail and dimensions to their designs.
Although gouache can be built up, be careful not to apply it too thickly, as gouache has the tendency to crack when it is laid on very thick.

, It’s important to let your layers dry completely before painting on top of them. If you start to paint on top of a wet layer, the colors will swirl and mix in a way that is very hard to control.

Though some artists have mastered blending gouache painting while both colors are wet, it’s a good idea when you’re just beginning to paint with gouache to let the layers dry completely.
If your colors do begin to bleed, stop painting and let them dry, then paint over the blended area with the desired color.
If you notice that some of your paints are drying on the palette, spray them with the spray bottle of water to keep them wet.

, There are a number of ways to shade when you are painting with gouache. Because gouache dries extremely quickly, it’s not feasible to spend your time mixing the colors on the surface of the canvas as you would do when painting with oil paints.One way that you can add shade is to paint a series of lines of color laid next to each other in a gradient that goes from light to dark. For instance, if you are painting an apple, start with a line of pure red, then a line of slightly grayer red, and then add more gray until the last line is the darkest shade of your shadow.
After you lay down all the lines, soften the transition of color by dipping your brush in water, removing excess water using a paper towel, then gently scrubbing the dampened brush across the lines of color to blend the colors.
You can also shade by adding translucent layers of paint in progressively darker colors.
Finally, you can crosshatch or stipple to achieve shading. You can soften the stippling or crosshatching by using a slightly dampened brush to rub the area of the painting to blend it.

, After you have laid down your colors and have shaded your piece, go in with a small brush and add details to your piece. You also may choose to outline parts of your design either using a thin brush dipped in black gouache, or using an ink pen that can give you solid, defined lines.For instance, if you are painting a strawberry, you may go in with white paint and draw in the seeds of the berry. Then you might use a thin brush to define the leaves of the berry, and then finish by outlining the berry in black pen.

, After you add details to your design, go back and refine your design, correcting any mistakes and adding any finishing touches. Make sure that the paint is dry before you go in to finish your piece., If your final work is something you’re really proud of, consider framing the painting behind glass to protect it from weathering and aging. When you are framing your piece, be sure to mount it first, then place it inside the frame.Mounting prevents the painting from being directly against the glass, which can cause condensation and mold-growth, especially in humid environments.
Don’t varnish your gouache painting. Although varnish is a great way to protect other mediums, varnish will alter and darken the colors of your gouache painting."

On a piece of 11 x14"" watercolor paper, draw a circle in pencil to indicate the petunia's shape and the amount of space it will take up on the paper.,
Continue shaping the flower by connecting the area between the dips with flowing, curved lines.,
Mask the three circles you made for the flower's center with bits of tape, masking fluid or plan to paint around them.

,
Draw stems as long wavy lines.,
Continue laying out the entire page with circles for flowers, lines for stems and leafs.,
Set up a palette with red, violet, yellow and green tube paints.,
Add some droplets.,
On the same side, within the droplet, run a line of body color with a small brush and immediately follow with a brush dampened with plain water to soften the colored line.,
To finish the flower, paint the yellow circles at the center.",How to Paint Water Drops in Watercolor on a Petunia," Indicate the center with three small circles, and with curvy lines radiating out from that center, divide the flower into five parts. Put a ""U"" at the ends of the lines to remind yourself that the petals dip at that point.;
, Use ""V"" shapes to indicate where the flower has pleats and ruffles.

,, Double them to create a narrow space to fill with green paint.


Draw leaves as crescents. Notice that the veins come from a single point near the base of the leaf and radiate out like a fountain.
Draw a petunia in side view. Note that all the blossoms are joined to the base with a tiny, five pointed star.

, Follow the steps above for each flower. Be sure to add one flower that is waning. Later you can indicate its demise with its curled edges touched with brown paint., If you are using a paint box, activate the colors with drops of water. Make juicy puddles of well diluted red to make pink and diluted violet for lavender. Paint the flowers and the stems. Use a small, pointed brush for the stars at the flowers' base.

, A single light source is needed for doing water droplets, so indicate it with an arrow or piece of tacky note paper to remind you as you work. Draw a small circle where you want the drop and use a scrub brush to scrub the spot back to white. Allow this to dry. Accuracy is important, so follow the circle, starting at the half way point and on the opposite side of where the light is coming from, paint a cast shadow. Allow this to dry. Already the water spot is taking shape.

, Allow this to dry. On the opposite side draw a tiny circle for a highlight and use a very small scrub brush to remove any color on it. If it isn't as white as you would like, touch it with a drop of white opaque watercolor or acrylic paint.

, Then, give each petal a two or three main veins using a darker shade of body color and a tiny brush. Pull very delicate tributary veins to almost cover the petal. Don't forget to add little off shoots coming off the stems at various places.

When you have painted the first layer of your piece, let it dry.,
Get a small brush and do some calligraphy.,
Let the piece dry thoroughly.",How to Paint Sunflowers in Watercolor," If possible, study a live plant. Supermarkets and road side stalls have bundles of cut flowers for sale in the summer when they are in season. Put them in a vase or jar or position them as if they are growing in the field.;
, Artificial sunflowers come in all levels of quality. Cheap ones are basic without much detail, but ones from a craft store have more textural nuances and more closely mimic the real thing. Silk flowers last forever, are easy to obtain and because of their wire stems can be arranged in many poses. Photographs of sunflowers are a good reference, too., What do you see when viewing a sunflower? Start with the utterly simple general shape, a large round circle for the flower with a smaller disk directly in the center.

, Often they are in two rows in a simple radial pattern around the dark center.

, Look closely to see that it is actually many small seeds or flowers compactly arranged., Imagine that it is growing directly from the center of the back of the flower. Make it thick to support the large flower head. As the yellow sunflower develops, it can get so heavy the stem bends.

, They can serve to fill the space along the stem. How are the leaves arranged on the stem, symmetrically or staggered? What type of veins do the leaves have? Draw the center vein of the leaf first as a wavy line to suggest movement and life to each leaf. Then add the two sides to form a leaf. Do small lines as tributary veins coming off the main vein on each leaf.

,, Within each circle, draw a smaller circle for the central disk., Have the stems go off the page if you are showing the flowers growing outside in the earth. If the flowers are in a vase, criss-cross the stems and make the mouth of the vase large enough to appear to fit many flowers., There is no need to show the entire vase. You can depict only the top portion of it and have the rest disappearing off the page.

, Where you are viewing your vase from, looking down on it, seeing it at eye level or viewing is from below will dictate how the semi circle, or ellipse of the vase’s mouth will look.

, If you are showing the whole vase use help getting the curves of the vase's sides to match. Draw one side of the vase on tracing paper, reverse it and copy it onto the opposite side., They can also act as a filler to connect the flower head to the vase.

, Make any corrections or additions at this point since pencil is easy to erase and making changes will give you more satisfying results after it is painted.

, Squeeze the colors around the edge of the palette to keep the center free for mixing. If using tube paints, choose, as Van Gogh did, at least three colors of yellow. Put out orange, two browns, three or more shades of green, blue, violet and red.

If using a box of paints with dry pads, dampen with water to activate them.

, There is no correct place to begin your painting. Start where you wish, but many artists begin with the subject matter first. Keep in mind that wet areas will bleed together if laid down touching one another. Keep a tiny dry line of paper between colors or work around the page allowing areas to dry before painting next to them., Backgrounds can be whatever you want them to be. Look at your color wheel and to see what is opposite the yellows and oranges of your flowers. Those blues and violets are called complementary colors and make a lovely foil for the flowers. Van Gogh often put the flowers in a room and used even more yellows and oranges in the backgrounds of some of his works. There is no hard and fast rule.


If your work is an outdoors scene, put appropriate items to show off your flowers; a building, a fence, green trees, the sky, etc.







, Take a few steps back to view it as it would be seen on a wall, slightly from a distance. Make any adjustments at this point and allow to dry again., Accent parts you want to bring into focus with lines and darker or lower values of the body colors. If necessary, put in some small shapes. Just keep the linear brush work to a minimum. Remember to play up your center of interest with touches of more intense color. This is the place to show a lot of detail, too. You are guiding the viewer’s eye through the work., Erase any pencil guide lines if you wish. Put it in a mat and frame and hang it to enjoy.

",How to Paint Red Poinsettias in Watercolor," Either an artificial poinsettia plant or a live one will give you the information you need to paint it. Look for the general shape of the blossoms, how many petals come from the center of each flower, what size and color are the central berries, what shape are the leafs, do the blossoms lie flat or form an umbrella shape, are there layers of red petals and how are they configured?;
, Draw it in pencil. Begin by plotting out large circles for each blossom. If you are aiming for a realistic look, place a small circle within the larger one, but not exactly in the center to create the illusion that the flowers are pointing in various directions as if they were growing. Place small stems under them as if they were standing up.

, There are six main petals, so arrange them evenly around the center, allow them to become elongated ovals, and end in a point. For the veins, draw a slightly curved line down the center of the petal to give them the illusion they are lifting and curving at random. Fill in between each petal with a secondary set of petals for a lush, full flower.


, They are a third layer of petals but will be distinguished as leafs by painting them green.

, It can be a store wrapper around a pot, basket, or vase. If the container is a basket with a handle, let it go off the top of the page to give the viewer the feeling of being involved, not seeing the arrangement from a distance.

, The opening and bottom of the vessel, no matter what type, if it is round, will have curves at the lip and foot. They must be the same.,,, Put undiluted red paint on the tip of your brush and touch it to the petal. The water will carry the paint to all areas that are wet. Add a second dot of another shade of red, if desired.

, If desired, do tributary veins off the main one. Alternatively, paint the veins with a liner or small brush, or use a combination of both techniques., Darken the red by adding a touch of blue or green to it.

, Have some greens lean toward the yellow, and some toward the blue. For the veins, do as you did for the petals., Leaf shapes are good fillers within the flower arrangement. For the all over composition, if the base looks too simple, add twining ivy or holly.

, Wet the entire background, getting water carefully in around the flowers, using a soft wash brush. Make two juicy puddles on your palette of grey and tan. Just add water to the paint in the center of your palette and let the colors cancel one another out to make neutrals. Using a soft brush, paint grey on the top and tan for the table's surface.

Start by finding lace edged items.,
Set up a still life using a lace edged cloth prominently displayed.,
Sketch the still life in pencil.,
Take a look at and appreciate a few of the many possible edgings.,
Set up a palette of primary and secondary colors.,
Gather brushes, all purpose and watercolor types.,
Begin painting by indicating the shadows on the cloth or drape under the objects.,
Paint in whatever order pleases you.,
Doing lace is all about a technique called “negative painting.” This means you paint what isn’t there, the spaces around, rather than the filament or threads making up the lace.,
Start lace by painting the edging as it appears against the table.,
Try to train your eye to look beyond the stitches that make up the lace.,
Paint the objects by first giving them a base coat.,
Work all over the page.,
Check to see whether one side of each object is slightly darker in value to give the illusion of roundness.,
Mat, frame and hang your work to enjoy.









",How to Paint Lace in Watercolor," Look for examples of napkins, doilies, aprons, curtains or table decorations that have actual lace or crochet edging.;
, As the subject for the painting, use a vase, dish and/or flowers. Or, you could add a few pieces of fruit or colorful vegetables., Use 11” X 14” watercolor paper. Block in all the elements or objects, but for the lace, just indicate it as a strip along the border of the fabric. It will most likely have a fancy edge so make the outer edge scalloped or ornate., Crochet and lace have thousands of patterns of edging with varying degrees of showiness. Sketch trying to repeat the pattern as you go. Try to have it rise up and ripple in places., Place the watercolor, tube paints around the edges of the palette, but leave the center empty for mixing., Include pointed, round brushes of various sizes and a ½” flat., Mix a neutral gray and paint the shadows on the drape, including the lace. These are places where the cloth is bunched or slightly raised or under the items. Forming raised areas simply makes it more pleasing to the eye. The soft shadows suggest lines to direct the viewer’s eye through the painting. Let this dry and ignore this preliminary work as you begin to paint., There is no right or wrong way to begin. Either you first do the objects in the still life or tackle the more complex lace border. Some might even paint the background first., As you work, if you need it as a guide, draw greater detail on the lace. On close observation, you will see a pattern behind the lace, repeated shapes, circles, ovals, spaces between linked stitches., Defining the scalloped edge of the lace will give you parameters. The lace border or edging will emerge, almost magically, as you paint the surface it sits on.

, Leave the white paper representing the stitches and color in the negative shapes, or what lies behind the stitches. Use a neutral gray and a brush with a good point. Do the small dots and dashes around the treads that make up the lace. A strong lace pattern will emerge in a few minutes of painting. Establish a pattern and keep repeating it. Let it dry and move to the other part of the painting, the objects that comprise the still life., Whatever you have chosen to put in your painting, vases, flowers, etc., establish the body color of these objects. Allow to dry., Establishing and blocking in colors, you will avoid getting too detailed, too quickly. The lace edging will grab people’s attention and will be intricate. Keep that in mind as you paint the objects that make up the still life. When everything has been painted, let the piece dry and view it from a distance.

, If ornamentation on objects’ surfaces makes sense and follows the contour of the object, whatever its shape. If each item is “grounded” with a light, gray, transparent shadow under it. If you have put shadows on and beneath the lace in places, too. This makes it lie down flat against the table. It also provides contrast by making parts of it appear brighter and in sharper focus.,"

Take a good look at a poinsettia or another white flower to understand its design. 
,
Designate the flower heads with circles, drawn lightly in pencil on a piece of #140 pound watercolor paper, 11 x 14"" size.,
Wet the paper with a wash brush and leave it alone until the surface shine dulls slightly.,
Allow to dry.,
Draw the berries in the middle of the flower.,
Begin to paint the petals by running a line of any color, one that is already in use on your palette, around the edge of the petal.,
Create the leaves exactly as you did the petals, except this time, make them shades of green.,
Make some branches with the point of a brush to link the flower blossoms.,
Finish the piece, let it dry and stand back to see how it looks from a distance.",How to Paint White Poinsettias in Watercolor,", An uneven number is best and have some facing forward, depicted with circles and others pointing different directions, indicated with ovals.

, On the areas intended to be flowers, brush on very diluted, pastel reds, yellows and blues, or any other colors you wish. Don't stir, apply the colors and move rapidly to the leaf shapes. Paint very diluted blues and greens for leafs. Go to the edges and using the same colors as for the petals, paint abstract shapes around the flowers. All of these colors will merge and blend, but that is the idea. With the tip of a damp brush blend hard edges.

, The colors will dry lighter than when they are wet, but they should barely tint the paper.  Let it dry and do a detailed sketch of the flowers in pencil., Paint them yellow with touches of orange and red. To insure they remain bright, either mask them using masking fluid or plan to paint around them.

, Follow with a line of water on the inside edge to soften it. Do the center vein as a curved line with a fine brush and some of the tributary veins on some. It isn't necessary to put in every tiny vein., There will be many partial leafs between the flower heads and some will overlap., Keep this brown line irregular by holding your brush up onto the handle. Let the vine go through and around the flowers. Add little curvy lines coming off the branch for interest and to appear life-like. Do some pieces of pine if you wish. Start with a fine brush line and lightly make wispy pine needles coming off each side.

, Go back in and darken the areas under the berries to make the centers pop. If you used masking fluid, unmask with your finger.

Consider Aperture and magnification: the two most important qualities of binocular selection.,
Consider the weight.,
Consider the cost.,
Consider a monopod or tripod.",How to Select Astronomy Binoculars," Aperture refers to the diameter of the lenses. The larger the aperture, the more light the binoculars gather and the better you will be able to see faint objects. Magnification refers to how large the image appears and is limited by the aperture size. Be wary of binoculars that are advertised by magnification only. High magnification with a small aperture is nothing but bad marketing.


(Magnification)x(Aperture in millimeters) is how aperture and magnification are represented. For example, binoculars that are 15 x 70 have an aperture of 70 mm and magnify the image by 15 times. These are a great starting pair for astronomy binoculars.;
, Binoculars with large apertures are quite heavy. 20 x 80 binoculars may weigh over 5 pounds! While larger may seem better, if they are too large to use, they are no good.

, The price of binoculars does not increase proportionally to size. Larger binoculars become expensive quickly. You can get a good pair of beginner's binoculars for around 60-70 USD.

, With heavy binoculars with high magnification, the image will move around a lot if they are hand held. Binoculars can be mounted to a monopod or a tripod. This will steady the image. A monopod is nice because they are extremely portable, steady the image a bit and give your arms a break. If you want to use a mono- or tripod, make sure the binoculars have a sturdy attachment point.

"
"
Understand the numbers.,
Consider the lenses.,
Evaluate the eyepieces.,
Test the focusing ability.,
Look at the prism design.,
Decide how heavy a pair of binoculars you can handle.,
Consider waterproof versus water-resistant.,
Look at the manufacturer's reputation and guarantees.",How to Choose Binoculars," Binoculars are referred to with 2 numbers, such as 7 x 35 or 10 x 50. The number before the ""x"" is the magnification factor, or power; the 7 x 35 lenses will make objects appear 7 times closer, while the 10 x 50 lenses will make objects appear 10 times closer. The second number is the diameter of the main (objective) lenses in millimeters; 7 x 35 lenses are 35 millimeters (1.38 inches) in diameter, while 10 x 50 lenses are 50 millimeters (1.97 inches) in diameter. Dividing the second number by the first yields the exit pupil value, or the diameter of the light beam that reaches your eye in millimeters. (For both example lenses, 35 divided by 7 or 50 divided by 10, is 5 millimeters.)


The higher the magnification, the dimmer the image, and while the image you see will be larger, your field of view will narrow, and consequently, you'll find it harder to keep the image focused. If you choose binoculars with 10 x magnification or greater, get a pair with a tripod socket so you can mount and steady your binoculars when needed. If you need a wide field of view, choose a lower magnification.
The larger the objective lens, the more light it can gather, which is important in low-light activities such as astronomy or hunting at dawn or dusk. However, the larger the lenses are, the more the binoculars will weigh. Generally, most binoculars have objective lenses with a diameter of 30 to 50 millimeters (1.18 to 1.97 inches), with compact binoculars having lenses 25 millimeters (1 inch) and under and astronomical binoculars having lenses larger than 50 millimeters.
The larger the exit pupil, the more light that reaches your eyes. The human eye dilates from 2 to 7 millimeters, depending on how little light is available. Ideally, you should shoot for an exit pupil value that matches the width your eyes dilate to.;
, Most binoculars have glass lenses, which generally provide better image quality, but often cost more than plastic lenses. (However, a set of plastic lenses that provide the same image quality as a set of glass lenses will cost more.) Glass also partially reflects the light hitting it, but this can be compensated for with the right coating.


Lens coatings are described with the following codes: C means that only some surfaces have been coated with a single coating layer; FC means that all glass lens surfaces other have been coated; MC means that some surfaces have been coated with multiple layers; and FMC means that all glass lens surfaces have been coated with multiple layers. Multiple-layer coatings are generally superior to single coatings but add to the cost of the binoculars.
Plastic lenses, while generally of poorer image quality, are more rugged than glass lenses and should be considered for situations where durability is important, such as mountain climbing.

, The eyepiece lenses should rest a comfortable distance from your eyes, and even further if you wear glasses. This is called ""eye relief"" and normally ranges from 5 to 20 millimeters (0.2 to 0.98 inches). If you wear glasses, you'll need an eye relief of 14 to 15 millimeters (0.55 to 0.59 inches) or greater, as most eyeglasses rest from 9 to 13 millimeters (0.35 to 0.5 inches) from the eye.


Many binoculars include rubber eye cups around the eyepieces to help you seat the eyepieces over your eyes when using the binoculars. If you wear glasses, look for binoculars with eye cups that retract or flip out of the way.

, Look at how closely you can focus the binoculars in the store and measure the distance between them and the object you're looking at.


Binoculars focus in one of 2 ways: Most binoculars have a center-post mechanism, along with a diopter corrector to allow for one of your eyes being stronger or weaker than the other. Waterproof binoculars, however, usually have individual focusing for each lenses, with controls on each eyepiece.
Some binoculars are ""focus-free,"" with no ability to adjust the focus whatsoever. These binoculars can cause eyestrain if you attempt to focus on something closer than the pre-set distance.

, Most binoculars have their main lenses spaced wider than the eyepieces, thanks to the Porro prisms they use. This makes the binoculars larger but makes nearby objects appear more 3-dimensional. Binoculars that use roof prisms let the main lenses rest in line with the eyepieces, making the binoculars more compact but usually at the cost of image quality. However, roof prism binoculars can be made to deliver images of quality equal to Porro prism binoculars but at greater cost.


Less expensive binoculars use BK-7 prisms, which tend to square off one side of the image, while more expensive binoculars use BAK-4 prisms, which deliver more light and sharper, rounder images.

, As noted, high-magnification and large-lens binoculars weigh more than standard binoculars. You can compensate for the weight and stabilize the binoculars by mounting them on a tripod or with a strap that lets you carry them around your neck, but if you plan to travel long distances, you may want to settle for less powerful but lighter binoculars.

, If you don't plan on using your binoculars in bad weather or in conditions where they'll get wet very often, you can get by with water-resistant binoculars. If you plan to take them along whitewater rafting or skiing, get waterproof binoculars instead.

, Consider how long the manufacturer has been in business and what other optical products they make, if any, as well as how they'll handle matters if the binoculars get damaged.

Look at the first blooms of the season with a welcoming and curious eye.,
Pretend you are a landscape designer and let the dreams begin as you compose your garden in your mind.,
Begin a practice session by first drawing each flower in pencil on a pad of good drawing paper.,
Draw tulips as a U-shaped cup with a ragged top.,
Begin with two circles for daisies, sunflowers, bachelor buttons, chrysanthemum, dandelions, and the black eyed Susan.,
Look closely at the luscious blooms of the lilac and hydrangea because their large heads are made up of many small flowers clustered together, designating them as ""cluster"" blossoms.,
Don't fear the more complex trumpet shaped flowers such as daffodils or jonquils because when broken into simple shapes you'll see two distinct ones;  a cone or trumpet in the center and a circle at the base.,
Observe the single trumpet or cone flowers like the holly hock, lily, or amarylis.,
Shrink down those large trumpet shaped flowers and cluster them to get the delicate bluebell, Lily of the valley, crocus, or grape hyacinth.,
Look upward to the trees or sideways to the bushes to see flowering branches.,
Doing this research to break down each flower and practicing drawing them is time well spent and will make using these flowers in a painting easier.,
Begin your painting by letting whimsy rule the day.,
Obtain a pad of watercolor paper, 11"" X 14"" size #140 weight.,
Activate your paints, if they are the dry type, with a little water on each pad.,
Use other tools.,
Think of the delicate nature of your flowers as you begin to paint and dilute your colors to get the required transparency, using the mixing area of your palette.,
Group flower types.,
Vary your greens for leaves and vines by adding bits of yellow, blue, violet or even red to them as you work.,
Bring extra, unexpected life to your garden in the form of woodland visitors: butterflies, dragon flies, lady bugs, a rabbit, a toad, or a squirrel.,
Remember that pale blue will always resemble and make viewers think of the sky.,
When complete, allow the painting to dry thoroughly.",How to Paint Spring Flowers in Watercolor," Find photographs of your favorite flowers so you have lots of time to study their make-up, color, and special qualities. All the while, look past the obvious to see the flower's structure. This is an exercise in simplifying the flowers' forms to see them as lines (stems) and common shapes: circles, ovals, shields, daggers, etc.
;
, What all-over shape do you want the garden to have: curved symmetrical, random, or on levels? Will the taller flowers be off to one side or scattered throughout? Will the smaller ones be in rows? How will your choice of colors create drama? Would intricate flowers be highlighted next to simpler ones? Could a favorite object such as a statue be employed as a centerpiece or a focal point? Will flowering trees or branches from a shrub be visible at the edges of your picture's plane?

, Reduce the blossoms to simple geometric shapes and, for the moment, eliminate details and color. For example, a rose is basically round and the layers and rows of inner petals can be shown as a few, wiggly crescent-shaped lines converging at the center.


, The broad petals can be depicted with long curved lines from top to bottom. Use a double line whether the stem is thick, or spindly to allow room to paint it. The tulip's spiked leaves begin at the base of the stem and flare slightly at the top.


, They are called a ""radial"" type of flower because they are round and petals radiate out from the center.



, Start by outlining the basic shape of the blossom, round for hydrangeas and elongated for lilacs.  Within that shape, make many smaller circles for individual flowers. Divide each tiny flower into small petals and at the center of each flower make another small circle which can later be colored to define it.



, When divided into sections, this outer circle becomes the petals. It is a good idea to make the correct number of petals for any given flower, so check references. Note how some petals curl backward.


, The edges of the flaring trumpet can be curved or ruffled. Deep inside the center of the trumpet are long, thin strands which often release specks of pollen onto the petals.



, Tiny flowers and statice or baby's breath, make nice fillers for your design.

, Dogwood, apple, and cherry blossoms are delicate, round flowers growing from a small stem off a branch. The dogwood has four petals with an indentation at the top center. Cherry blossoms are pale pink and apple blossoms white.




, Try not to be obsessive about perfection, though. Save your materials by starting an Art File and use them for future reference., You will be creating an imaginary garden, by celebrating the flowers' shapes and colors regardless of whether it realistically makes a whole lot of sense. This is called employing ""artistic license"" and following the laws of design rather than the bounds of nature. This satisfying painting lets you forget about mulching, hoeing and weeding because it is a work of art, not of nature., Use an ordinary pencil to lightly sketch your flowers according to what appeals to you and what looks good on paper. Compose freely and creatively. For added interest, you might put some of the flowers in pots, ornamental planters, or hanging baskets. Add height using a trellis or strings to support climbing varieties of flower., Or squeeze tube paints around the edge of your palette, keeping the center clean for mixing your colors. Take whatever colors you think you'll need, but always put the primary and secondary colors out, as well as brown. Select small and medium round brushes and a 1/2"" flat. Add paper napkins or sheets from a roll of paper towels and a container of water.

, Watercolor pencils and water soluble crayons to cover larger areas are a joy to work with. Possibly, use a combination of watercolor pencils, water soluble crayons, and watercolor paints. With the dry media, just draw normally and wet the area with a brush and clear water to, magically, turn it into paint.

, There is no right or wrong place to start, so just jump in.  , Pencil in a shape for a particular flower, then fill the whole shape with that flower. Move to another shape and fill it with a different flower. Use different shaped flowers and contrasting colors for richness and to carry the viewer's eye throughout the painting., Work those greens by making the leaves and stems different shapes and colors.

, Add a touch of drama with a cat and some birds. You might incorporate a water feature and lily pads with waterlilies and a lazy frog sunning himself., Yellow, exemplifies sunshine. Multi-colors look like sunrise or sunset. Just try to keep the background colors sheer and vibrant. Wipe with a tissue or dab out areas for fluffy clouds, if you wish.


,  Set it up and study it to see what areas need more ""oomph"". Then, return to the painting and add notes of slightly deeper values or shades of the same or complementary colors to the parts where needed. This is also the time to add another sheer layer of color in places that dried lighter than you'd hoped.

Familiarize yourself with the microscope.,
Turn the microscope on.,
Inspect the head.,
Study the arm.,
Examine the base.,
Learn about light sources.,
Prepare your slide.,
Make sure that the iris diaphragm is open.,
Arrange the revolving nose piece and knobs.,
Focus the microscope.,
Magnify the image.,
Put the microscope away.",How to Use a Compound Microscope," Examine all the parts, and learn their name and function. If you are in a class, the instructor should review this with the class. If you are learning how to use a compound microscope on your own, you may have a diagram that came with your microscope which provides this information.Your microscope should be placed on a clean, level surface near an electrical outlet.
Always carry your microscope with two hands. Hold the arm with one hand, the other hand used for support under the base.;
, This will require plugging it into an appropriate outlet. The switch is usually located on the microscope's base.The electricity is needed for the illumination components found in a compound microscope.
Make sure your power source is appropriate for your microscope. Commonly, compound microscopes require a 120-V power source.

, The head holds the optical elements, which include the eyepiece and eyepiece tube, the nose piece, and the objective lenses. It is also known as the body of the microscope.The eyepiece, or ocular, is what you look through to see the object beneath the microscope.
The eyepiece tube holds the eyepieces in place.
The nosepiece holds the objective lenses.
The objective lenses are the main lenses of the compound microscope. There can be 3, 4 or 5 lenses on a compound microscope, depending on its level of complexity.

, The arm connects the head to the base. There are no lenses found on the microscope's arm.When carrying a compound microscope, hold the microscope at the arm and the base.
The arm provides support for the microscope's head.

, The base holds up the microscope and provides the stage onto which samples are placed. The base also contains the focusing knobs (both fine and coarse).The focusing knobs may be either separate or coaxial (meaning the course focusing knob is found on the same axis as the fine focusing knob.)
The stage is where the slide holding the specimen will be placed. A mechanical stage can be used when working with higher magnifications.
Stage clips should be used when stages are adjusted manually.

, The compound microscope provides its own light sources for optimal viewing. These light sources are found in the base of the microscope.Light enters the stage through the aperture, which is a hole through which the base light reaches the slide.
The illuminator provides light for the microscope. Typically, low-wattage halogen bulbs are used. Lighting is continuous and variable.
A condenser collects and focuses the light from the illuminator. It's located beneath the stage, often together with the iris diaphragm.
The condenser focus knob moves the condenser up and down to adjust the light.
The iris diaphragm is located below the stage. Working together with the condenser, the iris diaphragm controls the focus and quantity of light provided to the specimen.

, A slide should always be prepared with a cover slop or cover glass to protect the specimen you're viewing with the microscope. This will also protect the lens of your microscope from anything that might press against it.Position your sample between 2 pieces of glass to make a slide.
Place the slide on the center of the stage over the glass hole.
Move the 2 stage clips over the sides of the slide to secure it into place.

, This is usually found just under the stage.You want to have the best amount of light to reach the slide and the lenses.The iris diaphragm shouldn't be used to control the light, but to optimize the level of contrast and resolution for clearer viewing.
This is generally used at lowest magnification.

, Start with the lowest level of magnification. This will allow you to select the part of the specimen that offers the most interest. Once you've located this, you may increase the magnification so as to better view this part.Turn the nose piece turret until the shortest lens (4x) is above your sample. It should click and feel rigid when it is in place. The shortest objective lens is the least powerful and is the easiest level to begin when magnifying an object.
Twist the coarse focus knob (the large one) on the side of the base so the stage moves upward toward the short objective lens. Perform this without looking into the eyepiece. It's important to make sure the slide does not touch the lens. Stop twisting the coarse knob just before the slide contacts the lens.

, Looking through the eyepiece, arrange the illuminator and the diaphragm to reach the most comfortable level of light. Move the specimen slide so that the image is in the center of your view.Arrange the illuminator until you've arrived at a comfortable level of light. The brighter the illuminator shines, the better you will be able to see your specimen.
Twist the coarse focus knob the opposite way as you had before, so the stage moves away from the lens. Do this slowly until the sample begins to focus.

, Use the course focus knob to get the specimen in view, and the fine focus knob to bring the adjusted slide into focus. You may need to reposition your slide as you magnify.When using a compound microscope, the correct viewing technique is to keep both eyes open. One eye should look through the eyepiece, the other looking outside the microscope.
When the 10x lens is being used to magnify the image, it may help to lower the amount of light for better clarity.
Readjust your illuminator and iris diaphragm as needed.
Switch lenses by rotating the nose piece turret to a longer lens.
Perform necessary focusing adaptations.
Once you've found a clear image, change to a higher power objective lens. This should be a simpler process, requiring only minimal use of the focusing adjustment.
If you can't focus on your specimen, repeat the steps suggested above.

, Dust can cause great damage to a compound microscope. It can scratch delicate lenses, clog adjustments, and clutter the images visible through your eyepiece.Always turn off the power when you're finished using your microscope.
Lower the stage, remove your specimen and cover the equipment with a dust-repellent cover.
Avoid touching any lens or glass with your fingers.
Always carry the microscope carefully with both hands.

Obtain an 11"" X 14"" pad of 140# cold press watercolor paper from an art and craft store.,
Use tube paints.,
Select a round #10 brush that comes to a perfect point.,
Fill a large container with water.  ,Have tissues, sheets of paper towel and paper napkins at hand and have an old piece of terrycloth towel at hand to hold your brushes.,
Dive into the painting.,
Begin painting by touching the tip of your damp brush into a color for the tulip and just touch the tip of your paint loaded brush to the edge of your wet blossom.,
Repeat, if you wish, with the same or a different color or switch colors.,
Move along to the stem.,
To create a ragged edge on the flower petal, drop in some clean water from your brush held slightly above the paper.,
Expect excess water to pool at the edges of the wet shape, in this case a tulip head.,
Watch for accidental effects to happen as the water, paint and humidity begin to work on your color application and leave them.,Repeat with another flower head and stem until you have an uneven number of flowers.,
Do leafs by starting from the bottom of the page and, using only clear water, making a slightly curved stroke that ends in a clean point to indicate the long, dagger shape of a leaf.,
Analyze your work before putting in a background color.",How to Paint Glowing Tulips in Watercolor,"  A sheet is heavy and won't buckle, so there is no need to mount it to a support board. Just leave it attached to the pad and the cardboard backing will act as a support.  You will want to be able to pick up the paper and tilt it to help the colors mingle.;
,  They are the consistency of toothpaste.  For this technique you will be using them almost as they come from the tube since the water which will dilute them will be already on your paper. Set up your palette with both primary and secondary colors: red, yellow, orange, blue green and violet. Put out a spot of brown, but keep it well away from the other colors. Put pigments around the edge of your palette, or in the designated areas on the palette., When bent, the hairs will spring back to their original shape.  ,,, Tulips are a simple, cup shape, so there is no need to begin with a drawing.  Wet your brush and with the paper flat and using a generous amount of water, paint a tulip head, in plain water, on your paper.  Make a ""U"" shape and fill it in. It is fine to skip little spots, leaving bits of dry paper. Make the tulip approximately life size. Since wet areas will readily accept the moist color and dry paper will resist it, use care to keep surrounding areas dry. Drop in enough water so it almost rises off the paper's surface.

,  There ought to be enough water to carry the color over the wet blossom. Random, ragged color will begin to fill the blossom. Let the water work for you and help it as little as possible., As the blossom begins to dry slightly, pick up the paper and tilt it slightly to move the water and mix the colors. If it isn't moving, drop in a little more water. Again, set the paper flat., Paint a line for the stem of clear water. If you touch the wet blossom with even the tip of your brush, you will create a water ""bridge"" and the color from the blossom will gush into the stem. Ignore it and touch bits of green paint from the tip of your brush, or let the green mix directly on the paper by first introducing yellow and then, adding blue. Let the water will mix the colors. If necessary, drop in a tad more water if it isn't moving as you'd hoped., This will make a ""blossom,"" ""water spot"" or ""back run"" and will create something like a ragged petal edge.

, If things get out of control, use a ""thirsty brush"" as a mop to siphon off excess water. Try to avoid dabbing with paper and interfering with the things that are happening with the water, paint and process of drying., They are one of the hallmarks of watercolor paintings. The paint should look wet even when dry.


The glow will appear as the water sinks into your paper and begins to dry, if you have used enough water and not manipulated the area with strokes or dabbing. The glow will get stronger as the paper dries, and it does take a long time to become thoroughly dry. If possible, avoid using a hairdryer in favor of letting nature take its course.

,, Touch in bits of yellow, blue and green to make the leafs. Try adding just a small spot of brown to mix with and enrich the greens.

, If you decide you want a background, randomly wet the sky with a soft wash brush filled with clear water. Add yellows, blues, pink, lavender, or any color you wish to one wet edge and let the water carry the color over the background.

Set out a full palette of primary and secondary tube watercolor paints.,
Get a water vessel.,
Do an abstract painting.,
Try doing a painting called, “Summery Geraniums.”  Painting on saturated paper much like painting on super-soaked paper.,
Try the simple “Geraniums in Distressed Pots”  It employs a resist technique using wax crayons.,
Put the viewer's focus away from the flowers.,
Play with focus in “Flowers and Leaves In and Out of Focus”.,
Keep it “Childish and Simple.” This is wet color applied to wet paper in places and wet color applied to dry paper in places.,
Let a wet water spot create a flower.,
Try showing many views of the same geranium.",How to Paint Geraniums in Watercolor," Bring the small potted flowers indoors and set them in view on your work table. Really look at them, from all angle, and in different types of light. The are comprised of two extreme elements; fat balls of flowers and round leaves connected by thin stems which go off in all directions, sometimes crossing each other. The lines made by these stems give a humorous aspect to the plant in that they shoot off at will, paying no mind to what an elegant, upstanding, well behaved flower ought to do.
, Unless instructed otherwise, leave the pages connected to the pad and the cardboard back will act as a support board for your work.,,  Keep the colors at the edges of your palette to allow room for mixing in the middle.,  You’ll also need an aluminum disposable pan or plastic storage box.  This should be large enough to fill half way with water to soak your paper for wet-into-wet painting.  Assemble paper towels or an old terry towel, and tissues to soak up runs.  Sharpen your #2 yellow pencil and put an eraser cap on it.  Get, also, a pink eraser., Doing an abstract painting is fun.  You might title this work, “Geraniums in my Sleep.”  In it, you will be responding to the colors you see before you, eliminating all details.  If you look at your subject and squint, what do you see?  Bright red balls on spindly stems, grounded by green, round leaves.  Remove paper from the pad.  Immerse your watercolor paper in clear, cold water for a few minutes to thoroughly saturate it.  Pull it out of the water, give it a shake and set it on towels to begin to dry.  


Avoid dabbing or helping it dry, just let the air do its job.  When the surface of the paper starts to go dull, it’s time to paint. Note you will paint directly, no preliminary drawing.
Charge a large brush with barely diluted pasty paint.  Add only a small amount of water to make the paint the consistency of toothpaste.  The water is already on the paper.  Pretend you are communicating only the most elemental aspects of this flower.  Purposely try to make shapes that are telling, but without details.  The paint will fuzz out from where you put it.  
Wait a little longer to start painting if your colors dissipate too much. Think of your work as a jig-saw puzzle and work in general shapes and areas.  Fill in missing areas between your initial spots of color with other random colors.  Quit sooner than later and allow to air dry.  It will not only glow, it will have energy and may or may not resemble the geranium.  It will say things about the subject in a primal way.

,  Follow the same procedure as for the abstract work, remove the paper and put it to soak, only allow the paper to dry much longer before painting on it.  The paint you apply will stay where you put it.  Since it won’t move and fuzz as much you can put in much more detail. You will also do a preliminary drawing to guide your strokes.


In this piece, you will be attempting to paint what you see before you, trying to capture its shape and details.  Go slower and think about where you are putting the colors.  Again, use rich colors, barely diluted because there is so much water in the paper.  Thinner paints will dissipate and details will be lost.

,  Sketch a row of geraniums in terracotta pots.  Give the pots some texture using wax crayons.  Press hard to get a lot of wax on the pots and don’t over think it.  Just scribble.  The pots will be a featured element of the painting because you are giving them this interesting texture.   


Using a loaded brush, wet the paper with water.  Wait a minute or two before you begin to paint.  Paint the red circles for the blossoms while the paper is still quite wet to give them the opportunity to fuzz and spread.  Immediately, accent the wet blossoms with spots of orange.  Move to the leaves and paint them green.  Do the pots in a red-brown color to resemble the most basic of garden pots.  The wax will cause the paint to separate and resist the color.

, In “Leaves and Buds Predominant,” the geranium’s leaves and the buds are the primary elements. Sketch out the row of flowers at the top third of the page and leaves in the bottom third.  Join the two with stems going in various directions, even overlapping.  As you paint, think of how to vary the greens of the leaves and the reds of the flowers.  Work spots of even paler body color behind the row of geraniums and when dry, those pale spots will give depth by suggesting flowers in the background.  Spend some time on the buds and make them very visible hanging off and below the blossoms.  

, This shows how depth can be achieved by keeping some parts of the painting in sharp focus and allowing other parts to be vague.  This technique is used on both the blossoms and the leaves.  The colors are also fainter and many of the edges are blurred into the background creating what is called “lost edges.”  Texture is used on the leaves for interest and the centers of the flowers are carefully painted and accented in black. Tackle a wet-into-wet and wet on dry paper.  

,  Begin with a light sketch in pencil on your paper, indicating the main ball shapes, stems and circles for leaves.  You can see by the amount of blurring which areas were painted on wet paper.

, This technique is fun and easy. On your paper, sketch a number of abstract circles for geranium blossoms. Keep the paper flat and dry, but generously wet the circles. Add enough water for it to rise above the paper's surface. Let it soak a minute or two. Drop in color from the tip of your brush and let them merge at will. Leave them completely alone to dry naturally. This will take some time, but resist the urge to help things along. The paint will be pulled to become outlines for the flower shapes. Now is the time to paint, by clarifying the flower's mass into separate, little blossoms with a small, pointed brush. Paint the stems, leaves as you wish, using the wet-into-dry method, or a combination of that and wet-into-wet. However you do it, it is sure to shine and show off the geranium in a lovely way.,  “Many Views, One Geranium” on one page allows you to try various colors for the flowers, and other

Maintain your paintbooth.",How to Create a Paint Booth in Your Garage," If desired, adjust the paint booth's size according to your needs. An 8-foot (2.43m) wide paint booth is suitable for a two-car garage or a large patio. For more narrow booths, adjust the length of the three 8-foot pipes and the top-middle two pipes.

, If you're using a saw to make the cut, account for an additional 1/16 or 1/32 of an inch (1.6 or .8 mm). This extra allotment is to accommodate for the blade's thickness (called the ""kerf"") and any un-level cuts made that need to be sanded down.

Most 10-foot (3.05 m) sections of PVC pipe purchased will actually be slightly longer than advertised. This gives contractors or anyone working with the PVC pipe a little leeway for making cuts. It is not uncommon to have 10-foot-2-inch (3.1m) pipes sold as 10-foot (3.05m) pipes.
For the example design, the sections you will need are (refer to the 'Tips' section for a chart of pipe cuts):

three 8’ sections (2.43m)
one 5’11” 3/4 section (1.82m)
two 4’ sections (1.22m)
two 3’11” 7/8 sections (1.22m)
six 3’ sections (91cm)
two 2’7” 3/4 sections (80.6cm)
two 26” 3/8 sections (67cm)
two 20” sections (50.8cm)
eight 2” 1/2 sections (6.35-cm)



,


Secure each pipe before cutting. Use a small workbench (traditional definition) with two planks that act as a vise, or a table-mounted vise.







Cut the pipes with a PVC saw or clamp-style pipe cutter. A bladed cutter will yield clean cuts but may be slower than cutting with a PVC saw. The saw will leave one smooth side and one rough side of the PVC pipe. Don't forget to cut the eight 2.5"" connecting pipes to join pairs of connectors.







Clean up any uneven ends and PVC shag with a blade and/or a sanding block.







, At this point, ensure that the four bottom pipes (the booth's legs) are reasonably flat and level. Since there are six 3-foot (91-cm) sections, choose four of these pipes with the most level ends. Set these aside for the bottom pipes.


As an alternative, use an extra four 'T' connectors to serve as feet. When the paint booth is complete, it will be heavy enough to stay in place.

, During assembly, seeking another's help is advisable. One person is capable of assembling the structure, but two people working together will result in a quicker, easier, and safer assembly. Be sure to plan out floor space to accommodate the booth. Secure each pipe by fully inserting it into the PVC joint. (It is extremely difficult to break 2.25"" PVC pipe or joints with bare hands, so apply plenty of pressure to ensure a tight fit.)


Begin assembling the sides.






Next, assemble the top-middle two pipes with the 'T' connector and down-pipe.







Last, connect all of the horizontal pipes to the two sides panels. When working with the first fully assembled sides panel, lay it flat to insert the horizontal pipes that make up the booth's ceiling and rear side. When all of the horizontal pipes are installed, gently lean it over on its top, leaving the PVC joints to support most of the structure's weight.







, The final assembly of this booth should be roomy enough to walk inside for shorter people. (Taller people may need to bend down a bit.) At this point, the booth is still movable, but only by alternating the movement between one or two legs at a time. Position the booth to allow for free walking access around all sides. Pull down a little on each corner to ensure that the structure is stable and secure.
, Lay plastic over enclosure so that the 25-foot (7.62-m) length is covering the longest dimension, 8-foot (2.44-m) width plus 6-foot (1.83-m) side walls. There will be leftover plastic that you can cut and use later as a strip below the fan. Leave enough plastic around the front of the booth to fold over and leave dangling to catch excess overspray (6 in / 15.24 cm should be fine). Wrap the remaining plastic over the rear of the paint booth to cover the rear. Leave room to add your fan(s). This is where the quick grip clamps are useful in holding the plastic in place. The plastic's weight should be enough to keep it from moving, but winds will easily push it off until the booth is complete.


Apply duct tape while cutting the plastic sheeting, sealing off the sides of the enclosure. If your paint booth is installed in a windy area, make sure the plastic is tight against the PVC pipe. Use clamps to hold the plastic in place while you measure, cut, and place the duct tape.

, The 4-foot (1.22-m) wide cloth should be positioned so that the corners rest under each leg of the paintbooth. Make sure it is flat, and push out any creases or unevenness. Then lift each of the paintbooth's legs, one at a time, to push the drop cloth edges under each leg. If the cloth doesn't fit right, or it doesn't line-up under the paintbooth's legs, step back and visually inspect the legs. Each leg should be near-perpendicular to the ground (at a 90 degree angle).


Secure the plastic sheeting to corners, drop cloth, and the assembly's legs. Start on one side, attaching the plastic to the drop cloth with the duct tape.

, Using a small stepladder, cardboard boxes, or other temporary structure, place the box fan high enough to at least clear the middle PVC pipe of your paintbooth. Position the structure outside of the booth. If necessary because of limited space, place the stepladder so that it is approximately an inch from the rear, middle PVC pipe. This will place the legs of the ladder inside the booth, but they will easily be covered plastic. If you have the room, placing the ladder further away from the paintbooth will create more of a 'funnel' effect, with better angles for deflecting paint dust.
, The suction of a box fan on high speed is enough to hold a furnace filter in place.

You can attach it either directly to the fan or taped to the plastic surrounding the fan.






, Cut hangers to hang objects before painting. Locate a place to hang the painted objects if you plan to paint multiple items at one time. Also, keep a spray bottle full of water nearby to occasionally mist the inside of the booth. This will help prevent the paint dust from bouncing off the walls and drifting outside of the booth.
, Cleaning up overspray and paint dust is not an easy task, but cleaning it up at regular intervals will ease the overall task. Clean off overspray on PVC pipe with the appropriate paint solvent for the paint you've used. Check the effects of the paint solvent on scrap PVC pipe (leftover sections) before using it on your paintbooth. Clean off overspray before disassembling your paintbooth for storage, as removing fresh paint is easier than removing cured paint. Discard the plastic and floor mat when storing your paintbooth. The plastic sheeting will shed flakes of paints when it flexes, and most painting mats are intended for one use only; they can hold only so much paint dust before they become ineffective.

When storing your paintbooth by disconnecting pipes, it may be helpful to mark individual pieces with their assembled locations. Disassemble as little as possible to fit in your storage space. If you have room, leave the sides assembled, but disconnect the horizontal pipes and middle down-pipe.

Turn on the light.,
Use the lowest magnification.,
Put the slide in place.",How to Have Better Focus on the Microscope1," The first step in using your microscope is turning on the light. You must be sure that the microscope is plugged in and turned on. A light will appear from below the stage of the microscope.The stage is the flat, plate-like surface on the microscope. It holds the slides that you will be observing.;
, Adjust the nosepiece so that the lowest magnification is in place. This might say 4X or 10X depending on the type of microscope that you are using. It is very important to start with the lowest magnification first in order to achieve the best focus on a microscope.The nosepiece is the rotating portion of the microscope above the stage. It will have three or four objective lenses attached to it.
The objective lenses are the magnifiers that are attached to the nosepiece. They will be labeled with their magnification level, which is typically 4X, 10X, 40X, and 100X. They will also be color coded for your convenience.

, You will place the slide below the objective on the stage of the microscope. Be sure to center the object you want to magnify directly under the objective. Use the stage clips to hold the slide in place.Be sure that the slide is about ¼” away from the objective. To adjust the distance, move the stage up or down.

"
"
Adjust the coarse focus knob.,
Adjust the fine focus knob.,
Adjust the stage.",How to Have Better Focus on the Microscope2," Begin to focus on the object by adjusting the coarse focus knob. This will be the larger of the two knobs on the side of the microscope. Rotate the knob clockwise and counterclockwise until you see the best possible picture through the eyepiece.Adjusting the coarse focus knob may not give you optimum clarity. The coarse focus knob is meant to bring the object mostly into focus so that the fine focus knob can be effective.

, After you have adjusted the coarse focus knob, you can fine tune your focus by adjusting the fine focus knob. This will be the smaller of the two knobs on the side of the microscope. Just as you did with the coarse focus knob, turn this knob clockwise and counterclockwise until you see the best picture in the eyepiece., You can adjust the stage up and down as well as left and right. Adjusting the stage up and down will bring the object closer or further away. Adjust it left to right if the object that you are viewing is not centered under the objective.When adjusting the stage, be sure not to allow the objective lens to touch the slide.

"
"
Move up one magnification.,
Adjust your focus.,
Repeat the magnification process.",How to Have Better Focus on the Microscope3," Once you have focused the best picture of the object that you are viewing, you can now increase your magnification. To increase the magnification, turn the nosepiece one click clockwise. The next objective lens will now be pointing towards the slide., Focus the microscope in the same way that you did with the lower magnification. First, use the coarse focus knob. Next, use the fine focus knob. Last, adjust the stage.Focus each objective lens before moving to the next magnification. If you skip objective lenses, you will not achieve the best focus possible.

, If you need more magnification, you can repeat the process again with the next one or two magnifications. Remember to focus each objective lens before moving on to the next objective lense.

Optional: a stick of sanguine (rust colored) Conte crayon, a medium gray pastel stick, a charcoal pencil, a travel set of watercolors, and a brush. Also, a pencil case to carry your supplies.;
, Find a place to settle yourself. Become a “fly on the wall,” perhaps sheltered from others so you will not be disturbed as you think and work. Engage all your senses and open yourself, let things come to you.

, Lose the fear of a blank page by describing the scene in words, record your impressions. You could list the specifics of your situation at that moment; your location, weather, wind, temperature, etc. Just start making marks on the paper. Whatever it takes to help you open the eye to hand connection and get those lines flowing., The world abounds with eye catching things. Once you begin this activity, you will be inundated with material worth documenting on paper. Just the process of singling out an image and recording it brings it to life.

, Trees, tree tops, branch patterns, tree trunks with differing bark, how trees are connected to the ground, etc. The sky, clouds, layers of color or shades of value from white to grays, to black. Sturdy weeds, seed pods, grasses, tiny flowering plants, rocks, pebbles, etc. Flowers, shrubs, wild flowers, planted flowers in all stages of growth.

, Cast off paper, bits of thrown away junk on the ground. Park benches, seats, boats, buildings, cars, bikes, walkways, bridges, fences, walls, etc. are rich material.

, By working in a series, you might explore the facets of a single thing, for example your morning coffee accouterments and routine. You might want to celebrate a particular food or fruit. You can make a visual collection of random images. Open yourself go with it.



When stumped begin with a single thing, for example, a clump of weeds or dog passing by. Then work out in all directions from that central figure until you come to the edge of your picture plane or paper.







, This gives you parameters and provides a frame for your sketch. Vary formats, work horizontally vertically, square, etc. If desired, these can later be transferred to a “scrapbook” or “photo album,” even a page that you paste into a colorful collage.

, Divide what you see into three or four basic geometric shapes, like a puzzle within your picture plane. Try making initial lines touch two or more edges of you paper.

, Repeating one shape to create a pattern results in texture. Push it. If the texture is subtle, play it up to make it more dramatic., No need to draw exactly what is in front of you, shift things to suit yourself. It’s all about the art work, designing a page, not necessarily capturing reality., Use the sharp point with everything from light pressure to heavy pressure. Tip the pencil to the side and rock it as you sketch. Draw lines that go from thin to fat. This is called a weighted line and can quickly depict the volume of an object, such as a tree trunk or rock.

, Turn in on its side and rub an area of your sketch. Show where the light is strong on the object as the white of the paper, to where it is in shadow. Shade your textural areas to make them appear almost three dimensional., Or not. If you desire a less smooth transition from one area of shading to another, leave the pencil marks alone., This is simply doing a series of lines in one direction and then repeating them in the opposite direction., If you want more detail, put it in. You can manipulate your drawings, taking them from abstract to realistic. Drawings comprised of lines that are rough and retain the a gestural quality to those that are delicate and refined, each has its own beauty. Retain and celebrate examples of each.,, The possibilities are endless.

, Most have a thumb hole and are light weight. Your palette and paints are designed for working on the fly and quickly become an extension of your non-dominant hand., It doesn't have to be much, but change it often, when it gets dirty. Fill a discarded cup half way from your water bottle for drinking.

,, Paint within the lines or more abstractly. Paint only what is most important and leave the rest black and white lines. Paint softly or use harsh shapes and colors.

, Try painting directly without sketching first. Explore the unlimited possibilities.

, It is there when you need it and can be called upon in times of need. Its value grows with use and familiarity. It helps pass the time, even easing you through difficult events. Keeping sketches is a gift you give yourself.

Decide on a subject for your painting.,
Pick good quality paper.,
Draw a 2 X 3 inch or a 2 ½ X 3 ½  inch rectangle in pencil on it, leaving the small rectangle on the paper for easy handling.,
Purchase a set of watercolors.,
Plan your design.,
Do your thumbnail sketches on a page with lots of white paper around them.,
Color the thumbnails if you wish.

Keep thumbnails very simple if you desire.,
Sketch out your design in pencil.,
Analyze the possibilities of each before settling on one of your sketches to paint.,Sketch your idea onto the watercolor paper lightly in pencil.,
Activate your paints.,
Work as you would with a normal sized watercolor.,
Return to the piece and refine it.,
Place your finished work in a purchased mat and frame.,
Be inspired to do more.,
Think of unifying the small paintings by style, subject or color.,
Sign your work, but meet the challenge of making your signature readable without overtaking the composition.",How to Paint Fine Art Miniatures in Watercolor,"  Almost any subject that is done large scale will lend itself to miniature painting.   Portraits, animals, flowers, birds, fruits and vegetables, historical subjects, seascapes and almost anything imaginable makes a good subject.;
,  Paper without a great deal of surface texture works best.  Use a sheet from a pad of #140 cold pressed watercolor paper.  Or, buy a large sheet of hot press, but you will only be using a tiny part of it.  Practice on both types as they accept paint differently and need some practice to do confidently.,  You can cut it out when it is completed.,  You’ll want a full range of basic colors.  For brushes, you will need small but springy ones intended for watercolor.  Get rounded and flat ones.  Add a water container, tissues, and a board to support your work, or just keep the page attached to the cardboard backing of a pad.

,  Try to get a strong composition and keep details and surface texture to a minimum.  Try out ideas by doing a page of “thumbnail sketches.”  This is a good way to test ideas.

,  Draw 2 X 3 inch vertical and horizontal rectangles on a sketchbook page or on a piece of computer printer paper.  Avoid having them touch the paper’s margins.  This gives you flexibility in adding or changing the dimensions and focus of your design.  

,, Dynamic and to the point is good sometimes.

,  Shade it with the side of your pencil to create a “value plan.”  This shows how the colors will be distributed in the final piece, but, at this point, color is represented by a range of gray shades going from white to black with a few steps in between. ,  Begin by choosing a less complex subject that you are familiar with.

,,  Get comfortable and go to work.  Be warned that, depending on the complexity of the drawing, the small size of these paintings is no shortcut to the time it takes to painting one.  In most cases, they take almost as long to do as a larger piece. 

,  A good method is to establish your design and color pattern by first doing an under layer of light washes of color. Try not to get your paper too wet in order to keep the accuracy of your strokes. Work all over and allow this first layer to dry.  ,  Do accents using richer colors.  Allow it to dry thoroughly, study it, and further tweak it, if necessary.

,  Hang it on a wall, or put it on a tiny easel and place it on a shelf or table.

,  This one small, lonely piece will be dwarfed by a big wall. Work toward the goal of doing enough tiny paintings to create a grouping on your wall.,  Or, just hang them randomly according to your mood and taste.  Take pride in displaying your work.  

,  A fine line Sharpie or a very small pointed brush will work to do your signature. "

,  Use your pencil, but hold it loosely near the top, rather than close to the lead, as you would to write.  Start with a lightly curved line for the spine.  Cross it almost at the top for shoulders, a few inches lower for the waistline and lower again for the hip line or pelvis.  This establishes the body's central mass.

,  Remember to bend the arms at the elbow and wrist. ,  Allow for the neck. Drop lines off the two sides of the hip line for legs.  Do them in three parts, just as you did the arms.  Bending legs at the hips, knees and ankles gives movement to the figure.,,  Paint directly over the pencil lines. ,  Keep it wider at the shoulders and tapered slightly at the hips. 

,, Add small triangles for feet and hands.  You will now have the shape of a person.  Let this dry thoroughly.

,  Paint right over the flesh-colored body, keeping your watercolor dense enough to let the colors shine, but still transparent. 

,  When the under layer is dry add more details up to three new layers.  Don't forget hair and facial features.

,  Bear in mind that people come in all shapes and sizes.  Use your photo references as a guide only, don't try for a realistic image. Also, try doing the stick figure in diluted paint with a small brush.

Check the surface of the slide for abrasive substances.,
Remove debris if present.,
Wipe the slide with a microfiber cloth.,
Clean the surface with an antistatic cloth.,
Try a liquid film cleaner.",How to Clean 35mm Slides1," No matter what you use to clean your 35mm slides, it’s important that the surface of the slide is free of sand or other grit. If the surface of the slide has abrasive substances on it, they will just get rubbed across the surface when you clean, no matter what sort of cloth or cleaning agent you use., If dirt or sand is present on the slide, turn it upside down so it falls off. If necessary, give the edge of the slide a few gentle taps to get the object to fall off. If a foreign object remains attached to the slides, use a bulb blower or compressed air to get it off the slide.The compressed air should be free of moisture and rated at 60 PSI or below. You could also turn your blow dryer to the cold air setting and use it to blow debris from your 35mm slides.In rare cases where the debris coating the slide is particularly tenacious, use a soft, clean brush (a paintbrush, for instance) to dust the surface., A microfiber cloth is a specially designed fabric made of synthetic polymers. The fibers in microfiber cloth are woven more closely together than those in regular cotton cloths, making the cloth more effective. To wipe the slide with the microfiber cloth, place it over the slide, then gently move the cloth about the surface of the slide in a circular motion., Antistatic cloths are actually just a variation of microfiber cloths. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, though, they are designed with conductive fibers that dissipate static charges. Apply the cloth to the slide and gently move it about in a circular motion., Liquid film cleaner is the least-recommended way to clean 35mm slides. There are a wide variety of liquid film cleaners available. Each has a unique set of instructions. Consult manufacturer instructions before using a liquid film cleaner. Generally, however, you’ll dab a clean cotton cloth with a bit of the liquid film cleaner, then wipe the slide clean.After using the liquid film cleaner, you might need to blow the slide off using compressed photographic gas.
Some liquid film cleaners dry instantly, while others need to be wiped away.
Never use a water-based cleaner or water to clean your 35mm slides.

Finished.

",How to Paint Fall Trees1," Acrylics are easy to maneuver, thick enough to stay where you put them, and they come in a variety of colors to create your fall tree.;
, Alternatively, you can get a thick brush, which has a wider coverage of your canvas overall. It's personal preference.

, This is the best type of material to spread your paint onto, and it will provide a neat texture for your painting. The texture should resemble the feel of crisp dying leaves.

, Start at the top, going down until you have made your tree trunk the desired length.

, Dip your wide brush into it, and then wipe off a small amount of paint onto the side of the paper plate. You don't want too much, or it will ruin the effect of the leaves and the trunk being seen together.

, This will create the effect of the leaves on the (invisible for now) branches of the tree. Pour more paint out onto the plate, mix colors, and repeat the previous step.

, Not too much, but enough to define the frail branches of the fall tree. Spread out the brown paint towards the top of your tree where the leaves are, and create straight-ish lines.

,  In pencil, trace around them. Remember to draw stems, even if you have to make them up.,  Little broken sections, worm holes or edges worn or eaten away, are great to give character to the leaf.  Draw carefully, filling in the leaf shapes with the details you've discovered. ,  No need to follow exactly what you see, be creative.  This is a work of art, not a botanical sketch.

,  Add purple, yellow, red or shades of brown for variety. Sprinkle salt onto a leaf or two as soon as they begin to dry. .,  Drop these shavings onto a wet leaf to create texture.,  If shapes need linking, add an imaginary strand of ivy or a long stemmed piece of pine with red berries.

Wear cotton gloves.,
Remove the slides from their backing.,
Wipe the slide with isopropyl alcohol.,
Moisture-condition the slides.,
Re-mount the slides.",How to Clean 35mm Slides2," When cleaning mold of fungus from 35mm slides, protect your skin from both the cleaning agents and the mold by donning gloves. Gloves will also prevent you from inadvertently touching the slides and leaving behind fingerprints., All 35mm slides are housed in a backing (or mount) of plastic, glass, metal, or cardboard. Whatever the backing, remove the slide from it. Usually, the slide is easily removed via a narrow slit in the side or top of the slide. In the case of plastic-backed slides, you’ll probably have to pop the backing open by pulling up at its bottom or top corner.Cardboard-backed slides will require more time, as you’ll have to use a razor blade to slit the cardboard open along the top or bottom edges, guessing roughly where the edge of the slide is. Since this method carries with it a risk of slicing into the slide itself, cut small strips off the slide so as to avoid cutting the slide itself., Isopropyl alcohol is a chemical compound widely used as a household cleaning agent. To clean mold from slides using isopropyl alcohol, dab a bit onto a soft cleaning pad, a cotton cloth, or a photo chamois. Wipe the slide with a gentle circular motion until the slide is clean.Isopropyl alcohol can also be used to wipe away fungal growth that may have developed on the interior or exterior of slide mount glass.

, Place the slides in an environment with relative humidity of 40% or less for several hours, or overnight. Alternately, place the slides in an open-frame mount and project them for a minute or two. The high temperatures of the projector (60 degrees Celsius, or 140 degrees Fahrenheit) will kill fungus spores that might have survived., After projecting the slides in an open-air mount, replace them in an appropriate mount. If you removed mold from slides that were housed in a cardboard mount and the mount is no longer usable, place them in a new plastic, metal, or glass mount."
"
Handle slides carefully.,
Limit the slides’ exposure to light.,
Store slides under proper conditions.,
Protect your slides with slide sleeves.",How to Clean 35mm Slides3," Slides are easily damaged. The oils on your fingers can cause smudging and deterioration of the slide. Wear disposable gloves to prevent smudging, and place them gently in the projector.If you have a particular slide or set of slides that get handled regularly, undertake a digitization project or create duplicates so that the originals can be stored safely, thereby limiting the length of time they are handled and extending their useful life.

, Excessive exposure to light can cause fading. Slides should not be in the projector or on the light table longer than necessary. Generally, exposure time should not exceed more than 60 seconds per slide.If you’re working in a museum or archival setting, you should invest in polarized sheeting for windows that are in the viewing room.
Avoid fluorescent lights in the viewing space. This type of lighting is especially hard on slides and negatives.

, If slides are not in the projector, they should be kept in the elongated slide box along with their counterparts in the set. Additionally, ensure slides are kept at an appropriate temperature.Most stable office environments with a temperature of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) and 50-60% relative humidity are appropriate for storing slide collections.
However, if your you have the resources, you could invest in a humidity-controlled cold storage unit. Such units are especially useful for slides that are part of museum or archival collections which require indefinite retention.

, Once your slides are clean, you can protect them by placing them in slide sleeves. Slide sleeves are like small plastic bags that fit snugly around the slides. You can obtain slide sleeves for 35mm slides online or at your local photography store."

Finished.

",How to Paint Fall Trees2," If you get paper that is too thin, the colors will bleed through. If you get a paper that is too thick, the colors will run off. You needs something that's just right.

, Don't use anything that will damage the paper.

, You can use acrylics that you have diluted with water, or normal watercolors for creating your tree. Preferred colors are red, orange, yellow, or brown.

, Use a paper plate, once again, to pour your colors onto and mix with. The wider, the better.

, Drag your sponge or brush gently downwards to avoid getting too much paint on the paper. If you put too much on there, hold up the paper and allow the paint to run off.

, Start at the top and blot the colors on it. This will create an effect that is close to crisp, rustling leaves on your tree.

, Allow time to dry.

,  Go to the internet for pictures. Google: ""realistic bird coloring pages"" for clear line drawings. Birding magazines, bird watching guidebooks and gardening catalogs are all places to look for inspiration and guidance.

,  They are quite realistic and come bearing blossoms in many varieties; apple, cherry, forsythia, and dogwood. Pussy willow is a spring mainstay, and will last forever.

,  Look at the real thing, see those little details provided by nature, tiny minutiae and peculiarities. These branches will add a sense of realism to your drawn and painted ones.

, For the birds, art and craft shops have realistic looking, life-sized ones.  Some have wired feet so you can attach and pose them on a branch. Pictures of birds, either ones you have taken yourself or pulled from magazines will work, too.

,  Thumb through birding magazines and studying the myriad photos others have taken will give you lots of ideas.  Looking out your own windows will be helpful, too.  Begin to narrow your scope.  Start creating a mental image of what you want your own art work to look like.

, Composition will be easy if you allow the diagonal lines of the dark branches to be prominent. This will give your composition stability and directional excitement.


Another composition is to frame the entire picture plane with leaves and branches.  Working the entire four edges of the paper with foliage will draw the viewer's eye inward to your center of interest, the bird.

, Google: ""How to draw a bird"" for ideas. Think of two basic shapes; an oval for the body and a circle for the head.

, Try doing a bird with a few brush strokes. This will give you a fresh, lively looking bird. Do a lot of birds in this style of painting on a piece of scrap watercolor paper. Try various poses.


, The choices are endless; bright and sunny, stormy, bleak and winter, rainy, a solid color, etc., Do this lightly in pencil. Make the bird at least life size. Since he is on a branch, Indicate where it will go.

, It is entirely your choice., Paint around the bird.

, Masking is a rubberized coating, that allows you can to paint right over an area, such as the bird, to get a unified background. After the piece is dry, you can unmask by rubbing with your finger or an eraser, and paint the bird at your leisure, knowing that the background is taken care of.

, Leaves, buds and fully opened blossoms are all things you might want to put in your picture. If the leaves are just unfurling they will appear curled. The colors of spring might be more yellow green than the deep, rich, verdant greens of summer. This pastel green will contrast nicely with the dark branches.Do distant branches in gray or pale blue to have them appear to recede.

, To do this, first mount your paper securely on all four sides to the support board with masking tape. This will keep the paper flat as your work., Do the entire page as background, branches, etc. everything but the bird. Paint right over where the bird will eventually be sitting. On a small piece of watercolor paper, do a bird. Sketch and paint it. Cut the bird out and adhere it over the background using sticky foam dots. The thickness of the dots will make the bird stand out slightly and give a spatial dimension to the piece.


, It's free and yours for the taking. Appreciating such a vast gift is good, but making a piece of art inspired by nature elevates your experience and makes it unique and unforgettable.

Find two tubes with different diameters.,
Line the tubes with black paper.,
Fasten a lens to each tube.,

Cover each end with a rubber disc.,
Make a hole in a film canister.,
Push the lens tube through the hole.,
Secure the eyepiece.,
Start with a solid base.,
Create a vertical stand.,
Secure the microscope tube to the vertical stand.,
Test your microscope.",How to Make a Microscope," Look for tubes made of sturdy materials, such as PVC. This will ensure that your microscope will hold up over time. The small tube should be just small enough to slide along the inside walls of the large tube.Make each tube approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) long.;
, The functioning of a microscope will be diminished if light enters through the side of the tube. To improve the microscope’s ability to function, line the sides of the tube with black paper. This will help absorb the any excess light.If you use a thick, opaque material such as PVC, the black paper is not necessary.

, Glue a lens on the end of each tube. The diameter of the lens should match the diameter of the tube. Use a moderate amount of glue and make sure not to get it on the inside of the lens. Allow the glue to dry before proceeding.Use lenses with short focal lengths. For example, you could reuse the lenses from disposable 35mm cameras to make a microscope.

, Place the open end of the small tube inside the large tube. You now have a lens at both ends and the ability to move them closer to each other. This allows you to view objects and focus on them using your microscope.Focusing this type of microscope is done by simply sliding the lenses close together or further apart until a clear image is obtained.

, Cover the edges of each lens by gluing on a rubber disc. Be sure that the discs do not cover the center of either lens. This creates a buffer between the lens and other objects. It also makes the microscope more aesthetically pleasing., An eyepiece is not necessary to see objects, but it helps to keep your eye off of the viewing lens. It can also make viewing more comfortable. Use a drill or shop object (e.g. scissors) to make a hole in the bottom of a film canister. The hole should be in the center of the canister and large enough to slide the smallest tube through., Line the smallest tube up with the hole in the canister. Push the tube so that the top (side with the lens) inch is inside the film canister. If the tube will not fit, make the hole larger until it does., Use glue or liquid cement to keep the eyepiece in place. This will allow you to look through the eyepiece without it moving. Give the glue time to dry., Use a square of plywood or plastic to set your base. Use a saw to cut the square to have four inch sides. You want the base to be approximately 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) thick., You can use a wooden cylinder to create a vertical stand. PVC pipe is another option. Cut the vertical stand to be 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) tall. Glue the vertical stand to the base plate., The microscope tube should rest just above the base plate. This will allow you to place samples under the microscope lens. The tube can be secured to the vertical stand with glue or zip ties., Gather a sample and view them under your microscope. You can start by looking at a drop of water, or a piece of hair. You can slide the eyepiece up and down to adjust the focus of the microscope."

,  Doing quick sketches of them will help you see how different they are. Look, with a discerning eye, at the various types.

,  Seeds appearing in stores make us excited for planting.  At the dollar store the displays are prominent, the packs are cheap, so get a few, if only for the illustrations on the front.

,  If you can get one or two from the supermarket, use them as models.

,  In addition to the usual drawing and painting equipment, lay out the seed packets and other references for viewing as you work.

Get inspired by looking at pictures.  See how others have done it. Google:  Watercolors of window herb gardens.
Study photos of actual arrangements. Google: Free stock pictures of window gardens.

,  How do you want your garden to look?  A large, sunny window is a given.  Will the garden be small, in individual pots or will the herbs be contained in a single planter box?, This offers another way to use the space. Go ""retro"" by having a pot or two coming down from above on a braided or macrame hanger.

, Decide which orientation you want, sideways or tall., An ordinary pencil, eraser, ruler, watercolors, support board, water bucket and tissues. Place all this at a work space that allows you to spread out and not be disturbed while you work.

, Break up the paper's blank space by making the window the most prominent feature. It will most likely take up most of the center of the composition.

, A window's lines should be exact., For convenience, drawing around a tissue or other another box or rectangular piece of cardboard can give you a three sided shape for the window with hardly any measuring., Make any type of divisions you prefer. Looking at pictures of the various types is helpful, too.

, Arrange them in groups or in a row. Stagger them, have some on different levels, hang some in rigid holders screwed to the side moldings. Let your imagination guide you.


Doing a long planter box has advantages. The plants side by side can be touching for a lavish feel. Remember, adding accessories like little stakes with the plant's variety on it can be a fun way to distinguish one from another.

, Unusual clay pottery, old teapots, or the like can add whimsy to a garden.

Keeping the garden very simple is fine, too. A single pot or two can be enough.

, Begin where you wish. Starting with the plants and making them the center of interest is a typical way to go.

, On a scrap page, practice control of the brush. Keep the brush well filled so the line flows. If you make a mistake, simply dab it with a tissue or wipe it away using a piece of a white eraser pad. Allow to thoroughly dry before doing over.

, Forgo the brush entirely, if you wish.

, Views out the window can add interest. Birds on branches on a tree or shrub, other vague buildings or just a quick neutral, streaky wash of blue are all possibilities., Plants like the fronds of dill or texture on the wall paper can be done by touching a damp sponge into undiluted paint and stamping with it.

,  If you do them as opaque fabric, they will add splashes of color and texture. They can be pushed aside or bracketed to allow for maximum light to enter the window. Doing them as sheers brings attention down to the herbs.

, Painting a subject can preserve it for posterity.


Bringing the plants of summer indoors is fun. Doing a painting can be a substitute for the real thing.
If your day needs a boost, consider doing a painting of herbs. Those little plants pack a punch and do triple duty; they are a thing of beauty, add flavor to a recipe and spice to our lives.

It's a good idea to begin with a small piece of paper, then as your confidence grows, you can paint larger sunsets.;
, For a sunset, the following colors are recommended:


Windsor Blue or blue
Cadmium Red or red
Lemon Yellow or yellow
Cobalt Violet or purple
Rose Madder Genuine or pink
Windsor Orange or orange
Windsor Green (yellow shade) or dark green.

, Use a 6B pencil (or whatever pencil you prefer to draw with). Once the line has been drawn, on the upper half of the watercolor paper, dampen it just a little with water, using a size 10 Brush (or big brush).

, Paint in lines, going back and forth. Do not cover the entire paper with yellow paint; you'll be adding other sunset-related colors shortly.

, Paint swiftly, randomly and spontaneously, moving the brush lines back and forth across the yellow part of the paper.


Use only a little touch of Windsor Blue.

, Use a size 6 brush and Windsor Green and Cobalt Violet paint for the hills. Keep them simple at this stage; you can be fancier when you gain more confidence.

, Paint back and forth using the same colors as you did for the sky. For more reflective look, use white pastel and draw short, wavy lines before painting the lake.

, Now you can show off your painting of a sunset to your friends and family. Keep practicing; the more you do, the more your own creativity will take hold and the sunsets will begin to look much more professional.

",How to Paint a Watercolor Face Using Crayon Resist,"  It resembles an egg on end with the rounded end up and the tapered end as the chin. Using pencil, sketch a large egg shape onto a piece of 11 x 14"" watercolor paper. Place it in the center and make it smaller than life, but not larger.;
,  This divides the egg into quarters.

, Just plot them as ovals or almond shapes for now.

,  Divide the space from the center or eye line to the chin in half and make a light line. The nose comes off the center vertical line and is symmetrical. For the nose, less is more. It is a triangular shape, but keep it vague and light. The bottom of the nose is a curvy line and will fall approximately at the halfway point between the eye line and chin's bottom. Do the nostrils as light crescents.

, The top lip goes above and the bottom lip below this line. The top lip is slightly longer than the bottom one, but the bottom one is plumper. Don't forget the cupid's bow in the center of the top lip. Better a small mouth than one too large, so have the lips stop no further out than the center of the eyes.

, They should lie flat on the sides of the head, slightly fuller at the top.

, Shoulders drop slightly. Avoid squared-off or boxy shoulders.

, It can have the quality of actual hair, straight lines for straight hair, wavy lines for curly hair. Short lines for short hair, lines coming forward for hair over the forehead.

, When you are satisfied with them, go back and refine the eyes. Adjust the shape and size of the eyes until they look right. The iris of the eyes are circles, filling almost the entire center of the eye with something like Roman numerals radiating out from the pupil A circle in the center of the iris is the dark pupil. Draw the top eyelid slightly over the top of the iris to cover the white of the eye and partly cover the iris.

, Stop when you reach the outside of the eye Draw them with short, feathery strokes, thicker near the nose and tapering off at the ends. Stop where the eye ends.

,, Remember that the neck is a cylinder, so have collars or necklaces curve around the neck to suggest roundness.

, Separate the lighter colored crayons from the pack; white yellow, other very pale shades. Begin to put lines in crayon on the face, clothing and background. You will draw with a lot of pressure to get a build up of wax on the page. If you have trouble seeing what you are doing, all the better, as lots of lines going in many directions in the background and on the clothing will add energy to the finished piece. If this bothers you, switch to yellow until you get your bearings, but go back to white and press hard, getting a lot of wax on the drawing. Scribble, use pressure and let the crayon really play over the paper. Do keep in mind the pencil drawing you've already made of the face and use it as your guide.

, This light will make one side of the face glow and the other side will be in semi-shadow.

, Select a 3/4"" flat brush, load it well and begin to paint.


There is no correct place to start. It can be the face, clothing or background.

, Remember your light source, especially on the face. The colors will be repelled by the crayon lines and the results will surprise you, in a delightful way.

Draw on an 11 x 14"" sheet of watercolor paper, in pencil, using a ruler, a window.,
Look at pictures of sleeping cats on the Internet.,
Draw a cat reclining on the good watercolor paper in pencil.,
Activate your paints and begin painting, starting with the foreground, the interior view.,
Paint the cat by carefully wetting the cat shape with a brush and clean water.,
Pull tube colors for the cat onto your palette and dilute only slightly as the majority of the water is already on the cat shape.,
Paint the window trims such as the sill under the cat and the moldings.,
Look for contrasts in planning the outdoor scene that will be seen through the window.,
Paint the scene outside.,
Sketch the scene outside the window in pencil and paint it.

,
When finished, allow to dry well and stand it up to study it before making alterations of additions.

",How to Paint a Watercolor Cat in a Window with a View," It can be as simple as a rectangle on the page or ornate with layers of molding, or with the panes divided into smaller rectangles. These lines must be done carefully to be straight and lined up with the borders of your paper, so use a ruler. Make the window large enough so that you can see an outdoor scene out the window. If the holidays are near, decorate with swags or colorful ornaments.;
, Or, if you are so lucky, study your own sleeping cat. Make sketches in a sketch book comprised of ordinary paper so you can draw freely and a lot.

, Have him stretched out on the window sill so he covers a lot of it.

, Try a flat brush to do the molding and have the width of the brush match the width of the molding so you can do the long strips in one pass, stopping to recharge your brush as often as necessary.

, Allow the water to get into all parts of the cat's silhouette and have enough water so it stands up slightly off the page. This insures the water will carry the paint to all parts that you have wet.

, Diluting it too much will make it pale when dry. If it dries too light, it is possible to do another layer, but wait until the piece dries thoroughly, not to disturb the paint already applied. If the paint isn't moving well enough through the water, use the tip of a round brush to coax paint into all parts of the cat. If you add more color into a wet wash, it has to be thicker paint.


Do spots or stripes on the cat's coat and shadows along his edges that way. If you want to keep, for example, paws separate, leave a tiny dry dam of paper around the paw as you paint. Wet paint will be attracted to wet paper and it will all flow together. Let it dry thoroughly, first naturally, then with a hair dryer, if desired. Do features, eyes, nose, whiskers, inner ears and more shadows on a dry cat shape.

, Add additional strips of molding, building it up as many window frames have layered moldings. Again, use a ruler for accuracy. Mix a neutral color darker than the sill and swipe on a shadow under the cat. Do it only once and leave it alone.

, If your room is predominately warm colors, use cool hues for the outside. The room will have many lines and angles, so think of using curvy lines for the outdoors. Make things up, realism isn't necessarily the only way to go, so, use your imagination.

, If you are stymied about what to put outside, stick close to home, and take a look out your windows. Go through your collection of snapshots for something that sparks your interest.

Begin by cutting a 6 x 9"" piece of #140, cold press watercolor paper.,
Place the paper on a sheet of heavy cardboard or foam core board larger than the paper, but don't mount it to the board.,
Draw in pencil, a line two inches up from the bottom to separate the sky from the earth. 

,
Set up your palette by squeezing 1/2 inch amounts of tube watercolors;  red, yellow and blue.,
Use a large brush for each color.,
Load your brush to almost dripping with one of the colors and working from left to right paint a single, juicy stroke from side to side.,
Repeat as many times as you wish until you reach the pencil line for the earth.,
Prepare paints for the earth by squeezing out 1/4 inch amounts of browns, greys and black.,
Paint the earth strip by mixing dark colors randomly.

,
Do your research.,
Plan the amount of space the tree will take on the paper by sketching in pencil the position of the trunk.,
Draw or paint the tree using dark media such as Sharpie markers, a fine brush and India Ink or opaque water color.

,
Bear in mind that the trunk and branches tend to taper and get smaller as they grow upward.",How to Paint a Winter Tree at Sunset in Watercolor,";
, 


Elevate the top of the board approximately two inches using a piece of hard foam such as rectangular blocks found in the floral department at craft stores or make one from a piece of hard packing foam. The board must be secure and stable during painting, so be sure the device for elevating goes all the way across the top of the support board.






You will transport the wet painting on the board to the hairdryer as you work. You will also avoid a cramped, stunted stroke by gliding the paint across the paper from side to side and letting your brush go right off and onto the board.







,,  Arrange the paints around the edge of a white plastic plate or white palette, leaving the center clear for mixing. 


In art, as in life, sunsets come in many combinations of colors and surprising new colors will be created from the basic three as the paints flow downward, merging and mingling.

, Plan to work fast to paint the stripes of color.  Prepare your puddles of color by pulling a color into the center of the palette and adding enough water to make it the consistency of milk, mixing thoroughly.,  Do it in one pass, don't stop to reload your brush.  You will see, as the paint flows down, a bead forming at the bottom of the stroke.



Repeat with a second color, but this time have your brush slightly touch the bead. The color from the earlier stroke will be pulled into the next stroke.







, Don't go back over the sky. You can alter it somewhat by picking up the board and tilting it various ways to make the paint flow together.

As soon as you are satisfied, remove the riser and let the painting dry flat. Air dry or use a hairdryer. If it curls slightly, roll the dry painting gently the opposite way.

, Make up an entirely separate palette for these dark colors. Use a large yogurt or whipped topping lid, but keep it well away from the other colors.,, Either draw the tree from one of your own photographs or take a tree from one of the free, photo sharing websites.

,  Lightly sketch the outer limits of the branches to form a compact shape for the branches.

,, A tree trunk will split into three or more large branches and then smaller branches will split and grow off these.


Continue to draw branches until they become so fine they are barely visible, but stop at the pencil line you drew for the outer edge. To avoid smearing the branches, dry as you go, or turn the piece upside down to draw the finer branches.

Sketch out some snow figures on computer paper.,
Think about snowman related props and sketch some on scrap paper.,
Do a little research if you need it.,
Gather your supplies.,
Try ways to make a white snow person stand out against white paper.,
Hold your paper in either orientation.,
Ignore all the standard rules for a realistic painting and do your own thing if a fantasy background is preferred.,
Keep in mind that the snow you paint has lots of color in it.,
Bring in some neutrals.,
Paint the snow figure's face and accessories.,
Hang up the art work.",How to Paint a Snow Figure in Watercolor,"  Let your imagination run wild.  We all know that the basic construction of a snow person is three balls of snow, grading from the largest at the base to the smaller one at the top for the head.;
,  Frosty the Snowman's black top hat is seen often, but any type of available headgear works fine.  Coal was used for accents like eyes and buttons, but today, anything goes.  A fresh carrot still seems the main choice for a nose, and broken branches for arms, but rules are made to be broken, so be creative.  Draw some earmuffs, a snow shovel and a broom, other common accessories.

,  Seeing how snow figures have been done by others can get your imagination primed.  Google images of winter scenes, snowmen, watercolors of snow figures and coloring pages of realistic and cartoon snow figures.  You can often print these out, too.

,  You'll need an 11"" x 14"" piece of watercolor paper (or any size you wish,) a pencil, watercolors, various round and flat watercolor or all purpose brushes, and a water container.

,  Simply painting behind the white figure with colors works well.  Putting trees, either bushy evergreens or naked winter trees in the background is another technique.

,  Begin to sketch out your design.  If you aren't sure try doing small sketches of the paper both ways.  Things you might include in your design are: another snow figure or two, a sled or snow dish, part of a house, just the doorway or a corner with a window, trees, a fence, and visiting birds or animals.  Human figures wearing colorful outdoor clothing are fun to add, too.

, Everything is good, it is a work of art, don't forget, your imaginary world.

, You might have to fake it a little, but if you carefully observe a snow scene you will begin to see subtle colors in the snow caused by reflections, type of light, time of day, shadows and just pretty colorful lines and shapes as long as they are transparent and pastel.

, Winter landscapes are most often drab and fairly colorless, so using a range of grays, browns and shades of dark gray to black look right.

, Make tree branches for arms. Add details to the landscape, whatever your wish. Let the piece dry thoroughly. Stand it up and if anything needs punching up, do it on a dry painting.

, You can purchase pre-cut mats in colors that will coordinate and highlight your colors or white to give it a refined and finished look. Frames can be easily found at discount and thrift stores, so put the matted piece behind glass and hang it for the season.

Fix a cup of hot cocoa and in the warmth of your house, feel happy to have created art from something as simple as a pile of snow.

Understand that observing the real thing is optimal, but looking at pictures of snow globes you find online is fine, too.,
Find a 4-5"" round object the size you want to make your globe, such as a plastic lid, bottle or jar.,
For the interior of the globe, create a tiny world, so include what strikes your fancy.,
Use a ruler to draw a horizontal line on either side of the globe.,
Prepare your paint.,
Paint the scene and base and let the piece dry.,
Paint the background a very dark shade, to make the glass appear to shine and give the illusion of depth behind the globe.,
Add a curved shadow around the base of the globe, anchoring it onto the table and creating depth.,
Make your template for the snow.,
Create the magic of transparent glass with the shadows and highlights on the exterior of the glass.,
Study the piece and see if, from a distance, it sparkles.",How to Paint a Snow Globe in Watercolor," Do your research, see what globes contain and how the bases look; some are plain, some are ornate. Decide how you want your globe to look.;
, Alternatively, you can use a compass to draw a circle in the middle, slightly toward the top of a piece of 6 x 9"" or 9 x 12"" watercolor paper. Follow the curve at the bottom of the circle and replicate it a few inches below the glass ball to form the bottom of the base of the globe. Add vertical lines to complete the base and decorate it as you wish. Keep it simple, add a special quote, song title, or make it ultra fancy. Do this in pencil.

, If you are thinking this art piece might be a gift, what does the person on the receiving end like? Natural, woodsy scenes, animals, clowns, snowmen, Santas, religious scenes, a church, toys, pets, hobbies etc. the possibilities are endless.

, Below this line will represent the table top and above the background. Draw a few swirls around the globe's base for a cloth or table covering or leave it plain.

, Activate your paints if you are using a set of dry watercolors, or squeeze out a tiny amount of a variety of colors of tube paint onto a palette. It won't take much paint, but even though you are working in miniature, it will take almost as long as doing an ordinary picture, so allow enough time not to be rushed., Draw an ellipse or curved line for the water line at the very top of the globe's interior and depict it with a fine dark, line., Go around the globe being careful to make a crisp, perfect edge. If you have trouble with a brush, use a fine line Sharpie. A crisp, even line and perfect circle are needed to convey the illusion.

, Let the piece dry thoroughly. Study it and make adjustments if you need to., Find the circle template you used earlier for the globe, put it in the center of a large sheet of newsprint or sketch paper and trace around it. Poke into it with the end of a pair of scissors and cut it out carefully. Place it over your painting so only the globe is exposed and all else is masked.



Squeeze out 1/2"" of white watercolor or acrylic paint and mix with a little water to dilute it slightly. Fully charge a 3/4"" bristle brush and tap it against another big brush or wooden spoon handle to have tiny droplets fall on your paper. Practice first on a piece of scrap paper. Allow to dry thoroughly.

, When painting transparent glass, most of the reflections are hard, dark, almost black shapes and are always seen at the edges of the glass object, contouring to the shape of the vessel. Study the globe and look for these shapes and try to replicate them, but stop at three or four. Paint them in barely diluted black over what is already down on the paper.



For the white highlights, use the tip of a utility or craft knife and scratch small, curved lines to represent reflected overhead lights or window shapes, if that is what you see on close observation. Or, simply paint them with the same white you used to do the snow. Keep these to a minimum as well.

, Darkening a background that has dried lighter than you had hoped will help if the illusion is not as dramatic as you wish.

If the imprint isn't strong enough, do it again, or hold the paper up to a window and trace. You have made the first bottle.
,  Use a half sheet on its side to get a squatty bottle.  Aim for variety in shapes, sizes and neck configurations.  Cut out the five bottles to use as patterns.,  This line will represent a shelf or window ledge.  Place the patterns or templates you made along this line, arranging and rearranging until you get a pleasing pattern of bottles in a row. ,  Remove the paper templates.  Place the remaining two bottle shapes, completely overlapping the ones already drawn on the paper.  Draw them and remove the templates.,  First paint the bottles in the rear, one each color. Remember, these bottles must be completely painted even though there are bottles standing in front of them.  Allow to dry completely.

,  Note what happens where the bottles overlap. Again, dry the entire paper thoroughly., Wet the background well and glide on color you've mixed and made into a big puddle. Blue usually reminds people of the sky and yellow the sun., Make the shadows colorful the way they look when light comes through colored glass., For fun and to add a little drama, add the image of a mischievous cat as seen through one of the bottles. Is the cat thinking, ""Should I give this bottle a tiny push?"""

,  They include many bright red and orange flowers with a trumpet shape for the bird to insert his beak.

,  Simplify the bird into a few shapes to get the size and proportions, then add details.  Doing this practice will make it easier to draw the bird with confidence on your watercolor paper.

,  In planning your composition, stay true to the bird’s size in comparison to the rest of the world by keeping it on the small side.  If you are having trouble do some research on the internet.

,  Lightly sketch the surroundings, including a large flower.

,  You will need a watercolor set with the basic colors, an assortment of watercolor or all purpose brushes, a water container, and a board to support your paper as you work.  Add a few drops of water to your paint pads to activate them.,  Hummingbirds come in a wide range of brilliant colors, but many, called, the “Ruby Throated Hummingbird” have a long swatch of red under their beaks.  ,  It is a good plan to place the first layer of colors, including green, blue-green, yellow, light gray, tan and dark gray.  Allow it to dry and then go back to do the details;  the beak, the eye and area around it, the darker feathers at the edges of the wings and tail and the feet.   It is interesting to note that the feet are not used for walking, rather for perching and scooting along on branches.  The feet are visible, but stretched behind and back when the bird flies.

Alternatively, use creative rainbow colors.  There are many hues of feathers on the hummingbird, so, if you feel like it, celebrate them.  Let creativity overcome realism.

,  Sketch it large compared to the bird.,  Add green leaves for contrast.,  This can consist of more flowers painted in clear focus or slightly blurred.  To get the illusion of out of focus flowers, sketch their placement lightly in pencil and paint them on paper that you have dampened with water.  Allow the area to sit a minute for the water to soak in and then paint the flowers with any colors you wish.  , 

 

Remember that painting this on wet paper allows the blue to appear faded and blurry. 
Consider filling in the sky area with yellow to represent a brilliantly sunny day.

,  This choice will give the illusion that you are in the midst of a lot of flowers in a garden., Remember that hummingbirds can be aggressive and scrappy.  Many can often be seen at a feeder, but one might be protective of his food and try to attack the others.  

Butterflies, ladybugs or dragonflies might also be fun to include.

,  If you need to add further details, do so on a dry painting to preserve the colors you have already put down.,  You might not see a hummingbird everyday in the flesh, but a painting will last forever.

Use mulberry hinges and wheat paste for the mounting. The hinges should be slightly lighter than the paper. In case of a problem it is better for the hinge to tear and not the painting.






Attach the hinges only at the top of the watercolor paper to the backing, using only acid free material such as Foam Core. These hinges can be removed with water in the future if necessary. When framing and matting one does not want to do any harm and it should all be reversible.

, Cut 3-4"" off the top to allow room to draw the rest of the lighthouse.,  Place the cut lighthouse shape on the paper.  Check to make sure it is absolutely straight and draw around it in pencil. Stand back from the paper and double check that the lighthouse is standing perfectly straight. This is the time to correct bad lines. Drop a guide line from end to end in the center of the cylinder to keep you on track as you work.

, It is actually round, but will appear as a rectangle sitting on top of the lighthouse body. This room would house the watch room and galley deck, an outside walkway circling the lighthouse.

, This space holds the lens. Indicate it with another rectangle. Section it off for large panes of glass. Draw the large light filling the entire middle of it., Add a small ball at the very top of the roof and a line for a lightening rod., This is a series of lines like a fence., Add two or three windows going up the tower., Draw both geometric and rounded rocks around it and, if desired, spatter rocks for more texture.

,  Pull small amounts of blue and brown paint into the mixing section and blend them to make gray.

,  For the first stroke, using a full charged 1/2"", flat brush, run a line of juicy gray paint from top to bottom along the left edge.  If your brush runs out of paint, recharge it and continue painting the line.  Rinse your brush.

,  Have your wet brush barely touch the gray line already in place.  It will pull color toward the center of the lighthouse.

, This creates a washed out effect on the right side of the lighthouse as if it is in bright light.  This technique gives the illusion of roundness to your lighthouse. Allow the lighthouse to dry., Refine your lines in pencil, using a triangle and/or a protractor to keep them straight.

,  Because it is comprised of glass panes, the sky will show through in all places except the center, where the lens is located. All you need to indicate is the metal framework holding the glass panes. Outline the windows in black to show this, using a small brush and black paint., Use a pointed, #8 round brush loaded with dark gray or black. Keep a sliver of the roof unpainted as a highlight, letting the white paper showing through., Paint little bricks on the body of the lighthouse with a brush that is the exact size of the bricks so you can do them in single strokes. Do groupings of texture randomly on the conical building, suggesting a pattern, but do it only in sections. No need to overdo this texturing, people will get the idea.

, Do rocks, grass, a stone walkway, and shrubs. Rock shapes can be angular or rounded. Paint as you did the cylinder, apply color to one side and let clear water coax it over the body of your rock.

, Clean off the mixing area of your palette. To paint the water, pull two shades of blue into the mixing area and with your brush and drop in clean water to dilute the blue paint.  Let the two shades blend, forming a new color. Test the color on a scrap of paper, making sure it to keep the integrity of the pigment, but keeping it transparent and very liquid.

, Be aware that the water reflects the sky. Use the same puddle of paint for both. If the paint is even slightly dirty, make a fresh puddle. For a flat body of water, use a fully charged brush, either flat or round to flow the paint from the brush onto the area for the water.  , Do curved strokes, leaving white paper showing between the strokes and while the water area is still wet, add strokes of darker blue to give the illusion of depth., Wet the sky area with a large 2"" brush.  Be sure the paint on your palette is clean.  The sky can be as unique as the sky actually is, so have fun with it.

, Or, lightly dab with a soft tissue to lift cloud shapes.  , Let the painting get thoroughly dry., Give the painting a final, hard look. Possible corrections include: straighten the sides of the lighthouse using a ruler and fill in with paint where needed. Sharpen all straight edges of railings, etc., with a pencil and touch them up with appropriate colors using a small, pointed brush.

, One method is to do the dark areas first., Enjoy the process of painting with tiny dots.

Another way is to under paint an area with a watercolor wash. Use a normal watercolor brush for this. Allow it to dry and then use your special stippling brush to paint dots over the colored area.

, See whether the colors merge from a distance. You might consider going back in and reworking an area with larger dots. Do this by using a small, pointed brush and painting each dot individually.

Draw a cornucopia on an 11 x 14"" piece of watercolor paper.,
Have the opening be large and extend the tapered end behind, even off the page.

,
Fill the horn with drawings of various fruits and vegetables.,
Small items like grapes or plums make a good contrast to larger ones; pineapple and pumpkins.,
Activate your paints with a few drops of water so that when you pull them onto your palette, you can easily fill your brush.,
Paint the cornucopia with strokes that correspond with the shape you are working with.,
Wash color beneath the fruits and vegetables.

",How to Paint a Cornucopia in Watercolor,"  While it was originally a goat's horn, most today are baskets woven into that shape.;
,,  Cluster them tightly, overlapping, and spilling out of the mouth of the basket.

,  Use elongated shaped items like corn, bananas, string beans and asparagus as lines to lead the viewer's eye.  They work well as space fillers, too.,  This is no place for skimping on paint.  Paint the fruits and vegetables, reserving a spot on all, regardless of size, for a highlight.  Make a circle as a reminder to leave white paper.,  Circular for the opening and semi-circular for the horn.  Allow the painting to dry.,"

Find a photograph with interesting elements at the edges.,
Take a hard look at the edges of the photograph and using a pencil begin to extend the shapes you see onto the watercolor paper.,
Activate your watercolors by dropping clear water onto each pad with your brush.,
Paint out from the photograph, work all sides.,
Allow the painting to dry thoroughly and study it again.",How to Incorporate a Photograph Into a Watercolor,"  Photocopy it, trim the white border, if there is one, and carefully glue it in the center of a piece of 9"" x 12"" piece of watercolor paper.  Make sure the edges are glued down flat to the paper.  Either landscape or portrait format is OK.;
,  No need to continue all the way to the edges of the watercolor paper, just go far enough to show what might be lying just beyond the photo's boundaries. This technique of leaving the edges ragged and unfinished is called a ""vignette."", Use a scrap of paper to test colors and try to match exactly the colors on the edges of the photo. The colors will dry lighter than when wet, so, when completely dry, have another go at it and adjust your hues and values to match exactly what they are replicating.

,  Look deeply to see what textures and patterns exist and be creative in trying to match them. Step back and look often to see the photograph merging with the painted background. If adjustments need to be made, wait until the paint dries to do another coat. Stay with it until the photograph is almost invisible.

, Continue to make adjustments until you are satisfied."

When the painting is dry, tip the paper up gently and shake the excess salt off.,
Finished!",How to Make a Water Colour Salt Painting," Make sure that you're painting in a place where water, paint, and salt won't do any damage to the table or floor.;
, Use a paintbrush and some water to moisten the surface, but avoid creating puddles of water. If puddles form, soak some water up again with paper towels.

, Use the brush, water, and paint to create a design on your page. Because of the water, your colors will bleed into each other, but that's just part of the effect. You can use several colors and create an abstract design, or you can try to create a scene like the ocean floor or sky and mountaintops.

, Be generous and random as you sprinkle, but don't use too much. You don't need mountains of salt around, but putting more in some areas and less in others will result in a more varied, interesting design.

, Because of all the water, this may take some time. Don't try to move it while it's wet, or the paper may tear.

, Take care not to spill the salt everywhere - you may want to shake it into a tray or container for easy disposal.

, Enjoy the interesting effect, and place your watercolor somewhere for the world to see!

,  Put out yellow, blue, red, violet, green, orange and brown.  Place the palette on a piece of old terry toweling to hold your brushes and absorb splashes.,  A #10 pointed, a liner, and a 1/2 inch flat.  A soft wash brush, a cheap, bristle brush for dry brushing, or a rake brush and a big water container, tissues or paper towels, a pencil, and eraser.

,  Get masking fluid and a cheap, old paint brush for applying it.  Alternatively, get a bottle of rubber cement.  A hard rubber ""masking fluid remover"" is good, but rubber kitchen pads work well, too.

, An eye dropper works well to apply it.,  Pick actual ones at all stages of life, buds to puffballs.  Or, find pictures of dandelions and print some out.


,  On your paper, sketch freehand circles for the puff balls, ellipses for the dandelions, upright ovals for the buds.  Distribute them over the paper as you wish.  Make some of them, the ones in the foreground, closest to the viewer large, and have them diminish in size as they go back in space.  Draw stems, originating from the middle of the balls and dropping as long as you desire.  Have some stems be wavy, cross each other or bending over slightly for interest.

,  Mask the circles with masking frisket fluid or rubber cement.  For stems, rubber cement squeezed from a plastic bottle is quick and easy, but you can paint them with a small brush, too.  For the buds, paint the upright standing oval at the top of the stem and give it a little collar of downward pointing lines.  For the skeletal puff balls, have your lines radiating out from the center.  Let this dry thoroughly, a hairdryer can speed this process.

,  This work will be gestural and the paint applied quickly so protect your work area and your clothing.,  Pull a color into the center of your palette and dilute by dropping water into it with a brush.  Mix until it resembles skim milk.  It should be dense enough to exploit the color, but thin enough to allow the white of the paper to show through when dry.  Test each color on a scrap of paper as you mix it.

,  Stand up and develop a rhythm going from the palette to the paper, and use any color you wish.  Let the areas of color touch and they will begin to blend and mix on their own, surprising you with the new colors they make.  Try to let the paint do it's job and not stir or help it.  Enjoy watching the colors move away from and resist the areas you have prepped with rubberized mask.  You might think of the top part of your paper as sky or atmosphere and the lower part earth or grass.  Abstract application of color is good and fun, too.

,  Keep a fully loaded brush and make bold, fearless passes at your paper.  Your confidence will grow as you work and the strokes will show it.  Try to get deep values behind the puff balls so when unmasked there will be a nice contrast to the white spiky flowers.,  As the work begins to dry slightly and the sheen goes off the paint, lightly sprinkle some table salt on it.  Try not to over do this.  Pick up the dropper and drop on alcohol and watch what happens as the color disperses.  Allow the whole thing to dry thoroughly. The hairdryer is helpful to speed this up.,  Use whatever it takes to get the mask off, including your fingers.,  Let your strokes radiate out from the center, and move the paper to get the proper spikiness to the strokes.  For puff balls, keep them white, but add little touches of gray.  Find gray on your palette where colors have mingled as you worked and use that.  It is the sum total of the colors in your painting and will, therefore, be harmonious.  Paint the buds.  Your floating seeds will be on the paper from the salt resist.,  Stems ought not to be regulated and flat, so to capture their liveliness use varied shades of green.  Leaves resemble spikey shapes that have chewed sides.  Again, vary your greens by adding touches of other colors to them.,  Pick up the bristle brush and practice on a scrap how to touch just the ends of the bristles into pasty paint.  Work with upward strokes to make grasses and weeds.  Try double loading your brush with two or three colors and brush that onto the piece.  Have a few strands of grass overlap a yellow flower or two.,,  The paper goes from gray to pure white and sparkles.  Sign your work, mat and frame it.  Display it and enjoy how you have elevated the dandelion from a weed to a work of art.

Leave it attached and turn it back so the cardboard supports your work. Tube watercolors work best for the large washes. Get them in two shades of brown and two blues. Also, a pan of primary and secondary colors for accents. You will need a palette for mixing colors, a variety of brushes, including a 1"" flat, small and large round, pointed brushes and a liner brush. A rake brush is nice for doing grass, but not absolutely necessary. Gather a water container, wide masking tape, scissors, and a drinking or cocktail straw. Immediately squeeze out a small amount of each of the tube paints onto your palette and activate them with a few drops of water. Wet the dry pads of paint in the set, too.
,  Draw two lines dividing the page into three areas; beach, the water and sky. Try to make varied divisions rather than equal shapes for visual interest.,  Cut a two inch piece of masking tape from the roll. Cut two diagonal pieces off, one from each side to form a triangle for the sails of a boat. Repeat, making as many triangles as you want boats.,  Tape the triangles on the center space (or space designated for the water) on your paper. Make the triangles smaller for boats that will be in the distance. Rub to secure them tightly to your paper. Keep them far back from the shore where deeper water is better for sailing.,  Make a good puddle of yellow/gold paint with water on your palette, thinned with water to the consistency of milk. Test your mixture on a scrap of watercolor paper. It should be dense enough get the most from your color, but thin enough to allow the white of the paper to shine through. It will lighten as it dries, so allow for that., Load the brush fully enough to try and get from side to side in one stroke. It should glide smoothly, and be wet all the way across. Starting at the top of the sand, work downward. A few skips of white paper are good to give sparkle to the yellow/gold sand. Using a small, pointed brush, or by dipping a corner of the flat brush into a darker brown paint a few horizontal lines in the sand.,  Follow the previous method for making a big puddle of paint. Paint the water as you did the sand, in a few juicy strokes from side to side. Allow for some skips of white paper to show through. Once a line is painted, try not to go back over it to preserve the freshness. Add some horizontal strokes of darker blue for accents.,,  Dilute the blue puddle even further to make a sky color. Add, if you wish, other shades of blue for variety., Do them one of three ways. Either paint around them to retain the white paper, dab with a crushed up tissue to remove the blue paint or allow the sky to set for a minute and introduce water carefully from a pointed brush so that ""blossoms"" will form. Use a ""thirsty brush"" or one that is damp and clean to remove excess water from the inside of the cloud. Note that the color will be pulled to the outside of the wet area forming a blue outlined ""blossom."", Hasten the wait time by using a hairdryer and carefully remove the masking tape triangles.

, Bring the piece together, starting at the top. Shade the clouds using a thin gray and a pointed brush. All clouds have subtle and sometimes angry looking shadows in them. These areas will give the clouds depth and fullness. Try to soften many of the hard edges to avoid an outlined look., Beneath each of the white sails, make a quick, red or other color stroke with the tip of a round, pointed brush. Allow this to dry., Use a liner brush or the point of a small, round brush to make a line for the masts. Add flags at the top in any color you wish. Suggest people in the boats with tiny dark dots and dashes., This will show depth and puffiness of the sails. Put a stroke of gray beneath the boats using a neutral, transparent gray paint. Test your gray before using on a piece of scrap watercolor paper. It should remain visible when dry, but be transparent. Do the shadows in a single confident swipe and don't try to edit them. Do them fast and only once. Allow to dry., With a scrub brush, remove some of the color on the boats. This gives them the appearance of roundness and being solid masses. Remove quite a lot of the color from the boats in the distance to give the illusion that they are far away. Scrub sections of the sails to soften the lines and reduce the use of the masking tape to make the sails, Charge a 1"" flat brush with deep brown and in one swipe, using a twisting motion, add some rocks clustered on the shore., Run a crescent of diluted gray or blue at the top of one rock and blow air through the straw to spatter the paint in an upward pattern to mimic spray. Repeat for each rock., Show where the water has come up on the sand and dampened it by running a brush with diluted blue or brown onto the sand., Using a pointed brush, make check marks in darker blue along the water line to resemble small wave peaks. Follow by using a scrubby brush or a piece of magic household eraser to remove a little white from the tops of each check mark to look like foam., Texture the sand with a bristle brush or toothbrush dabbed in thick paint. Aim it down toward the sand and run your finger over the bristles to throw dots of color onto the sand., Do clusters and not too many., Allow the piece to dry thoroughly and stand back to look at it from a distance. Add shadows under the rocks. Also do a final, short, dark stroke at the bottom of the boats to pop each boat out and accent them against the water.

, If you can heighten the white it will make them appear to have depth. Use a piece of household white magic eraser to gently wipe out white highlights., It will bring the peacefulness of a summer day at the beach back to you whenever you look at it."

If any section got too dark or opaque, use a piece cut from a white kitchen eraser pad to gently lift or wipe off color.",How to Do a Watercolor Inspired by Stained Glass," Get a #2 yellow pencil, an eraser, a ruler, a compass or varied round objects such as dishes to use as a circle templates.;
, You can use watercolors of any type, tubes or dry pads, an array of watercolor brushes, a water bucket, a piece of old terry toweling to hold supplies, and tissues or napkins.

,  This will guarantee fresh, dark, ink that won't skip or disappear halfway through your project.  If your design has small, complicated areas, also purchase a black Sharpie with a tip that is pointed.

,  Hold the paper either horizontally or vertically and using a ruler, draw a light pencil line, dividing your paper into four equal quarters.  These light lines will help keep you on track and will assist you in keeping all lines straight.

,  Pick something that is meaningful to you and draw it in the center of the paper, any size you wish. Draw it free hand or use stencils from the art store.

, Use a ruler, and drop horizontal and vertical lines to surround and outline the central figure.  Work symmetrically, having the shapes the same on both sides of the center line.  Divide all of those spaces again, breaking them into smaller shapes, if you wish.

,  Use plates, saucers, cups, etc. as templates to get rounded shapes.,  Always try to use the biggest brush possible to cover an area on your work. Premix tube paints thoroughly on the palette with enough water to make it easily spreadable, but retaining the illusion of luminosity. Have your paint transparent enough so the white of the paper shines through.,  You can do random colors or devise a color plan, keeping the painted shapes symmetrical, or the same color on both sides.  There is no correct or right way to work the window panes.  Just enjoy playing with beautiful colors and making a pleasing array of colors.

,,  This will give bold dividing lines similar to the leading in stained glass. Do this freehand. Go slowly and follow the guide lines you drew initially. Use the sharp pointed Sharpie marker for details. Look on the internet for stained glass watercolors to see how to break up larger areas of color into smaller shapes.

,  If any section needs enriching, repeat with a second coat or layer of the same or another color. Just remember to keep it sheer so the white of the paper shows through.,  Pat the section dry.  Always bear in mind to work for the illusion of light coming through the window.  If you remove too much, simply dry the piece and retouch more color onto an area.

Familiarize yourself with the types of paper available:



Weight and texture: Watercolor paper is available in a variety of weights and textures, and choosing the right paper will depend on technique as well as personal taste.",How to Choose Artists' Watercolor Paper1,"







Absorbent ability: Unlike drawing and printmaking papers, watercolor paper contains sizing, which reduces the absorption of paint into the paper itself. The pigments remain on the surface of the paper, so the colors remain brilliant. (To see this for yourself, make one watercolor painting on heavy drawing paper and another on watercolor paper.)







Cost: Watercolor paper can be very expensive, but if you want to get the best results, you've got to use the right materials. Copier/cartridge paper, sketch paper, illustration board, and other types of papers and artists' boards aren't meant to be used with watercolor, and the results will reflect that.







"
"
Understand the different qualities of texture is usually the first consideration when selecting paper.",How to Choose Artists' Watercolor Paper2," There are three general categories:



Hot-Press has a smooth surface, and is sometimes even labeled as ""Smooth."" It's your best bet if you work with fine detail, combine watercolor and fine pen-and-ink work, or use watercolor as a base for colored pencil.







Cold-Press has a noticeable texture that may not be suitable for extremely detailed work, but otherwise it's a versatile surface that lends itself to most watercolor techniques. Cold-press is the most commonly used surface, and if you're taking a beginning watercolor class your instructor will usually specify it on the supply list. There is no standard ""cold-pressed"" surface, however; the relative roughness of the paper and size of the grain varies between manufacturers. Strathmore's cold-press paper, for example, has a much larger grain, and thus a coarser appearance, than Arches.







Rough is--well, rough. It's great stuff if you're into bold brushwork and larger-scale paintings, but is generally not used by beginners.





;
"
"
Understand the importance of weight.",How to Choose Artists' Watercolor Paper3," How thick the paper is is the next thing to consider. The weight of paper is given in pounds (or grams per square metre). The higher the number, the heavier the paper.


The most commonly-used weight is 140lb (300gsm) because it works well for most artists' purposes. If you plan to work very large or use a lot of heavy washes, there are much heavier papers available; 300lb (620gsm) is also popular.






Watercolor papers as light as 90lb (200g) are available, and they are usually less expensive than 140lb. However, they often end up causing problems for beginners because they buckle once you start applying washes. Unless you know how to stretch watercolor paper, they are best avoided.







"
"
Decide in what size and format you're going to buy your paper:



Pads usually contain 12-50 sheets (depending on weight) of watercolor paper, either spiral-bound (like a sketchbook) or glued along one edge.",How to Choose Artists' Watercolor Paper4," The spiral-bound kind are great if you want to keep all of your paintings together, or are traveling and want to keep an illustrated diary that includes your paintings. The glued ones make it easier to tear off a finished painting while it's drying and start work on another. They come in a range of sizes, usually from postcard-size up to 18 x 24"" (45 x 60 cm).







Blocks contain 20-25 sheets of 140lb paper, glued together on all four sides. The advantage to blocks is that by having all four edges bound, the paper is less likely to buckle as you're painting. The thick backing board onto which the sheets of paper are bound keeps everything stable and makes it easy to hold the block of paper on your lap while working.







Sheets are a great deal if you want to try a paper without committing to an entire pad/block. You'll also end up switching to sheets if you work larger than 18 x 24"", or want to use heavier-weight papers. You can buy most brands of 140lb watercolor paper either in individual 22 x 30"" sheets, or in a package of 4-10.







Rolls are usually 44-60"" wide and 10 yards (9.1 m) long. If you love a particular paper so much you want to use it all the time, buying it buy the roll will be most economical in the long run. If you want to paint watercolors larger than 22 x 30"", buying paper by the roll and cutting it yourself will be your only recourse.







"
"
Note that there are some other important factors to consider when purchasing watercolor paper:

Acid-free paper is pretty much a given, anymore, but check the label to make sure (especially if you're buying cheap or ""student"" paper).",How to Choose Artists' Watercolor Paper5," You might end up painting something you're proud of; don't let acidic paper slowly destroy it.

Whiteness of the paper can significantly affect the look of your finished painting. Some artists like a very bright white paper; others prefer a softer off-white. Some manufacturers (such as Arches and Fabriano) offer bright white papers for those who prefer it.

Cleanliness is important when working with watercolors. There are people who can't go through the paper section of an art supply store without getting their dirty paws all over the paper. Not only are fingerprints and dirt impossible to get off paper, but the oils in people's fingerprints can mess up your painting. Buy the paper that's still sealed, or is on the bottom of the stack, and always check to make sure it's clean before buying it.

",How to Do a Watercolor of a Window Box,"  Take your own pictures of flower boxes.  Ones on storefronts are most likely fair game to photograph, but ask permission before snapping the window boxes on private property.;
,  Never copy them exactly, but taking inspiration from them is good.

, Get a pencil, ruler, eraser, an assortment of brushes, tissues or sheets of paper towel, a dry pan watercolor set, or tube paints in an array of colors with a palette.  Set up your palette and activate the paints with a little water.  This gets them moistened so they are ready when you are.

,  Leave the piece attached to the pad so the backing serves as a support board as you work., This will assist you in composing your painting.  You will need two big index cards, 5” X 8” or two sheets of heavy white paper, a ruler, pencil and scissors.  

,   Draw in 1 ¼” from two of the outside edges and cut out the two pieces. Place these pieces over your reference photo and by moving them around, try out various compositions.   When you settle on one, tape the masking pieces onto your photo with masking tape.

,  Use a ruler to get the long lines of the box. windows and siding straight.  The box will appears as a rectangle since it is being seen straight on.

,,  Again, use your ruler, making sure the vertical lines are precisely parallel to the sides of the paper.  Draw layers of moldings on the window frame where they show.  If desired, break up the glass area with smaller rectangles.

,  This will show mostly in three places, on either side of the window and below the window box.  There are numerous types of building materials, from bricks to all kinds of wood or other siding, each with its own pattern.  Indicate this lightly in pencil.

,  Double check for absolutely straight vertical and that horizontal lines. Make corrections, if necessary.  ,  You can start wherever you please. The flowers will be what is closest to the viewer, so make them generous and bursting from the box.

,  Paint leaves various shapes and sizes.  Allow the piece to dry.,  Do the siding, but try not to go overboard with precision and details.  Pick a body color for the siding and paint it lightly.  Allow it to dry.  Go back in and texture it any way you wish.  To make your job easier, pick a brush the same size as the shingles, or bricks and do them in one stroke.  Allow the piece to dry.

,  If possible, study photos of window glass with reflections.

,  If trees are reflected, pull greens onto your palette and prep them with some water to the consistency of heavy cream.  If sky is reflected, pull blues and have them ready.  Mix a puddle of dark from red, blue, and a touch of yellow.  Blue mixed with brown also makes a good dark and diluted, a good gray.  Keep all paints for the window glass fairly thick. It will go on an area that has plenty of water.  Consider using three brushes for the three colors of paint.  Keep the colors squeaky clean and let them blend by themselves on the wet window.,  Wet them with a wide brush and plain water.  Guide your brush around the flowers. Try keep the window moldings dry and free of paint, but mistakes can be corrected later, if necessary.    ,   Do strokes of green, blue and deep neutral.  Crush up a piece of tissue or paper towel and randomly blot the glass in one or two places.  Let the entire thing dry undisturbed.,  Analyze where the colors need to be intensified.  Sharpen the edges all around the windows and glass.  Use a small, pointed brush and a neutral gray or tan to straighten lines on the moldings.  If there is a lot to correct, mask the moldings and scrub them.  

, They are what will give depth. Mix a puddle of neutral gray and with a ¾” flat brush, add shadows around the windows, under the window box and under the flowers.

, Put in contrasting colored centers, veins in the leaves, creeping vines coming down from the box., The cat's body needs trimming down.,,"

Put the covering back onto the base of the ears.,
Before putting Furby back together, pop in some batteries and make sure the new ear works.,
Pop the batteries back out and reassemble your Furby.",How to Replace Furby Endoskeleton Ears," You will be using the donor's ears to replace the ear on your broken Furby.;
, Be sure to remove the outer shell too!

, Locate the base of the endoskeleton ears. Just simply follow the ear down to its gear like base. You will notice that there is a red cover over both of the bases. That needs to be unscrewed.

, Keep the screws in safe place like a cup or dish for later.

, The base of the ear should now be exposed. Just be sure to move the cluster of wires to the side so that you don't compress them.

, There will be a peg that went through the hole in the middle of the base. That is where your new ear will go.

, Now you have the ear that will be going into your working Furby.

, Just put the new ear onto the peg that held the old ear! Simple!

, Be sure to screw it in!

, If it doesn't, then the Furby's ear mechanism may be damaged and not work.

, And now he has two working ears!

Purchase two or three 2"" square rubber stamps of flowers.,
Squeeze out 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of the primary and secondary colors using tube watercolors.,
Use a 1"" flat watercolor brush to paint a color over one of the rubber stamps and press it onto the border.,
Create your fall subject.,
Paint the subject with your watercolors.,
Return to the outline of the border and make it double by drawing another line 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the first one.,
Wash in colors behind the stamped flowers on the border with watercolor.",How to Do a Fall Watercolor with a Rubber Stamped Border,"  Measure a 2 1/2"" border around all sides of a sheet of watercolor paper and mark it with pencil.;
,  Arrange these colors around the outside edge of a white plastic dinner plate or a purchased palette.  Use three brushes and pull red, yellow and green into the center and mix with enough water to get the consistency of heavy cream.

,  If necessary, tidy the stamp with a tissue and repeat.  Alternate flowers until you have printed completely around the edges of the paper.  Allow to dry.  Wait to paint the backgrounds of these flowers until you determine the color palette for the interior painting you will make next.

, You might put some wild flowers in a glass canning jar, tin can, or other rustic container and sketch them in the rectangle.  Add two or three fall vegetables, various shaped squash, corn, peppers or fruits in the foreground. 


This floral subject with veggies would make a complete composition, but here's how to make it even better: To enliven and add drama, sketch a cat sitting to one side of the flower bouquet.  Put a worm or mouse on one of the vegetables.

, Allow to dry and add a soft wash of color on the background, making the tablecloth checkered, flowered, or otherwise patterned.

,  Paint this line with a contrasting color and draw on stitches with marker as if it were a piece of ribbon or bias tape sewn onto the painting.

, With magic markers, create faux stitches separating the flowers into separate rectangles to resemble quilt squares.

Lay a sheet of watercolor paper out on a table.,
Put a small dab of any color of watercolor onto the white palette plate.

,
Get your brush lightly wet.,
Drop a couple of drops of water (from your paintbrush) onto the dab of watercolor that you have on your palette plate.,
Dip your brush into the watercolor liquid on your palette, and lift a small amount of color onto your brush.,
Let the picture dry.

,
Take a piece of watercolor paper, tape down the edges firmly on a drawing board.,
You can get a very smooth background light color by going wet into wet.,
Try letting it dry until the sheen is gone but the paper is still damp.,
Use a very simple subject at first that has broad areas of color.,
You can tell when the paper is completely dry because it will no longer feel cool.,
You can use a watercolor block that's gummed on all four sides like the top of a writing pad instead of taping your paper down.,
Try using a big wash — lots of light color — in an area.,
Try drawing on the paper with a white colored pencil, wax crayon or candle end to see the lines show up when you watercolor over them.

,
Try cutting out shapes in masking tape and painting inside those shapes to get exact shapes.,
Always paint watercolor paintings by painting the dark areas first and paint around the light areas.,
Try ""glazing."",
Read books and articles on watercolor and try the ideas in them.",How to Approach Watercolor Painting As a Beginner," Draw some very simple design on it with light pencil marks. A square or circle is a good idea.;
,, If there is too much water in the brush, dab it on the towel to soak up the excess, or lightly shake the excess out of the brush.

, Don't use too much — just enough to make the watercolor liquid.

, Next, paint this inside the shape drawn on your paper. If the paint is too thick, and stays in one place, dip your brush into the water again and add a little more water to the paint on the paper. Keep experimenting with different amounts of water versus paint mixtures to get a feel for just the right amount of water versus paint you desire. If you want a ""dry brush"" look, you will use less water on your brush versus the amount of paint. If you want a very wet flowing look, you will want more water versus paint. Fill in the shape with color on your paper.

,, Using a big brush or a sponge, get it wet all over. Then try painting into that with different colors. As the paper dries, observe the different ways the paint reacts with how much water there is on the paper.

, Colors mingle with each other on the paper easily and some colors migrate more than others. Try laying down stripes of blue, then a stripe of yellow or gold next to it, then a stripe of red after the gold when it's very wet. You'll see the mixtures your colors create as they form a smooth gradation.

, Now your strokes will still be soft edged but a little more defined. Once the color's down, let it dry completely and then add details wet on dry.

, Mix some sky blue. Mark some hills and a tree in your sketch lines. First paint them in loosely wet in wet. Then start adding some large details wet on damp. Finally add all the smallest details with wet on dry when it's completely dry.

, Hold the back of your hand over the painting, but do not touch it. It takes a little practice to really feel the dampness this way, but touching your painting could damage it or leave skin oils on it. Don't remove the tape around the edges until it's completely flat and dry. The tape is what's keeping the paper flat or flattening it out again when it bubbles up.

, It's a little more expensive but very convenient for a beginner.

, Then shake salt in it before it dries. You'll get some beautiful effects that you can use to make snowflakes in the sky or lichen on rocks.

,, Anything you mask with masking tape will stay clean and white.

, Paint around or mask anything you need to keep white. Getting used to ""negative painting"" like this will also help you get more accurate outlines to objects than trying to draw the object itself. Try drawing just the shape of the space around the cup exactly and the shape of the space within the handle instead of drawing the cup. You'll see a big difference in accuracy!

, Once a watercolor mark or area is completely dry, mix a thin wash of another color and paint over it quickly. It will change the color and, if you do it carefully, won't disturb the details you painted under it. A light gold glaze on sunlit areas in a landscape can make the sunlight look much richer.

, Watch videos on YouTube and other places to get ideas for watercolor techniques. Then paint something you really like. A good type of painting that translates well to watercolor is Sumi-E or Japanese ink painting — those strokes and techniques are just as beautiful in watercolor.

, Get a pair of scissors and make a small snip in it on both sides of the zipper.

, Now remove it from the Furby. Or if you'd like, you can cut all the way around Furby's bottom, but you will need to remove the zipper later.

, You may have to pull hard the first time if you cut all the way around because the fur is in the zipper.


Once you are past the lip that keeps the fur on, just keep pulling up until you reach the faceplate.

, Once at the faceplate, you will either see that there are 2 screws holding on the faceplate or that there is glue holding it on. If there are screws, unscrew them from the side. If it is glued on, take scissors and cut the inside of the fur from the faceplate.

, Pull the fur up until you get to the very end of the endoskeleton ears.

Assemble basic watercolor supplies.,
Purchase a live pansy plant, if possible.,
Look at coloring pages of pansies also.,
Sketch some pansies in pencil.,
Locate the center most point of the flower.,
Count the number of petals and how they are positioned.,
Draw the stems lightly, even if they eventually won't be visible.,
Ask and answer the artist's age-old questions about your subject and background.,
Get your watercolor paper and begin your layout.,Do simple, free form circles for the outermost shape of each blossom.,
Find the center of each blossom.,
Have the petals grow out from the center point.,
Remember, be a little whimsical, let the pansies dance.

,
Note how the outer edges of the petals touch the circle.,
Draw the leaves.,
Wet the blossom carefully with clean water and a pointed  brush.,
Drop a spot of color onto the flower, at the center point.,
Take good care of your pansy plants.",How to Paint Pansies in Watercolor,"  Either tube or good quality pan colors work fine if you remember to activate them with some clear water before using. Gather as many purples and violet tubes as you can find. This is one color, that while it is possible to mix from the primaries, getting all the shades and nuances of color requires pre-mixed tubes of paint.


In addition to paints, you will need an assortment of watercolor or all purpose artist's brushes in various sizes. Find an ordinary pencil, an eraser, an 11"" X 14"" piece of watercolor paper, a support board, a water bucket and tissues.;
,  The internet has pictures galore.  Google free stock pictures to see the wide variety of colors of the pansy.

,  They will give you ideas for containers for the plant and how to compose your page.

,  If you have the real thing, look closely at it and try to replicate the features of the plant, the clusters of blossoms, the greenery, stems, buds and even a blossom past its prime and wilting. These preliminary information gathering sketches will help you understand the flower better and give you confidence for starting a painting of it.

,  Surprisingly, it might be a little off exact center.

, There are five, two sets of smaller ones and a larger one underneath. Look closely to see this in actuality, but don't worry about it too much. Just do five petals, overlapping them slightly.

, Have the stem, even though it is hidden beneath the flower begin at the center point of the flower. Note how slender it is and that is can curve slightly.

,  What type of container will the pansies be in?  Will they be in a garden, planted in the earth?  What other flowers might surround them?

Think about the background and begin to get ideas for how you will paint it.

, Lightly sketch how you want the overall painting to look.,,  Draw a small circle for the center. Paint it yellow, let it dry and mask it out to preserve the brightness of the yellow. Use a dot of masking fluid or a spot of masking tape you've torn to shape., Erase the parts of the circle you made for a guide where it isn't needed.,, Give them wavy edges., Leaves function to join the colorful blossoms so have some of each plant touch the others. Show a part of a stem in a few places. Those spindly stems will help to guide the viewer's eye through the painting.

, This is the point where magic occurs.

, Use thick paint because the paper is wet. Watch as it spreads across the wet petal but try to let the paint do it's thing as it reacts to the water.

,  They are a lasting flower and can even withstand a lot very cool temperatures when planted outdoors.  Having a pansy painting, though, allows you to enjoy the sweet face of the pansy all year 'round.

,  Fill them with water tinted with food coloring.

,  Place it in either landscape or portrait orientation.  Just plan to place the vases high enough in your composition to allow for space to show the cast shadows.

,  Watercolors in either tubes or pans work fine.  Add an assortment of all purpose or watercolor brushes, water, a pencil, eraser, masking fluid/frisket, lined composition paper, scissors and tissues.  Place all supplies on the side of your dominant hand to avoid dripping on your painting as you work.

,  Use a few glass vases or jars in varying colors and shapes.

,,  Try various light sources; strong day light coming from behind, light from a lamp placed on one side, or use ""artistic license"" and make up a dramatic light source by using your imagination.

,  They will most likely be found at the object's edges.  These darks and lights will define the shape of your objects.

,  Things behind might be distorted.,  Be careful to keep each side of the vases even and having the exact curvature.  Make perfect agreement your goal and make refinements as needed.

,  Fold a piece of lined, school paper in half lengthwise and draw one side of the vase.  Cut through both layers to create a template of each vase or jar.

,  Try various compositions.

,  Remove the templates and refine your drawing.  Add thickness at the bottom and mouths of the jars, finish the ellipses at top and bottom, too.  If there are swirls or decorations on the vases, draw that, as well.

, This rubber medium will reserve the white highlights on the edges of the objects. Allow it to dry thoroughly.

, Paint a transparent, sheer wash of color over each vase. Let the brush skip over the vase to create some lively white shapes on the vase. Let this first layer dry thoroughly. Use a hair dryer if you wish.

, Mix a darker value of each color and paint the dark highlights. Each pure white highlight must be accented with a very dark highlight. Let your strokes skip and be broken to avoid outlining., Use a ruler and have the line go right through the vases. This will help with the illusion of transparency.,, Dark gray or even black is a great way to show off the colored vases.

, Mix the same color you used for the vase and touch a brush loaded with that color to the bottom edge of the vase. Run a splashy expanse of plain, clean water in the foreground and allow the wet paint to fill the wet area without helping it. Keep each shadow separate by drying it before attempting to do another. If they overlap slightly as you paint them, they will remain separate, clear shapes if done on dry paper, next to a dry painted area. Dry the piece thoroughly., Stand up the piece and step away from it to view it with a critical eye., Follow that with a swiggle of plain water to create a light shadow., Remove the masking fluid with a piece of honeycomb, rubber carpet backing, a rubber cement lifter, or your finger., Try this project again. Possibilities are endless and after your first attempt your confidence will grow and it will show in the painting.

, Have them face opposite directions. Oval bodies, round heads with peaks at the crown, tail and wings. Omit the feet for the present time to keep the shapes compact. Cut them out and set them aside.

, Get a variety of widths and spaces between them. At the top, have them branch out. Tear strips of beige masking tape, and mask the tree trunks. Tear, or cut a strip of tape lengthwise for narrow trees. Press down well. Cut and tear shorter, tapered pieces and make branches at the tops of the trees.


Alternatively, if the idea of masking isn't to your liking, paint around the trees as in the tree on the far right.

, Split into forks at the end.

, You'll be overlapping the masked trees.,, Mix with water to the consistency of milk. Paint the blue in long strokes from top to bottom. The blues ought be dense enough to cover in one stroke, but not opaque. Add in some greens. Air dry or use a hairdryer.

, If you have not used #140 cold press paper, do this step very carefully, as the tape might tear the paper. If the paint has bled under the tape, lift it off with a round bristle brush you have cut to 1/4"". Or use a purchased ""scrub"" brush.

, Details such as the wings, beak, feet, mask on the face. Draw a tiny circle for the eyes at the edge of the mask, to remember to paint around them. If you forget, just use white paint to add them later., Dilute the paint with water to the consistency of milk and fully load your brush, not scrimping on paint. Let it dry before doing the orange beaks and feet and the black mask.

, Run a line of brown paint down one side and let it bleed into the wet area. Use the end of a flat brush to stamp the horizontal lines on the trunks.

, Whatever appeals to you. Run ivy around one of the trunks.

, Add only enough water to make the paint resemble heavy cream. Fully load a large, flat brush, and tap it against the handle of another large brush. Practice first on a scrap paper until you get the hang of it.

, The green is a good contrast to the red birds.

Purchase a handful of ripe cherries from the store.,
Set up your still life arrangement.,
Keep the cherries as the central theme since they are the subject.,

If you wish to add a background, do it at this point.,
Add final touches.,
Again, prop up the painting, step back and study it.,
Hang up your painting.",How to Paint Luscious Cherries in Watercolor," Pick through to find perfect ones at their prime. They come in a variety of colors, from yellow, to bright orange-red, to deep maroon. Select what appeals to you or get an assortment of colors. Search for cherries that still have their stems. If a leaf isn’t attached, do your online research to see how they are shaped, their color and their size compared to the round fruit.;
, Place the objects you intend to paint close to where you will be working. You will need to see your subject clearly, up close and in good light.

, Include, however, an extra item or two to add interest to the arrangement. For example; an interesting bowl or container. Glass will have the bonus of being transparent so you can paint what you see through it. Silver or other metallic objects will be reflective, and the reflections will add an eclectic touch to the work.

, Bunch and swirl the cloth slightly to add interesting folds. These folds can act as lines to lead the viewer’s eye through the painting. Keeping the cloth simple will insure that focus remains on the fruit.

, Any type or style is fine; dry pads or tube colors squeezed onto a clean palette.

, Use a page from a watercolor pad or a quarter sheet (approximately 11” X 14”) of good watercolor paper. Select an array of watercolor brushes, including small, medium and large pointed ones, a soft watercolor mop or wash brush, a ¾ inch flat, angled style, and a liner brush. Use a deli container filled with water for activating and diluting colors and rinsing your brush. Have tissues or paper towels handy., Start with the cherries as circles, keeping them life size. Cluster and overlap some but allow a few stray ones to be apart from the central mass. The stems ought to go off in many directions. Add leaves to fill blank spots or at the edges of the cluster of cherries. If adding a dish or vase, sketch it in.

, Highlights will help, so on each cherry draw a small circle for the highlight to be left unpainted. If desired save the white of the paper by using a drop of masking fluid or frisket. Or, simply plan to paint around the small light spots.


A second way to give the illusion of roundness on the cherries is by controlling the light falling on the objects. Decide which direction the light is coming from and be consistent as you paint the objects. Keep the side nearest the light source lighter, almost to the point of looking washed out, than the opposite side. If you can’t actually see such dramatic light, fake it.

, Charge your brush with paint and touch it to the side in shadow, or the side away from the light source. The water will carry the color over the entire cherry shape. The richest deposit of color will be on the shadow side, with the color diluted and lighter on the opposite side. Add another touch of red paint on the dark side. Remember to make the strokes semi-circular to mimic the round shape of the cherry.

, Again, work to get three values of red on each cherry; the palest pink on the light side, mid-tones and the darkest, richest color on the shadow side., Pull a tiny, rounded shape of color down from the cherry to form a subtle shadow. Do this in one swish of the brush and don’t try to alter or edit the shadow. Try to have it connected to the cherry at one point. If the red from the cherry is too bright for a shadow, dab it lightly with a tissue to lighten it. Or add a tiny touch of green to neutralize and gray it.

, Wet some leaves and work others on dry paper. Use a variety of greens; ranging from yellow-green, to dark green. Again, keeping three values of green. While wet, scratch in the vein pattern with the sharp edge of an old plastic credit card or paint the veins with a tiny, pointed brush. Do the central vein first as a wavy line to give the illusion that the leaf is alive, curving and twisting slightly. Or, do a combination of both techniques and do the tributary veins coming off the main one.

, They are slightly fatter at the far end and ideally will appear as three values of brown. Angle them in all directions. Allow to piece to dry.

, Using a pencil, indicate lines where the fabric flows out from beneath the cherries. Add an interesting edging to the drape, if desired. Paint shadows in the cloth with diluted, neutral brown or gray. Soften one edge by running a line of water along the gray shadow.

, To give the illusion of a silver container, paint along the object's edges in shades of gray. Show some reflections. Red cherries, green leaves and stems might be reflected, but to give the illusion of distance, do only one or two of the reflected cherries realistically and have others fade away appearing as loose spots.



To indicate that the container is glass, show hints of the colors and shapes that are behind it. Again, paint the glass only at the object's edges. Allow the piece to dry.

, Put a contrasting color or deep neutral in the space above the drape. Again, let the painting dry.

, Use a liner brush or a small pointed brush loaded with a dark shade of paint. Analyze what needs to be accented within the cherry grouping, leaves and vessel. Draw these dark lines with a fine, pointed brush. Keep the drawn lines to a minimum and try not to outline whole shapes., Let it dry overnight and study it from a distance again. Do touch ups again, but, keep them minimal., It will remind you of the beauty of nature all year long."

, Put dark shapes against light ones and vice versa., In the middle third of your paper, put some interesting and more complicated things. This is where the ""focal point"" or ""center of interest"" is located. This should fall slightly off center and be interesting enough to capture and hold the viewer's interest.

Think what the center of interest, or in this painting, the foothills, might contain. Hikers, mountain climbers preparing for their ascent, people camping in tents or a cabin. Wild animals such as cougars, coyotes or mountain lions. Tame animals such as mules, sheep or goats.
Picturing a ski lodge might come to the mind of the athletically inclined. In the mountains, you might have a ski lift with ski trails winding down it.

, Waterfalls of all types, water crashing over the rocks. Or, possibly a meandering stream emptying into a serene lake.

, Block in shapes lightly, omitting details. Use one of your small sketches as a guide, if you wish., Add details, as many as you want in the picture., Drop water on the dry pads or squeeze from the tubes a range of primary and secondary colors. If using tube paints, place the primary and secondary colors around the edges of your palette to keep the center free for mixing. Moisten them with a small amount of water.

, Brushes, tissues, a water bucket, and a board to support your paper. If you plan to work large areas wet, tape the paper to the board with masking tape.,, This is why many mountains appear pale blue or lavender. Those colors recede and appear further away.

, This wash should flow easily over the paper, so work from a puddle of color you have already mixed. To assure the freshness of your painting and to show the mountains as the sparkling gems they are, try to keep a soft touch as you apply paint.

, This helps show the texture of weeds, grasses, bare rock and many other applications. Use dry brush or scumbling to enliven an area by contrasting a roughed up area with a smooth one. Find many ways to make use of your brush., Use a hairdryer to hasten drying. Then, using a soft wash brush, slide on a second layer of color. Strive to keep the mountains glistening and fresh., It's bound to give you food for thought and a departure from every day routine. Armchair travel can happen through art and might open new vistas for actual exploration. At any rate, painting a mountain scene is fun and the result lasting.

Purchasing acrylic paint is one of the rare instances in which it is better to splurge and get a pricier brand, such as Golden or Liquitex. Cheap brands of acrylic paint aren’t as thickly pigmented as the more expensive brands, and will therefore require 2-3 more coats of paint to get the same vibrancy and color of a single coat of a higher priced paint brand.


To start, buy the most basic colors: titanium white, mars black, ultramarine blue, alizarin crimson, and yellow ochre. Most of the paint colors you'll need can be made from a combination of those few hues. As you paint more and more, you'll know which colors you want to add to your collection.
Tubes of paint are typically preferred by beginners because you can purchase smaller quantities to start, but there is no difference in quality between a tube or a jar of acrylic paint.;
, Paintbrushes are rather diverse and are categorized by two factors: the shape of the brush tip, and the material of the bristles. There are three different brush tip types: flat, rounded, and filbert (rounded and flat). There are many materials used to make paintbrush bristles, but the most common are synthetic and boar hair. Most beginner painters prefer synthetic brushes in an assortment of tip points.


Visit an art supply store and feel a few different brushes for a good idea of what you prefer. Synthetic brushes are softer and easier to clean than real fur brushes.
Unless you’re in it for the long run, don't splurge on the paintbrushes. Although having good paint brushes to work with can be beneficial, it is more important to have quality paint.

, You’ll need something to mix paint on, and to store paint on between painting sessions. If you’re feeling frugal, a paper or plastic plate will work just fine. Any wide, flat, clean surface can be used as a workable palette. However, because acrylic paints dry so incredibly fast, it may be beneficial to invest in a stay-wet palette. These incorporate a wet sponge and special stay-wet paper that keeps your paint moist and workable for several weeks at a time.


Keep plastic wrap or another cover of some sort on hand to preserve paint on your palette that you aren't using at the time.
If you’re mixing large quantities of paint at once, it may be beneficial to have small cups/lids to store your paint between sessions. This will better preserve the acrylics than a plastic wrap covered palette.

, Acrylic paint is thick and heavy, and therefore can only be used on a few surfaces. The most common and popular acrylic surfaces are stretched canvas or canvas board, watercolor paper, or treated wood. You should have success painting on anything that isn’t greasy, oily, nor very porous.If you’re afraid of painting on something expensive, start with watercolor paper and work your way up to canvas or wood.

, With all of the aforementioned big-ticket items out of the way, you will need a few additional items that you likely have in your home. You will need 1-2 jars/cups for water, a palette knife, an old rag or cloth, a misting spray bottle for water, and soap to clean your paint brushes. These are all available in art supply stores if you don’t happen to have them, but none of them need to be specialty items.Because acrylic paints dry notoriously fast, mist your painting/palette from time to time to keep the paints moist.Consider wearing a smock or old shirt while painting to prevent staining your clothes with the acrylics.
Some painters like to lay down newspapers on their tabletops to prevent large messes.

, As with most things, painting is done best in natural light. Set up your painting station near an open window or a room that has a lot of natural light. You’ll be able to see small nuances in your brush strokes and colors that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to pick out.

, Each artist has their own way of setting up their supplies, but it is best to get them all placed how you like them before you start painting. Fill your jars with water, get out the paintbrushes and paints you want to use, and put your palette in the most ideal location. You may want to put on your smock or old t shirt at this time as well.

, As a beginner painter, you may have an idea of what you want to paint, or you may be looking for some direction. Think about possible subjects or models you could use for your first painting. It is easiest to work from a 3-D object or photograph, rather than putting paint to something a mental picture. If you’re not sure what to paint, easy paint subjects for beginners include:


A bowl of fruit
A vase of flowers
Objects in your home
A sunrise/sunset, If you feel confident in your ability to paint exactly what you see, then you can go ahead and jump right into the painting. Most people, however, require an outline to follow along with their paint brush. Use a regular pencil to roughly sketch the outline of major shapes directly onto your canvas; don’t worry about details or shading too much.


You can do multiple sketches on paper before ever turning to do one on canvas, just to make sure you are confident with your drawing of your subject.

, It is a common mistake to mix paints as you work, rather than mixing them all before you start. Use your time and paint efficiently by mixing all your paints - in all the colors you need - prior to starting your painting. In this case, it is better to be safe than sorry by mixing more paints than you are likely to use. You can store extra paint for future paintings, but it will be nearly impossible to mix the exact shade of paint twice.


Use a color wheel as a helpful reference for mixing your paints. All the basic colors can be made by mixing the primary hues (red, blue, and yellow), and more specific colors can be made by mixing the primary and secondary hues.
Remember, if you can’t get the exact shade of paint that you’re looking for with a limited paint palette, you can purchase nearly any color pre-mixed in tube or jar form from an art supply store.

, Color changes depending on the way light hits it, so before you begin painting your subject, locate the primary light source. Pay attention to this throughout the painting process; you should have lighter colors nearer the light source and darker colors further away. It may seem elementary, but picking out the light source before you begin will help keep your colors on track.

, Even if you’re only painting a single object, it must be layered with other surfaces or backgrounds. Look over your subject and determine what is nearest to you and what is furthest from you. Pay attention to overlapping, color changes, and texture. You will be recreating each of these things in your painting, so make sure you have a good idea of how to do it prior to starting.

, When you paint, you will be layering upwards; therefore, painting from the back to the front is the easiest method. Start with your medium value colors, followed by your darkest colors, and then brightest, for the easiest application.

, Finish building up the basic colors, and then add details to the background. If it is a solid color, you should add shadows and light points. If your background is patterned or busy, add texture and movement with brush strokes in order to complete the layer.

, As you begin to paint your subject, break it up into identifiable shapes and paint those in solid hues. As you build up shapes and colors, your subject will begin to appear. Work in small sections at a time, to make the painting process a bit less daunting.


Some beginner painters find it easy to use a grid system when painting their subject. Split up your canvas into parts using an imaginary grid, and paint an entire grid space to finality before moving onto the next one.
Remember to add medium value colors first, followed by darker, and then lighter colors. It is hard to go over a dark color with a light one, so working in this way will make layering of hues much easier.

, When you’ve gotten the basic colors and shapes added, you can add the details with a few different painting techniques. These each focus on adding texture and movement through different paintbrush strokes and color applications.


Stipple on paint by holding your paint brush vertically and tapping it onto the paper. This works best with a dry paintbrush and a small amount of paint, and will give the appearance of many small dots.
Use a palette knife to sweep on broad strokes of color. For a rough, unedited paint look, paint with a palette knife. Coat the knife in a thick layer of paint, and move it across your canvas to load up thick layers of textured paint.
Create a wash of color by thinning your paint with water. This gives an effect similar to watercolors, where the paint gradually lightens on your canvas. This is great for creating a gradation effect., Paying close attention to your subject matter, add any finishing details you think are necessary to perfect your painting. Often this includes last dabs of light and dark, any outlines you may want to include, and finishing washes of color., Although it isn’t required, many painters add a finishing coat of varnish to seal the acrylic paints. This helps the paint to chemically bond to the canvas, and protects it better from damage.

, It is imperative that you clean your paint brushes right after finishing up with them. Acrylic paint can severely damage and ruin paint brushes if left to dry in the bristles. Wash the brushes with cold water and soap until the water runs clear (warm/hot water will set the paint in the brushes). Wipe up any paint on your painting surface, and rinse the jars with water.

, Acrylic paint will last for several months in an air-tight container, so if you have any extra set it aside for a future painting. Scoop the paint into small containers with lids, or seal it into your stay-wet palette.

, Place your painting in a location to dry for 1-2 days. Acrylic paints have a very short dry time, but they should be left in an area where they won’t be disturbed in order to cure.

, Art is meant to be shared, so showcase your newly finished acrylic painting so that others can see your handiwork. Have it matted and framed if it is on paper or canvas board, or simply hang it in your home.

Make a list of words that represent the season.,
Look in magazines, online and in newspapers to see how others depict autumn.,
Cut a long strip, approximately 6"" X 14"" or use a piece of 11"" X 14"" watercolor paper from a pad.,
Draw freehand squares and rectangles, as many as you wish, any size you like, to use for your miniature ""snapshots"" or paintings of autumn.,
Fill each space with something that represents fall.,
Start by filling a shape with a fat pumpkin, if you are having difficulty facing those blank canvases.,
Set up a palette of primary and secondary tube watercolors.,
Keep the hues of fall in mind as you begin to color your design.,
Get started by working on the main elements of each scene.,
Keep on painting until all miniature scenes are complete.,
To do smaller details, consider outlining them with markers.,
Stand up your paper.,
Keep in mind that any background you pick can be altered, even drastically changed.,
Allow the piece to dry overnight and evaluate it again.,
Enjoy your foray into fall.",How to Celebrate Fall Through Mini Watercolors,"  Just close your eyes and write what comes to mind as you think the word, ""autumn."";
,  Ads closely track trends and are illustrated with nice photographs.  Newspapers list fall events.  Clothing ads show cooler weather apparel.  Keep these pictures as references as you work.,  Either format will work well and give you an opportunity to fill the space with many of your favorite fall things.

, Use a pencil and break up the space on the entire paper.  Make various shapes.

, The possibilities are endless, but go back to your list of words and clipping for inspiration.

,  In another space, draw a fallen leaf.  Add apples on branches in another space and keep going until all frames are filled.,  If desired, use a set of watercolors with dry pads you need to moisten and activate with water.  You could also use water-soluable or regular colored pencils.  Colored markers would be fun, too.  Or, do a mixture of all those media.

,  This is an opportunity to showcase the warm colors;  orange, red, red-violet, gold, rust, brown and yellow.  Contrast them with the cooler ones from the opposite side of the color wheel.  Blue, green, blue-violet, an an array of neutrals from pale gray to black.  These will highlight the warmer, brighter colors.

,  Use the brightest and boldest colors to bring out the subject of each rectangle.  Then color the backgrounds for each, working right up to the border.

,  How detailed to make your painting is up to you.  Any approach you pick is acceptable and will show your own personality and style.

,  Either black Sharpie or permanent colored markers.  A small, pointed brush can be used for detail work, too.

,  Take a look at your work from a distance and decide what to do with the white paper around the mini-paintings.  Anything you do is fine, including leaving it unpainted.  An all-over treatment of color will unify your page.

,  Paint another color, up to three, layers over thoroughly dry paint.  Or, to remove color, use a scrub brush or a piece of white kitchen cleaning sponge called a Magic Eraser., As the paper dries, the piece will brighten but the watercolors will appear slightly fainter.  Go back in at this point and heighten any colors that need it, add more detail, and remember to intermingle colors throughout the scene.  Do this by touching small areas with the color of another area.,  Don't be sad if you can't really have haystacks, scarecrows or smoking leaf piles at hand because through art, all things are possible.  Even a row of noisy crows."

Do some research on the type of Furby you'd like.,
Decide if you'd like an original 1998 Furby.,
Decide if you'd enjoy caring for a toy more like a baby then a friend or pet.,
Make a decision on whether you want a real Furby or a Furby Friend.,
Decide if you'd like your Furby to be more interactive.,
Decide whether you want an older Furby or a newer one.,
Think about whether you'd like a smaller Furby.,
Decide if you'd like a colorful and modern Furby.,
Decide if you'd like something slightly different than a classic Furby.",How to Choose the Perfect Furby1," There are nine types of Furbys. There are the original 1998 Furbys, the 1999 Furby Babies, the 2001 Shelbys, the 2005 Emototronic Furbys, the 2012 Furbys, the Furby Party Rockerz, the Furby Booms, the Furblings, and Furbacca. Research pictures and videos of these Furbys to decide on a favorite. All of these are very different, and this is important to note when choosing your Furby.
, Original 1998 Furbys are ideal for a new Furby owner. They are simple to operate and easy to learn to care for. If you decide on getting an original Furby, you can choose from seven different generations. Please note that many original Furbys will no longer start up when they are new in box. If you do not know how to repair a Furby, try finding one in working condition., Furby Babies are very similar to original Furbys, except that they are smaller and have additional ""baby"" vocabulary. Furby Babies are best for more experienced owners, as they require more attention than most Furbys do. If you choose a Furby Baby, you have four generations to choose from. Like original Furbys, some new in box Babies no longer work., If you'd like a Furby friend, then you might like a Shelby! The Shelby is a toy from the makers of Furby. Shelby is a clam, and was released in two different generations. Shelbys are also for the more experienced owner, as they do require lots of attention. Many Shelbys are still in working order, and you have a good chance of getting one to work from the box., Emototronic Furbys are the most interactive Furbys. The Emototronic Furby was a new variation of Furby which included more facial expression and voice recognition. These Furbys will respond to commands and are a good Furby for a first time owner, as they have an off switch and don't require much care. There are many colors to choose from, and many of these Furbys are still in working order., If you'd like a newer one, then the 2012 Furby is a great choice. 2012 Furby was a re-release of the original toy. 2012 Furby has LED eyes, and can change personalities. This Furby even has an app for Apple and Android devices, from which you can feed and communicate with the Furby. These Furbys are a bit harder to care for, and may not be a good choice for a first time owner. Almost all of these Furbys are still in working order and ready to play!, Furby Party Rockerz were another toy released in the Furby line in 2013. They were smaller, and would become more wild when you shake them. They also respond to the Furby app. Despite their small size, Party Rockerz are quite difficult to care for, and are very sensitive to movement. They will often wake up if you walk past them. These Furbys come in a few different variations, and almost all still work. But this Furby may not be the best choice for a first time owner. If you are still interested in a small Furby, then a Furbling is a great choice. They aren't the most interactive, and only respond when you pet its head. They come in all of the same colors as the Furby Boom, and are a great choice for a first time owner!, The Furby Boom was released in 2013 and came in multiple colorful patterns. Like the 2012 Furby, Furby Boom has LED eyes and multiple personalities. Furby Boom has its own app, where you hatch and raise Furblings, as well as care for your Furby Boom. Furby Boom can also be very sensitive to movement, but is a good choice for an experienced owner. All of these Furbys will work unless they have some sort of manufacturing defect., Furbacca is a Furby based off of the Star Wars character, Chewbacca. It features Chewbacca's shaggy brown fur, and belt. Furbacca even speaks Wookie! He has his own app, where you can hatch and raise Star Wars Furblings, as well as care for Furbacca. Furbacca is lots of fun, and is great for any Star Wars fan!"
"Once you've chosen which type of Furby you'd like to get, it's time for you to get one!,
Consider the price range you'd like to pay.,

If you are willing to pay a bit more, then you can get a Furby new in box., You can only find Furby Boom, Furbacca, and Furblings in stores. Any other Furby must be obtained online. EBay and Amazon are great places to find Furbys!, But if you are up to the challenge of a repair, consider purchasing one new in box., If you ordered one, track the package so that you will know when your Furby will arrive. If you purchased one from a store, then you can just take it home!,"

Wait for 15 to 30 minutes for the hair to dry.,
Done.",How to Style a My Little Pony's Hair," It is best if the pony has regular hair, as this is the easiest to work with. If it has tinsel hair, be aware it will be harder to style because the tinsel irritates the hair and messes it up. The instructions, if followed carefully, should still help to make it look as neat as it was before you took it out of the box.;
, Fill it up with water. For conditioning, add some shampoo and soap to the water, or maybe conditioner, if you'd like to go that far.

, Get a brush, pony-sized, and some rubber bands. You will need these to do a good job of styling.


The brush is for brushing the hair afterwards, to remove tangles and straighten it out.
The rubber bands are for styling: when you brush their hair, and it is still quite wet, maybe you could put the hair in a style and fasten it in place with the rubber bands. The hair will dry that way and virtually stay that way, or if you try a ponytail, bun or braid, you will need the rubber bands to fasten them.

, Rub the shampoo into the pony's hair for a while, until it seems softer and more conditioned. Leave the pony to float for a while, roughly 15 to 30 minutes. If the hair still seems bad after that, leave it there for another 15 to 30 minutes.

, Some of the tinsel may be floating around, if you're styling a tinsel mane. That's okay! The less tinsel there is, the less ratty the pony's hair will be in future.

, Brush the mane hair until it's at a desirable straightness. Grab the rubber bands.


Some tinsel may rip out of the pony's head. Don't panic! A little less tinsel won't hurt.

, Maybe you'll chose a sophisticated bun style. Or maybe a braid. Or perhaps a ponytail? Or maybe you want to do something extra special. Whatever it may be, fasten the hair in place with the rubber bands.

, The wet hair will dry in the place of the hairstyle, and when you remove the rubber bands, it may stay that way. Unless it's a bun, ponytail or braid that you want to remain in place, remove the rubber bands from the pony.

, You've just styled your pony's hair.

, You need to have a script so you are not quiet trying to think of a name or trying to guess the next line.

, For a series you should have 5-8 LPS, for a movie or Halloween special you should have 4-7.

, Your characters should have names, so you need to write down their names. Ex: Brown cat: June Brown, White Great Dane: Josh Bell.

, Plots help you know what materials you need. Without a plot, you will just make things up and your movie will most likely turn out badly.

You can be as free as you wish. (How about a demon unleashed from the underworld?) Be sure to follow some of the general rules for good.

, Notes can help you with your movie. Scripts are more for the strict director, but notes let you be free with your plot.

Name the video. For example, LPS: Apocalypse or LPS: Haunted.

, Set up the kitchen or the bedroom. If you can, use the houses turned to look like walls to separate each room.

, You need to find a quiet room where you can focus. Tell you parents or if you have siblings to stay out of your room. After that you need a flat surface, like a desk or window seat. Do not film on the floor. Even if it is a hard wood floor don't, you want the film to look as professional as possible.

, You need to have your things all laid out. Have the LPS furniture all lined up and the houses all lined up so you can choose what you want.

, Scrapbook paper covering a binder can be a good background.

, For that scary look add some cobwebs or trash on the house or room. You want the video to be scary.

Make fake blood if needed. There are many ways to make LPS fake blood. Of course, you can just grab a red marker and scribble all over them, but there are more realistic ways people make fake blood. For instance, red food coloring and glue. Making realistic fake blood helps you in views.

, Use a lamp for extra lighting so people can see the video.

, Once all this is finished you can start filming, don't forget to follow the script.

, After you are all done you can edit. For a good looking video use a nice edit system, use back round music and have a title. For the scary part you want to add effects to make it sound like the doors are creaking and foot steps.

Think of things that associate with your pet.,
Once you've listed down associated words, think of some other words that connect.,
From a colour comes everything.,
Name your pet after a plant or flower.,
Think of any object or item, but make it reasonable.",How to Create Names for Your Littlest Pet Shop Toys1," What colour are they? What kind of things do they like? Write these things down along with your pet's species.;
, For example, if you have an orange LPS, you could get fire from orange and from fire you can get Blaze, Flame, Spark, Ash, Cinder. If you're stuck with this type of thing, consider the other options.

, Colours are really helpful in a naming situation. If your pet has blue eyes, you could look up some shades of blue. If you find a nice sounding name for a shade of the colour of your choosing, you could give it to your LPS as their name. Google some other shades of colours.


Some shades of blue are- Azure, Ocean Blue, Sky Blue and Cyan.
Some shades of purple are- Violet, Indigo, Grape and Lilac.

, I have named my pink horse Lotus. Think of your pets personality- if it were snappy, you wouldn't call it Petal, would you? It would more likely be Thorn or Thistle than Petal. Don't know any plants or flowers? Search some up or go outside.

, You could use objects such as a piano or cushion or a book to help give you inspiration for pet names, but don't use anything silly like a toilet or a fish tank (well, maybe if it's a fish or something).

Use a human name for your LPS.,
Research possibilities online.,
Think about where your pet is from.",How to Create Names for Your Littlest Pet Shop Toys2," Names such as Rachel or Kristine for girls, and Luke and Ray for boys. You could also use unisex names like Reece, Alex and Jess.

, Websites like 2000 Names or Baby Names may help. They have huge lists of names for you to use, male and female. They even have names from different countries.

, Maybe it's from Japan or maybe even Italy? Look up names from the country you choose. Sometimes they lost meanings as well, so keep meanings in mind as well. Don't have a tough husky having a name meaning 'flower' or 'beauty', for example.

Littlest Pet Shop has a lot of varieties, from bunnies to ostriches.;
, You can buy big houses like the ""Biggest Littlest Pet Shop,"" the ""Pets Only! Club House,"" or make the houses yourself. You can do so with cardboard shoe boxes or any other material around your home. You might also want to make furniture.


Some pets come with their own beds, but some also come with nothing.
You might want to try making them tiny TVs, couches, stoves, toiletries, etc.

, Fill a sink, small bowl, or glass with warm water. Then, get the toy wet. Take it out, and lather it in soap. Then, put it into the water again, and make sure all the water comes off. Dry it off well, to avoid rust.

, Make sure you have a comfortable bag for your Littlest Pet Shop. Pack a few things for him/her! For example, if you are going on a picnic with your friends/family, bring a little blanket and some food! Or if it's a sleepover, pack a little blanket and a teddy bear and toothpaste and a toothbrush.

, Most sets have ""food"" like apples, carrots, or bones. Get all your food and see which one would fit your pet best. If you had a hamster, and gave it a bone, that wouldn't be the smartest thing to do.

, Celebrate your pet's birthday, which is the day you bought it. If you aren't sure of this date, just choose a random day or your own birthday. If you have friends that are into Littlest Pet Shop too, invite them to the party and tell them to bring some of their pets, and a present if it's a birthday party. But don't make a lame party!

",How to Condition Hair of My Little Pony Toys," Be careful not to get water inside their bodies or to the top of their tails, because the washer securing their tail will rust.;

, Wrap your pony's hair around a straw or straws, depending on how many curls you want. Secure with hair ties at both top and bottom of straws. If your curls aren't staying in very well, spray their hair with body spray. Different sizes of straws will give you different size curls. When dry, unwrap and remove straw.

Done.",How to Customize a My Little Pony," Ponies that have been drawn on, are going bald, or whose decals have worn off are good custom bait. If your pony is in fair to good condition, check to see that it is not collectible. Certain original My Little Ponies, like Baby Sugarberry, or Grand Champions are worth quite a lot. Others, like the original Applejack or Blossom are very common. Knockoffs or 'fakies' e.g. Lanard toys are good for practicing on.

, If you just want to restore it, touch up the design and eyes with paint.

, The glue will fail with heat and water so soak the pony in hot water. With time and patience the head should come off. Use a blunt blade like a smooth table knife. If this doesn't work try thick sewing thread soaked in acetone to saw at the neck seam. Personally I would never deliberately cut the plastic around the neck area. Older My Little Ponies (G1, G2) are easier to work with, newer versions and knockoffs have stronger glue (G3, g4, Fakies) and you may *have* to cut through the vinyl to get the head off.

, A vinegar soak can be used to remove rust stains inside the body. Toothpaste is a good cleaner. Bleach can fix stains and damage ponies so you should use another disinfectant such as Savlon in water if necessary to remove mold. To prevent mold in future make sure the pony is bone dry before putting head back on.

, On newer ponies, you may need to cut the hair off first. If you want to use the pony's original hair, take rubber bands and tie off small pieces. If you have other hair, discard or save the hair for another pony, Dolly Hair, KatSilk® or Saran hair works especially well when you are replacing hair.

, If the ring is missing, you can replace it with a fat plastic cable tie which also prevents future rusting. If you want a new design, remove the old one with Grunge Off. It will also remove many stains that your pony may have. If you want to repaint the eyes, you can remove them, or just paint over them. If you dye your pony's head, you will need to repaint the white of the pony's eyes.

, You only need enough to cover both the head and body, but you can also make your final color darker or lighter by adding more or less dye. You can also try other dyes, even natural ones like coffee or juice. Match your shade to the original color of your pony, if your pony is yellow, blue dye will give you a green pony. Dye the head and body at the same time, or they will not match. You can also dip your pony into different color dyes, or at different levels to make more interesting looks. Let your pony dry while you prepare the new hair.

, Snip thin sections, a millimeter or less thick and several inches long, and tie knots into the ends. Smear a little Modge Podge or craft glue onto the ends and stick to a newspaper to dry. When you have about 100, you are ready. Some ponies take up to 150, so count the pairs of holes and make a few extra.

, This is your hair threader. Open the holes in the head with the tack or needle, then insert the ends of the wire into the hole from the inside. Pull a strand of hair through the hole with the wire. When the hair reaches the glue knot, it will stay in place. Alternate hair colors every other hole for a mixed look, or every ten holes for a striped look. When all the hair is in, smear glue onto the seams inside the pony's head to hold it in place. Take a chunk of hair for the tail and tie a knot in the middle. Use the wire or thread to pull the tail through the metal ring, and insert the tail into the body.

, You can add gems to make your own Twinkle Eyes Pony, or give her thick lashes and a realistic iris.

, You don't have to restrict yourself to where the old design was, take the design down her legs, all over, or put a smaller version of it on her forehead. Glue your pony's head onto her body after her paint is dry. Let her sit for several days before playing with her. If you want to add other decorations, save the head for last.

, Pull. Soon the head should pop off with ease.;
, Use a panel remover to pull it out.

, use tweezers to pull it out.

, Try to get every hair off her head.

, Let it dry.

, Paint the head with the desired color model paint.

, It can't eat physical objects, so provide it with food for its other senses, such as sight, touch, smell, and hearing.

, Use a box as a stable, accommodate your toy in a dolls house or make a tent! My Little Pony toys can live anywhere, even just on a shelf if you like.

, You can give your toy pretend food, little bits of real food or imaginary food. You don't have to pretend to feed it at all if you don't want to.

, You can spend time playing with your toy or just keep it around when your doing other stuff like surfing the web, or reading a story. You can also give your My Little Pony other toys to hang out with. Other My Little Ponies are a great choice, but other toys of the miniature animal type would work too. Your My Little Pony can be best friends with a plastic dinosaur if you want it to be.

, You can buy these types of things too if you want. You will feel like you are caring for your toy if you make or buy things for it.

, Giving it a mud bath might seem fun at the time, but if you want to care for it, protect it from loss or damage.

, You don't care for a toy by throwing it away or wrecking it. Give toys you no longer want to people who'll care for them or donate them to charity.

An alternative to this is having your Tamagotchi mate with another one by frequently connecting.",How to Look After a Tamagotchi4," This will happen when your Tamagotchi is about 6.

The other character will show up with 4 hearts. If the Tamagotchis are at a good age, each will get a baby during a connection. Both will also be the same gender.

Remember, since it's modelled after a living organism, think in terms of what we need to survive and do the opposite!,
Don't feed it.,
Don't clean up its waste.,
Don't turn out the lights at night.,
If it gets sick, don't give it medicine.,
Don't play with it.,
Don't pet it.,
Reset it.,
Overfeed your tamagotchi.,
If you have the version 4 model, check the fortune cookies that come in the mail.",How to Kill Your Tamagotchi,";
, This is a crucial step to getting rid of your tamagotchi. Hungry Tamagotchis aren't happy tamagotchis, and you know what happens to unhappy tamagotchis... Basically, not feeding it will get things to fall apart. Sounds horrible, but if you're desperate, starve it.

, Another crucial step. Just imagine a person in a room full of this sort of waste: if nothing else, they'd die from the fumes eventually.

, Combined with the poop step mentioned above, this is another small detail that will help you kill your tamagotchi.

, If you've just fed your tamagotchi too many snacks or it naturally gets sick, don't give it any medicine. This will most definitely hasten things up - a sick tamagotchi is not a healthy one.

, Playing games with your tamagotchi makes it happy, and that's not going to kill it off. So just leave the tamagotchi alone - don't do anything with it. Simply treat it like a battery chicken and it'll save you some time in the end.

, Again, giving your tamagotchi positive attention will result in making it happy and that won't help you at all. Don't praise your tamagotchi, pet it, or do anything which makes it happy. Leave it by itself, alone.

, Press the button on the back of your tamagotchi toy and save yourself the time of waiting for it to die. After resetting it, a new egg should appear and you can start over just like new.

, It makes them very unhealthy, gives them toothaches, and will definitely shorten their lifespan.

, Try to work on the areas that have the most stars. The less stars the better."

While the color coating on the game does not tell you what kind of tamagotchi monster will hatch inside your game, it can be fun to select a color you like. You can find tamagotchi in colors like pink, blue, red, green, and so on.If you're going for an older tamagotchi, these can be difficult to find as they're typically sold only on auction sites like eBay. You may have to settle for whatever color you can find.;
, Some tamagotchi cases come in unique patterns, like stripes, polka dogs, and leopard print. Like the color of the case, pattern does not make a big difference when it comes to game play. However, if you'd prefer a particular pattern, keep this in mind when deciding on your tamagotchi. If you're getting a tamagotchi as a gift, you may also want to think about pattern. If you're getting a tamagotchi for your niece, who loves polka dots, a polka dot tamagotchi case may be a good choice., The classic tamagotchi was a popular toy in the mid-1990's. You may be longing for the original tamagotchi. While tamagotchis are still sold today, the original tamagotchi can be hard to find. However, some people have nostalgia for the original design.If you're getting a tamagotchi for a child, you probably don't need to worry about looking for the original. The original version will not be fondly remembered by young children, and they'll quickly adapt to the new size and features.
However, if you're getting a tamagotchi for someone older, or for yourself if you're older, you are probably seeking out the original version. You'll have to use sites like eBay to find an original tamagotchi and the prices will vary greatly. It is not impossible to find an original tamagotchi, and it can be a great bit of nostalgia. However, you may have to do a lot of searching and settle for the color/pattern you find., New tamagotchis, called Tamagotchi Friends, are still sold today. You can find them in many places, such as sites like Amazon and toy stores. Tamagotchi Friends are much easier to find, and you can choose from a variety of colors and patterns.


One of the biggest differences is size. New tamagotchis are about twice the size of the original. This may make them more difficult to carry as keychains, but it's also easier to see the graphics.Death is also different in the newer version. In the older version, tamagotchis would die if not properly cared for and would also eventually die of old age. In the newer version, tamagotchis may die on occasion. However, they may also simply choose to leave if not properly cared for, and may be more likely to run away than die in response to inadequate care. As one of the complaints of the original tamagotchi was that the death factor could be upsetting, a new tamagotchi may be right for you if you're more sensitive., If you're buying a new tamagotchi, you can expect to pay around $20. You can purchase tamagotchis online, or at a local store. Tamagotchis may cost more or less than this, but should hover around this price range.Like all popular toys, knock offs of tamagotchis can be found on occasion. There have been many virtual pets released on the market since tamagotchi was released. These pets can be fun, and may be cheaper than tamagotchis. However, if you have your heart set on a tamagotchi, make sure the brand name Tamagotchi is written on the label, and spelled correctly. If you're paying well under $20, examine the game closely to make sure it's a legitimate tamagotchi. Check to make sure that Bandai's logo is on the package.
If you buy a tamagotchi online, keep in mind you may need to pay shipping and handling. Keep this cost in mind and plan to spend a few dollars more than you were planning.

, Original tamagotchis can be trickier to find. However, users on auction sites like eBay occasionally sell original tamagotchis. You may also stumble upon someone selling a tamagotchi on another similar site, like Craig's List.


Tamagotchis were often sold as Nintendo or computer games in the '90's, so you'll want to search for ""original tamagotchi"" when you're looking at an auction site. This will assure you'll mostly find links to the original keychain version of the game.
As stated, there have been many virtual pets on the market since tamagotchi was popular. You'll want to make sure that you're getting an original tamagotchi, and not another virtual pet. Examine images closely, looking for the tamagotchi label. Do not purchase anything online without seeing pictures first.
Prices will vary greatly, especially on sites where users can bargain. Some tamagotchis may sell for as cheap as $10, but a competitive auction can raise the price up to $50 or $60.

, If you're buying a tamagotchi with your own money, you may have to save. Save up your allowance or money from chores or school. You can try setting a small amount of money, like $5, aside each week until it adds up for enough money for a tamagotchi.

, Tamagotchis can be purchased for smart phones. If you have an iPhone, a tamagotchi app is available for purchase for just 99 cents. This is much cheaper than buying a tamagotchi that comes in its own shell, and the app is similar to the original version. It can be downloaded on an Apple watch, an iPhone, or an iPad., If you have an Android phone, you can buy a tamagotchi app for $3.99.Like the iPhone version, the Android version is similar to the original game.With the Android version, you can look at the tamagotchi in ""toy view"" or ""app view."" In ""toy view,"" you look at the tamagotchi through an egg-shape. In ""app view"" your tamagotchi appears on the screen of your phone without barriers.
Like original versions, tamagotchis send notifications when they're hungry, sick, or need to be cleaned. They can also die from improper care. If you care for your tamagotchi correctly, you can unlock rewards like special backgrounds for the game.

, You may want to get a phone app instead of an actual tamagotchi. However, before making this decision, weigh the benefits and drawbacks.


The main benefit of a phone application is the cost. It's much cheaper to get the application than the actual tamagotchi. It also may be easier to care for tamagotchi, as many people are on their phones a lot. This will make it easier to see when your tamagotchi needs care.
With a phone app, you cannot pick a special color or pattern for your case. You also may dislike being connected to your phone while playing. You may want to play with your tamagotchi without the annoyance of checking texts, e-mails, and other phone notifications.

, Deep down, it's what you believe that matters, not how they see your beliefs. Stand by your beliefs in your own mind. You have your reasons for believing what you believe. They probably don't have a good reason for insulting your religious beliefs. They are probably doing it through ignorance or fear. You can be unaffected by the insults because you are completely devoted to your beliefs and your faith is unshakable. They may insult your beliefs because they have no strong faith of their own to hold onto. You should pity those that taunt you.br>
, You can defend your views, but do it without resorting to emotional attacks or defensiveness. You will get nowhere by shouting or being melodramatic. Explain that your religion gives you hope and is part of your way of life, and ask that they respect your position. Everyone is entitled to belief what they wish in enlightened society. They should respect your beliefs as they expect their beliefs to be respected.

, Don't take a ""holier than thou"" attitude or be condescending, but realize you have a right to believe as you will. Don't apologize for your faith. On the flip side, they are entitled to think as they will, and you should not retaliate by attacking them.

, Read religious texts, pray, or talk to local religious leaders. Remember why you believe what you do, and the feelings and help it gives you in life. A stronger tree of belief stands up better against the winds of insult.

, From participating in events with like-minded individuals, you can build your faith and find others who share your beliefs.

, In the end, don't bow yourself to the insults. Persevere. If you struggle standing alone, find a parent, friend, or religious leader to help you, or ask your God for strength.

Start every day with gratitude by completing these ten simple steps...,
Meditate; that is, prepare your mind for miracles
The Universe’s wish is that we be happy now.,
Send love to people....just because you can.,
Be gentle with yourself (this is known as 'self-compassion') and remember how far you've already come.,
Surrender your plans and let Life take over.,
Ditch, (or, if you prefer, discipline) the Ego.,
Spend time outside and with Nature.,
Keep an open mind; practice perceiving through all of your senses.,
Breathe deeply & listen to your heartbeat.,
Love is a choice and not a reaction.",How to Love the Universe,"


Thank the Universe (God, Life) for the fact you woke up
Give thanks for the bed that kept you comfortable all night, and/or for other things many of us take for granted: family, food, clothing, a job, a place to live, friends, and so on.;
, The Universe is not interested in what plans we have to postpone our happiness on the chance we will attain it in the future. Furthermore, it is not concerned regarding any subconscious desire we might have to retain our psychic obstacles to love no matter our reasons for so doing, and regardless of the origins of those love-blocking strategies. By meditating, we cooperate with the Universe’s wish for us to be happy and clear our mind of any thought that tries to convince us otherwise. Start meditation with a simple request to your mind 
Dear Mind, I am about to enter into meditation. I thank you for being concerned about my well-being and how you look for various solutions to my problems. However, I am now giving you some time off as I take over responsibility for our well-being from a deeper part of Self. I assure you that I will come back to you after a short while and ask that you support this process by not attempting anxiously to reassert your control either by interrupting the meditation, by distracting me or by creating some mini-drama. I want you to know that this process is safe, and that 'you' and 'I' will become stronger, more capable and more resilient as a result. Thank You for your trust and patience.

, When you send love to another person, it will automatically come back to you. Even if you cannot act in a loving way you can always send people love with your thoughts.

, When you begin to lose faith in a cosmic force, (e.g., God, the universe) it is always useful to take note of how far you've come over the past 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, and so on. You will be surprised at how much you've grown.

, Life has a plan that works, we don't. Surrender your own plans to the Universe and take inspired steps based on what life brings to you. You will save yourself a lot of time and a lot of heartache. This can start with a simple prayer ""Dear Universe, I do not know what is best for me today, so I leave the blessings in your hands.""

, The Ego's agenda, based as it is on faulty interpretations of reality bent to socially and culturally dictated criteria regarding 'fitting in' and 'belonging', can be a troublemaker. It's like a 'sincere friend' who is constantly pressuring you to act in ways that it perceives are in your (really, its) best interests. The ego's agenda is not necessarily healthy or good for you. You can ditch (or, again, discipline) your ego by doing what feels right from a deeper perspective and not according to what you think you 'should' do. You can ditch (train) your ego by loving (accepting, caring about, appreciating) yourself more just the way you are and by no longer judging other people as much.

,
No, this step is not asking you to go and hug a tree. This step is about going outside and receiving the gifts of the Universe for yourself. See the beauty in the flowers and the sky, listen to birds singing, take time to smell the grass and feel the wind. You may notice that, whilst you're doing any of these things, it's impossible to be unhappy.

, Life is already speaking to you in many ways. Be open and receptive to the messages Life has to offer.

, If you really want to feel the presence of the Universe (following the principle, 'what is without reflects what is within') then take some time to listen to your heartbeat and feel your breath--sense your own presence. You can do this by dancing to your favorite song, for example.

, You are free to make the decision to LOVE. As you learn to love yourself more and as you practice loving others until you become good at it, you will begin to feel love for the whole universe welling up within you. Once you're there, you'll know you've arrived.

Do not start any additional lives.,
Learn about antinatalism.,
Consider how your antinatalism will express itself.,
Discuss the philosophy with other people.,
Become informed about various religious perspectives.,
Consider non-human suffering.,
Prevent unnecessary pain.,
Keep in touch with others.,
Share honestly.,
Take care of your health.,
Don't be a downer.",How to Live As an Antinatalist," If you have not yet had children, do not have any. (If you have had children, don't have any more.) Do not allow yourself to procreate, either deliberately or “by accident.” Take complete responsibility for contraception, remain celibate, or seek an early abortion so that you do not bring another being into existence. Just as they say to “let sleeping dogs lie,” allow the uncreated to remain in their undifferentiated, painless state.;
, Read the book Better Never to Have Been - The Harm of Coming into Existence by David Benatar. This book will explain the logic behind the philosophy of antinatalism. Continue to read other online articles and book reviews about antinatalism.

, Be forewarned that this is a misunderstood and unpopular philosophy, calling into question as it does the very meaning of human existence. Be discreet, and consider the potential social, familial, employment, and religious ramifications in your life. To whom will you talk about antinatalism? How can you explore or discuss the philosophy without having friends and family worry that you’re depressed? A gradual, “theoretical” approach may help you test the conversational waters, such as making a general comment like, “I recently learned about an interesting philosophy, antinatalism, which suggests that being born is actually harmful to humans.”

, Once you feel confident and conversant with the antinatalist philosophy, as a person who was born yourself, stick up for the moral right of those who would not want to be born.

, Learn what each religion professes about the meaning of life and death; pain and pleasure; procreation and suicide. Buddhists may be influenced by the concept of “avoiding rebirth. Christians may be swayed by the idea that their children could end up suffering eternally in Hell. However, keep in mind that many people object to antinatalism on religious grounds, and you are unlikely to leverage someone off of a position which is based in faith -- particularly with a philosophical discussion -- no matter how logical or rational your arguments.

, Extend your antinatalist philosophy to non-human sentient beings, and work to minimize their suffering as well. Treat animals compassionately. This may include eating a vegan or vegetarian diet, not owning pets (or only keeping rescue pets), or taking care that animal products you consume are from animals who were treated humanely while alive.

, Once a person is born, they are no longer in the category of the “never born” and thus should not be denied human compassion, love, and medical intervention when needed. You can live a long and productive life as an antinatalist. Murder and suicide cause pain to victims and survivors and thus should not be indulged. If you are depressed or suicidal, you may benefit from professional medical or psychological intervention.

, Don’t restrict your social life to fellow antinatalists – the pool is too small, and you won’t be able to entice others to dive in and openly consider your philosophy. If you are in danger of social isolation, consider becoming active with a philosophically non-dogmatic religious group such as Unitarian Universalism or Zen Buddhism.

, Tell others about your personal experience with life, without minimizing problems or overstating pleasures.

, Get sufficient sleep, good nutrition, and regular exercise. Don’t invite suffering by ignoring your physical health.

, While the antinatalist philosophy is often considered to be against sentient human life, recognition of the misfortune of having been born does not relegate you to dourness, suffering, complaining, or misery. Antinatalists can be as happy as the next person, yet still recognize that everyone’s suffering could be obviated if those people had never been born in the first place. Still, once a person has been born, they may as well make the best of a bad situation. Pursue pleasure for yourself and others, and avoid contributing to suffering.

First, you must acquire a Tamagotchi.,
Once acquired, let the madness begin.,
When it is around the child stage, you can start the insane obsession.,
Sew or glue a little pouch for the teeny tiny Tamagotchi.,
Take your Tamagotchi wherever you go.,
Remember to always clean up its on-screen messes, and to heal it when it is sick.,
In the summer, you can make little rock-houses for your Tamagotchi.,
Always bring the Tamagotchi with you.,
When you get your Tamagotchi, the package will have a little plastic mould cradling the Tamagotchi.,
Either the above step, or you can take a large lump of crayola clay, stick a colored marker inside it, mix it up, (make sure it matches your Tama) and keep adding more marker until it is dark enough.

,
Bring your Tamagotchi into the shower.,
Style it.,
Always keep extra batteries on hand!,
Even if your Tamagotchi dies, you will still have a new beginning!,
Have fun.

",How to Awaken Your Inner Tamagotchi Obsession," You can buy some batteries for an old one, or buy a new one. The batteries required are button batteries, about the size of a quarter, called CR2032.;
, Start by spending all the time you have for the baby to change into a child. It will take around an hour, and it will require a lot of attention to care for. Be sure you have over 1 hour of free time to care for it.

, Decorate your Tamagotchi with stickers, nail polish, glitter, rhinestones, or anything else you wish. You can glue on feathers, wiggle eyes, wings (clay!), or write all over it with a Sharpie marker.

, Take some felt, and measure it around your Tamagotchi in a rectangle. Double that length, and stitch or glue the edges together. Put a little strap on it to hook over your wrist or around your neck.

, Bring it to friend's houses, even in public. Nobody will really care, because the world is filled with (Tama)crazy people, right?

, Never let it get overweight. When it goes over its base weight, play games until the weight goes down.

, Take some pebbles, super glue them together into a slight half-sphere shape, and glue felt over it. Make a little base out of a larger, flat rock, and cover the bottom with felt. This can be a little cabana for your Tamagotchi when you go to the beach, lake, pool, whatever. You can sculpt a little glass of lemonade with ice cubes out of Sculpey and glue it to the Tamagotchi cabana.

, Never pause it, because it sleeps at night (obviously.) The less you pause it, the cuter character you will get!

, You can paint this so it will have a little holder at night.

,, Take 3 plastic, sealable sandwich bags, put your Tamagotchi in one, and arrange them like nesting dolls, sealing each bag tightly. Your Tamagotchi is now shower- and pool- proof!

, Take clear nail polish, and spread a thin, non-streaky layer onto the screen. Wait 20 full minutes for it to dry, and this should protect the screen from further scratches. Be aware that any warranty does not cover this, so do this at your own risk.

, Maybe if you accidentally drop your Tamagotchi in the pool unprotected, the battery will completely FLIP out.


If it is in water, leave it in a warm, dry place for 2 days, and replace the battery. Also, batteries wear out after 6 months, and around 4 months for non-lithium batteries. This may vary though.

, Take advantage of a new game. Or, if it doesn't die, it will eventually get married by the matchmaker. Or not. Your choice! Take advantage of a death, or a new generation!

Open the package.,
Take out the Tamagotchi.,
Untab.,
Begin changing settings.,
Wait for your Tamagotchi to hatch.,
Determine your Tamagotchi's gender, and name it.,
Begin caring for your Tamagotchi.,
Wait for it to evolve.,
Keep taking care of it until it evolves to its adult stage.",How to Care for a Tamagotchi V4/V4.5," This should be done with sharp scissors. Make sure that younger children do not open this package by themselves, especially when you have already made a slit; it has very sharp edges. Also make sure to not cut too far into the box, as the instructions are hidden behind the cardboard!;
, Once you have the box open, reach your hand inside (be careful of sharp edges!) and pull the Tamagotchi out. It should be cradled in a small plastic mould., 'Untabbing' your Tamagotchi means pulling the tab on the left side of it, activating the Tamagotchi. Simply pull it out, and it should make a short beeping noise and show a small egg on the display screen., To do this, you must press what I'll refer to as the B button (the middle button). In a few seconds, it will display the time and date screen. To set it, press ""A"" (the left button) to select the next number, and ""B"" to confirm. If you made a mistake, just go back with the ""C"" (right) button.
The things you will enter in order are:


Date

Month (or Day for European/Asian models)
Day (or Month for European/Asian models)


Time

The hour
The minutes


Birthday

This is where you enter your birthday. Your Tamagotchi will celebrate for you on that day! Make sure you set it correctly, as you cannot change it.


Username

This is for use on TamaTown, a website where you 'log on' with your Tamagotchi! You should also set this correctly, as you cannot change it.
Your Tamagotchi should now show the same egg, bouncing up and down.



, It should only take about a minute. Think of some names while you wait, it can pass the time quickly.

, Once you hear your Tamagotchi hatching, it will show you if it is a boy or a girl. Afterwards, it will ask you to name your Tamagotchi. It can only be five characters long, so make it short and sweet!

, The attention icon should light up, and your Tamagotchi will be needy for this first hour. It may be needy, but people have discovered that it CANNOT die as that little baby.

, It should evolve after the first hour or so of care. Just wait patiently, and make sure to take care of it, and it will evolve into something cute.

, The Tamagotchi's life cycle takes around a week until it is ready to mate and start a new generation. Be patient, persistent, and remember to take care of your Tamagotchi!

Realize that good and evil are points of view and while your own opinion matters, there are some universals.,
Recognize both points of view.,
Do your homework!,
Think about how you or your culture views right and wrong.,
Write your views on good and bad down, then analyze them, rethink what truly is right and wrong.,
Discuss your ideas on morality with others.,
Observe others and yourself, you would be surprised at the number of people that do ""wrong"" things everyday.,
Decide whether you want to be ""good"" or ""evil"", then do the things you wrote on your list that fits that category.

",How to Know Good from Evil," ""Think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You might as well imagine a country in where two and two made five."" --C.S. Lewis;
, There are subjectivists, who believe that each person can determine ""good"" and ""evil"" for himself. There are objectivists, who believe in a universal concept of Good and Evil. Good and Evil can be discussed independent of religion, so both the religious and the atheistic can be found in both viewpoints. Which do you identify with? Why?

, Uncounted philosophers and religionists have taught and debated Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, and other topics. Read up on the topic, see what others have said, and decide whether you agree or disagree.

, In general ""evil"" people do ""wrong"" things and ""good"" people do ""right"" things. Christianity, for example, puts emphasis on treating others the way you would have them treat you. But remember that each culture, to an extent, holds different opinions on what is right and wrong.

, Then, when you're satisfied with your list, define how many wrong actions it takes, or the severity of the action, to be declared ""evil"".

, Discussing with others may change what you believe to be right and wrong.

, Think about if wrong things can really be wrong if everyone does them.

Take some time and find some space if you are just starting to practice this subject.,
Firstly break down feelings into groups of 5, 3 & 3.,
Try to classify each feeling as it comes.,
The way to do that is just to watch them.,
Examine the next group of three.,
Again Try to classify them into these groups.,
Consider this is important just because you are the one involved in these contradictions.,
Investigate the final group which is probably the most important.,
Think about these.,
Examine your feelings and these groups carefully.,
This can actually reveal the whole purpose and method of Buddhism, to develop the mind in order to let go of stress, to develop a lifestyle in order to avoid stress and to develop skillful actions that don't result in stress.

,
Then you are free.

",How to Investigate the Feeling Aggregate," Once you've been doing it a while you can do it anywhere and anytime.;
, Feeling luckily is much more limited in scope compared to the materiality aggregate. The first group to look for is the group of 5. These are:


Pleasant physical feelings
Unpleasant physical feelings
Pleasant mental feelings
Unpleasant mental feelings
Equanimity feelings

, The point behind this is not only will you know them when they happen but you are far more connected in order to develop or let go of each type. It also has the big advantage that you can know when the mind is playing tricks on you, saying this or that is pleasant, when in reality parts of the brain are stressing out.

, Not only see how they change or react to various things but keep an important eye on collective feelings. Is there tension at seeing something, is there a pleasant sensation at seeing something and so on through the senses (touch, taste, sight, smell etc).

, These are:


desirable - so you would want more of them or the ones you have to stay forever etc.
undesirable - so you don't want them to come and the ones you have to go away.
neutral feelings.

, You might be surprised to see that you might desire getting angry, when parts of the mind are showing the whole anger experience is really pretty unpleasant. You can gain some real insights in doing this as pleasant and desirable can make a common pair, but so does unpleasant and desirable and vice versa - Undesirable and pleasant and so on.

, Are your feelings leading you into potential traps?

,


Profitable, beneficial or skillful, (or whatever word works for you)
Unprofitable, harmful or unskillful
Indeterminate.

, Some of them are tricky because what is pleasant and desirable is not always beneficial to you or others. That's the big catch. The only way to work out which is which is to watch and examine each feeling as it comes.

, It might sound crazy that your mind would want to have anything to do with harmful or undesirable feelings, but it does it all the time because it has been let run wild and no one has been watching it to pull it back into line.

Be skeptical.,
Look for unusual change of moods.,
Watch out for poltergeist activities.,
Look for noises and smells out of the ordinary.",How to Get Rid of Demons1," The hard thing about having a haunting for a long period of time is that you begin to lose your line between imagination and reality. Even in genuine haunting there can be normal explanations for the activities.;
, A demon likes to play with its target(s). It doesn't manifest itself easily until it knows that everyone is vulnerable. So if a calm peaceful house suddenly turns into a really depressive one or if someone specifically is heading a really dark road in life, you need to pay attention to that.

, Demons are powerful spirits. Unlike human spirits that need to absorb a large amount of energy, these require a lot less or even none to produce terrifying phenomenons such as movements, teleportation, throwing and even levitation of objects. In extreme cases they were able to manifest as dark misty figures or produce spontaneous combustion.

, Often demons can be caught on digital tape recorders (EVP) as someone speaking, laughing and even growling. They can also leave behind a terrible smell that smells like rotten flesh or sulfur.

Define ""meditation"" in a Christian context.,
Meditate on one verse or paragraph.,
Center meditation around a specific topic.,
Focus on the meaning of one word.,
Study one book of the Bible.,
Find a quiet place.,
Quiet your heart.,
Read the Bible.,
Pray over the readings.,
Take notes.,
Think out loud.,
Memorize the words.,
Rephrase the chosen passage.,
Evoke an emotional response.,
Actively seek the blessings of meditation.,
Apply the words to your own life.",How to Meditate on the Word of God," In a secular context, meditation is associated with emptying the mind and relaxing the body. On the other hand, meditating on the Word of God—or any other form of Christian meditation—requires you to concentrate and think deeply on God’s truth.Consider God's words to Joshua in Joshua 1:8 (NIV) -- ""Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.""
While this verse technically only refers to what Christians consider the first five books of the Bible, you can still apply this idea to meditating on the entire Bible. Meditating on God's Word should be done frequently, and the overall purpose should be to enrich your understanding so you can apply it to your life.;
, This is probably the most common way to meditate on the Bible. Identify a single verse or paragraph within the Word of God to meditate over. You’ll need to dissect and explore the meaning of that verse during a concentrated amount of time.There’s no “wrong” choice, but if you’re not sure where to start, a good spot might be a verse from the New Testament—especially one from one of the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). With regards to the Old Testament, the Book of Psalms and Book of Proverbs also contain great verses to meditate over.

, Another option worth trying would be to choose a topic explored at length in the Bible. Instead of meditating over one specific passage, you’ll need to identify several passages that deal with this topic and think deeply on how the supporting passages define or elaborate on it.For example, you might focus on the topic of forgiveness. Use a topical Bible or index to find different verses on forgiveness, then read through as many as possible. Look at the context surrounding each verse and compare them to one another.

, This option is related to meditation on a specific topic, but instead of dealing with a broad topic, you’ll need to rely on the context of one or more passages to help enrich your understanding of the meaning of a significant word.For instance, you could choose the word ""Lord."" Look at verses with the word ""Lord"" in them, as well as verses that contain the lowercase version of ""lord."" Consider the contextual meaning of the term for both spellings. You may also supplement your understanding by using external resources, like a dictionary, to compare religious use to secular use of the term.

, Using this technique, you’ll need to devote a longer amount of time to reading a full book of the Bible instead of merely focusing on one short passage. Dissect and explore the significance of that book, looking at the book as a whole and at individual pieces of it a little at a time.If this seems intimidating to you, consider starting with a relatively short book, like the Book of Esther. You may even wish to supplement your understanding with the use of a Bible study guide, but doing so isn’t necessary.

, Like secular forms of meditation, mediating on the Word of God requires you to set yourself apart from the noise and distractions of the world long enough to focus on the task at hand.Multitasking may seem like a valuable skill in today's world, but you won't be able to give any task 100% while trying to balance it with something else. Minimizing your distractions while meditating on God's Word should improve your ability to focus on it.
Try to set aside at least 15 to 30 minutes for your meditation. Let any family or roommates know that you need time to yourself to focus, and set yourself apart in a quiet, empty room. Make yourself comfortable, but not so comfortable that you find it hard to stay awake.

, External silence isn’t the only quiet required for this form of meditation. You also need to pursue internal quiet by setting aside your doubts, fears, and other distracting thoughts.Don’t feel too guilty if your mind initially wanders back to the day’s problems, but don’t let your thoughts dwell there, either. As soon as you notice yourself getting sidelined by anxieties or other concerns, take a moment to pause and consciously redirect your attention back to God. Praying for rededicated focus at that moment may also help.

, Open the Bible and read the verse or verses you plan to meditate over. Spend as much time as you need to gain a basic understanding of the words, then bookmark the verse for later; you’ll need to refer to it continually throughout your meditation.After you read through the passage, try reading through it again. This time, speak the words out loud and intentionally emphasize different portions by your tone, and open yourself to new revelations as you do so. Repeat this exercise as often as needed or desired during your meditation.If necessary, you may also wish to improve your understanding using other tools. Research the cultural context. Read through verses that are similar in tone or topic. Look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary or thesaurus., Spend a few minutes praying to God for guidance on your meditative efforts. Ask God to open your heart to the truth and wisdom lying within His Word.While the Bible may seem like little more than words on a page, try to keep in mind that the text you read comes direct from God. Asking the Holy Spirit to enrich your understanding while you meditate is, essentially, like asking an author to help improve your understanding of his story.

, Read through your chosen passage again, but this time, take notes on its content. You may wish to highlight, underline, or write short notes directly in on the page, but you should also keep a dedicated journal so that you can take more extensive notes.Highlighting ideas can redirect your attention to key elements during later readings, but actually writing notes on each verse will make it easier for you to think through it. Summarizing ideas and responding to them in this manner forces you to think fully on the words in front of you.

, Even though your space and heart should be quiet, don’t be afraid to think out loud. Talking over the passage can help you process the information and work through its mysteries more effectively.You can think out loud in the form of a prayer, but you can also think out loud to help yourself work through complex ideas.
The Bible is often referred to as the ""living word"" of God. As suggested by the term ""living,"" the text is meant to be active, which also means that you can (and should) interact with it. Don't be afraid to vocalize your questions, praise God's promises, or respond honestly to the things you read.

, While this won’t be feasible for meditation on multiple verses or full books, it’s often a good idea to memorize the passage word-for-word when meditating over a short paragraph or single verse.Consider using the building block method of memorization. Repeat one word or short phrase roughly 6 to 12 times. Add new words or phrases onto the first, then repeat the entire thing again. Continue until you work through the full passage., Spend some time writing out the meaning of the passage in your own words. Go into as much detail as possible, drawing out as much meaning as you can find in the process.Paraphrase the passages you read by putting them into your own words, but remember to stay true to the meaning behind God's words as you do this. The idea isn't to alter or twist the truth, but to access it in more familiar terms.

, Think through the passage on which you're focusing. Try to pinpoint God's desires as expressed through those words, and attempt to align yourself with those desires so you can feel some degree of what God feels.By allowing yourself to feel emotion alongside God, you can make the passage you’re reading seem more “real” to yourself, which should create a richer experience. Instead of merely looking like text on a page, God’s words should seem notably more meaningful—as meaningful as they were always meant to be.

, Like secular meditation, meditating on God's Word can provide you with a renewed sense of calm, but the blessings of this meditative practice can extend even deeper than that. As you meditate, seek guidance, comfort, joy, reassurance, and wisdom that come from an enriched understanding of divine truth.As Psalm 1:1-3 (NIV) notes, ""Blessed is the one whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.""
Meditating on God's Word will give you a greater understanding of what God wants from and for you, thereby providing you with guidance. Reading of God's promises and mighty deeds can give you comfort during times of trouble and an enhanced sense of joy. Improving your understanding of God's redemptive love should offer you reassurance. Lastly, by improving your understanding of God's Word through meditation, you can equip yourself with the wisdom you need to navigate through spiritual darkness., Once you understand the depth and meaning of the meditative passage, it's time to take action. Assess your own life and determine how you can apply your new understanding of God's Word to your behaviors and perspectives, then make the necessary changes immediately.Consider the words of James 2:17 (NIV), which states, ""...faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.""
Actions are a sign of faith and understanding. Meditating on the Word of God is a practice designed to improve both faith and understanding, so action should be a natural result of effective meditation.
That being said, don’t assume that one 30-minute meditative session will make it easier to live by God’s Word for the rest of your life. Meditation is a discipline, and as such, you will need to continually and intentionally work at it to reap its full benefits."

Start early.",How to Divide up Family Heirlooms1," The best decision you can make when dividing heirlooms is to make a will. While this can be difficult, as it forces all involved to consider your mortality, it can be very beneficial and will ease familial responsibilities after your passing. Invite all children or siblings you will be including in your will together for a family meeting.;
, Express your wishes, but consider family desires. Go through each room and let each family member have the opportunity to discuss the heirlooms. There might be a necklace that holds very little financial value but one sibling has a strong attachment to it because she wore it on her first date. Or maybe your brother has an open spot in his house that would make a great display for the china plate collection.This should be a positive time to share happy memories together as a family!

, Once it is settled who will receive an item be sure to write down the decision. Then when you write up your will be very specific about items. For example don’t write “John gets the china” add details, “John gets the complete Lenox Christmas edition china set, including the candlesticks.” This is not a guarantee that there won’t be any arguments later, but will at least remove any doubt over the person’s wishes., Consider the financial distribution of your heirlooms. If a child feels “shorted” is likely to be a source of tension and resentment among the family. An easy way to make things more equal is through the estate sale. For instance, if you want to divide $10,000 worth of jewelry and china among your daughters, but don’t have any comparable items for your sons, then your sons will receive $10,000 more from the estate sale.

, This can either be a family member, or a third party. Consider your family dynamics in making this decision. If you know it will cause disharmony to choose one child over another then consider using a third party, a family friend or hiring an attorney.

, Once you’ve discussed everyone’s wishes start giving heirlooms away! It’s better to start the process while all family members are still living. This limits the potential arguments among family after the death and takes added stress off of the family. Additionally, distributing while you’re still alive provides you with the chance to see the joy your family experiences in their new heirlooms.

Consider calling Child Protective Services.,
Determine whether to pursue emancipation.,
Become financially independent.,
Get your parents' permission.,
Submit the proper paperwork.,
Attend a preliminary meeting and court hearing.",How to Disown Your Family1," If you're under 18 and you feel you're living in a dangerous situation, contact your state's Child Protective Services for help. The most important first step is to get to a place of safety. Once you're removed from your family's household, CPS will help you determine how to proceed in order to make sure your family won't be able to harm you.


If you're unsure about calling CPS, talk to a trusted adult like a teacher, school counselor or your friends' parents about your options.
Understand that when you turn 18, your parents will no longer have the legal right to make decisions for you. Maybe you don't get along with your parents, but are they putting you in actual danger? If not, your best bet might be to wait it out. When you turn 18, you'll be able to live your life the way you want.;
, If you are a teenager, the legal way to disown your family is to become ""emancipated"" from them. This means you'll be legally treated as an adult with the right to make your own decisions, and your parents will no longer be your legal guardians. In most states you have to be over 16 to pursue emancipation. This might be the right path for you if the following is true:


Your parents are abusive.Your parents are unable to take care of you.The situation at your parents' house is morally repugnant to you.You are financially independent and want to have the rights of an adult.

, A judge won't grant emancipation unless you are able to prove that you can live independently from your parents like any adult. That means being able to make enough money to pay for a place to live, groceries, medical bills, and all other expenses. Once you're emancipated, your parents will no longer be legally responsible for providing money to cover your basic needs.


Start by finding a job as soon as possible. Save up as much money as possible; be sure not to spend it on items you don't really need.
Move out of your family's house and into your own apartment. You also have the option of staying with a friend or relative, as long as the person agrees that the arrangement is permanent.

, The emancipation process is a lot easier when your parents agree that they don't want to be legally responsible for you. If they don't agree to consent to emancipation, the burden will be on you to prove that they aren't fit parents.

, You'll need to fill out a petition for emancipation, which you can obtain by contacting the Circuit Court in your jurisdiction. You will also need to fill out paperwork regarding your financial status, your employment status, and your living situation.


If possible, consider getting legal help when you fill out the paperwork. A lawyer familiar with your state's laws will be able to guide you during the process to make sure everything is filled out correctly. Look into ways to hire a lawyer when you have low income.

, After you submit your petition and other paperwork to the Court, you'll receive a date for a preliminary meeting that both you and your parents will attend. Your situation will be assessed, and if your parents object to your emancipation, you'll need to attend a court hearing to prove that they are unfit parents.


An investigation into your home situation may be conducted after the preliminary meeting.
If you are successfully able to prove that you can and should live as an adult, you'll be free to cut off all contact with your parents and family members - effectively disowning them.

Love yourself.,
Observe your mind.,
Be patient.,
Understand what spirituality is for you.,
Have fun!,
Feel your emotions.,
Give back.",How to Heal Spiritually," This is always the first step to connecting with your spirit. If you've been bashing yourself for living the ""wrong"" life or mulling over the past, now is the right moment to stop that. Know that when you say negative messages to yourself, you are diminishing your own spirit, taking you further away from where you want to be. A great exercise to try is to observe your thoughts for one day, without labelling them either good or bad, and instead just watching them. This will help you love yourself more and bring healing to your spirit.;
, This step is a continuation of the exercise from the first step. When you can eliminate judgement from your mental space, you'll see the thoughts you have with more clarity. For many people out there, we've been told what spirituality is in religious terms, meaning that you must follow a certain set of rules. Its possible when you no longer judge your thoughts as right or wrong, that you'll shed unnecessary concepts or beliefs no longer helping you. At this stage, some people see beyond emotional reactions and gain understanding the triggers that cause emotive reactions.

, Healing doesn't happen in a day, especially for spiritual healing. You may work on your spirit for a decade and find one day that you've fallen into an old belief that you'd thought to be long gone. There's no benefit in further beating yourself up, just be patient, this is life, so allow it to happen. If you're working to stand up for yourself with healthy boundaries and find that you fumble, don't worry, the lesson will reappear again for you to retry. Patience will be one of your greatest allies when healing, because we often have to repeat lessons a few times before getting them right.

, As mentioned earlier, the majority of us grew up under the notion that spirituality happens in a temple under a strict code of rules and regulations. If this environment makes you feel uncomfortable, then this is likely a place that will stifle your spirit. Various metaphysical healers and philosophers have often pointed to spirituality being an awakening process. What this means is that we already know what areas light up our spirits, it's just a matter of awakening to them. For some people, when they get on a stage in front of others and sing their heart out, they feel that bright connection to their spirit. For others, when they work on a mechanical project, they feel connected to something bigger in that moment. As you heal, you'll feel your spirit and be able to more accurately hone into it.

, Healing can often elicit images of depressing hospital rooms and the like. This does not have to be your healing process. Laughter will heal your bones faster than sitting in a situation you find to be depressing. Go to an amusement park, join a drum circle, get a dog, take that dog to the park, and the list goes on. Sunshine will blow away old cobwebs around your spirit if you spend some time in its warmth. Remember that healing is a process of making you stronger, which will allow you to laugh and cry more often.

, Allow those emotions to come out of their suppressed cases. If you hear a story that touches your heart, don't hold back the tears; if they're coming, this is your spirit talking physically. As a society we've learned that certain emotions are okay and that others aren't, yet this is a false notion. Your emotions play an integral part to your life's journey, don't bind them to ideas brewed from misinformation. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, then validate that emotional response; don't beat it up for happening. As you heal, you'll find yourself becoming more comfortable expressing your true feelings, rather than what you believe others want.

, Your spirits lift to new heights when you give to others, because you know that you're using your gifts to their fullest potential. When you give, you'll find that you get more in return. When you help others heal, you'll find yourself healing in the process. Giving back doesn't mean you have to volunteer somewhere destitute, or to even leave your house, because it's different for everyone. Some people love writing inspirational blog, others enjoy cooking meals for their loved ones, and so it goes. Give back what you love doing, because you'll bring a wonderful spirit to others and yourself.

Make sure your children are involved.,
Write a mission statement.,
Think of your values daily.,
Stay connected as a family.,
Make positive life choices.,
Model your values.,
Use family values to work on family goals.",How to Define Your Family Values," Values are both important and personal, but few people actually choose their own values. Instead, most people follow the values that were learned in childhood. To deconstruct your values, think about your childhood and determine what values you absorbed.Think about specific values. For example, did your parents value religion, education, or wealth? How much did that impact your formative years?
Consider asking your parents to discuss their values with you. Ask them what they considered to be the family values, and ask how they integrated them into your development.;
, Once you have thought about your earlier values, take some time to consider whether you have retained the same ideas throughout your life. Reflect on the major decisions you have made in your life. Does your family life reflect the values you originally had? Or have you evolved as you've gotten older? Questions such as these can help you define your values.You can also reflect on your career choice. For example, if fighting for social justice is a core value of yours, have you chosen a career path, such as social work, that integrates that value?
One way to figure out what your values are is to examine how you spend your money. Does most of it go towards entertainment? Travel? Or do you give a lot to charities or political causes?

, Make a list of all of the values that are important to you. This is a great way for all of your family members to think about values. Ask each family member who can write to make a list. Your family can then rank the values on each list to help you define which are the most important to all of you.Common values include: honesty, balance, caring, generosity, health, humor, learning, wisdom, leadership, and compassion.
Think about your family as you consider values such as cooperation, financial stability, humility, and patience.Try thinking about the values in terms of categories. For example, your categories could include: Personality, Career, Family, Friends, Health. Try looking at the list of values and figuring out which category to put them in. This organization can lead to clarity about what matters most to you.

, Once you have spent some time thinking about your personal values, it's time to figure out how to integrate them with the rest of your family. In order to do that, you all need to effectively communicate with each other. Begin the process by asking questions.Ask your family to join you for a discussion about values. Begin by asking open ended questions such as, ""What is most important to our family?""
You can also try, ""What brings you happiness? How does that affect our family?""
Other good questions to ask include, ""What makes you most proud about our family?"" or ""What do you look forward to when you come home?""
You could also try ""What embarrasses you about our family?"" and ""What does our family provide for you that you don't get from friends?""
Consider having each family member answer these questions individually. Then you can openly and honestly compare answers.
Encourage your family members to ask questions, too.

, During your family discussion, it is important that you all practice good listening skills. To indicate that you are listening, ask follow up questions. For example, if your partner says he values honesty, ask him how that can become more of a focus for the family.You can also use non-verbal cues to indicate that you are listening. Nod your head when someone is speaking, and smile to indicate you appreciate what is being said.
Try to limit interruptions. Ask everyone to put away their cell phones and turn off the tv while you are having this important conversation.

, Once you have spent some time discussing your family values and enjoying quality time together, you can begin the process of more clearly defining your family values. Take some time to sit down together and make a list of the values that are most important. You can think of these values as firm guidelines that your family is agreeing to live by.Writing things down can help your family gain mental clarity about shared values.Try writing down items such as ""help society"" or ""religion/spirituality"" or ""honest communication with family members"".
Try having each family member choose 3-4 values that they feel are most important. Combined, this will give you a manageable number of values to put on your permanent list.
For example, you could choose ""Safety"" as one of the primary values for your family. Each family member could then indicate how they will stick to this value. You could pledge to always drive the speed limit. Your daughter could promise to always wear a helmet when riding her bike.

, Treat defining your family values as a family decision. If your children are a little older, such as teenagers, make sure they feel like they are an important part of the process. Say things such as, ""We value your input. How do you feel about including education as one of our primary family values?""You can also encourage your kids to explain their opinions. Try saying, ""What do you like about this choice? Why do you think adding humor as a family value is the best option?""If your children are still pretty young, you can find other ways to get them involved. Try having them draw a picture of the things they love about your family.

, Once you have reflected on your values and discussed them with your family, you should have a good idea of how to define your family values. One way to solidify them is to write a mission statement. This is a document that indicates what your family values and can also include goals. The mission statement is a formal declaration of the values you share as a family.Write down what the purpose of your family is and a strategy for making sure that you remain focused on that purpose.
Try writing an introduction that states why your family is choosing these particular values. You can talk about how your family is committed to these values in order to help promote good life choices. The introduction doesn't have to be long, just a paragraph will do.
List the values. You can organize them by categories such as Health, Happiness, Balance, and Stability. Then, you can indicate your family strategy for sticking to each of these values.You can print the mission statement and have it framed. Having it hang in your home is a good way to remind each of you of what is truly important to your family.

, Take a few minutes every day to check in with yourself. At the end of each day, you can ask yourself questions. Try thinking, ""How did my actions today relate to Value #1? How about Value #2?"" This will only take a few minutes of your time, but can be very helpful in keeping your values front and center.Ask all of the members of your family to adopt this habit. Once you have a mission statement that is easily accessible, it will be easy for everyone to reference the list of values on a daily basis.

, You can do this by making sure to spend quality time together. The more time that you spend together, the more shared experiences you will have as a family. Spending quality time with each other will allow you to get to know one another better. This will help you figure out what matters most to each of you individually, and as a family.Schedule time for the whole family to spend together. It can be as simple as eating dinner together, or something like devoting a whole Saturday to family activities.
Let each member of the family have input in your activities. For example, if your daughter loves to exercise, try taking a hike together.

, Your values are an important part of your decision-making process. Keep your family values in mind before making any big life choices. For example, if a family value is education, make sure to live in an area with good schools.Make life choices part of a family discussion. Before major changes are made, call a family meeting to discuss how the potential change aligns with your family values.

, The best way to integrate your family values into your daily life is to make sure that your actions reflect those values. Make sure that the choices you make are in line with what you consider to be your most important family values.If your number one family value is honesty, make sure that you are candid and truthful. Apply this value to your work life and your social life.
Modeling is the best way to help children learn values. For example, if you value respect, show your kids how to be respectful by always addressing other people with consideration.

, Values are important because they can help determine your choices and your actions. When you are thinking about family values, it is useful to also consider your family goals. Your values will likely play a big role in how you go about accomplishing those goals.Is learning one of your family values? Think about translating that into a concrete goal. Think about the steps you can take to focus on learning as a family. For example, you could all learn a new language together or take a cooking class. This will integrate your family values and goals.
If financial responsibility is a family value, you could use that guiding principle to make sure that each family member understands the importance of sticking to a budget. That way, you can accomplish family goals of saving for retirement, college, etc.

Get on their level.,
Emphasize the importance of family time.,
Dedicate one-on-one time for each child.,
Stay in touch with academics, friendships, and extra-curriculars.,
Kid around.,
Be trustworthy.,
Practice active listening without distractions.,
Follow the 3 F’s of effective parenting.,
Have relaxed, side-by-side conversations.,
Review rules and increase privileges as your children get older.,
Include them in decisions.,
Encourage your child to take on challenges and find independence.,
Open up and show your human side.",How to Develop a Good Parent and Child Relationship," You can enrich the relationship you have with your child by connecting with them in an age-appropriate way. Teach, work on projects, and play on a level that your child is familiar with. This helps them bond with you and makes you seem more approachable.


If you have a toddler, get on the floor and build a city out of blocks. If you have older adolescents or teens, join in on a round of video games.
You are more likely to spark conversation during these types of activities than by trying to get them talking at the dinner table.;
, While your children need to know that you acknowledge and respect their individuality, it also counts when you uplift the family as a unit. Make family time a regular and special part of your routine.Eat meals together most nights of the week, and have everyone share their peaks and pits (i.e. best and worst moments) of the day. Go to sporting events, movies, or community gatherings together.

, Spending time together as a unit is essential. You should also set aside time to focus on each individual child. Prioritizing one-on-one time helps you form a connection with each child. Plus, it also helps you focus on each child’s individual strengths and talents.


Find a shared hobby to engage in with each of your children. Maybe you will teach one kid how to fish on weekends. Or, work with another on perfecting a piano performance. Free up part of your weekly schedule to build a special relationship with each child., Parents who have good relationships with their children are involved with their lives. You can’t expect to have a strong bond with your children if you simply say “good morning” and “good night” each day.


It’s understandable that you’re busy juggling work and other responsibilities, but you should also make an effort to get to know your kids and learn about what’s happening in their lives.
If you have some free time, offer to volunteer at school, coach a softball game, or meet with your children’s teachers regularly to stay updated on their academic performance.
Sit down with them as they do homework. Help them practice their lines for the school play. Invite your kids’ friends over so you know what kind of influences they are around., Let your kids know that things don’t always have to be so serious between you. Of course, you want them to respect your authority, but you also want to laugh with them. A sense of fun can liven up their lives and build fond memories.Make crazy faces or noises to supplement mealtimes or playtime with smaller children. Act silly with adolescents by pulling pranks or telling jokes.

, As a parent, it's important that you build a foundation of trust. Trust translates to many roles in parenting. Of course, your child needs to know that they can rely on you to be there. When you say you’ll do something, do it. Keep your word. This helps your child form basic secure attachments that will influence future relationships.


However, trust also means respecting your child’s need for privacy and keeping their confidences when they do share with you.Trust doesn’t necessarily mean you believe whatever your child says, but it does mean you’ll try and give them the benefit of the doubt.

, Parents are busy. But, you also want to make sure your children know that you care about what they have to say. Even if your child is complaining about the same issue at school or going on and on about teenage drama, try to give them your full attention. When you actively listen, you strengthen your bond with your child and demonstrate their importance to you.


Silence your phone and shut off the TV. Don’t zone them out in order to prepare your response. Truly listen to your child and try to understand their message. Turn to face them. Make eye contact. Use open body language. Listen without judgment or negative facial expressions.Once they’re finished speaking, summarize what you heard. For instance, your daughter says, “All the girls at school are going to this camp-out next weekend. But, we have to go to that stupid wedding.” You might say, “It sounds like you are frustrated because you can’t attend the camp-out.”

, Every child pushes the envelope a bit when it comes to communication and behavior. However, as the adult, you are must be inclined to respond maturely and calmly to misconduct. Go by the 3 F’s to help you with discipline and protect the overall parent-child relationship.


Be firm. State what the consequences are and apply them consistently.
Be fair. Make sure the punishment fits the crime. Try to avoid harsh or excessive consequences.
Be friendly. Convey your words in steady yet polite tone. Avoid raising your voice. Simply explain what terms they violated and lay out the consequences. Also, take time to praise them when they are doing well., Adolescents and teens can easily become intimidated with too much face-to-face communication. Reduce the pressure by planning some of your talks in a parallel position. Try asking your son about bullying at school when driving him to rugby practice. Ask your daughter about her new love interest when you are baking in the kitchen.


Use this time to really get to know your child. To build meaningful relationships with anyone, you need to take the time to get to know one another by learning about interests, preferences, hobbies, and so on. This type of relationship building is no different for you and your child. Engage with your child light-heartedly, play and joke around with them while at the same time respecting them and ensuring that what they talk about is important to you. Share your own interests, likes, and background with your child too. Emphasize to them similar interests you both may share.Your child is more likely to engage and open up when talking in this way., As your children age, it’s important to review your rules and guidelines and change them as needed. Children need to see that you trust them with more responsibility as they age. However, this also may translate to more serious consequences when they break the rules.


Encourage cooperation by sitting down with your children and discussing the rules. You might say, “It seems like you haven’t had any problem sticking to your 9pm curfew. Since you’re older, I think we’ll extend that by an hour. How does that sound?”, The feeling a teen gets when their parent genuinely wants their opinion is priceless. Many parents just bark out decisions instead of letting their kids play a role. However, as your children become teenagers and young adults, it can give them a sense of autonomy to offer forth their opinions.


Allow older children to weigh in on more decisions like choosing clothes, meals, activities, or vacation plans.You might ask older children’s opinions about handling family matters to show you respect their points-of-view.For example, you might say, ""Jackson, what's your suggestion for this week's family movie night?"" or ""Where would you like to go for summer break?""

, When your child has a strong relationship with you, they feel empowered to go out into the world and take on challenges. Be a supporter for your child, pushing them to develop greater self-efficacy over time.This may translate into allowing your teenager to handle their own laundry to ready them for college life. However, it may also involve empowering your child to stand up to bullies or speak up (respectfully) to a teacher who gave them an unfair grade.
Empowerment happens through gradual instruction. Teach your child how to take on more demanding chores or tasks. Role-play with them through stressful social situations. Then, give them feedback to encourage future progress.

, As your children mature, it’s okay to relax the parent hat a little and let them get a glimpse of the person underneath. In fact, showing your kids your human side can actually reinforce lessons. Use personal, age-appropriate stories to drive home ways your kids can learn and grow.


For instance, if you, too, had an incident with being bullied in your school days, share that with your child and explain how you got through it. They look at you as being strong and invincible, so it helps to know that you were teased and somehow got through it."

Allow family time to grieve.,
Get the items appraised.,
Decide an order for choosing heirlooms.,
Have a family “auction.” Instead of taking turn picking items, an alternative is to have a family “auction” Have all family members involved make a list of heirlooms in the house that they might be interested in having.,
Sell or donate most of the items.,
Decide before starting if switching will be allowed.

,
No fighting.",How to Divide up Family Heirlooms2," Even if there is a clear will and not much to work out after a death, recognize that your family has still lost an important member. Don’t try to rush through the process. Give yourself and your family time to grieve and support each other through this loss.

, You may already know if there is an antique or collectible item in the house. However, even if you know your mom’s china cabinet has plates from the 18th century, you may not know its value. There are many options to have items appraised, so it is important to do a little research before making decisions.After you have a list of the items and their values divide the total among the family members involved.


Professional appraisers. There are certified professionals to appraise almost any item, the Appraisers Association of Americaand the International Society of Appraisersare two respected organizations look into. The benefit of a professional appraiser is, since they are not allowed to buy item they appraise, you are more likely to be given a fair market value for your items.
Price guide books. For many collectable items there are respected books you can purchase to help you self-assess the price of your items. If your dad had a stamp or baseball collection, a guidebook can help you itemize and roughly price the collection.
Online appraisals. There are websites where you can upload photos and pay to have items appraised. While these websites are not able to authenticate, they can be helpful in giving a value to your items. Just be careful to do your research into the credibility before paying for any online services.

, As you go through the items keep a list of the value each member chooses, subtracting it from their total allocated amount. Take turns choosing items until all items are distributed.


Age order. Take turns choosing from oldest to youngest, and then youngest to oldest.
Shake dice. Each family member rolls a pair of dice. Choose highest to lowest roll, then lowest to highest roll. Then roll again and repeat.Draw straws. Number straws, one for each family member, then take turns drawing. Choose heirlooms from highest to lowest, then lowest to highest, and repeat.

, Any items that a family member expresses interest in will be added to the auction list.


Any items that are not on anyone’s list are immediately put aside and not used in the auction.
Give each sibling equal amounts of “money.” Use pennies, popsicle sticks, monopoly money, etc. to use during the “auction.” Read over the list of items that will be available during the auction so everyone can plan how they might want to spend their money. Remind family members that they only have a set amount to work and to bid wisely.
Auction off each item. Siblings may bid on their most wanted heirlooms until their “money” is gone., One way to avoid arguments over who gets what is to simply sell or donate the heirlooms. Let each member pick one or two mementos, then have a yard sale or use an auction house to sell the remaining items. Distribute the profits from the sale according to the total allocated amount for each family member.,, Once the items are divided it is final. No arguing or holding grudges. Remember your relationships with your family is the most important part."
"
Hire a third party.,
Recognize that things may not be “fair.” Not everyone will have the same idea about how to divide heirlooms “fairly.” For example, if you make more money than your sister, she may believe that she should get more from the estate, your brother may want the stamp collection to be donated to a museum, and you may want everything to be sold and the proceeds split evenly.

,
Focus on a compromise, not a win.,
Know when to take a break.",How to Divide up Family Heirlooms3," Whether you are dividing heirlooms before or after a loved one has passed it is critical to have a non-partisan third party involved.It is important to have a person there without emotional attachment to the items. Consider hiring a professional arbitrator or asking a priest to help your family.

,, Remember that there are many people and feelings involved in this experience.Think about what is most important to you from the division of heirlooms, and listen to what is most important for each other family member. You will not be completely satisfied with what happens, but maintaining family relationships is more important than getting everything you want.

, Emotions can run high when people begin getting sentimental over family heirlooms. If there is a particular item that everyone is arguing over, put it aside, take a break, and come back to it later. Sometimes family members begin arguing because of hurt feelings rather than a real desire for an item.It’s important to give yourself time away from the argument to calm down.

"
"
Put distance between you and your family.,
Cut off contact.,
Consider getting a restraining order.,
Write your family out of your will.Another way to make sure your family has no way to influence you or your children is to explicitly state as much in your will.",How to Disown Your Family2," If you are in a physically abusive situation or feel as though you're at the end of your rope, the most important step is to get to a safe place where your family can't hurt you. If you're over 18, your parents and family members have no legal right to determine where you should live.


If you aren't financially independent, determine whether you can stay with a friend or relative until you get on your feet.

, Once you're an adult, ""disowning"" your family primarily means ceasing all contact with them. Stop calling your family, and stop taking their calls. The same goes for email and other forms of communication. Don't give them your address, and instruct others not to tell them where you are.


You may want to change your phone number and email address to make it more difficult for your family to get in touch.
Consider sending a written statement that you are cutting off contact. State that you no longer want to be in contact, that you are disowning them, and that if they try to contact you you'll take legal action.

, If your family is physically abusive to you or your children, you may want to get a restraining order so they will be legally obligated to stay away. A Domestic Violence Restraining Orders (DVROs) may prevent your family from contacting you or coming within a certain distance of you.


Consider hiring a lawyer to help guide you through the process of filing a restraining order. The procedure varies from state to state, and you'll have a better chance of getting the protections you want if you have an expert helping you fill out the forms and navigate court appearances.
Once the restraining order is in place, call the police immediately if your family members violate it.

, Hire a lawyer to help you write a will that dictates your wishes regarding your end-of-life medical decisions, the guardianship of your children, and the way you wish your property to be handled.

Recognize that their bad mood may have nothing to do with you.,
Keep the conversations neutral.,
Redirect uncomfortable conversations.,
Find something to like about your unbearable family member.,
Reduce stress in the moment.,
Deal with stress in healthy ways.",How to Deal with Unbearable Family Members1," It's not about you when someone says something mean in your general direction. Some people are rude and negative to lots of people and family. While that's no excuse for their bad behavior, it may give you peace of mind that not everything that makes someone upset has to do with you. Some family members may be struggling with difficult situations, such as a loss of a family member or friend, a failing relationship, failing a class, losing a job, a recent move, not having enough money to pay the bills, or something else.
Others may have a long-standing history of depression, anxiety, or anger. They may have difficulty with controlling their mood and regulating how they feel or communicate.;
, Sometimes relatives can become unbearable when the conversation turns to stressful or emotionally charged topics. Religion, politics, and money can all lead to stressful and opinionated arguments. Avoid the mess of trying to ""win"" an argument.Keep the conversation positive or neutral. Don't start making accusations or bringing up negative things from the past.

, For example, let's say you have an opinionated uncle who likes to talk about politics, and you differ in your opinion from him. Maybe you're all seated for dinner, and he just wants to speak his mind. Maybe he's offended a few people in the room. Learning to redirect to a different and less emotionally charged topic will help you and everyone to keep the peace.


First attempt to redirect the topic to something else that your difficult family member enjoys, such as sports, movies, or TV.
Find a topic that your unbearable family member can have an interest in talking about without offending people.
Try something like: ""All this talk of politics reminds me of a play I saw once... Uncle Jerry, didn't you recently audition for a community play?""
If your uncle is being blatantly rude, see if you or another person at the table would be willing to talk with him in the kitchen. This will likely stop the conversation in its tracks.

, Ultimately finding ways to connect with your family members rather than finding reasons to hate them will be more beneficial for everyone.


Identify at least one thing that makes this family member not-so-terrible. It may be as simple as you like an outfit they're wearing or the type of food they like.
Say something like, ""You look great in that sweater. Where did you get it?"" Or, ""What did you think about the last Rolling Stones album?""

, Some great stress-busters, like exercise, can help you calm down, but you may not always be able to go for a run or hit the gym every time you get annoyed with a family member. Find ways to center yourself in the moment, such as deep breathing. Take a deep breath, inhaling for five seconds and letting your belly fill with air. Hold for a moment, then exhale slowly. Do this several times and you will feel yourself begin to calm down.


Other ways to deal with the person in the moment include finding an excuse to leave the room, using distraction (TV, dog, food, etc.), and reducing stress with laughter.

, While you can't control the actions of other people, you can do your best to keep your mind, body, and spirit in check. Learn to cope with unbearable people by making sure to set aside time for yourself. Consider these activities:Exercise. Go for a walk or run. Get outdoors. Take a hike. Ride a bike. Go to the gym. Go for a swim.
Do something creative. Write in a journal. Play music. Draw. Build something.
Be with friends and your community. Find group activities that interest you.

Meditate. Do stretches. Practice yoga.

Let the idea that money is a barrier flee from your mind as you consider your educational options.,
Make sure schools are accredited.,
Research the minimum GPA requirement.,
Do thorough research concerning financial aid.,
If you attend Fall and Spring semester and intend to work Summer semester, then call financial aid and have them walk you through the process of making that clear on your financial aid arrangements.,
Check the price of books.",How to Get a Religion Degree Online," Also, colleges like Liberty University and Liberty Theological Seminary even allow the admission fee to be deducted later from your financial aid. You can apply online without any money. Books costs are also deducted later. You are given a voucher with which to purchase your books from their affiliated bookstore online.;
, Try to stay away from diploma mills. These are easily researched online and many are noticeable by their extremely high tuition. Once you have chosen your college, call admissions and speak with someone. As a person who loathes these types of procedures, I have found that this method works better because admission counselors are there to help you. They know information that you do not and they can connect you with the right degree program.

, Many schools only require a 2.4 to gain admittance to their college. While other programs or colleges may require a 3.0 or higher, do not let your grade point average deter you from your degree. In certain instances, you can obtain conditional admission, allowing you to take prerequisite courses before you are officially admitted into the regular courses. This can easily raise your grade point average.

, Do your front work and make sure you are cooperative and proactive in getting this information in. Check and double-check your forms and resources. There is an online banking institution called Higher One, which allows your financial aid to be disbursed as a student checking and debit account. It is without a monthly fee and if you use your debit card as a credit card, there are no small fees for using the card for payment. Higher One was designed by students. You obtain faster access to your financial aid because as soon as the funds are disbursed to your college, they automatically transfer these funds to your account. Be aware that you will receive a rather large sum of money at one time. The temptation may be there to splurge. Use common sense and pay your bills first. Then, if there is an item that you can realistically afford, then, perhaps, purchase it but not before serious consideration. There is nothing like checking your bank account and realizing it is empty one month before any financial aid is due. Although many class schedules allow for working a part time job, some of the programs are so rigorous and additional responsibilities may not allow for paid work. Let your degree be your full-time job as much as possible.


Financial aid for online classes is the same as for residential classes, in many instances. The additional benefit of online classes is that you do not have to travel back and forth to campus. You may prefer studying at home or a local library or coffee shop. With the technology available with iphones and androids, many lessons and lectures may be listened to anywhere, even as you jog down the path. Discussion boards online are also easily accessed from any location with these devices, although appropriate reference material should be nearby as these discussion boards are highly intellectual and require book citations to back up your views or stances.
Financial aid is one of the more tricky areas to maneuver around. You must have all your college and financial information available. This includes your program of study, your start and projected end date, and your yearly income from tax records. Whether you are a dependent or independent student also decides the amount of financial aid available. For instance, Liberty University allows all information to be submitted and the FAFSA or federal financial aid application to be submitted online, as do most colleges. It is also very important to consider whether the funds you are entitled to will need to be allocated over two or three semesters. Make sure you complete your FAFSA as soon as possible because it takes several days to be determined for financial aid purposes.

, It takes about two minutes online. If you intend on attending classes all three semesters, then you can divide the funds between the three semesters. This allows a larger amount of funds to be obtained between just two semesters than if they are divided out among three semesters.


If you are in a position of caring for a loved one then perhaps the division between three semesters is better. Another very important factor to consider is that Fall semester is five months long so far as financial aid is concerned. Why this happens is December falls at the end of Fall semester and this leaves several additional weeks which require one to carefully consider their resources.

, Again, Liberty University has a student friendly approach. They allow all books to be ordered two or three weeks before classes start so you may begin reading your material. The prices of the books that are ordered are deducted from the upcoming financial aid. Although you may be able to purchase these books on Amazon or elsewhere much cheaper, make sure the ISBN numbers match exactly or you may have the wrong book. MSBN allows a student voucher code to be entered in order to purchase books. When you order, make sure you state the correct semester or the class materials may be different. Online financial aid does not disburse the first day of class at Liberty. It does not disburse until 25 days later. This is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because you are not anxious to go spend the money in your account because it isn't there. A curse because with beginning new classes there is the additional burden of figuring how to pay the bills until another month has passes. Again, many of the classes are very rigorous. You will not have time to work. Let your classes be your job.

Think about how you want to behave.,
Wait before you speak.Especially if you have strong negative feelings toward someone, don’t react quickly or speak without thinking.,

Dodge recurring heated debates.,
Pick your battles.Your cousin may say something really offensive that you immediately want to fire back on or correct, but take a breath and decide whether it’s worth engaging or not.,
Resolve conflicts.,
Say “no”.If you have a relative that seems to want things from you (money, free labor, a place to stay, etc.,
Avoid passive aggressive manipulation.,
Uphold your family rules.,
Handle delicate situations.,
Take care of yourself.,
Remember it’s not about you.,
Realize you can’t change this person.,
Accept your relative.,
Find reasons to be grateful.While you may dread family gatherings specifically because you hate having to spend time with difficult relatives, undoubtedly you can find something that you can look forward to or feel grateful for in meeting with your family.,
See a therapist.",How to Deal With Relatives You Hate," Before you spend time with this relative, take a few moments and decide how you want to behave.Perhaps you and this relative have gotten into arguments in the past. Ask yourself what started these arguments and if there are ways to avoid getting into an argument this time.


You may be proud to be Atheist, but your Aunt may truly believe that being Atheist will land you in hell. It may be best to avoid talking about religious beliefs when around your Aunt.;
, Take a breath before you speak. If you’re having a hard time holding back negative comments, gently excuse yourself.


Say, “Excuse me. I’m going to go use the bathroom” or “I’m going to see if any help is needed in the kitchen.”

, That way, if you get cornered into a discussion or argument you want to leave, you can signal for a rescue.


You can agree on a sign ahead of time if you may need a rescue at a family function. For instance, you can make eye contact and give a hand signal that means, “Please help me escape this situation!”

, You don’t have to dread going to family functions because of a family member. Put your focus on spending time with the family you enjoy and doing activities you find fun. Even if the family member you hate is in the room, focus on other things. If you find yourself in a conversation with this relative, find a distraction to help you get through the interaction (like playing with the dog).


If you fear sitting next to the relative during meals, suggest making name cards and sitting far from this person.

, One way to deal with a difficult relative is to give this person a job or a task at family gatherings. If a meal is being made, ask the relative to chop onions or set the table, and let him or her do it the way he or she wants.That way, the relative will feel like he or she is making a contribution, and will be out of the way for a bit.


Find ways to include this relative yet also keep this person busy.

, Especially if the situation is tense or uncomfortable, you can use humor to disarm difficult behavior and bring some lightness to the situation.Make a casual comment that shows you aren’t taking yourself or the situation too seriously.


If your grandmother keeps telling you to put on a sweater, say, “I should go grab a sweater for the cat, too; I wouldn’t want her to be cold, either!”

, You may have a friend call you (or you call a friend) with an “emergency”, or you can say the house alarm system is going off, or that your pet is ill. Whatever you find plausible, arm yourself with a potential excuse if you’re feeling uncomfortable or angry with your relative.

, If your uncle loves to bring up politics but you’d rather not discuss it, don’t engage the conversation.Make an effort not to bring up politics when in this family setting. Even if your uncle brings it up and tries to egg you on, it’s up to you how you respond. This goes for competing sports teams, universities, or cousin rivalries.


Say, “We can agree to disagree and leave it at that” or “I’d really rather not get into that here and I’d prefer to have a great family gathering without this argument again.”

, If your grandfather says something offensive, ask yourself whether your comment will alter his perception or if it will spark a debate.


Sometimes you have to grit your teeth and say, “You’re entitled to your opinion.”

, If you can’t stand your relative due to a conflict, see if you can resolve the conflict between you and your relative. You may need to find time to sit down, be honest with each other, and clear the air. When approaching your relative, be kind, compassionate, and non-defensive.The sooner you resolve conflicts, the less resentment will build up.
Be willing to forgive.You don’t have to ignore the situation or pretend it didn’t happen, but learn to forgive so that you can release the hurt in pain from within yourself.

,), don’t be afraid to say no. Remember that you have the right to say “no”. If you want to consider things before you immediately say “yes”, you also have the right to wait and think things over before you agree to anything.


You don’t have to justify your response or give an excuse. Just say, “I’m sorry, I’m unable to do that.” You don’t owe anyone an explanation.

, Perhaps your difficulties arise because of certain passive aggressive remarks from your relative comparing you to other grandchildren or nieces and nephews (“Well, Jason got into the university but you did great going to community college”). You may even feel manipulated by your relative by passive aggressive remarks or actions. If your relative is passive aggressive toward you, keep your distance as much as possible and don’t interact more than you have to; remember that it’s not about you and it’s not personal.If you feel like you are being manipulated, find an exit strategy from the conversation (“I’m going to see if any help is needed in the kitchen” or “I’m going to go play with my nephews, I haven’t seen them for so long!”). Don’t engage the conversation.

, If you struggle to enforce family boundaries with relatives, firmly let them know that family rules apply at all times. If you don’t like how a relative treats your child (like bossing the child around or feeding foods that are unhealthy), let this relative know that the behavior goes against family rules, and family rules are enforced in and outside the home.


Be upfront and matter-of-fact when discussing this with your relative. Say, “Allison isn’t allowed to play that game at home, and she’s not allowed to play it here, either.”

, If a relative has done something unforgivable, enforce whatever boundaries allow you to feel safe. If that means not inviting this relative to family functions, fully avoiding him or her, or letting the family know that relationship is severed is up to you. Put the focus on feeling safe, and not on punishing the family member.


Use your best judgment in telling other family members the situation. Keep in mind that while you feel the situation is unforgivable, your family may not feel the same way and continue a relationship with this family member.
While you may want your distance from your family member for your safety, realize that estrangement can be really hurtful, both to you and your family members., If you know you’ll be spending the day with a relative you dislike, make sure you come into the situation as prepared as possible. If this person brings out an aggressive or testy side of you, make sure you get a good night’s sleep the night before. If you’re feeling tired and grumpy at the family Christmas party, leave early. And make sure you’ve eaten, too: if your blood sugar is stable, you’re less likely to become angry or aggressive., If someone belittles you, talks down to you, or says mean things to you, it’s important to remember that this is more a reflection of the person than it is of you.Stand firm and remember who you are. Do your best to tune out the words, and remind yourself, “This is not about me. This is my aunt’s projection.”


People are often mean because they have their own personal issues they are dealing with. This can happen when people have low self esteem, anger issues, or stress.
Other people might act a certain way and truly believe it is okay and normal. This can be caused by a number of factors, but one example might be a person who lets their competitive and cutthroat business style seep into their personal life.
Some individuals simply don't have the biological tools needed to feel empathy. This may be brought about by genetic differences or by the way someone was brought up (i.e., the environment they grew up in)., There’s likely nothing you can do to change the person whom you don’t get along. You may have a fantasy of a happy family celebrating every holiday together, and when this relative comes, it crushes that fantasy. It’s up to you to drop this fantasy and accept that this is the family you have, and that fantasy is nothing more than a happy and nice thought that’s not based in reality., Instead of approaching this relative in judgment and disgust, practice being accepting and empathic. Listen when your relative talks and try to understand this person’s point of view.Practice loving compassion for this person. Take a deep breath and look at your relative. Then think, “I see you, and I see that you suffer and are in pain. I don’t understand your pain, but I see that it is there and I accept that it affects me for the time being.”, Maybe you’re excited to see your nieces and nephews, or happy you get to cook (or not cook).


Find things to be grateful for even before you arrive to the family function. That way you can go into the situation already feeling thankful.

, If you have a hard time moving past the hurt and pain the relative has caused, you may benefit from therapy. A therapist can help you work through feelings, find coping mechanisms, see things from a different perspective, and help you work through underlying feelings of depression, anxiety, or other diagnoses.You may also consider family therapy if you wish to engage your relative in therapy with you. While it may be difficult, it can help you confront difficult topics and discuss them with your relative.

Don't take it personally.,
Talk to your family members about how you feel.,
Avoid blaming the favored sibling.,
Spend some individual time with your family.",How to Deal with Favoritism in Your Family," You are special with your own quirks and traits. Don't allow your parents' favoritism to get to your self-esteem. It's just that the favored sibling's abilities are noticed more than yours. It doesn't mean you don't have any good qualities.;
, You can't force them to change, but by knowing how you feel when they favor someone else, they will most likely change because they love you. Sit your parents down and tell them your emotions.


For example, you could say ""Mom and Dad, I feel hurt and unimportant when you favor (sibling's name) over me. Could you please not do that?""
Be honest with your feelings and don't sugarcoat the situation. Favoritism is wrong, even if your parents aren't aware of it. Be calm and don't yell but be firm.
If they don't care about how you feel, thank them for hearing you and don't avoid bringing up the subject again but with maturity and show your family that you aren't going to be put down by their favoritism. If they still don't understand, make sure this doesn't break your sibling bond.

, Although it may seem tempting to blame your sibling for what's happening, don't. It isn't your sibling's fault they are being favored as they didn't ask for it. Still be nice to them and respect them. Blaming doesn't do anything effective, and in the end both of you will be hurt.

, Usually, the reason why favoritism happens, is because the parent/guardian/relative views the unfavored child as ""just another family member"" rather then an individual. You need to let them know that you are individually different, with your own talents and qualities. For example, if your Dad likes baseball, just you and him could attend a baseball game. Or if you're a girl and enjoy shopping, you and your Mom could just go to the mall and shop.

Focus on asking your loved one to change a behavior.,
Lead with a compliment.,
Point to the problems with your loved one’s behavior.,
Offer encouragement.,
Make yourself available to your loved one.,
Avoid pressuring your loved one to change.,
Stand up for yourself.",How to Deal With Loved Ones Who Refuse to Change1," It is important to make sure that you are asking your loved one to change a behavior and not to change who he or she is. Try to identify the specific behavior that you would like your loved one to change rather than suggesting that your loved one change her personality. Some behaviors that your loved one might be able to change include:


criticizing
nagging
making inappropriate remarks, such as racist, sexist, or homophobic comments
yelling or screaming at you
not respecting your privacy, such as by invading your space or prying during conversations;
, People who are not willing to consider another’s perspective or who are consistently engaging in behavior that is detrimental to themselves or your other family members are likely hard to talk to. Try to approach your loved one gently and start by offering a sincere compliment.


Always begin your compliments with ""I"" rather than ""you."" For example, you might compliment your loved one by saying something like, ""I appreciate your help with the dishes,"" or “I have always admired how assertive you are,” or “I think your passion for politics is so cool!”, Once you have gotten your loved one’s attention and helped to disarm him or her with a compliment, it may be easier to bring up the behavior that bothers you without causing your loved one to become defensive. Remember the goal is to focus on a behavior that you would like your loved one to change, not changing your loved one.


For example, you might say, “Dad, I feel uncomfortable when you make remarks about people who are gay. I have good friends who are gay and they are not at all how you describe them. I feel hurt and confused when you say those things.”

, It is possible that your loved one will become defensive. When someone is blatantly refusing to change or reconsider an opinion, he may be out of his comfort zone. If this happens, try to encourage your loved one to approach the situation differently.For example, you might say something like, “I know this is not a comfortable topic for you, but I think it is awesome that you are willing to talk to me about it.”

, Take care never to avoid your loved one, even when he or she may be frustrating you.Unless you or others are in danger because of the other person’s behavior, don’t avoid your loved one.


Isolating your loved one may intensify his or her problematic tendencies, so continue to include your loved one in activities as you usually do.
Make sure your loved one knows he or she can come to you with problems. Try saying something like, “I want you to know that I’m here for you when you want to talk.”

, Change takes time and pressuring your loved one will not make it happen any faster. Try to avoid doing things that might cause your loved one’s negative behavior to continue, such as:Constantly bringing up the issue. After you have made your loved one aware of your feelings, he or she will need to think about what you have said and make a decision to change or not change the behavior. Continuing to bring up the issue on a regular basis will not speed the process or sway your loved one. It is more likely to upset your loved one than anything else.
Avoid passive-aggressive comments about a loved one’s behavior. Making passive-aggressive comments is another form of pressuring your loved one, so it is best to avoid these. For example, don’t say things like, “Too bad some people are so close-minded.”

, If your loved one’s behaviors are hurting you, then you need to stand up for yourself. This can be difficult, especially if you are used to keeping quiet when you have an opinion.However, you will need to start being more assertive to help your loved one see that his or her behavior is not okay.


Try saying something like, “I respect your opinions, but I have a right to my opinion as well. The things you are saying/doing are hurting me and I want the behaviors to stop.”

Set clear boundaries.,

Look to elder care for help.,
Provide a way to earn money.,
Teach them some skills.,

Recognize if the money is tied to addiction.",How to Deal with Relatives Who Take Financial Advantage of You," If a family member makes a financial request, don’t immediately reach for your checkbook. Take some time to consider a few things before you agree or disagree to help out. For example, can you afford to help your relative? Have they asked you for assistance before, and did they follow through on paying you back? Could the situation potentially be resolved if they simply had the right resources and tools (help budgeting, etc.)? Will your relative be able to pay you back, and what will happen if they cannot or do not pay you back?Sometimes, saying no to a request may be difficult, but can save your relationship from any future resentment or hurt feelings. Money can create strains in your relationship.
Saying no is sometimes the best help you can give someone. Helping someone can turn into enabling them to continue a destructive lifestyle. If this person has a history of not paying back loans or taking advantage of others financially, it's probably best to tell them no.;
, Talking about money can be a sensitive topic, so be cautious in how you bring up financial discussions. Only ask questions that will help inform you of how to help. Don’t pry into their personal problems that are irrelevant to you helping them. Show your support and let them know that you want to help, even if it isn’t the way that they are requesting help.Put yourself in their shoes and think what it would be like to be in their position. What would be most helpful to them?
Say, “I know you’re making a request, but I’d like to know more information. What is the money going toward and will you need more money later?”

, If your relative promises to pay you back but tends not to, agree on a way to keep them accountable. Make it clear that you are loaning them money, not giving them money. Agree on a payment plan or other way to keep them accountable. Set dates to have money back and sign a document to make it clear to both of you what is expected.


Say, “I want to help you. I can’t give you money but I can loan it to you. Let’s work out a plan so that you can pay me back.”

, A relative who thinks they can depend on you for money may have more and more requests for help, even if their initial request was necessary. If you fear being taken advantage of or being put in a bad situation, create some boundaries. Be clear on how much money you’re willing to gift or lend. If you’re not comfortable being a revolving piggy bank, let your relative know you’re willing to help them one time, then they need to find another option.Say, “I am willing to help you; however, I don’t want this to happen regularly. If you need money in the future, you will need to find it somewhere else.”

, Even if your relative is in a bad situation, you have the right to say no, even if they pressure you. You don’t have to give a reason, just say, “no.” You can still care and support your relative without giving them money.Say, “I know you’re looking for financial help, but I’m not able to help you at this time.”
Be careful about saying, “This is the last time.” Several times can turn out the be the ""last time,"" so be firm and say no.

, If you say no and your relative pressures you, know how to respond. Your relative may try to guilt you or take away something you care about (like access to your grandchildren). Say that you understand what they want and they do not need to pressure you into making a decision, which may make you begin to resent them. Ask them not to pressure you or guilt you from now on.Say, “I know what you want, and there is no need to pressure me or guilt me into giving you what you want.”

, If you are elderly and are being taken advantage of, reach out for community support. Financial and elder abuse unfortunately often comes from those who are close to us, as they can use that close relationship to gain access to your assets. Children and grandchildren may take advantage of their aging relatives as a way to get money. If you suspect a family member is doing this to you, you can get help from someone in your community. Find local support to help you assess the situation and get help if necessary.Although family members are among the most common financial abusers to the elderly population, they are not the only ones. Caretakers (home health care worker), neighbors, or professionals (lawyers, bankers, financial advisors) can all commit financial abuse.
If you suspect financial abuse, call the the Adult Protective Services Hotline at 1-800-677-1116. You can make this call on your own behalf or on behalf of someone you suspect is being abused.
If you or the elderly person live in a nursing home, contact the Nursing Home Ombudsman (http://theconsumervoice.org/get_help). They will send an advocate to investigate.

http://www.eldercare.gov/ can also help link you to local resources.

, If you’re handing out money that’s never getting paid back, find a way to make an exchange instead. For example, the next time your relative asks for money, say, “Would you be willing to help me with some house cleaning in exchange?” This way, the money can be earned and not just given.It’s up to you how much money you’re willing to pay your relative for their help. If they find reasons not to help you, this may indicate that they don’t want to work for the money and rely on you to give it to them.

, There’s a saying that goes, “Give a person a fish you’ll feed them for a day. Teach a person to fish and you’ll feed them for a lifetime.” To someone who continuously relies on you, give them skills to rely on themselves. After all, what happens to them if something happens to you? Perhaps you make money because you took a financial management class, have steady employment, or work with a professional to manage your money. Offer to help your relative to build similar skills.


Work together to create a budget, recommend a program, or recommend a financial planner., If you have the financial means, consider making an investment in your relative. For example, help your relative invest in their education or a business. This may be a larger amount than they ask for, but consider your investment as a way to give them more security in making money in the future.For example, if your relative is struggling to get by teaching yoga, offer to help them open up a yoga studio.

, Instead of using your wallet as the solution, allow there to be other means of help. For example, if your relative is unemployed, let them know about temporary agencies that match people with temporary work, selling items online, or looking through the yellow pages or online forums to get a job. Your money does not have to be the only solution.Say, “Let’s look at online listings together so we can find you a job.”
Say, ”I know you’re having a hard time finding a job. What are your interests and how can you put those toward more stable employment?”

, Find ways to assist them in furthering their career or employment. For example, offer to babysit their kids so that they can attend job interviews or work meetings. If they ask for money to pay for food, invite them over for meals at your house. Find ways you can help that don’t involve money. This way, you can show that you care and want to help but in a non-financial way.Say, “At the moment I can’t help you financially, but I’d love to help you in different ways. If you need help going to interviews, I can watch the kids or give you a ride.”

, If your relative has a problem with alcohol, drugs, gambling, or another addiction, recognize that giving them money may be enabling their addiction. If you suspect that addiction is involved, offer to help and support your loved one in other ways. Offer your support in wanting them to break free from addiction and seek professional help. Support their steps to recovery through the ups and downs.If your relative asks for money, say that you are willing to give money in order to help their recovery. For example, say that you are willing to help them seek treatment or see a counselor. Do not give them the money for treatment directly. Offer to help pay for detox and/or rehab, sending payments directly to the facility.

Communicate what's bothering you.,
Approach the issue when you're one-on-one.,
Use ""I"" statements to keep confrontations from feeling like personal attacks.,
Focus your time on family members who are supportive.,
Rally other family members together to handle the unbearable person.,
Distance yourself.,
Ensure the safety of children.",How to Deal with Unbearable Family Members2," Sometimes you may feel uneasy about speaking up for yourself or others. But it can be important to address what's bothering you rather than bottling it up or repressing it. You don't want to let negative feelings fester and then turn into arguments and fights.


Learning to be open with what you're feeling can help others to understand the situation better. Sometimes they may understand, and other times they might not. While you may not change them, they may be able to see things a little different if you are open with them., Avoid making a scene in a large group about what's bothering you. Private conversations are best if there is a difficult or uncomfortable situation in order reduce possible embarrassment on either side.


For example, let's say you're at a family picnic and your cousin is playing mean tricks on some of the younger kids. First ask to talk with your cousin for a minute alone and ask them to stop. If they don't stop, find a supportive adult like a parent or grandparent that can help to discipline your cousin. Avoid having this occur in front of the family group.

, Avoid blaming or focusing on the negative traits of the family member. By using ""I"" statements, you deflect the focus to how certain actions lead to certain reactions.


Consider saying, ""I was feeling hurt when you said that I'm terrible at making breakfast."" Then set the boundary by requesting what future behavior should look like: ""In the future, please keep hurtful comments to yourself.""
Or say something like, ""I felt upset when you yelled at me about tying the trash bags without using the twist ties. If you want me to do it differently that's fine, but next time just ask me instead of yelling."" Avoid saying things are generic in their negativity such as ""you're OCD"" or ""you're crazy.""

, While you may feel stressed, anxious, or upset by the behaviors of unbearable family members, avoid dwelling on their negative behavior. Focus on what you can control — your own actions. Take your mind off of unbearable relatives by reminding yourself of those who support you.


Reach out to other family that you see less but have enjoyed being with. Make plans with them or talk with them over the phone.
Do you have a kind grandparent? Talk with them or visit. They may have wisdom about how to deal with difficult people.
Lean on family that you trust about the difficulties you're facing with a challenging family member.

, If a family member is continuing to be obnoxious to you and others, find an authority figure in the family. You don't have to feel alone in dealing with an unbearable family member.


For example, your brother may not listen to what's bothering you, but he may listen to your mom, dad, or grandfather.
Even if they don't live in the same city or state as you, comforting relatives may be able to assist if there's a crisis or an ongoing challenge with your unbearable relative.

, Find ways to limit your interactions with family members who make you feel upset or anxious. This may be especially important if you see them daily or weekly. Learn to be polite when you want to distance yourself. Stirring drama may make other family members uneasy.If the relative you want to avoid is a parent or sibling, it may be more difficult to have distance if you're living with them. Find ways to create private space at home so that you don't feel bothered by them. For example, if it's your sister who's bothering you, find a different room to be in when you're relaxing or doing work.
If the relative doesn't live with you but visits frequently, find ways to be occupied with other things when they visit. Do something outside or with other people if they are at your home. Find spaces that make you feel more comfortable so the interactions are limited.
If the relative is someone you see only during the holidays, this may be an uncomfortable time when you see them, but remind yourself that you don't see them regularly. You may be able to sit with other relatives more, or excuse yourself when your relative is particularly unbearable.
If you're visiting at your relative's home, find ways to excuse yourself from the room, or interact with others at the house more. If you're an adult, it's your choice whether you want to stay and visit with someone who is rude and mean. If you're told to visit as a child or teen, talk with your parents or relatives about what makes you uncomfortable. Be open rather than keeping quiet and upset.

, While each family may have different parenting styles, it is important to protect your own children and those of others who may feel unsafe. Safety does not just mean physical safety but also emotional safety. Some unbearable family members lack insight about boundaries when around children. They may use vulgar language or act inappropriate. They may lash out at children because they have difficulties in their own lives. Here are some things to consider:


Approach the person who is acting inappropriate and ask for them to stop. For example, let's say there is an aunt who uses vulgar language to talk about people she dislikes and her sex life. She may not realize it's inappropriate to talk about that with six year olds in the room. Request to speak with your aunt in a different area of the room about her language. If she continues to ignore your requests, and she is in your home, then consider asking her to leave unless she is able to act appropriately.
Provide a safe environment if things are getting out of hand. Let's say you and your two children live with an unbearable relative who spends all his time drinking and acting obnoxious to others. Maybe he yells at you or the kids for seemingly the slightest things. If you can't talk with this relative about his behavior, you may need to find a way to have the relative live elsewhere, or find another place for the children to stay safe. Don't let bullies and manipulators take over your life. Focus on staying safe."
"
Be assertive.,
Set consequences for unbearable behavior.,
Accept that you can't change other people's behavior.,
Seek help outside your family.",How to Deal with Unbearable Family Members3," Don't let others blame things on you or use you as a scapegoat for a problem. Be polite and direct about the facts of the situation. Avoid immediately blaming them or being defensive. It can sometimes be tough to be direct, but if done in a clear and matter-of-fact way, it may help you to feel less like a victim.Speak calmly and maintain eye contact.
Be aware of the setting when having a direct conversation. Avoid asserting yourself in a large family gathering. Ask to speak with the relative in another room or privately.
Focus on the topic at hand. Avoid bringing up the past or other things that are bothering you. If the relative goes off on a tangent, redirect them back to the original topic.
Try to start and end the conversation with something neutral or positive. Avoid making the conversation too harsh.
Say what you need to say and accept that the situation may not change after that. Be willing to let go of the topic if it's going nowhere.

, If the family member is continually acting inappropriate, and they are unavoidable, find ways to establish consequences. This will likely work if they are intruding in your space or your home. Don't be guilt-tripped into accepting their bad behavior.


In the heat of an argument, you may get emotionally charged when trying to address consequences for bad behavior. Try to only talk about consequences when you are calm. Don't threaten in a nasty way. Be clear, calm, and direct.
If you're younger than them or under 18, consider finding an adult or parent to help with setting consequences.
For example, let's say you have two cousins who continually come over to your home and ask you and your family for money. Maybe you feel intimidated by your cousins. They are loud, domineering, and guilt-trip everyone. Talk with your family about what is going on and decide on the consequences of what will happen if they come over to ask for money. Get everyone on the same page that the cousins are not welcome if they continue to come over for money. Then you or another family member must explain to them that if they continue to ask for money after being told no, then they will be asked to leave.

, While you may want to be able to ""fix"" someone or convince them that they're wrong, this may feel like you're talking to a brick wall. Some people are willing and open to change, while others are not ready or able to admit when there's something wrong. While your family member's actions or words may cause you stress, getting back at them or trying to tell them that they're wrong may not make things any easier. While telling them ""no"" or explaining that they are not welcome due to their behavior may put you and your family member on non-speaking terms, sometimes having a little distance can help.
Focus your time and energy on the people and family members who recognize their own faults, are willing to admit them, and see the importance of change.
Accepting that someone won't change does not necessarily mean that you approve of their behavior. You don't have to support them with your time, money, or talents if you feel that they are difficult or manipulative.

, While advice from family members may be helpful, it can also be wise to seek support and advice from others who may have an outsider's perspective.


Talk with friends or the family members of friends about what you're facing with your own family.
Discuss with teachers or mentors the difficulties you're having.
Seek out the support of school counselors or counseling centers in your community. A therapist can assist with coping skills and teach you how to assert yourself.
If you're working, see if your employer has an employee assistance program. They may offer free over-the-phone or in-person counseling sessions to deal with difficult people and relationships.

Articulate your willingness to have a conversation free of blame.,
Open a conversation about your loved one with a story about yourself.,
Quit trying to reason.,
Use “I” statements when conveying your opinions.,
Demonstrate the way you hope a conversation will go.,
Laugh off brief moments of tension.,
Be patient.,
Know when to end a conversation.",How to Deal With Loved Ones Who Refuse to Change2," State that you have no desire to attack a loved one. Emphasize an interest in listening and responding to one another non-defensively.If something comes up, but tempers are running high or the context is not appropriate for an open, heartfelt conversation, ask your loved one to agree to talk soon.
State the intention of a conversation beforehand. For instance, say something like, “I want to strengthen our relationship by better understanding ______.”

, Particularly if you’re hoping to discuss your loved one’s unwillingness to change – or willingness to see something differently – talk about a time you came to an awakening of your own.Talk about a time you accepted help for something you had previously insisted wasn’t an issue.
Check your terminology and framing to ensure you are not shaming your loved on for whatever it is you believe he or she needs to change.

, Abandon the concept of who’s right and who’s wrong. If someone refuses to change – either a behavior or perspective on a single issue – he or she may not be relying on reason or logic to make this decision.The behavior may just be part of your loved one’s belief system, so debating will not help.


Avoid starting a debate with your loved one. Don’t ask your loved one to provide proof for his or her beliefs or try to prove your loved one wrong.
Ask questions. Try to better understand where your loved one is coming from. For example, you might ask something like, “What experiences did you have that have caused you to feel that way?”

, Making it clear that you recognize that your own perspectives are often subjective or opinionated may help loved one’s come to the same conclusion.Begin sentences with “I think ______”, “In my opinion_____”, or “It seems to me that _____”.
If a statement requires elaboration, follow with something like “So, I’m wondering about _____”, or “It seems that this might lead to _______”.
Elaborations are only necessary when your loved one doesn’t respond to your initial observations or stated feelings.

, Send clear signals that you are willing to revisit and rethink your positions, and that you hope your loved one will have the same attitude.If you state opinion as truth and your loved one jumps on you for it, admit that your terminology was problematic and adjust it.
Say something like, “Well… yes, you’re right, I can’t be positive, but I see it like this.”

, It is extremely normal for moments of tension to arise in everyday conversation, especially between loved ones who spend a lot of time together. If this does occur, quickly try to reduce the tension.Say something like, “Jeez, we’re both being pretty stubborn!”
All it takes for someone’s defenses to go up is one side refusing to give ground. Make sure it isn’t you that pushes a conversation into deadlock.
Follow up any potential spots of conversational lock-up with a question such as, “Do you see it differently?”

, You may end up feeling most frustrated just when your loved one is closest to adjusting their behavior, when they’ve acknowledged that things need to change but may still be slipping.Recognize that even when people are willing, change takes time. Breaking entrenched patterns of behavior in particular is a process.
Incremental improvements, even only during dialogue, are worth acknowledging.
Show your appreciation for a loved one’s effort and willingness to change by thanking your loved one for talking with you.

, Sometimes, it may be the most healthy or safe decision to change the subject or simply walk away. If your loved one is absolutely unwilling to have a mature conversation and becomes aggressive or starts to shout, then don’t risk your own stability and safety.End the conversation before it gets out of hand.


For example, you could say something like, “Let’s talk some other time when we are both feeling calm.” Or, “This has been a good start, but I think we should end it here.”

Schedule a time to talk as a group.,
Focus on the issue at hand.,
Have everyone state what they truly mean.,
Listen without interrupting.,
Validate and show respect for each person’s point of view.,
Decide on a solution together.,
Seek professional advice.,
Be aware of how different family members may react to problems.,
Acknowledge but get a handle on emotions.,
Resist the urge to point the finger.",How to Deal With Family Problems," Facing and overcoming family problems can seem impossible. When you work together, however, resolving family differences becomes more feasible. The first step towards resolution is agreeing that there is a problem in the first place. Then, once tempers are moderately cooled, everyone needs to plan to come together and devise a strategy to resolve the problem.


Schedule a meeting at a time that is mostly convenient for everyone. Make everyone aware of the purpose of the meeting and that you want them to arrive with suggestions and solutions at the ready.
Be mindful that young children may be a hindrance to a family meeting. Huddle them in a separate room if you expect tempers to flair or sensitive information to be discussed.
Therapists often suggest holding regular family meetings.This tactic enables family members to bring issues out in the open before resentments develop. Talking with your family on a regular basis can improve communication and the bond that you share.;
, When disagreements occur, people have a tendency to bring up any and every unresolved issue they have ever encountered with the other parties. This impedes conflict resolution and blurs the point of the discussion.Strive to uncover what is actually important about the current problem. Building a case or bringing up old misdeeds will not assist you in resolving this issue.

, Direct communication is essential to effective conflict resolution. Each party should use “I” statements to clearly state your needs, wants, and concerns.Remember, you are aiming to de-escalate the conflict and work towards a solution. Using “I” statements allows everyone to express themselves while showing respect for the others listening. Making an “I” statements allows each person to take ownership for what they are feeling, and suggest a remedy for the problem at the same time.
Examples of “I” statements include: “I am worried that our family is falling apart. I would like us to work things out.” or “I get scared when Dad drinks a lot because he starts yelling. I wish he could stop drinking”., To reach an agreement during a family conflict, listening is imperative. Only by actively listening to each party can you understand what he is trying to communicate. Active listening involves cuing in on the other person’s tone and body language, allowing him to speak without interruptions or remarks, and paraphrasing what was said afterwards to ensure you understood correctly.


Effective listening allows the other person to feel heard, motivates the other parties to want to listen to you, defuses arguments and strong emotions, and rebuilds the relationship during conflict., Validation pertains to showing another that you recognize, value, and accept his thoughts, opinions, or beliefs.Of course, your own opinions may differ greatly, but using validation demonstrates that you see the other as a human, worthy of integrity and respect.Validate your family members by saying something like “I’m really glad you felt comfortable enough to share this with me” or “I appreciate your willingness to work towards a solution”.

, Once everyone has shared their needs, wants, and concerns, then strive for a compromise. Consider all the suggestions that each party has provided and look for a middle ground. Everyone present should feel good about the proposed solution. If necessary, develop a contract or written agreement outlining how you will manage the problem., If you cannot resolve the problem on your own, consult with a family therapist who can offer you practical advice about managing your family’s problem., One potential obstruction to conflict resolution in families is differences in how each member responds to stress or tension. These differences must be taken into account and everyone will have to consciously choose to face the issue in order to truly find a solution.For some people, conflict causes them to become hostile and defensive. This is the “fight” aspect of the physiological “fight or flight” response. These individuals may argue endlessly to remove any responsibility from themselves, or refuse to hear others’ points-of-view.
Others resort to the “flight” aspect. These individuals may run from conflict at all cost. They may deny there’s a problem, or believe there’s nothing they can do to resolve it anyway. Such family members may pretend as if they don’t notice any tension in the household, or downplay its effect on them.

, Emotional awareness is important in recognizing the unique experience of yourself and others. If you have trouble identifying how you feel, you will have trouble controlling your emotions or expressing your needs during conflict.First work on trying to identify your emotions.Consider what thoughts you’re having, what you feel in your body, and what actions you want to take? For example, maybe you’re thinking “I hate this family.” Your fists are clenched and you want to punch something. Such a strong emotion could be labeled as anger or contempt.
Next, aim to control and ease these strong emotions so that you can effectively problem-solve. Depending on how you’re feeling participate in a complimentary activity to ease your discomfort. For example, if you are sad, you might want to watch a funny movie. If you are angry, it might be helpful to vent to a friend or engage in intense physical activity.

, Accusing someone of being the cause of the problem will only result in the person becoming defensive, and otherwise, hindering a productive exchange. Always attempt to attack the problem, not the person. You can love, honor, and respect someone without liking every single thing he does. However, if you make your loved one out to be the blame of the issue, progressing beyond this point is difficult.Using “I” statements is one of the best strategies to minimizing blame and subsequent defensiveness. Say “I fear that your addiction will lead to someone getting hurt” rather than “Addicts are just dangerous people to be around”.

Understand signs of codependency.,
Explore books about codependency and its effects on the family and relationships.,
The best way to move out of a codependent relationship is to stop focusing on the other and to focus on yourself and your health.,
Eventually the other person will have to begin getting healthier as well or will have to rethink the importance of the relationship.,
If the other person does not come to respect your needs and/or growth, however, the healthiest choice is to maintain your boundaries.",How to Deal With an Extremely Codependent Family," There are many signs. One of them is dysfunctional boundaries. Like boundaries with personal ""physical"" space, (ie. standing too close to someone in an elevator) people in codependent relationships interfere with others by invading emotional space, allowing others to invade theirs, and having trouble distinguishing their own feelings, needs, and responsibilities from other people. You realize you feel uncomfortable not giving help when asked, or you are the main provider for comfort or any other support for a person close to you, or you feel pulled in many directions by the people closest to you.;
, Look for material on the Internet and gain an understanding on the causes of the relationship difficulties.


Codependent parents, for example, may have a hard time letting go of parenting and providing for their adult children, or they rely on their grown children to help them in unhealthy ways, reversing the parent-child dynamic. Pulling away from either dynamic is a positive move toward establishing healthy personal boundaries. It does not mean that you're a ""bad"" son or daughter, even if the parent claims that this is the case.

, When you put your need to grow, mature, and become a healthier person first, that will create a shift in your codependent relationship.


Be aware that doing this work will destabilize the relationship and make things harder before it makes them better. Imagine you and the person with whom you have a codependent relationship are roped together and standing on ladders next to one another. As things are now, you are stabilized--on the same rungs on your ladders and the rope around you both is taut. You understand the unspoken rules of how you interact.
Now, when you begin to get healthy, begin moving up your ladder, the other person in the relationship will feel the pull of the rope and try to pull you back down, may even move down her / his ladder a rung or two to get you to move back to where things were. This is normal. Continue your work to grow, mature, and become healthier. The rope can stretch.

, (And generally, most folks will choose to get healthier, thus making the whole thing less codependent)

, Find ways to make choices that are independent of their needs. In worst-case scenarios, curtailing contact may be necessary for personal growth.

Go to a different location.,
Change the topic if you get into an uncomfortable conversation.,
Distract him with an activity.",How to Deal With a Rude Family Member1," While it may be unavoidable, large family gatherings usually require a large space. Get away from any rude family members by simply changing locations. Be polite and greet him with a handshake and a smile; you’re not obligated to engage in anything more.


Stay out of earshot. Even if you change locations, you may still be able to hear something infuriating. Be sure to move into a room where his voice will be muffled or close the door of the room he is in.
If it is a family member that you will see everyday like your sibling, schedule yourself to limit your time with him. For example, join extra-curricular activities after school so you won't have to be at dinner with your rude younger brother.;
, Many times rude people are simply trying to get attention by eliciting a reaction. If you know what topics she enjoys evoking, avoid them by bridging to a more neutral conversation that won’t require her opinion or reaction.


For example, steer clear of her political views and talk about topics that you know she enjoys and remains positive about like her recent home improvements. Say something like, “That is a difficult issue that I’d like to read more about before I place my vote. Speaking of reading, I read an article on how to build a really great deck. How long did it take you to build yours?”
If it is a family member that you have to interact with every day, keep cordial. Talk about common interests or dislikes to form a bond.

, Depending on the size of the family gathering, there may be opportunities to break away and start an activity. Large family gatherings may need people to help supervise children, prepare the meal, or clean the location. Delegating a job that he enjoys will keep him occupied.


For example, ask for help with your car, home renovation tips, or playing sports with the kids.
Be careful not to include him in an activity where he could offend more people. If you ask him to participate in activity with a lot of social interaction, you could be fueling a volatile situation.
Keep busy around the house or take up a new hobby to stay away from any rude siblings. Better yet, fuel the interest or support the hobby of your rude family member. For example, if your rude brother likes a certain type of book or video game, buy him several of that genre to keep her occupied."

Be consistent in your approach.,
When observing the commotion, remember to look for what isn't being spoken.,

When looking for a solution, look inward at your role and what you can change to defuse the situation.

,
Remember you can only change you and your role in the commotion.

When the commotion is deescalated and the house is returned to quiet ... it is time to have a talk about what happened and problem solve for the future.

,
Remember to not allow the actions of others steal your power.

Don’t include many chores in the morning routine.,
Ease kids into routines when school starts.,
Incorporate exercise into your morning routine.",How to Create a Morning Routine for the Whole Family1," It will be difficult or impossible to stick to the morning routine if you and/or your family doesn’t get enough sleep.To wake up energized and ready to jump into your morning routine, you’ll need to have a full night’s rest. You should try to get about seven hours of sleep each night. Younger people will need even more sleep. Teens should get about eight hours of sleep nightly, and elementary and middle school students will need around 10 hours.Your morning routine should start with waking up. Select your bedtime relative to when your morning routine begins.
For instance, if you have a 6:00 wakeup time, you should plan on going to bed around 10:00.;
, Your morning routine should include things that matter to you. Cut things that are unnecessary, unimportant, or could be done later. For instance, your morning routine should exclude things like polishing your shoes, doing the laundry, or walking the dog. Ask yourself what is most important for you and your family, then incorporate it into your morning routine.Things that should be incorporated into your morning routine include getting your children to brush their teeth and eat breakfast.

, The best way to organize morning routine tasks is to place the less fun parts of the morning routine (getting dressed, brushing teeth, and making the bed) before the more enjoyable parts of the morning routine (eating breakfast, watching TV, and meeting friends at the bus station). That way, when your child wishes to engage in something fun like eating breakfast, you can say, “You can eat breakfast after you’ve brushed your teeth.”


Staggering morning routine tasks in a logical way reminds your child that the morning routine must be followed closely in order to have a happy and successful morning.

, Everyone in your family should have a few minutes of special time in their morning routine. This allows individuals to take care of specialty tasks that matter only to them. Alternately, it allows people to catch up to the rest of the family if they’re running behind. Use this special time to do what matters to you – or just relax and read the news while others are engaged in their morning routines.For instance, perhaps your daughter wants to put makeup on as part of her morning routine.
Perhaps your husband wants to shine his shoes.
You and your partner might use the time to beat the morning traffic and get to work a bit early.

, The morning routine should allow time to feed the dog and let it outside for a bit, and time for the kids to make their beds. But nobody should be watering the plants, washing the dishes, or vacuuming the house. Save these time-consuming chores for later, when everyone is home and has more time to commit to them., Starting the school-year morning routine on the first day of school is just asking for trouble. To avoid sleeping late, begin the school-year routine a week or so before your kids start the first day of class. Likewise, if you and your partner have a week off of work, you’ll probably spend a few of those days sleeping late and enjoying lazy mornings. But your last weekend before returning to work should be used to resume your morning routine., Research shows that by exercising before breakfast in the morning, you can better maintain a healthy weight. You could go for a jog, a bike ride, or do pushups and sit-ups.Kids live an active lifestyle and probably don’t need additional exercise time in the morning. However, if your child is overweight or obese, you could schedule some exercise time into their morning routine, as well.

Ask your loved one to get help for you.,
Know when to end a relationship.",How to Deal With Loved Ones Who Refuse to Change3," Whatever has brought the issue of your loved one’s unwillingness to change to your attention may require more than conversation to address properly. Look into how to help your loved one deal with any of the issues you think your loved one may be having in their individual lives.Part of being there is having something to say when someone comes to you for help. (Or when they don’t.)
Know the first step that a loved will need to take so you can recommend it.
Talk to a health care professional. You may benefit both in terms of knowledge about your loved one’s scenario, and in terms of your own mental health, by seeing a mental health professional yourself.

, If you’re able to have an honest conversation with a loved one who is struggling with personal issues, you’ll likely have an opportunity to help. Try to find some information about where your loved one can go for help. The best way to do this may be advising your loved one to see a general practitioner and ask for a referral to a therapist.Your loved one may be more likely to agree to seeing a general practitioner than to seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist. General practitioners may then be able to convince your loved one to see a mental health care professional.
When advising your loved one to get help, emphasize statements your loved one has made or behavior that may bring harm to your loved one or to others. For example, you might say, “I am concerned about what you said about feeling angry all of the time. I think that you might need to talk to someone about that to feel better.”
If you don’t know where to look for help or information, contact organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness., If your loved one resists your recommendation to see a professional or otherwise get help, you might consider asking him or her to do so for the sake of your relationship.Ask other friends and loved ones to do the same.
In dangerous scenarios in which your loved one’s behavior is detrimentally affecting his or her own and others’ health and safety, this may be the only way to convince your loved one to address the need to change.
Try something like, “I know you’re struggling with ______ right now, and I want to let you know I support you. I want our relationship to stay healthy and positive, and it would mean a lot to me if you got help dealing with _____.”

, Set boundaries for relationships in which there is risk to yourself or others, including your loved one. Take the time to reflect on what you are willing to participate in, help with, or, frankly, put up with in your life.Articulate the boundaries you set for yourself to your loved one. For example, you might say something like, “I can’t be around you when you have been drinking. If I come home and you are drunk, then I will have to leave.”
If a loved one consistently knowingly defies or asks you to defy boundaries you’ve clearly articulated, you need to consider ending the relationship.
If a loved one is consistently hurting you or others, you need to act. Ideally, your loved one will be willing to willing to change his or her behavior. If not, you may need to distance yourself from your loved one, and potentially stop seeing the person.

If it helps, try saying your thoughts aloud to a trusted friend or another family member. Always sleep on your emotions for several days to ensure they are accurate and not irrational.Recognizing how you feel will help you tailor a solution to the problem.

, Writing down what you want to say allows you to construct a coherent and rational communication plan.


Begin with a flow chart or brainstorm your thoughts and emotions.
Practice and rehearse what you will say. Whether you talk in front of a mirror or go over your talking points with other family members, get comfortable speaking about this issue and being in a hostile scenario.

, Silence enables bad behavior. Other family may not be comfortable stepping in. Have a frank discussion and let her know how her behavior is affecting you and the rest of the family.


Take a deep breath before and during the confrontation.Keep calm when delivering news that the person may see as accusatory. Open body language and a friendly demeanor can help defuse their defensiveness.Remember people who are rude may be in denial or become defensive.
Use ""I-statements"", to express how you feel rather than starting a statement with ""you"". Don't place blame but rather state clearly how you feel while listening to what they have to say.

, Make sure to choose your words carefully and not to escalate the emotions with an angry or elevated tone.For example, if you are confronting your younger brother, say something similar to, ""I don't appreciate your snarky and sarcastic comments. There's a time and place for jokes. It's fine to joke around with your friends, or with me when we are watching tv, but please don't say things that will upset mom and dad. Don't say things at the dinner table, especially after they've both had a long day.""

, You may escalate the situation if you confront your family member in front of others because they may feel embarrassed and will want to lash out. Choose a place where you can present yourself as equals.


Scheduling around her can ensure that she doesn’t feel blind-sided or rushed for a response. Scheduling shows that you are considerate of her time and that you have thought about this conversation enough to prioritize it.

Perhaps he is rude because he had a tough upbringing or because he feels insecure about his accomplishments relatives to the rest of the family.Don't broach difficult topics by becoming rude yourself. For example, if she often references how much you make compared to her, let her know that you know how hard it's been for her and her family. Offer advice and let her know that you know where she's coming from with an example of how you had to move up to get to where you are financially.

Send your kids out to meet the bus.",How to Create a Morning Routine for the Whole Family2," After waking up, dress yourself and encourage your partner to do the same. Dress appropriately for whatever is next in your morning routine. If you’re headed to the office, you should dress in work attire. If you’re going to bike or jog a few miles before breakfast, change into your workout clothes., If your kids are old enough, they should wake with their alarm clocks and dress themselves. If they are too young to dress themselves, wake them up and dress them yourself. If your kids are messy eaters, you should wait to dress them until after breakfast., Show your children how to brush their teeth properly, with the brush angled at 45 degrees toward the gums.Remind your children to brush their molars and tongue, too.
Tell your children, “Brushing your teeth keeps your breath fresh.”

, Breakfast is the meal that begins the day. Eating a healthy breakfast has been linked to improved memory, lower risk for diabetes, and better overall health.Try to find healthy breakfast options that require little to no preparation. For instance, sliced apples, strawberries, and bananas with two slices of whole grain toast is a delicious breakfast option. A green smoothie chock full of kale, blueberries, and spinach is also a good option.Talk to your family about what sorts of healthy breakfast foods they like. Obtain these foods for your morning routine.

, If you have younger kids, you could take five minutes to snuggle with each child in bed just before they wake up.Talk to them about their dreams that night. With older kids, you could converse with them during breakfast about what they have planned that day., Your kids should be at the bus stop at least five minutes before it arrives. This ensures they will not miss it. Help them remember to grab their book bags and other essentials from the family’s predesignated organizational point.If you wish, you could walk your children to the bus. Younger kids might benefit from having you walk to the bus stop with them until they know where it is. Older kids might chafe at being “chaperoned” by you while waiting at the bus stop with their friends. Use your judgment about your child’s needs and character to determine if you should or should not walk to the bus stop with your child.

Introduce the morning routine before implementation.,
Make a chart.,
Provide positive feedback.,
Make a game of the routine.,
Provide punishments and encouragements.",How to Create a Morning Routine for the Whole Family3," Use roleplaying to help your child understand the family’s morning routine. For instance, you could use stuffed animals to show how a parent and their child go through their morning routine. You could make the juvenile stuffed animal start by waking up. The parent stuffed animal might say, “Wake up, sleepyhead.” Continue in this way until the whole morning routine is complete.Don’t spend the actual amount of time necessary to complete each morning routine task. That would be tedious for both you and your child. Instead, play through each task briefly, but long enough that your child understands what each step entails.
Play this morning routine act out during the evening before starting the morning routine.

, Some people learn better when presented information and plans visually than they do when just being told. Draft a morning routine chart on an erasable marker board and place it in a prominent location like the front door of the fridge, or in the hallway where everyone in the family – especially the kids – can see it. The chart should list all the morning routine tasks and the exact time they should occur. Your chart should include things like:waking up
brushing teeth
eating breakfast
getting dressed

, Use verbal feedback to keep your kids motivated. For instance, if your daughter is getting dressed, comment on what she is wearing. You might say “Wow, I noticed you’re wearing a blue shirt today. Great choice. It looks really nice.”, If your child is a laggard and does not readily conform to the morning routine, find ways to make doing so more enjoyable. For example, you might ask your child to play a game with you. The game requires them to do one morning task by the end of one song on their favorite album. For instance, they might brush their teeth when the first song is finished, get dressed when the second song finishes, and so on., If your kids repeatedly fail to meet the requirements of the morning routine, consider instituting punishments. For instance, if your kids don’t wake up on time, they should not be allowed to watch TV for the rest of the day.On the other hand, you could provide positive reinforcement for kids who conform to the morning routine. For instance, if your child is ready for breakfast at the exact time they are expected to be, you could reward them with a neat sticker or a special blueberry muffin.
If your partner does not conform to the morning routine, talk with them about why they are not conforming to the morning routine. Say, “I’ve noticed you aren’t conforming to the morning routine for the whole family. What can I do to help you conform to the morning routine?”

Stick to it.,
Plan ahead.,
Organize your stuff.,
Keep it simple.,
Provide some flexibility within the routine.,
Don’t apply the routine to every day.,
Don’t get frazzled.",How to Create a Morning Routine for the Whole Family4," If you don’t maintain your morning routine, it’s not a morning routine. Instead, it’s just a bunch of things you sometimes do in the morning. Don’t hit the snooze button and don’t allow anyone else in your family to either. Accept no excuses for non-adherence to the morning routine.If anyone wants to alter the morning routine, encourage the individual to speak up. Discuss the change(s) with the whole family and decide together if the change is acceptable.
As a parent, you should feel comfortable rejecting any unacceptable proposals for the morning routine (for instance, if your kids want to skip brushing their teeth in the morning).

, Choose the clothing you want to wear tomorrow the night before your morning routine begins. Encourage your kids and partner to do the same. Pack your briefcase with all the necessary documents and gadgets. Encourage your kids to pack their book bags and homework so they aren’t trying to locate them on the way out the door. That will save you and your family time in your morning routine to do other things like have a relaxing breakfast together.Additionally, you should pack your kids’ lunches the night before. If you or your partner take lunch at work, you should also pack your lunches for the next day the night before.

, Find a convenient place where everyone in the family can place their essentials. For you and your partner, you might want to place your keys, wallets, and glasses there. Kids should place their backpacks, lunch pails, and show & tell objects there. A small table beside the front door is the ideal place for organizing all your family’s essentials., There’s no need to provide overly-abundant detail in your morning routine. Instead of specifying what each person in the family should eat for breakfast each day, limit your family’s morning routine to simple tasks like “Wake up,” “Brush your teeth,” and “Eat breakfast.” Intervening steps like “Walk downstairs” or “Set the table” are best left to custom, rather than made explicit within the family’s morning routine., Implementation of the morning routine should be open to adjustment and negotiation in certain respects. For instance, if your child wants to use mint toothpaste as opposed to cinnamon, allow them to do so. Likewise, if they want to eat bananas instead of strawberries, permit the exchange., Weekends and holidays should be free of morning routines. Sleep in and enjoy a couple days of relaxation around the house. Encourage your whole family to do the same. This prevents burnout from the constant pressure of conforming to the morning routine., If you are frantically rushing about and yelling at your kids and partner to conform to their morning routine, they will only become stressed and less likely to be able to stick to the morning routine. Instead of yelling, crouch down and look into your child’s eyes. Explain to them, “I need your help. Please conform to the morning routine so we can have a great day.”Try breathing in and out slowly a few times to calm down. Breathe in for three seconds through your nose, then exhale for five seconds through your mouth. Repeat three to five times until you are relaxed.
Never yell at, strike, or curse at your kids for failing to conform to the family’s morning routine.
If your partner is stressed and running behind with their morning routine, the best thing to do is encourage them to relax. Say to your partner, “I know you’re running a bit behind on your morning routine. Just relax a bit by doing some breathing exercises with me.”

, Repeating what someone says to you is the best way to let them know they were heard.


Listening is a skill, and repeating what they say can show them not only what they said, but how it feels to hear those words., If your relative is being super annoying, try changing the subject or ask them a question, out of the blue.

, When you do decide to speak, answer respectfully and only to the detail you wish.When they ask you questions, try to answer authentically if and when you can.Learn to listen better. Listening isn't just waiting until another person is finished talking., When you can, temper your perspectives and if possible, your appearance, just to keep the peace.


Try to avoid sensitive or provocative topics; instead, suggest useful alternatives.
If they say something to you, good or bad, just say thank you and move on.Don't argue with them all the time. Arguing with another person is what creates conflict.

, Not every strange, awful, rude or ignorant thing they say needs to be corrected.If they say something mean or odd about someone you care about or love, you will probably want to stand up to them, so prepare some answers and comments ahead of time.

, Needing a break from a person is not a flaw, and you can duck out of the conversation if you need to by excusing yourself and then returning when you have had a chance to collect yourself.If you need another break, take it! Repeat as necessary. Maybe you're trying out having a conversation where before you would have avoided it, or ignored it.

, Knowing what will trigger your impatience, anger, or sense of annoyance in advance is the first-step to taking control of your well-being.If you can, ask the person to not discuss that topic/issue, or let them know you haven't forgotten their question and will answer when you can.
If they press you, say nothing and change the topic.

, If none of the techniques above work, just let go of the conversation and walk away.


Not replying is still a reply, one saying ""This is too unpleasant a topic to deal with.""
Walking away shows you respect yourself and that you can ""live and let live."" Move on!

Accept that the person annoys you.,

This might seem to be exactly the opposite thing you want to do, but your undivided attention, even in small amounts, can go a long way to diffusing annoying behavior., It might seem counter intuitive, but being loving can often stop the annoyances before they occur. And, it will certainly changes your perspective.It’s not your purpose in life to change them, because you cannot succeed and you will waste your energy.
Do incorporate love and acceptance into everything you say and do., Accept, rather than deny, that you have a hard time dealing with annoying people, and that some of these people are in your family.When you get irritated and annoyed, don't blame them. You're the one who cannot deal with it, and acknowledging this the first step towards taking responsibility.Focus on what you can do better to be the person you want to be, no matter who you are around, or what they do or say. You'll always come out ahead if you focus on yourself., Being compassionate towards yourself, and to those around you, can go a long way towards diffusing the annoyance.Compassion is active, not passive, and is something you develop over time.You will fail at being compassionate from time to time, but with annoying relatives, you will always get a new chance to practice compassion!

Being able to calm yourself will help you respond appropriately, and you might even surprise yourself., Being a good guest means respecting your hosts’ hours and habits, and following the rules of the house, and even to a degree offsetting the cost of your visit in thoughtful ways.Discuss your plans and free time, so that you know ahead of time what you will need to schedule, rent, and so on.Don’t take over public spaces, spread out everywhere, or take over the bathroom or kitchen.

But it’s not—depression makes it hard to for people to connect emotionally with their loved ones. In order to be available to this person and help them, it is important to understand that it’s not personal. , When you are talking to a depressed family member, you have to keep in mind that they are dealing with an actual physical problem. It can be tempting to blame their mental disorder on decisions they have made, but recognizing that it’s not their fault can help you be less critical and more supportive.Keep in mind that your support can help them recover from depression.

, Your support of their recovery process is one of the most valuable things you can offer someone struggling with depression. Offering to let someone with depression talk about what they are feeling without judging them is an important part of recovery. It will help them feel less alone.You can also offer to help them find a support group, where they can talk to people who have been through what they are going through, to help them feel less lone.

, In order to help your depressed family member, you need to know what they are experiencing. With depression, there are a lot of things that can be going on, so to get to the heart of it, you have to ask direct questions. You can prompt your loved on to explore why they are feeling depressed to help them get to the other side of it.Ask questions like:

“When did you first start to feel bad?”
”Do you know what triggered these feelings?”
”What makes it worse?”
”What makes it better?”



, Demanding that your loved one change the way they feel is a pointless exercise, mostly because they don’t know how to change how they feel. You will feel frustrated when they don’t change, and they will feel angry toward you, perhaps even feeling more depressed than ever.


This can also trigger shame in them, which makes things even worse.

, If you try to rescue your family member, they will not learn for themselves how to manage feelings of sadness on their own. It is unlikely that you will be able to make the depression go away, and the fact that you are sticking your finger into their lives can trigger depressed relatives to feel frustrated with you.This will also lead you to have negative interactions with your loved one, such as when fixing it doesn’t work and you get angry with them.
Accept them for who they are and where they are emotionally.

, Develop realistic expectations for your depressed loved one and maintain an attitude full of hope for them. Your loved one can get help for depression, and they can change. There is hope, and if you keep this in the forefront of your mind, you can help them have hope as well., Sad feelings are the hallmark of depression, especially feeling sad when there is no cause for it. This feeling of sadness can weigh on your family member’s soul, and watching for signs of this extra sadness is key for identifying depression.Listen to them when they talk to see if they sound like they are very sad but they don’t know why.
They may also exhibit signs of tearfulness, feeling empty, and feeling hopeless.

, Losing interest in things that used to get them excited is a classic sign of depression. Watch their behavior and notice if they start replying “no” frequently to activities that they used to love, as well as acting listless and bored most of the time.These are usually things like hobbies and sports.
People who are listless and have no interest in anything can also be lethargic, not wanting to move or do physical activity.

, People with depression are sad about life and discouraged about things that used to make them happy, so they are not happy. Being unhappy can make you generally irritable, getting upset about small things on a regular basis. If someone in your family can’t seem to ever be happy, they may be depressed., People with depression tend to go to one extreme or the other when it comes to sleep. They either can’t sleep at all or sleep way too much. The inability to sleep is called insomnia, and if someone in your family starts complaining about insomnia, watch for other signs of depression.Sleeping too much is a way to escape having to feel negative feelings most of the time.

, Finding out for yourself how depression works is a good place to start in dealing with a depressed family member. This not only allows you to understand the way your family member’s illness works, but it shows that you are supportive and that they are valuable to you, all things someone with depression needs to feel., A family member’s depression affects the whole family, not just the person dealing with it. Sitting down as a family to discuss it can help your depressed family member express themselves and feel supported. This also helps you discover what works and does not work., If your depressed family member agrees, you can meet with their therapist now and then to check on their progress. This way, you can see if what you’re doing at home is helping them or hurting them. The therapist can also educate you so that you can help even more., It may help to seek out couples or family counseling to help everyone share their feelings about the family member’s depression alongside individual therapy for the depressed family member. This therapy can help restore relationships that have been disjointed by depression, especially marriages.Family counseling also helps children understand their role, clarifying that it is not their fault.

, Offer to help your depressed family member find and build a support system. You can poll your friends to see if any of them have had depression and see if they can talk to your family member. You can find area support groups and see if your family member would be interested in joining one.


It’s also important for you to build a support system so that you don’t feel isolated and overwhelmed by taking care of a depressed family member., Most importantly, encourage your depressed family member to seek out a therapist, offering to help them find one that meets their needs. You may have gotten a recommendation from someone, or have an insurance plan that requires you to look at specific therapists.


Your help can keep the depressed family member from feeling overwhelmed and giving up on the therapy process, which is very important for their success.

Understand that as much as your parents love you, it's still their home.,
Always respect the wishes of your parents.,
Accept that your choices will differ.,
Introduce your likes, preferences and lifestyle to them in subtle ways.,
Just because you are an adult now, doesn't mean the golden rule ""obey and respect your parents"" (or something along those lines) vanished in thin air.,
Listen to your parents.,
Do not create or feed arguments.,
Be self responsible.,
Do things for your parents.,
Keep a close check on your parent's health if they're elderly.,
Treasure your parents.,
Count your blessings.",How to Cope with Staying with Your Parents (As an Adult)," Even though you might contribute financially, it isn't the same situation as any other payment for shelter arrangement; your parents are used to things being as they like them, and it all rests on them having funded it in the first place. Treat it like a ""first come, first served"" policy. Most of all, be willing to share and be ready to compromise quickly on things that you know mean a lot to them and maintain their level of comfort and space.;
, They're not your children, they're not in a position of deference to your preferences. If they want to watch a certain program on TV that you don't, show your respect and walk away. Be proactive and set things up to have your own space to avoid bumping into theirs, such as purchasing your own TV, watching things online or visiting a friend's place for those ""must watch"" things that don't interest your parents.

, From what you wear to what they eat, your choices will differ. This doesn't imply that either of you is right or wrong. Each person is entitled to the way that they want to live their own life. Respect and value their choices as you do yours.

, Never be afraid to be yourself but do it respectfully. They may actually be more accepting of you once they know things better. Your likes may even become their preference over time.

, Oh no, buddy. That's a lifelong rule. Live with it, and try to be happy while you're at it. It helps ease unnecessary controversy.

, Expect to defer to and respond positively to their preferences when it involves the running of the household, the decisions about home management and the way routines are followed. While it is all too listen to reply and react, it is important to listen to your parents when they talk and really hear what their perspective is. You don't necessarily have to add something to what they are saying every time you talk. This will avoid most of those conversations turning into arguments.

, If you know they disagree on a certain point you want to introduce to them, just tell them to give your view a consideration and to focus on the positive side of your point. This will work well if in a conversation or meeting with your parents––give them the first priority to give their own views, to make them easily adjustable towards what you really want them to take in. However, your success all may depend on the kind of parents you have. If they they are always dictatorial, you will sometimes be forced to disagree completely with them, but if they are understanding you can always discuss the issues as they arise.

, Take care of your own belongings. Do not expect your parents to be willing to fall into care mode and do your washing, cleaning, etc. as when you were a child. You are completely independent now and need to show this aspect at all times. If you do allow some help with your things, make sure it is part of an arrangement whereby you are helping them with something of equal value or effort.

, Help them out a great deal and show them that you can be responsible. This will increase the happiness of the household greatly.


Go that extra mile to take care of their needs, regardless of what differences you may have. Parents may not say it often enough, but even your smallest, slightest gesture toward them makes them feel loved and fill the void created by generation gaps. Try cooking their favorite meal, leaving a sweet note on the counter for them, or doing a household chore that they typically take care of. Never forget to show your appreciation for having them allow you to live in their home.

, It is possible that the mood swings and temper of much older parents are an outcome of an underlying illness. They may be irritable or angry due to an internal change or an underlying pain. Ask caring questions to elicit information about their health and help them with doctor's visits, etc.

, We all have to leave this earth one day. We only have one life to live. Live it in the right way. If you are lucky enough to have both parents, realize that they are too special to take for granted. Someday, when you grow old as they are, at that point you will fully understand how short life truly is. Make today a day that you can look back at and smile from the memories you share with the ones you love.


Even if you become annoyed by their many, perhaps slightly infuriating habits, remember they've always been there for you; and don't think for a second they haven't felt the same way at some point about your actions. They too have had to endure your ""many, perhaps slightly infuriating"" habits when you were a child or an adolescent, or even as an adult. Patience is the key to a happy life.

, There are millions of people homeless because they don't have family and/or friends to lean on. When your parents begin to nag about something, just be thankful for the gift of shelter and that cement wasn't your pillow last night.


If you treat your parents as a gift rather than a nuisance then you will enjoy the fruit of their hard work and unconditional love. Remember, there were times when you were young and may have acted like a ""nuisance"", yet they always treated you like a blessing from above. Treating them the same way they did to you is the only way to repay their kindness.
Just remember that you are lucky to have parents. Imagine what life would be like without them. Once they are gone from this earth, they are still here in spirit but not physically present to be able to hug. Never feel bad about living with your parents. They love you more than you could ever imagine. If you have a problem tell them and come to an agreement, don't go overboard as you are living in their house!
Do not treat them as burden. If you treat your parents as an additional responsibility, then it is more likely that you will not be able to enjoy the process of being with them. Try to enjoy their association, just as a kid, which you used to do. Realize that now a role reversal has taken place. Your parents are now in your role as kid, and you are going to take care of them as grown up. Implant happiness in this relationship. Celebrate birthday, marriage anniversaries together with hugs and cuddle. Lighten up their lives!
Let your kids play with your parents. If you have children, ensure that they spend time with their grannies and grandpas. Given this fast world, when couples are sharing financial burdens together, you need to ensure that somebody takes care of the children in the home. Who can give better security and take care for your children than your parents? Also, when your kids see how you are taking care of your parents, it is more likely that they are also going to take care of you in future. Examples are more than spoken words, aren't they?

Keep pictures of your family in any place you can.,
Call your family!,
Use technology to your advantage.,
Be creative and send letters.,
Plan trips home.,
Enjoy this time you have alone.",How to Cope with Distance from Your Family," It’s inevitable that you will become lonely when none of your family members are within hours of you. It’s okay to feel that way! Don't hide from this feeling, but try to channel it into two areas: staying in touch with them in meaningful ways, and connecting with the people and activities around you.


Let yourself feel any emotion you may be feeling. Your emotions will be very confusing; some days you could be sad, mad, or just depressed. Allow yourself to feel that way, but then start the next day off new. It’ll be hard, but it’s a whole new world to explore!;
, Keep an album of favorite pictures on your phone or tablet, so you can browse through them any time (and share them with your family members, too!). You can keep them on your phone lock screen, wallet, purse, desk, or the walls in your room. It’ll feel like they’re right there with you (almost).

, You will find out that you’ll end up being the one being worried if your mom doesn’t answer the first time you call.  Call once a day, if you want to, so you can catch up.

, The options we have to stay connected these days are plentiful; if you don't have time for a phone call, try texting, emailing sending a picture message, or Snapchatting. If you want to see them when you call, try Skyping or FaceTiming.


If you're trying to stay connected with many family members at once, consider starting a blog. It's a little less personal than one-on-one emails or calls, but you can share your news there, set the blog to private (if desired), and still get comments from them about what you're up to.

, You can buy postcards or normal cards at a local store. You also can make them more heartfelt and write hand written letters. These will take longer to reach their destination but can be really meaningful, and you can even throw in fun trinkets or items, a little like a scrapbook; send them a photo of you with a new friend, a stub of the ticket from the concert you just went to, or anything else that made you think of them.

, It’s always exciting counting down the days to visit family. Make it even better, and surprise them on Thanksgiving! Surprise them one weekend and watch their eyes fill with happy tears.

, Take this time away from your family to find yourself. You don’t need to always dwell on the fact that your family is so far away. Make them proud, and do something new! Run, write, or learn an instrument. Connect with the people and activities around you; find a local community, get absorbed in hobbies you're passionate about, and make your life fulfilling. Then you can visit home and tell them all about it!

, Just listen to your nanny to keep him/her happy. She usually doesn't stay for long anyway, and if you do everything that your nanny tells you to do, your parents might be impressed and get you something that you really wanted (a new game, to go to a slumber party, etc.).

, Talking with them can get you to understand him/her as well as get the nanny to know you.

, After doing what the nanny tells you to do, try playing games or doing something interactive with each other such as baking cookies, playing outside, or even just talking.

, She takes care of you. If she didn't want to take care of you, she would've told her boss and get sent to take care of another child.

, Tell her everything about her that bugs you. They may switch nannies for you.

, The base is the part of the loop where the halfway point meets the other part of the cord.,,, You’ll see the start of a chain beginning which is what makes this method so special.

,, Remember to have your palm up every time you grab the cord. This will make another loop, thus creating another link in the chain.,, Try to keep your loops consistent sizes so that you create a better chain for storage.

Notice how each chain is a similar size. Try to keep that size as you make each link in the chain. Depending on how long of an extension cord will determine the size of the loop, since you don't want to be looping small links for relatively long cords.

, As you get closer to the two ends, your last loop will be different.

Grab the cord like you have for the previous steps.
Pull the cord through to make a small loop (depending what you are left with in length).
Separate the female end and male ends.
Put one end through the loop.






Connect the ends.

, Now the cord is secure, it is up to the user where to store it. You can hang it up, or bundle it.

In Windows 10, you can find the Windows Update utility in the ""Update & Security"" section of the new Settings menu.

, The amount of space on your hard drive doesn't normally have a massive impact on your performance, but if you dip below 20% free space on the drive Windows is installed on, you may notice some slowdown. Windows relies on this free space to move and store temporary files, and without it your computer can slow to a crawl. Regularly clearing out old files can help keep your system running smoothly.


Open the Computer/This PC window (⊞ Win+E) and find your Windows drive (usually C:). This drive should have at least 20% free space available for optimum performance.

, Open the Start menu or screen and type ""disk cleanup"" to find the utility. Select your Windows drive and wait for it to be analyzed. Check the boxes for each of the types of files you want to remove. Each entry will display how much space you will reclaim by deleting them.

, A lot of popular programs are poorly optimized, and can slow your computer down when they're running. Common culprits include Norton Antivirus, iTunes, and Adobe Reader. All of these programs have free, light-weight alternatives that can significantly speed up your computer.Instead of using Norton as your antivirus, consider using Windows' built-in Microsoft Defender. Avast and Bit-Defender are also two popular free options. See Turn on Windows Defender for instructions on using Windows Defender.
If you use iTunes for your media, consider a program like foobar2000 or MediaMonkey, both of which support syncing your iOS device.

, Your Mac OS X and other software updates can keep your system stable and running smoothly. Updates should install automatically, but it's good to check every once in a while and see if an essential update is queued.

Select your hard drive in the left frame.
Click the ""First Aid"" tab and then click ""Verify Disk."" The scan will begin, which may take a while to complete.
Click the ""Repair Disk"" button if the scan reports any errors.

, The most common source of adware infections is additional software installed while you thought you were installing something else. Whenever you download a program from the internet, pay close attention to each screen of the installer, especially if it's free. Be sure to decline any additional offers and double-check each checkbox.


Look for open-source alternatives, which generally will not have any adware in the installer.
Avoid download sites like CNet or Tucows, as these will try to get you to use their ad-serving download manager programs.

, If you're using a Windows computer, you should have an antivirus program running at virtually all times. Windows Defender is usually more than sufficient, but you can use Avast, Bit-Defender, Kaspersky, or other reputable antivirus programs as well. Just make sure that you only have one anti-virus enabled at a time, as they can conflict with each other.


See Install an Antivirus for detailed instructions on finding and installing an antivirus program.

, Too much dust can cause heat to build up inside of your computer. If your computer gets too hot, the components will automatically slow down to try to lower the temperature. Keeping your computer clean and cool can help make sure it's always running at peak efficiency. This is even more important if you have pets or smoke in the house.


You can purchase cans of compressed air or use an air compressor to remove most dust from inside the computer.
See Clean a PC for tips on cleaning all of the dust out of your computer.

, If you stay on top of your installed programs, you can keep your computer bloat-free for a long time. Remove programs once you don't need them anymore, and you'll free up lots of space. You can even keep backups of the installers so that you can quickly install them again in the future without having to re-download the files.

Open up the case.,
Check the ports.,
Wipe your phone’s surfaces.,
Close the case.",How to Clean a Lifeproof Case," During daily use, you won’t want to do a deep cleaning every time your case accumulates dirt or dust. In these cases, use a soft cloth. Get the cloth damp with warm water then use it to wipe off the surface debris.Don’t clean with rough pads or brushes. These scrape the cases.;
, Immediately after exposing the case to non-fresh water, including soap, chlorine-treated pool water, or seawater, return the case to a faucet. Use cool or lukewarm water to rinse the entire case so the non-fresh water does not abrade it. Rinsing this way protects the case when you don’t have time to clean with soap.


Unless you plan on cleaning out the inside of the case and are sure the seal is secure, you do not need to remove your phone.

, First, ensure all the ports are closed. Apply a mild dish soap and rinse it off under warm water in a sink. Perform this deeper cleaning whenever you see deeper stains that don’t come off with rinsing or at least every three months when you are supposed to perform a water seal test.Never clean with bleach or abrasive cleaners or polishes.

, Shake off excess moisture. For speedier drying, gently wipe the case with a soft cloth. Otherwise, leave the case out on a paper towel away from direct sunlight. Only use a microfiber cloth on the screen so the screen doesn’t get scratched.

, Use the plastic pick that came with the Lifeproof case to wedge apart the halves from one of the corners. If you don’t have the pick on hand, use a coin. Place your phone far away so it doesn’t get wet.

, Again, apply a mild dish soap directly to the case. Spread it around with your finger or a cloth. With the empty case, place it in a lukewarm water bath or rinse it under the faucet. Make sure to get loose any dirt in the corners or in the ports.

, Shake off as much moisture as you can, then wipe it down with a soft cloth. For slower air drying, leave the halves out on paper towels away from direct sunlight. Avoid using fluffy towels, as these can introduce lint that affects the phone or the seal., The seal test should be done before water exposure, after a bad fall, or every three months otherwise. This tests the case’s ability to keep out water, so if you haven’t removed your phone already to clean the case, do it now., Make sure the case is closed, including the charge port. Hold the case underwater for up to 30 minutes. You can place something heavy on top of the case in order to keep it underwater.., Once the 30 minutes are up, clean off the outside of the case only. Use a soft cloth. Make sure all the water is gone so none of it gets inside.

, Use the plastic key or a coin to wedge open the corner of the case. Separate the halves of the case. Check them thoroughly for any sign of leaks. If the case is completely dry, you are free to put your phone back inside.

, The charge port, camera ring, and headphone jack on both the case and phone accumulate dirt. Whenever you open them or notice dirt, it is a good idea to use a soft cloth. Remove the dirt as soon as you notice it to prevent it from spreading inside the phone or case.

, Lifeproof cases come with a microfiber cloth, but these can also be found at a general retailer. Only use cloth that is good for eyeglasses, jewelry, and electronics, as these won’t scratch the screen. Make sure the cloth removes all dirt and dust before you put your phone or tablet in the case., Lay your device in the bottom of the case. Place the top part of the case over it, then run your finger around the edges to snap it in place. Before you finish, check to see if you got all the dirt, dust, and lint. Any spots you miss will be amplified on the screen or stick in the charge and camera ports. Undo the case and remove the debris."

Ask genuine questions about your boyfriend's interest in sports.,
Find a sports related hobby you can do together.,
Learn a little about sports if you do not know a lot.,
Get to know your boyfriend's teammates and sports buddies.,
Incorporate touch into sport related activities.,
Laugh together while watching or playing sports.,
Flirt with your boyfriend through sports.,
Turn off electronics during games.,
Accept your boyfriend may need some alone time.,
Do not force yourself to like something you dislike.,
Respect your differences.",How to Bond With Your Boyfriend Through Sports," People feel close to people who convey interest in them. Try asking your boyfriend genuine questions about sports and his interest in them. This can help you get to know about his passions more, increasing your bond.

If it's a new relationship, starting with the basics is fine. You can ask things like, ""What kind of sports do you like?"" and ""What's your favorite team?"" As you go closer, however, ask open ended questions that allow you to get to know your boyfriend as a person.
Try something like, ""What is it about sports you like?"" and ""When did you first develop an interest in sports?"" Ask your boyfriend things like, ""Do you find sports inspirational? Are there any players you find admirable?"";
, Studies show having a shared hobby can strengthen a romantic relationship. Shared experiences can help keep a relationship fresh and interesting over time.

If your boyfriend is a sports fanatic, playing a sport with him can be a great way for the two of you to bond.

Aim for a sport you can both play with some success, if possible. If you figure skated in high school, and your boyfriend plays hockey, you could go skating together and occasionally have lighthearted hockey competitions.
Try to incorporate sports into your date nights regularly. You could, for example, make a point of shooting hoops together every Tuesday night when your boyfriend comes to spend the night.
If you don't like playing sports, find a hobby that involves sports. You could, for example, agree to play a sports related video game with your boyfriend. You could also promise to watch the games him, or play sports trivia at a local bar.

, If you're not also into professional sports, it can be confusing to get acquainted with the world. If you want to share your boyfriend's interest, it may be a good idea to try to learn a bit about sports yourself.


Watch ESPN regularly and watch a few matches of your boyfriend's favorite sport. Try to figure out the rules when watching. You can also look up the rules online if you're confused.
Read the history of your boyfriend's favorite sport online. You could also learn a bit about his favorite players and his favorite team.
If it doesn't bother your boyfriend, try asking about the rules while watching sports with him. However, be careful. If your boyfriend is invested in the game, he may get annoyed by your questions.

, Research indicates the more you bond with your partner's friends, the stronger your relationship will be. If your boyfriend is on a sports team, his teammates may be his close friends. Try to get to know his teammates to strengthen your relationship. If your boyfriend doesn't play sports, try getting to know the guys he tends to watch games with.When you're invited to hang out with the team or his sports buddies, don't just stay by your boyfriend's side all night. Chat up some of his teammates. Allow yourself to form somewhat independent friendships with them.
Be polite to his teammates and sports friends. Ask them questions that allow you to get to know them, such as where they're from, where they went to school, what their families are like, and so on.

, Touch is vital to fostering feelings of intimacy in a relationship. You should touch your partner frequently during sports related activities. This can make such activities feel more intimate, deepening your bond.Cuddle with your boyfriend when watching sports on TV. Place your hand on his knee. Hold his hand. Lean against him.
If you're playing sports together, take opportunities to touch him. Playfully rub his shoulder when playing basketball. Lightly wrestle with him during a game of football.

, Humor is one of the best means to bond with a person. People who laugh together frequently tend to feel closer to one another. You need to keep some levity in a relationship to keep things fun and happy.Try teasing your boyfriend lightly and in good spirits. You can give him a hard time when he's getting frustrated that his team is losing. You can also tease him lightly if he misses a shot while the two of you are playing basketball.
If your boyfriend doesn't take well to teasing, try making observational jokes about the game. Mock the announcer or the other team's outfits. If you two are playing sports together, try making a few self-depreciating jokes at your own expense.

, Flirtation is another means to keep a love bond strong. As couples grow more comfortable with one another, they may flirt less often. When playing or watching sports, find ways to work in occasional flirtation.Give your boyfriend a coy compliment about his body when he's playing sports.
Touch your boyfriend flirtatiously when you're watching sports together.

, Electronics can be a huge distraction when it comes to bonding. If your boyfriend is watching a game with you, he wants you to share in his interests. It's a bad idea to be on your phone or computer. You may miss a vital portion of the game. Be polite and put your phone and laptop away when watching sports with your boyfriend., While it's great to share interests and experiences, you can't hog all your boyfriend's time. He sometimes may want to watch sports alone. He may want to hang out with just his teammates after a game. It's important to allow for space in a relationship. If your boyfriend wants alone time to explore his interest in sports, let him have it.Ask your boyfriend if it's okay that you tag along. Tell him it's fine if he wants to go to a sporting event with a friend instead of you.
Keep communication open. Tell your boyfriend it's okay to let you know at any time if he needs some space.

, You don't have to become a sports fanatic to bond with your boyfriend through sports. If sports are not something that are personally interesting to you, do not commit too much. Ask your boyfriend about his team, and join him to watch the big game, but don't force yourself to remember the names of every player if sports are not something that interest you.

, You may never learn to love sports like your boyfriend. That's okay. Respecting one another's differences is important in a romantic relationship.Focus on the positive aspects of your differences. Why were you attracted to your boyfriend to begin with? Maybe you liked him because of his ability to feel excitement. His enthusiasm about sports may be a manifestation of that quality.
Respect that this is a passion that your boyfriend has, even if you don't share it. Remind yourself there are interests you have that may seem absurd to him.

You could do this at school. It is especially helpful when you have mutual friends with this person, and you find yourself all in a group together.
If you find yourself at a party, you can introduce yourself so that both of you have someone to talk to.
Introduce yourself if you are assigned to work on a project together or to complete a task together.;
, When you have the opportunity, take time to ask your new acquaintance questions about himself/herself. This shows him/her that you have an interest in getting to know him/her.


“Do you have any brothers and sisters? How many?”
“What do you like to do in your free time?”
“What sports do you play?""
"" Do you like cooking?""
“What are your hobbies?”
“Have you always lived in this area?”
“What is your favorite type of music/band/artist?”
“Do you like to read? What is your favorite book?”

, It is almost expected that as you ask your new acquaintance questions, he/she will answer and then ask you the same question about yourself. Be sure to take the time to answer those questions and give him/her the opportunity to get to know you, too.


Friendship is a two-way street, so it is important for both of you to feel that you know each other well in order to build a good friendship.
Keep the talking balanced. When you do answer questions, try to take a similar amount of time as your acquaintance did so that you avoid talking more than him/her.

, While you are in this first stage of getting to know someone, it is best to avoid controversial and personal topics of conversation.


Keep the chat light and upbeat, talking about things you have in common or things you want to know about each other.
Redirect the conversation if it gets too personal: “I'm not comfortable talking about that right now. Have you ever been to a concert?”
Excuse yourself from the conversation or redirect it if you begin discussing a controversial topic: “I understand that we both have our own beliefs about this, but let's talk about something more fun for now.”

, Avoid bombarding him/her with a lot of questions all at once. You want to get to know this person, but you do not want him/her to feel like he/she is being interviewed.


As you cross paths with your acquaintance on different occasions, like in school or at the mall, take the the opportunity to get to know a little more about him/her.
You could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to get to know your new acquaintance. It does not need to happen immediately or in just a few short hours.

, When you feel like you have gotten to know your acquaintance enough to pursue a friendship with him/her, ask if you can exchange contact information.You can share any of the following, based on how you like to keep in touch:


Phone number for calling and/or text messaging
Kik username for messaging without sharing your phone number
Email address
Social media profiles, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram

, In order to start becoming a good friend with someone, and therefore expecting that person to become a good friend, you need to be a good friend yourself.


Reflect on your own personality and determine what your strengths and weaknesses are in being a friend. Create a goal to improve one of your friendship weaknesses to help you become a better friend. For example, maybe you sometimes forget to respond to your friends' text messages, so you could make a goal to respond within a few hours every time.

, You would not like it if you found out that your friend's true personality is completely different from what you thought it was. Therefore, you should be yourself around your friend.


Show your quirky habits. Maybe they do the same things!
Share your sense of humor and tell jokes that you think are funny.
Share your hobbies and interests, even if others think they are “weird.” Your friend might be interested in them, too!

, Your friend is a unique person, and just as you want to be accepted for who you are, so does your friend.

, There is a wide variety of things that you can do with friends. Invite your friend to hang out with you so that you can build up your friendship.Go to the movies
Go to an arcade
Go shopping
Invite your friend over for dinner
Invite your friend to play at your house
Invite your friend over to play board or video games
Join in a neighborhood game, like soccer or basketball

, When it is your friend's birthday, be sure to give him/her a card or even a small gift. They will also appreciate if you acknowledge when they do really well at something, when they win something, and when they get accepted into a group or program.


Be sure to show genuine excitement for your friend. He/She will likely be able to tell if you are not sincerely happy for him/her, which will damage the friendship.
If you also made an attempt at the same thing (for example, you also applied to get into a certain program) but did not succeed, avoid being jealous of your friend. This is unhealthy and will not allow your friendship to grow.

, Friends rely on each other for support through hard times, so let your friend know that you will be there if he/she ever needs you.


Follow through when those times arise. For example, if your friend gets into an argument with a sibling or another friend, make sure you help him/her through that.
Be reliable for your friend. A big aspect of a successful friendship is reliability, so if you tell your friend that he/she can rely on you to always be there, then you need to prove that.

, No relationship can withstand being built on secrets and lies, so it is extremely important to be open and honest.


When your friend asks your opinion on something, give it politely and honestly.
Share your perspective in a polite, friendly way.
Avoid keeping secrets from your friend whenever possible, especially if the secrets are about him/her.

, You can do this many different ways, and usually, lots of things you do will work together to prove to your friend that you consider him/her a good friend. The following are things you should always work to do:


Be reliable and dependable.
Be honest.
Be yourself.
Support your friend.
Include your friend.
Celebrate your friend's accomplishments.
Help your friend when he/she needs it.

, If your friend asks you to hang out, but you already have other plans or an obligation, let him/her know. Then, suggest another day to hang out instead.


Suggesting another opportunity to hang out proves to your friend that you do want to spend time with him/her and that you like doing so.

, No matter how much you and your friend have in common, arguments and disagreements are bound to come up at some point. Work through these bumps in the road with your friend.


Apologize when you need to do so. If you are in the wrong, then it is important to take responsibility for your actions.
Offer ideas for how you and your friend can fix the problem instead of expecting him/her to fix it.

, Even if you and your friend are very similar, you are not the same person. Sometimes, you might need to try to understand an issue or an event from his/her perspective.


Try to understand why this issue bothers or upsets him/her. What about it is upsetting?
Do not brush it off if it is something that does not bother you. Instead, try to talk your friend through it and come up with strategies for dealing with the situation.

, Sometimes, he/she might not want your help or want your involvement in every aspect of his/her life. It is important to respect that and to give your friend the space he/she needs.Even if you or your friend moves away, it is possible to maintain a good friendship. Keep in contact when you can and show your friend that you respect his/her needs.
Let your friend know that you are still there for him/her, even while space is needed.
Understand that you and your friend do not need to spend time together every day. You both have your own lives, schedules, and obligations.

, Having a good friendship means trusting one another. You cannot expect your friend to trust you if you do not trust him/her.


Always be honest and open with your friend so that he/she has no reason not to trust you.
Talk through problems with your friend and come to a resolution so that you can continue to trust him/her.
Share your feelings and dreams with your friend. This is something that lets him/her know that you have trust, because you chose to confide in him/her.
Forgive your friend's mistakes. Holding grudges is emotionally unhealthy and will not allow your friendship to blossom into a good one."

Practice active listening.,

Work through problems as a team.,
Make your values and needs known to your partner.,
Get on the same page about finances.,
Date each other no matter how long you’ve been together.,
Continue to demonstrate honesty and build trust.,
Have mutual and separate interests.,
Support one another’s passions and dreams.",How to Build a Long Lasting Relationship," This means preparing to listen to hear the message of your partner and not to prepare your defense. Find a time and place where you can be without distractions and focus only on what your partner is saying. Try to set aside your negative perceptions about his or her actions or motives so you can focus on the conversation in real time.

Orient towards your partner. Make eye contact. Nod your head when you agree and show you are attentive. After he or she finishes speaking, paraphrase what was said like “What I heard you say was that…” and ask any questions to clarify whether you got the right message “Am I right in thinking you feel like…?”
Be aware of the nonverbal signs as well as what is said out loud. Does the message your partner is sharing with you line up with the nonverbal cues? Also, look for signs of tension or frustration. Balled fists, crossed arms, or frowns may demonstrate that the other person needs a break or is to upset to resolve any issues right now.;
, Communication is not about blame, it is about responsibility. “I” statements start with how you are feeling about the behavior or action of your partner. It means you take ownership of your feelings and also suggest a way to improve the behavior. The focus is not to tell your partner the action is bad, just to share your own experience of it.""You"" statements frequently blame the other person. Avoid making these kinds of statements. They may sound like ""You are always making big purchases without asking me first!""
An example of an “I” statement may be “I feel confused when you make big purchases without me because I thought we agreed to go together. From now on, I would like to be included in these purchases.”

, Your relationship should be based on mutual respect and love, not fear. A soft voice reflects the love, compassion and understanding that is missing from yelling. Meet your partner’s eyes and speak from a place of love and understanding. Disagreements don’t require anger and yelling to resolve.


If affectionate names are commonly used in your relationship, you can use such names to show that you still care for your partner even during a disagreement. Saying things like ""What do you think, dear?"" or ""I'm sorry I disappointed you, baby. How can I make things right?"" may help to ease the tension.

, Save harsh words, even during arguments. You can’t take back what’s been said. When you say something hurtful to your partner you send the message that a disagreement is equivalent to a war. You are on the same side. Remember that.


To prevent saying nasty things and getting caught up in anger, many couples use a “24 hour” rule. In this scenario, if things get too heated, they table the discussion for 24 hours so both parties calm down and are able to talk. It is pretty rare to find a discussion that can’t wait for a cooling down period if need be., It is a relationship myth that a solid relationship does not require work. Be prepared to put the work in. You can accomplish this by addressing any problems with your partner before they rear to their ugly heads.For example, you notice your partner withdrawing more money out of a shared account than usual. Instead of building a case over time, you might address the issue right off by saying ""I noticed you have been needing more money lately. Do we need to adjust our budget to account for this?""
You will never be perfect nor can you expect this from a partner. There will always be issues that come up and you can either learn to treat them as you would any other obstacle or you can hide them until they balloon into a huge problem.
Make a commitment to hold a weekly check-in in which either of you can bring up any issues you have on your chest. Communicating problems with the idea of tackling them as soon as they come up helps you establish a strong foundation.

, Pick your battles wisely. Not every issue needs to turn into a battle. There will be some that need to be talked out, others that go unsaid and finally some that just end up not being important compared to what you gain from the relationship.Compromising may include writing out a pros and cons list to points of disagreement and talking through the list objectively. Talking aloud may clearly point out which choice is mutually beneficial. It also means finding a way that both of you can have your needs met without jeopardizing the needs of the other.
Another way you can compromise is doing things one person's way one time and then favoring the other person's opinion the next time. For example, you may watch one person's favorite movie one night and the other person's top pick the next night.
Before you find yourself waging war against your partner about a small issue, assess how important the matter truly is to the happiness and growth of your relationship. If it’s truly not a big deal, move on.

, Relationships are about the “we” and not the “I” or “you”. Focus on honest communication to work through problems together with room for each of you to give and take. Learn from one another instead of working against one another.For example, if you need a sum of money to pay for a big purchase, you can sit down and find ways for both of you to contribute. Each of you can put money into savings for a span of time, or cut back on non-essential expenses.
Using terms like ""we"" as in ""We will get through this"" or ""us"" as in ""Let us figure out a solution together"" help foster a teamwork approach.
Every relationship comes with ups and downs. When you encounter an issue, go through it logically and objectively and make a decision based on a the mutual well-being of both partners.

, Be sure to clearly define what you need from a partner and what you intend to give to your partner. Follow through on your obligations to your partner and speak up when he or she isn’t doing the same in a constructive manner. It is a myth that you do not need to tell your partner what you value and need. You are mistaken to think that simply because your partner loves you, he or she should know what you need. Mind reading is impossible and the expectation of it merely hinders your growth.Communicate your desires simply by saying something to the effect of “Charity is really important to me. What can we do to honor that moving forward?”

, This is one area that can be very dangerous if you ignore it until it becomes a bigger issue. Make sure you share financial values early on in the relationship. If you want to save for the future while your partner lives for the moment, this may not end up lasting long term.

Sit down and discuss where each of you stand financially. Create a budget if you live under the same roof. Talk to a financial counselor if you have trouble seeing eye-to-eye.

, This includes giving your partner the same level of respect and attention you did from the start. Many relationships end as one partner just stops respecting the value or feelings of the partner and fall into old habits they never would have done early on.


For example, texting an old flame after you are married shouldn’t happen. If you wouldn’t expect a new date to be OK with that, why should your spouse ignore it simply because you are married?Treat your partner with the utmost respect. Strive to make him or her smile. Make an effort to schedule quality time shared between the two of you.

, Never lose sight of how important trust is to keep your relationship healthy. When one or the other partner is not trustworthy, doubt creeps into the relationship. You can build or repair loss trust by:Being there for your partner, both physically and emotionally
Being consistent in your actions
Showing up when you say you will
Keeping confidences
Respecting your partner’s personal boundaries
Doing what you say you will do

, You cannot expect another person to complete you or to be everything that you are. It is healthy to share interests and to also maintain some activities you do apart. When you enter into a partnership you become a team but each part of the team will gain something from also taking time to be an individual.A relationship should allow you to be your core self, while giving you someone to love and cherish. It will not be good for you or your partner if one of you become codependent and requires the other to take an interest in anything.

, Support these dreams and also recognize you cannot make all of them come true. You are there to love and encourage their dreams, not to take responsibility for achieving them.While the two of you should have separate dreams, it can also be unifying to have shared goals that you work towards as a team. Have a talk with your partner and brainstorm some dreams you’d like to accomplish together. It can be brought simply by stating ""I think it'd be great if we set some shared goals. What are some things we can work towards together?""

Show your partner what they mean to you and how much you love them.,
Focus on your partner.,
Demonstrate interest in what your partner likes to do.,
Surprise them with something you can do together.,
Tell them how much they mean to you.",How to Build a Stronger Relationship with Your Partner," This doesn't have to mean big expensive gifts or trips to Paris! Send them a text letting them know you are thinking about them or leave little love notes around the house. Kisses and hugs can also go a long way in showing your partner how much you care about them.;
, When they're trying to communicate with you, don't just sit there on your phone or watching television. Tune everything else out and give them your undivided attention for at least a few minutes. Though simple, this process can be extremely helpful, especially if your partner and you normally don't listen to each much.

, You don't necessarily have to like it yourself, but try to be appreciative of their interests. When they get excited about their favorite team winning a game or the newest episode of Doctor Who, let them tell you about it to their heart's content. Make sure they know that you're happy to talk about it if it makes them happy.

, Put some effort into planning it, whether it's a romantic picnic in the park or playing an old fashioned board game. It doesn't have to be a grand or expensive gesture, just so long as it shows that you're thinking about your partner.

, What do you love about them? Have they got a cute smile? Pretty eyes? Personality-based compliments are even better—tell your partner that you love how considerate or quick-witted they are. Don't keep it to yourself! Whatever nice thing you have to say about them, it will most likely improve their day to hear it.

Find any common interests.,
Be prepared to do most of the talking.,
Minimize social pressure.,
Gradually increase your social encounters.",How to Bond with an Extremely Shy Person1," Use these common interests to help form a bond. Discuss your common interests frequently and use them to make conversation when there is nothing to talk about.Once you find a common interest, try researching that topic in order to have more information to contribute to the next conversation.
For example, if you both have a love for music, consider asking the person what they've been listening to lately. You might also want to invite them to a concert or open mic night.;
, It will take a while for them to warm up to you. Even when they do warm up to you, they may not always have a lot to say during a conversation. Accept that you may be the one doing the majority of the talking.Try to avoid small talk. Instead of asking about the weather or their plans for the weekend, try something a little deeper. The person may respond to conversations about topics such as personal values, morals, philosophy, and so on.
Avoid topics that you disagree on or that are extremely controversial.
As the person warms up to you, they may become more open to small talk or talking about themselves.

, Don’t put them on the spot in front of a bunch of people. Avoid asking them questions in large groups. You should also avoid asking them to go to with you to a party, club, or large social gathering. You should keep their social needs in mind when inviting them to new places. Shy people usually don’t enjoy being around large groups of people.For example, if you and this shy person are out to dinner with a large group of friends, don’t say something like, “How was your day at work today?” in front of everyone. If possible, try to have a more private, side conversation with the person.

, Build your friendship slowly and gradually increase the amount of time that you spend together. Shy people are often introverts who are overwhelmed by social interactions and need alone or down time to restore their energy. Let them get to know you and build a personal bond before introducing them to friends or family.This isn't to say a shy person won't occasionally want to go out to a party or bar or crowded place, but it is likely they won't want to stay there all night. They may also not be interested in hanging out multiple days in a row — if they are introverted, they will need time to themselves to decompress and recharge.
Don’t spend the whole day with them. Shy people like to have some alone time. Instead, invite them to a quiet coffee shop or on a walk in the park.

Make your compliments genuine and realistic.,
Note positive aspects of her personality.,
Remind her of her accomplishments.,
Tell her she’s beautiful on regular days.",How to Boost Your Girlfriend's Self Esteem1," Complimenting your girlfriend can make her feel better about herself, and make you feel positive, too. Just make sure you stick to sincere and reasonable compliments. Exaggerating or lying about a feature that you don’t actually like may worsen the problem.


The key to a genuine compliment is looking for something good in her and sharing it freely without expectation of getting anything back. For example, you might say, “Your smile is beautiful” or “That outfit looks great on you.”It can also help to not focus too much on her appearance. Tell her she did a great job calming down an irate toddler, or she gave a really awesome answer in today's history class.;
, Although your girlfriend will appreciate compliments about her appearance, the best compliments point to someone’s positive traits. This shows her that she is so much more to you than just her looks. Talk about things besides her beauty, such as her personality, her intelligence, or her kindness.You might say, “You know that was really admirable how you helped your friend back there,” or “I can’t believe how giving you are. That’s one of the things I love most about you.”
Give her compliments that uniquely describe her. ""You're funny"" is a generic compliment that is easy to shrug off. ""Your sci-fi satires are hilarious"" is much more specific, and is harder to discount.

, If your girlfriend has low self-esteem, she may have trouble noticing her strengths. Make it your job to remind her of your many talents and achievements whenever she seems to forget. Sharing these sorts of compliments will make her feel good about who she is as a person.


For instance, you might say, ""I think it's amazing that you choose to spend your evenings and weekends volunteering at the shelter,"" or ""Algebra is so confusing to me. I'm glad I'm dating a math whiz who can help me understand.""

, Your girlfriend probably expects to be showered with praise when she’s all made up and dressed up, so reserve praises for when she’s looking like her normal self, too. For example, if you come over late at night when she’s in her pajamas, tell her how beautiful she looks."
"
Take advantage of one-on-one interactions.,
Accept their shy personality.,
Be honest.",How to Bond with an Extremely Shy Person2," Shy people often do not enjoy large, or even small, groups of people. Use one-on-one interactions with a shy person as a way to form a deeper bond — they will likely value time with someone who takes the time to authentically listen to what they have to say.


Remember your body language. Don’t stand too close to them and don’t hold eye contact for too long. Make it natural and comfortable.
For example, a one-on-one walk in the park is the perfect time to ask your shy friend, “How was your day at work?”

, You cannot and should not change them. Shy people have a lot of great qualities and can bring a lot into a friendship. They are often good listeners and make a great shoulder to lean on during troubling times.Avoid pointing out their shyness by saying something like, “Why are you being so quiet? Are you mad at me?” The shy person probably knows that they are shy and might even be self-conscious about it.
Don’t push them out of their comfort zone too quickly.

, Don’t lie or make excuses. Be honest about your feelings, thoughts, and opinions. Introverts are often slow to give their trust. You must earn and keep their trust. If you are caught lying or being dishonest you stand a chance at losing their trust, which may be difficult to get back.For example, if they ask you to go to dinner tomorrow night and you are not interested in going, don’t lie and tell them that you have other plans. Instead, politely decline their invitation and suggest that you get together another time.

Support them throughout their life.",How to Bond with an Extremely Shy Person3," Listen to them when they need to talk. Help them out when they are going through a rough patch. Make sure that you keep in touch and schedule regular time to see them. Be the kind of friend that you would like to have.Remember important dates and be sure to reach out to them on that date. For example, if you know that they have a job interview on Friday be sure to send them a text wishing them luck or asking if they want to talk about how it went.
Coordinate meals for them if they are going through a rough time, like a death in the family.

, Everyone likes to receive affirmations. Recognize when they are being a good friend and find ways to appreciate it. You can show your appreciation verbally or in writing.Give them a meaningful gift. Even a small gift can really show someone that you appreciate them.Remember to send a “thank you” card when they do something very nice for you.

, Encourage them to be the best person that they can be. Share in their emotional experiences. Give them emotional support when they are down. Laugh with them when they make a mistake. Show them that you will support them throughout the fun and the tough times in their life.Encourage them to take some risks. Shy people are not usually risk takers. For example, push them to accept a request for a date from someone that they are really interested in.

Make her feel loved.,
Be yourself around her.,
Take part in her interests.,
Ask her how you can help.,
Avoid eyeing other girls.,
Be patient.",How to Boost Your Girlfriend's Self Esteem2," This can be done by giving her little gifts you find when you’re out and about. You might also give her flowers, text or call her randomly during the day, make her food, take photos to say ""This reminded me of you,"" or plan a special date.Take into account her interests and favorite things. Some girls think that the perfect surprise date is a walk on the beach, others prefer a hike through the woods, and some would rather sit in front of the TV with popcorn and a warm blanket. Figure out what she likes and do it for her.

, As simple as it seems, showing her that you're comfortable around her demonstrates trust and respect. It encourages her to be herself around you, too.Don’t pretend like you’re perfect. If you snort when you laugh, or have weird eating habits, expose them. That way she’ll feel less pressure to be perfect as well.

, Engaging in her interests helps her know that you care about her, and also care about the things that matter to her. You don’t have to lose yourself trying to show you’re interested in her pastimes. Taking part in just one of her hobbies or interests is enough to show you care.For example, if she's in robotics club, ask to come see the robot she's working on sometime.
You might also show interest in her friends, like asking about one friend who was sick or one whose parents are going through a divorce.

, Some partners take it upon themselves to try to “fix” whatever problems their partner is dealing with. Truth is, your girlfriend may not always need you to solve a problem. She may just want you to be there for her. Learning to do this will strengthen your relationship and help her feel more loved by you.


Depending on the situation, she may want advice, help fixing the problem, or just someone to listen to her. Ask how you can help by saying, “Is there anything I can do?” Then, really listen to her answer.If she doesn’t need your help and simply wants validation, respond with empathy, like “I'm really sorry to hear that."" ""So, you're worried about your brother, huh?"" or ""That stinks.""

, The worst thing you can do in a relationship is make your girlfriend feel like she has to compete with other girls for your attention. She should feel like she’s the apple of your eye, which means showing her respect and not ogling at other girls or engaging in excessive flirting.


Doing this can only make a girl with low self-esteem even more insecure. When you’re around other girls, be sure you include her in the conversation and make it obvious who you’re with. Never leave her feeling like she has to compete.

, Even with all your love and reassurance, your girlfriend may still suffer from low self-esteem. This isn’t a problem that can be resolved overnight. In the long run, you’ll see that only she is responsible for improving her self-esteem. All you can truly do is try to love her through the process.

Steer clear of negative body comments.,
Recommend body-nourishing self-care practices.,
Challenge her insecurities.,
Share encouraging media.,
Set a good example.,
Suggest she talk to a counselor.",How to Boost Your Girlfriend's Self Esteem3," Being judgmental towards other girls will tell her that judgmental remarks are okay and normal for her to experience, both from other people and from herself. Mind how you describe other girls, and avoid comparing her to them.


If you respond judgmentally to other girls (e.g. ""girls who plaster their faces in makeup are so fake""), then you'll just be increasing the insecurity of your girlfriend.

, If you’re prone to body complaints yourself, you won’t be helping your girlfriend develop a positive body image. Avoid body-shaming comments about yourself and others.For example, don’t say, “I look so scrawny. I need to get in the gym.” Saying something like this only brings the focus to things you don’t like about your body. It also reinforces negative body comments.

, Negative self-criticisms and insecurities can grow in the mind when a person is low on self-care. If your girlfriend is feeling down on herself, inspire her to pour love and compassion back into herself. Encourage her to develop a self-care practice that makes her feel good about the body she has.Suggest that she visit the spa for a massage, sign up for a yoga class, or start journaling about her feelings. You might also spend an evening cooking a healthy meal together.

, Your girlfriend may not be aware of her harsh self-criticisms. By calling her out on them and challenging them, you can help her realize that she isn't being fair to herself. This can also teach her how to reframe negative thought patterns. Become a kind and gentle voice that defends her from her self-hatred.Contradict her when she says something negative about herself. For example, if she says ""Nobody wants to see this in a bikini,"" then you can reply, ""Really? I would.""
Does she think something is a flaw? Challenge that perspective. Tell her that you love her freckles, her gap teeth, her strong opinions, or the way she snorts when she giggles. Explain that because it's part of her, you think it's adorable.
Notice dangerous questions. For example, if she asks, ""Do you think I'm fat?"" then cut to the heart of the problem. Tell her that she's beautiful, and ask why she's asking., Girls are exposed to a lot of negative media that makes them second-guess their appearances and their bodies. Shun unrealistic images of bodies in magazines and on TV. Use a critical voice about how “real” these images are. Instead, share media with her that uplifts all bodies, no matter the shape or size.You might share a board on Pinterest, a page on Instagram, or a blog that feature body-positive women with your girlfriend.

, You can help your girlfriend treat herself well by taking good care of yourself. Practicing healthy habits will help you feel good and have the energy to be a good boyfriend. Try to maintain a balanced life, with plenty of sleep, exercise, nutritious meals and time spent on hobbies and other things you like.


When you spend time doing positive activities, you will inspire your girlfriend to do the same., Low self-esteem and a poor body image can take a toll on your girlfriend’s well-being. It can even bring down the vitality of your relationship. If, no matter how hard you try, she can’t overcome insecurities, you may need to seek professional help.A mental health therapist or counselor can determine the root cause of your girlfriend’s low self-esteem and work with her to build a healthier outlook.

Take a timeout.,
Express yourself appropriately.,
Apologize when you need to.",How to Be Less Possessive of Your Partner1," When you feel yourself becoming too possessive of your partner, taking a time out to evaluate yourself is a good idea.A little break gives you the chance to think about what you are doing, why you are doing it, and what effect it might have on your relationship.


For example, if you are at a restaurant with your partner and notice that you are beginning to feel possessive because the server is smiling at you all, excuse yourself for a moment.
Take a mental timeout if you can’t leave the immediate area. Take three slow, deep breaths and during that time focus only on your breathing.
Use the time to ask yourself why this situation is making you feel possessive. For instance, ask yourself, “Am I feeling jealous? Insecure? Why am I feeling so possessive?”;
, It’s okay to feel a little jealous or insecure some times. It’s also okay to express to your partner that you’re feeling this way as long as you do so in the right way.You can be less possessive of your partner if talk to them and express any feelings of jealousy or insecurity you may be feeling in a calm, mature way.


Tell your partner how you are feeling and what you think is making you feel that way.
Let your partner know what they can do to help you overcome your feelings.
Try saying something like, “I’m feeling kind of possessive right now. It’s silly, but I think I’m jealous of the attention you’re getting.”

, There may be times that you do something that shows how possessive you are before you can stop yourself. If this happens then you need to apologize to your partner and anyone else involved in the situation.


For example, if you are rude to a salesclerk because you felt possessive when they greeted your partner, then you should apologize to the salesclerk and our partner.
When you are apologizing to someone else, you might say, “I’m sorry for the way I just behaved. It was uncalled for and won’t happen again.”
When you need to apologize to your partner you can start with, “I need to apologize for the way I acted. I was feeling too possessive. It’s no excuse, but it’s what happened.”

Try the ""less is more"" approach.,
Learn the value of a raincheck.,
Divide your attention.,
Associate yourself with high status.,
Use names sparingly.,
Appreciate the difference between being elusive and being rude.",How to Be Elusive1," Though it might go against your instincts, your elusiveness rating might get a boost if you are intentionally indirect, incomplete, or vague in your conversations.You don't have to be withhold all the details from friends, classmates, and co-workers, but in a group setting people often imagine that other members are like themselves.Use this to your advantage by allowing your conversation partner's imagination to fill in the details they already expect. Some example questions and responses:


Q: What did you do last night?
A: Oh, the usual. You know me, I've always got something going on.
Q: What are your plans for this weekend?
A: Well, I was thinking about meeting up with some people downtown.;
, The key to this strategy is to accept the invitation, but not the occasion. Tell your friend or acquaintance that you'll gladly take them up on the offer some other time, but that you already have plans for the date mentioned. Be careful not to deny offers too frequently, or you might end up appearing cold or distant.It can help if you have some emergency chores or errands in reserve. This can also be a kinder way of postponing plans with somebody, as it is less direct (and cold) than a simple ""no.""
When you are certain you don't want to be available and, instead, want to showcase your elusiveness, planned responses can be useful:

""I'd love to join, but I have plans already. How about next time?""
""I hate how busy I've been lately. I keep missing your parties. Next weekend I'm free if you are.""
""You have no idea how much I'd rather be hanging with you, but something's come up and I have to take care of it.""



, You might be thinking of dividing your attention between different people at a party, and that is a very effective strategy for amplifying your elusiveness.However, you can also use body language to indicate that there might be more on your mind than your current conversation.


Look slightly upwards without completely breaking line of sight with your conversation partner to indicate distraction.
Repeated actions, like tapping your toes or casually checking your watch, also serve as signs that you might have other factors to contend with.Try to use subtle gestures so that you don't end up upsetting anyone.

, This doesn't mean you have to abandon your current group of friends for the popular group, but you might want to take some time to talk one-on-one with those who are well regarded in your community.This can give the impression that you are broadly connected, which only makes you more elusive.


If asked about your relationship with high status members, be vague or hint at non-specifics. As an example:

A: Hey, what were you and the class president talking about the other day?
B: Nothing in particular, aside from what everyone is talking about. But I really don't want to continue that conversation here, so maybe we'll pick it up again later?



, Language can sometimes have a strange effect on people, like making them unwilling to tear paper upon which the names of family members have been written.By withholding a name in conversation, you leave the subject you are talking about vague and uncertain, which by association, makes you more difficult to pin down. Practice using general forms of address:


""I'll be downtown tonight with some people my cousin introduced me to.""
""So this guy I met through a friend of mine from way back said he had exactly the same problem as you.""

, The point in being elusive is to evade physical or mental capture, but rudeness is hurtful to others. If you turn down a person too often or randomly disappear when hanging out, your friends might interpret your behavior as insensitive or disrespectful. Remember that the bonds of family and friendship require time and effort on your part to be preserved.

Ignore the teasers.,
Eat well and reassure people.,
Don't push your choices onto them.",How to Be in a Relationship with a Carnivore if You Are a Vegan1," The ones who tease you are generally nothing to worry about, because they are often the ones who feel comfortable around you and care about you a great deal. At times you may become irritated at them because you feel they are getting on your back, but is important not to lash out at them. If you must make it known that they are getting on your nerves, make sure to do so so that they understand what you are doing is important to you and without becoming defensive. Ways in which to convey this might include:


Saying, ""I know that you are teasing me, but it is making me uncomfortable. Could you please stop, at least for a while? Having this diet (or lifestyle) is as important to me as (include something that they really like or care about) is to you, and I would appreciate it if you respected that as I try to respect (their thing).""
Letting it slide for the time being. This is more effective and appropriate if you don't see each other often.;
, Close family members, close friends, and intimate partners may become concerned that you will become less healthy by adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet, or that it will somehow impact your mood in a negative way. It is up to you to make sure you are well informed enough to keep yourself well-nourished, sufficiently fed so as not to get angry or spooky, and explain the basic reasons for what you are doing. Also remember that although you may have a new passion for food, your loved ones will most likely not and may be frightened, bored, or put off by constant talk of what you intend to put in your stomach.


Nutritional information: Track how much protein you're getting. Often there are foods that must be combined in order for the amino acids to be absorbed as protein (for example, rice, beans, and corn). Also, if you are a woman, you must ensure that you have sufficient iron intake.
Make sure you know the studies that support a vegan lifestyle, not just testimonials or the articles interpreting or citing the studies. Also know the ones that don't support it.
You may have to take supplements, and you may have to backtrack to eating as a vegetarian or an omnivore. Do not be intimidated by the ones who say, ""See, I told you so,"" but don't attack them either.

, Unless the loved ones are willing to try a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, it will be rude and counterproductive (health goes down due to stress) to force them to eat vegan or vegetarian with you at every meal. Find ways to live comfortably with each other.


You cook a vegetarian dinner. Once you're served, they can add meat to it.
They eat meat at work during lunch, and eat vegan or vegetarian meals at home sometimes.
During meals, one meat dish is prepared, along with some vegetarian dishes, and people can choose what to put on their plates.

Ask about their interests.,
Be humorous and witty.,
Compliment them.,
Spend time with men you are comfortable with.,
Rehearse how the conversation will go.,
Don’t over talk.,
Be a good listener.",How to Be Confident Around Guys1," You can begin to become confident around guys by starting a conversation with them. There is no better way to start a conversation than by asking someone about their interests. For example, start a conversation by asking them what sports or video games they like to play. You can also ask more generally what their interests are—do they like going to the movies or concerts?You can start by saying, “This past weekend I saw that new horror movie, X. It was great! Have any of you seen it yet?”
Try to stick to topics that interest these particular guys to keep the conversation flowing. Listen to what they say and respond in a positive manner, for example, “Oh, sounds like a great game! I wish I had the time to watch it this past weekend.”;
, Keep things light by adding humor to the conversation. You can be humorous by sharing something funny that happened to you, especially if it happened that day. Or, perhaps something funny happened in class the other day; re-tell the story. On the other hand, if someone else is telling a joke or relating a funny story, laugh heartily (and genuinely) at their joke.If you’re good at telling jokes, try telling a joke; however, try to avoid insensitive jokes, and try to avoid making too many jokes. This can be off-putting.

, Everyone loves to get compliments. Compliment athletes on a great game they played over the weekend. For example, “You guys played great last Friday. It looks like you guys are really dedicated.” You can also compliment guys on their clothes or shoes, for example, “Those are awesome shoes.”If you are really bold, compliment a guy on his looks. For example, “Wow, Dave, you have been looking great these past couple of weeks. Have you been working out?”

, You can practice interacting with and relating to guys by spending more time with guys you are comfortable around. Spend more time with male family members (your dad, brother, or male cousin) or male acquaintances, like your friend’s brother.While you are hanging out with them, try to take note of the things they talk about. You can also ask them for advice, for example, “What are some good conversation starters with guys?” or, “What kind of traits do guys find appealing or attractive in people, as friends or as something more?”

, You can ensure your confidence the next time you are around guys by rehearsing what you will say. For example, make a list of conversation starters and practice saying them in front of the mirror. Pay attention to your facial expressions to make sure they are friendly and inviting, as opposed to timid or shy.


If want to add humor to your conversations, practice telling your jokes so when the occasion arises you can tell them confidently.

, When interacting with guys, it could be tempting to talk too much, especially if you are nervous. If you find yourself talking too much, try to redirect the conversation by asking one of the guys a question, for example “What do you think?"" or “How do you think the Eagles played last night?”. You could even admit your mistake in order to open the conversation up to let someone else speak. For example, “I’m sorry. I’ve been talking way too much. What do you guys want to talk about?”


Hint: you know you are over-talking when you are the only one talking and everyone is quiet. You can also tell that you are over-talking when people start to show signs of disinterest, for example by looking at their watch or phone repeatedly, or looking away and avoiding eye contact.

, Asking people about themselves and letting them have a chance to speak is only one part of the equation — you need to listen, too! When the other person is talking, remove all distractions (put away your phone, turn off the TV, etc.), make eye contact, and don't think about how you're going to respond, because then you will no longer be listening. You aren't going to make a very good impression if you keep looking at your phone or constantly asking the person to repeat themselves or saying, ""Huh? What did you say?""


Show that you are listening by nodding and occasionally making sounds when appropriate (like ""Uh-huh"") to show you are following. Ask follow-up questions, even just ""Wow, can you tell me more about that?""

Get enough sleep.,
Maintain good hygiene.,
Moisturize your skin.Moisturizing your skin is an important part of keeping it looking vibrant and youthful throughout the years.,
Get regular exercise.",How to Be Hot Around Your Boyfriend1," While it sounds like the least glamorous advice possible, getting sufficient sleep is an important part of looking beautiful. While it's recommended you should get at least 7 hours a night, many try to slip by with far less than that. If you want to look and act your best, make sure to get enough rest.Your skin will dry and age faster if you don't.


It's also a good idea to try to fall asleep at the same time each night. Try to be awake for as much daylight as possible.
Your mood and energy will also be affected by the amount that you sleep. It should come as obvious that you won't be acting with the same charm if you're trying to fight off sleep.;
, If you want to look your best, it should be a no-brainer that you'll want to keep up with the absolute basics. Brushing your teeth at least twice a day, bathing or showering regularly, trimming toe and fingernails, and brushing your hair are just some of the things you should be keeping an eye on regularly.Even without any type of cosmetics, you can look very beautiful so long as you look healthy and well-maintained.

, Although wrinkles on their own aren't necessarily a bad thing, signs of aging may have an impact on your confidence.


It may be a good idea to buy a specific moisturizer for your eyes as well. Eye moisturizers use a more delicate material to adjust for the gentle skin around eyes.

, Regular exercise tightens up your skin and is an essential part of keeping your body in healthy order. Cardio exercise like running will help put you in a great mood throughout the rest of the day. Don't be afraid of working some muscle training into your workouts as well. Some women feel against it because they think it's too masculine. Muscle training is a great way to get fit for both genders however, and you'll look all the better once you commit to a regimen.

This way you can resolve the issues, you will know where your relationship stands, and you can start being less possessive of your partner.


Tell your partner you’d like to talk about some of the issues you all have been having in the relationship. You might say, “Can we talk about the problems we’ve been having lately?”
Have an open and honest conversation about the things that have been bothering you.
Remember that resolving some issues, such as past betrayal, may take more than one conversation and a bit of time to resolve.

, One of the keys to a successful relationship is trust.You have to trust that your partner cares about you and is honest with you, just as they trust the same things about you. Part of the problem with being too possessive is that it sends your partner the message that you don’t trust them. Be less possessive with your partner by having faith in their feelings and their actions.


Trust your partner when they say they are going somewhere or doing something. You don’t need to check up on them to see if they are being faithful.
Believe what your partner tells you. Unless you know for a fact that your partner is dishonest, you should trust what they say.
Have faith in your partner’s feelings for you. Trust that your partner cares about you as much as they say they do.

, One issue with being possessive of your partner is that it may cause you to act in ways that are disrespectful to your partner, yourself, or others. You may say or do things that are humiliating, patronizing, or hurtful. You can be less possessive of your partner and build a stronger relationship if you make an effort to show them the respect they deserve.Talk respectfully to and about your partner.

Explain to your partner how you have been feeling and why you are feeling that way. You could try saying, “I’ve been feeling jealous because of some past relationship issues I have.”
Listen to your partner, as well. This should be a conversation between the two of you.

Be honest with yourself.,
Have confidence in yourself.,
Take care of yourself.,
Seek professional help.",How to Be Less Possessive of Your Partner3," Recognizing that you might be too possessive with your partner is one of the first steps in becoming less possessive.You’ve also got to be honest with yourself about why you are feeling and acting this way. Being honest with yourself will allow you to address whatever issues you have that are making you be so possessive of your partner.


Ask yourself if you are so possessive because of something from your past. For example, did your ex-partner from a previous relationship leave you for someone else?
Determine if there is something your partner is doing that makes you feel possessive. For instance, does your partner flirt a lot with others?
Be honest about any self-esteem or self-confidence issues you are having. For example, do you feel unattractive or like your partner is too good to be with you?

, Sometimes you may act possessively because you feel insecure. You may feel that you don’t deserve your partner. If you think you might be acting possessive because of personal insecurities or self-doubt, build your self-confidence so that you can be less possessive of your partner.Keep a journal or make a list of all the great qualities about you. List everything from your great eyes to your sense of humor to your love of anime.
Use positive self-talk. For example, look in the mirror and tell yourself, “I’m a great catch and Kelsey is lucky to have me, just like I’m lucky to have Kelsey.”

A counselor or therapist can help you determine why you are so possessive and help you become less possessive of your partner.If you are involved in a religious community, you can talk to your religious leader about what is going on. You might say, “Could we speak later about some problems I’m having in my relationship? I feel I’, being too possessive.”
A marriage, family, or relationship counselor can help you and your partner address any relationship issues that you all are having, as well.

Develop, and believe in, rituals.,
Have a ""soft calendar."",
Stay aware of your surroundings.,
Keep a wide circle of friends.",How to Be Elusive2," Rituals have a proven psychological effect of improving luck.When people see how well you do on your final exam after finishing your pre-test ritual, they might think you have some elusive insight into the inner workings of the world.


Get a lucky charm, like a rabbits foot, lucky coin, or game piece. These are highly portable, good conversation pieces, and can be soothing to trace or pet with your hand.
Consider a personal variation of a good luck gesture, like knocking on stone instead of knocking on wood, or tapping on the frame of a door before entering a room.

, There's no point in wasting your time alone just to give the impression that you're an elusive person, so why not plan ahead and look up activities to keep you occupied in the meantime? A soft calendar is filled with events that might be nice to do but can always be done later. A soft event, like going to the park, is flexible, where a doctor's appointment you scheduled a month ago is not. A soft calendar can also be a source for excuses in the event you offer a raincheck.


If a friend asks you to come on an outing, you might tell him that you were planning on going to the museum, and that you would love to join some other time.
If you should change your mind, like in the case of you finding out your best friend was also going on the trip, you can always say, ""You know, I can go to the museum any day. I think I will join you this time.""

, You never know when you might need to make an escape to sustain your elusive charm among your friends. When you are spending time at a public place, do some reconnaissance the day before or look up a map online. This way, if you feel the need to disappear discreetly, you can duck into an alcove unknown to others.


Use your knowledge of the lay of the land to your advantage. With a stopwatch you can time your return to the scene so that it's a surprise that makes people ask, ""Where did you come from? And... when did you leave?""

, This is a way you can extend your influence in ways that surprise your regular crew. You can attend less popular sporting events to show your support, quickly establishing new friends in the process. Having a broad network of friends will give you options for spending your time that are consistent with your elusive demeanor.


Make sure you spend enough time with the people in your life to keep your relationships healthy. Even if you do not feel the closest connection with a person, you should always take feelings into account.

Explain briefly.,
Keep your explanation casual and without judgment.,
Learn to deal with the rude people.",How to Be in a Relationship with a Carnivore if You Are a Vegan2," Some people that you have just met may wonder how you could have given up bacon/steak. These people usually seem to accept a shrug and a short explanation of how you did it. If they are interested, they may ask for an explanation of your reasoning for why you became vegan or vegetarian or what your diet or lifestyle entails. Tell them what you are comfortable telling them.


Be careful of talking about it too much. Their curiosity may be a way to invite a conversation, and conversation is never as fun when one subject is discussed too much.

, People are more likely to respond badly if they feel that you're attacking their omnivore lifestyle. Make it clear that this was your personal choice, and you don't hold their diet against them.


""I researched vegetarian lifestyle and found that it really fit me and my beliefs.""
""I was having some health issues and my doctor recommended going vegan.""

, These are the strangers who are overly familiar, family and friends who go too far, and and so forth. Standard procedures apply:


Ignore them.
Laugh it off with a ""Well, everyone's different.""
If they are persistent, stand up for yourself. Always be respectful when doing this, and never assume anything about them or be judgmental. Judgement, although tempting, invites full-blown fighting and hurt feelings. As important as food is, it is not worth it to make people feel bad about themselves.

Get creative about how to prepare common meals.,
Find suitable food when eating out.,
Eat out with others easily by becoming familiar with common substitutions.,
Stay calm.,
Invite your friends or family out to eat once in a while, or cook for them at home.",How to Be in a Relationship with a Carnivore if You Are a Vegan3," Make a pot of chili with everything except the meat, then divide it in half and the meat-eater can add their meat while the vegetarian/vegan adds something else, or eats it as is. This can be done with many soups, sauces, and ""one-pot meals"".

, When choosing a restaurant, your meat-eating family and friends may become overly concerned that ""we can't eat there"" because they think there will be nothing for you at a particular place. Show them you're a good sport once in a while by telling them you can find something anywhere. Every place has salads, pastas, and side dishes in some forms, and you can ask the waitress to do whatever you need once you're inside. Even if that meal wasn't fantastic, smile and say it was fine afterwards if asked, and decide in your own mind if you'll skip that place next time or go there again.

, Most Chinese restaurants can make any meat dish with tofu instead. A Mexican cook can replace meat with beans for you. Some things are not always on the menu, for example, ask if a place has veggie burgers, then choose any style of burger and have it made as a veggie burger, or have it chopped and put over a fantastic salad that normally has chicken on it.

, When at a restaurant, undoubtedly the meat eaters who care about you will start telling you what you can eat (eg: ""ooh, look! You can have a baked potato!""). This can be annoying, but rather than point out that you are not 3 years old and you can read a menu for yourself, just say, ""Thanks, I got it"". If you're close enough to joke with them, point out something they can eat, too, and maybe they'll get the hint that you are capable of choosing your own food.

, Open their palates to food from other cultures by giving them a vegetarian/vegan meal that is delicious and filling, and leaves them smiling. They'll soon stop asking, ""What do you eat?"" if you give them great examples. Maybe they'll start to enjoy a Meatless Monday where you're the chef. They'll appreciate your knowledge more, and start to respect you and your decision.

Take pride in who you are.,
Regulate your self-talk.,
Step out of your comfort zone.,
Bring a friend with you.",How to Be Confident Around Guys2," You can be confident around guys by being yourself and knowing your worth. Know your worth by embracing your unique qualities and talents. Are you great at writing, playing soccer, or doing math? Are you a movie, fashion, or book guru? What are the qualities that your friends and family love about you most?Make a list of your qualities and talents. Go over this list once a week to remind yourself that you have a lot to offer, not only to yourself, but to the world.

, If you find yourself saying, ""I can't do this. They are going to think I'm weird, boring, or ugly,"" you need to reverse these thoughts. Remember the list you made that identifies your best qualities and talents. Remind yourself that you are interesting, and that anyone would enjoy talking with you.You will begin to see that the more positive messages you send to yourself, the more confident you are.

, Increase your self-confidence by stepping out of your comfort zone. Try to step out of your comfort zone at least two times a week. By stepping out of your comfort zone, you will have more experiences to talk about and share with others. This will make you look interesting and adventurous in others' eyes.Step out of your comfort zone by doing something different. For example, go to a restaurant that serves food from parts of the world you have never been to or know little about. Or, if you're not very artistic, go to your local art museum.

, You can ease any situation with guys by having a support network. So, bring a friend or two with you in case things go stale or awkward. Let your friend know that you are little uncomfortable being around guys, but that you would like to get over it, and want to enlist their support. Having that extra support will boost your confidence because you will know if things go wrong, they can try to pick up the conversation.


Try bringing a friend that already knows one of the guys or has rapport built up with one of the guys. Sometimes a conversation between two people can be grounds for a conversation starter between other people in the group.

Make eye contact.,
Dress with confidence.,
Have good posture.,
Try not to fidget.",How to Be Confident Around Guys3," By looking confident, you can also feel confident around guys. Show confidence by maintaining eye contact with the person who is speaking. Eye contact shows interest, as well as respect for the person who is talking. You will make the guy feel like what he has to say is important, and thus, he will speak more freely., Always try to dress for the occasion. If it will be a comfortable occasion, dress comfortably. If the occasion is more formal, dress more formally. Make sure your outfit is clean and that it matches. Also, wear outfits that you are comfortable in. For example, if you are uncomfortable wearing heels, then wear cute flats or tennis shoes instead. Or, if you like wearing hats, like baseball caps, wear a baseball cap that complements your outfit.Try to choose colors that complement your skin tone. Colors that complement your skin tone will make your skin glow and your eyes sparkle.

, Your posture also signals that you are confident in your own skin. Try not to hold your head low or droop. Instead, hold your head level, with your back straight and your shoulders square. Also, walk at a normal pace. Don’t walk too fast or slow, and try not to stumble over your feet. Also, try to be relaxed. Instead of crossing your arms, or hiding your hands behind your back, let them hang naturally at your sides., Sometimes people look or feel nervous or awkward because they aren't sure what to do with their hands while talking with someone. Try placing your hands in your back pockets or coat pockets, or on your hips. If you're sitting, keep your hands in your lap or folded on the table. You can also use a prop — hold your backpack or purse strap, or hold a bottle of water in one hand.

Make your hands and feet glamorous.Manicures and pedicures are a great trick to take you from glamorous to casual.,
Wear red or black.A sexy black or fire-engine red are colours that have sex appeal virtually built into them when worn by a woman who knows what she wants.,
Slip into form-fitting or revealing clothes.,
Try a new hairstyle.,
Try out a sexy scent.,
Get adventurous with eye makeup.,
Emphasize your lips.",How to Be Hot Around Your Boyfriend2," They feel great, and your boyfriend will notice the difference in the way you look and feel. It's a good idea to make the hands and feet match if you use nail polish. After all, you want to make yourself a consistent, impressive visual package.


You can moisturize and manicure your hands at home if your budget's a concern. It can take some time to perfect your skills, but saves lots of money in the long run.

, The kind of wardrobe you're wearing shouldn't be completely different from what you're comfortable with, but aiming for suggestive colours can say something on its own.

, A great deal of sex appeal has to do with what someone is wearing. What you wear in particular will have a lot to do with your personal sense of style. As a general rule however, you should try to find clothing that showcases the natural shape of your body. It's not the clothes your boyfriend's interested in; it's what's underneath that counts.


You don't need to dress so provocatively to get a reaction out of someone. Something casual can usually do the trick. It's how you wear it that counts.

, Nothing changes the frame of someone's face like new hair. A new hairstyle has the ability to transform someone's look. Certain hairstyles fit different types of head better than others, but you r best bet is to pick a style that suits your personality and personal tastes. Look at some of the latest trends in hair.Although you shouldn't try to follow fashion unless it matches your own aesthetic, it can be a helpful refresher if you're not sure how you want to reinvent your look. Ask a hairdresser for her advice if you're stumped.


As a general rule, you want your hair to compliment the shape of your face. If your face is boxy, you may want a wavier hairstyle to even it out. On the other hand, if your hair is round, a short cute style can add height to your face.If you're trying to look hot for your boyfriend specifically, it might help to ask him his advice. While you're not doing this purely for him, a second opinion always helps.

, Perfumes and fragrances are a healthy bonus if you want to be really hot. Smell is an underrated way to arouse someone's senses. Although your boyfriend is probably already very attracted to your natural smell, a perfume can attract his scent closer to you. There are lots of different perfumes available, and many of them can be quite expensive.You should go to a makeup counter at a department store or beauty shop and try out a few scents before settling on one in particular.


Perfumes can be tricky, especially if you're wearing them to attract a man. Keep in mind that men and women interpret smells differently. A smell you love might turn him off. If there's any doubt, you should ask him beforehand.

, Eye makeup is arguably the most important cosmetic trick you can do to transform the way someone sees you. Your boyfriend is going to be looking into your eyes most of the time the two of you are spending time together, so it makes sense to capitalize on this opportunity.Try using a bold mascara and an eyeshadow that blends in with your natural skintone. Trying a new makeup look will have your boyfriend looking at you in a new light.


More colourful eyeshadows can make a playful touch. They're not recommended for casual days or nights out, but they can be fun when done once in a while.
Slightly smudged black eyeliner is a great sexy look.White eyeliner underneath the eyelid can make you look more awake and intense.

, Lip gloss and lipstick are such common things to use as part of someone's makeup wardrobe that they're easy to take for granted. However, just as with the eyes, you can recreate the look of your face through choosing a different type or style of lipstick. Try using a bolder shade of lipstick than the one you currently use. A lip pencil around the perimeter of your lips can highlight them and attract attention. Remember, lips are one of the most sensual parts of the face and body, and if you want to look as hot as possible, it wouldn't make sense not to give your lips some extra love.


If you want to make your lips look bigger, you can draw lipstick over an area that's just slightly bigger than your lips themselves. This will plump up the look of your lips. Be careful not to go overboard however, as this will make you look very silly.

Overcome your shyness.If you're on the shy side, it can be difficult to overcome the feelings of insecurity that go along with social anxiety.,
Flirt with him.,
Text him throughout the day.,
Take him somewhere unexpected.",How to Be Hot Around Your Boyfriend3," Confidence is key to being sexy. Even if your boyfriend already knows you well, having confidence will allow you to express yourself in exciting ways. If confidence is something you feel you struggle with, you should put some time aside to work on this part of yourself.Take control of your thoughts, and don't let any negative feelings get in the way of being self-assured.


Making a list of things you like about yourself can be a great help.

, Don't let yourself get too worked up over anything. Remember that you're worth being thought of as hot. If you're able to get outside your head and focus purely on your surroundings, your brain won't have the chance to trip you up.

, If the two of you have already been in a relationship for some time, it's quite possible that flirting has stopped being a regular part of your interactions. Reintroducing some of this playful teasing into the mix can do wonders for the relationship. Light touching on the waist, hands or shoulder can go far. Smiling at and complimenting him will show a revitalized interest.Teasing has its place even in long-term relationships. If he has a cute eccentricity, make a light jab at it. Just make sure he's not insecure about whatever you're poking fun at.

, If you're planning on meeting up later in the day or evening, it's a good idea to get him excited to see him by texting him. You can text him something suggestive or simply sweet. Something as simple as ""I'm missing you a ton right now"" will make sure he's thinking of you at that very moment.Every guy likes to be complimented, and a text message is an easy way to tell your boyfriend how you feel.


Emoticons like the 'wink face' can do a lot to suggest emotion if the two of you are far apart.

, Boyfriends are used to being the ones who make the date plans. It's really hot for a girl to take a guy out on an adventure. He'll be surprised and swept off his feet. Even if the date is to some place he's been before, the spontaneous experience will be exciting for the both of you, and it will definitely have an effect on how attracted he is towards you.

Praise your SO for their service and career choice but don't overdo it. A simple action like cooking them a thank-you dinner or a random activity like making them a ""You're my #1"" poster is sometimes all you need.
Do not be weird about it, though. If you just met less than a week ago, chances are you don't know your SO well enough to be constantly bragging about him or her like you've known them for years, so show your support in way that are consistent with your time together.

, The military values loyalty and trust, and chances are your SO has been bred to be loyal and protective. Your SO will be loyal to you if you can promise them the same., Just because you and your SO may have differing schedules does not mean you cannot have a successful relationship. Learn to plan around schedules. Figure out what works best for the both of you and work with that. Chances are their schedule will ease up as time passes.

Make the most of the time that you do have. Be creative. If all you've got is a couple of hours here or there, find activities to do together that forge and strengthen your bond.
Do not constantly complain because your schedules are too different. Doing so will only antagonize your SO and make both of you feel worse.

, When your SO is not around, don't spend  your day wishing they were there so you can do things together. Instead, spend time developing and being yourself. Focus on what's going on in your own life. It will be beneficial for your relationship in the long run and will give you more to talk about when you are together.

Focus on your schooling or work.
Find a hobby for when you are apart that will not get in the way of your relationship.
Don't forget about your friends - they were there before your SO and they will be there no matter what.
While it may be tempting to brag about your SO to your friends, don't overdo it. Bringing up your SO and praising them is a good thing as long as the entire conversation doesn't revolve around them.
Just be independent. Don't become an emotional leech who can't be alone and without your SO.

, Do things together that strengthen the relationship bond.

Go to the movies. bowling, for a walk, anything. Do something.
Include your SO in your life and ask to be part of theirs.
Make plans to hang out with friends or family, theirs or yours.


Whatever you do, do not berate your SO if their work comes in the way of a plan you may have had.

, Your SO will undergo and experience many situations that will mentally and emotionally test them, both at home and on the field, so it's important that you not only respect their career choice but also unconditionally support their roles.

Be part of their military life. Attend military social events and/or family days together and connect with other people. Connections are good.
Be a good listener when your SO needs to vent or a steady shoulder to cry on. You can expect the same in return.
Be mindful of their need for space and give them that time alone. While it may be tempting to want to spend every living second together, time apart does both of you good.
Be happy for each other!
If your SO has a bad day and brings it home to you, take it with stride. You are also human and you, too, have had and will have bad days. However, do not let your SO use a bad day as an excuse to mistreat or abuse you physically or emotionally. If you feel that you are in danger, seek immediate help.

, The hardest aspect of a military relationship is when a SO deploys for a lengthy period of time. In the long run, while it may be difficult to deal with and process at first, deployments can and often strengthen relationship bonds when both partners help each other navigate the change. If your SO is preparing to be or is already deployed, the following actions can be helpful:

Be consistently and unconditionally supportive of your SO. Deployments are not only hard for those of us left behind, but they are equally hard for those who leave.
It's good to let you SO know that you miss them, as this lets them know they are not only loved but yearned for. This is good.
However, be mindful of how much emotion you put on their plate when they reach out to you for support. The stress of the job and being away may be made worse if you put your stresses on their shoulders.
Know that you are not alone: thousands of SOs feel what you are feeling right now.
Reach out to others whose SOs are or have been deployed; they may offer healthy advice on how to cope with the separation (especially if you've had a lengthy relationship).
Reach out and find support groups. Take to Facebook or other social media outlets and find support groups dedicated to the SOs of deployed men and women.
Reach out to others in your community. Attend military events and chances are you will meet the SO of a deployed member.
Communication is key, especially when your SO has limited time to speak during the day. (see next step)
Be supportive. Deployments are hard even for those who have been deployed in the past, so do your best to be as supportive as you can.
In all honesty but not to be rude: it sucks, but suck it up. You are not the first and you will not be the last person who will experience a loved one being deployed. Time will pass, especially if you keep yourself busy.

, Communication is key. Having honest communication is healthy for any relationship, military or not. So do your best to have a positive way to communicate with your SO, but keep in mind that you're getting to know them and it may take time to adapt to their communication style.

Be open-minded about their relationship style and don't assume they just don't want to talk.
Find more than one way to communicate. Verbally is but one way, so communicate emotionally through small gestures of appreciation or love.

The clinical definition of antisocial behavior is somewhat different, however, making it important to distinguish between the two for an accurate understanding.


Antisocial behavior is characterized in much the same way as psychopathy or sociopathy. Some studies report that harsh or inconsistent parenting can be a risk factor for antisocial behavior.People who exhibit antisocial personalities tend to be cynical and unable to empathize with others, or recognize the suffering of others. Antisocial behavior is sometimes characterized by superficial charm, an inflated ego, and a general disdain for the feelings of other people.Introverted behavior is a sign of a normal social temperament, characterized by a preference for solitude. Introverts are task-oriented, and typically more engaged in solitary reflection and less engaged by interacting with others. While introverts may seem to display some of the superficial characteristics of antisocial behavior, there is no direct link between the two.;
, Being antisocial is basically just avoiding contact with people, and preferring your private time, spent alone. If you don't enjoy spending time alone, being antisocial is going to be pretty rough, if not impossible. While not all antisocial people are the same, or enjoy solitude for the same reasons, try to think about activities that you enjoy doing by yourself to figure out if you'll be able to make it work. Solitary activities may include:


Reading
Writing
Playing an instrument
Meditation
Prayer
Exercise
Hiking
Gardening

, Usually, being antisocial is a by-product of being obsessed with other things and forgetting to socialize, or simply not having the time to socialize, not a goal in and of itself. But if you want to be less attached to your social commitments, the best and most productive way to do it is to throw your attention and your effort into school or work, and forget everything else.


Instead of going home and chatting with friends on Facebook or going out, do your homework, or come up with new ideas for streamlining processes at work. Better yet, stay late at the office, or head to the library to study.
Work-obsessions don't actually have to be work or school related. Find topics or hobbies that interest you and get lost in them. Spend your evenings building model trains or writing code or making synth epics instead of socializing.

, If you want to spend less time around people, give yourself a comfortable living space so you'll enjoy staying in instead of going out. Whether you already live alone, or you live at home with your family, or live with roommates, you should carve out a space for yourself that's just yours, filled with all the things to keep your interests fueled and your alone time sacred.


If you live with your parents, make your room your sanctuary. Fill it with posters, books, and other decorations that you like and that will make you feel like it's yours. Hang a ""Do Not Enter"" sign on the door and keep it sacred.
If you live with roommates, try keeping your room as self-sufficient as possible, so you can avoid the common areas, if necessary. Get a mini-fridge for food and drink supplies, and get a hotplate, if possible.
If you live alone, take the time to decorate your apartment or house the way you like it. If nobody else is going to be around, sometimes we think there's no point in sprucing it up, but take the extra effort to make being home something special. Make it you.

, There's a difference between being antisocial and being a complete hermit. Unless you want to lose track of all social cues and become a total weirdo, it's good to spend some time in public, not socializing.


Go to the library to sit and read the paper, instead of getting it delivered to your house. This is a solitary activity, but you can do it in public and get a little people-watching in to feel like you're not completely alone.
Go out to eat occasionally and sit at the bar alone. Bring a book, if you're concerned about feeling embarrassed, even though there's no need to be sheepish.

, Feelings of isolation can start becoming a little grim if you spend too much time alone. To keep some emotional connection in your life, try getting a small pet to take care of, to stave off the blues.


If you're an outdoorsy type, get a dog to take with you on hikes and enjoy brisk walks together in the evenings.
If you're more of an indoors person, get a cat to curl up on your chest while you're trying to work on the computer.
If you don't want the commitment of a bigger pet, consider a caged animal like a rabbit, bird, or other small furry pet that's a little easier to care for.

, It's difficult to get to know antisocial people. The more you make it clear to the people in your life that you're a nut that can't be cracked, the easier it will be to spend time alone, because people will eventually stop trying to get to know you. Maintain an emotional distance from the people around you.


Used closed body-langague when you're in public to communicate that you don't want to be approached or engaged. Cross your arms, avoid eye-contact, and keep like you're focused on something else.
Don't volunteer information about yourself, if it isn't necessary. Be vague about who you are, what you do, and where you come from. If people ask you questions about your personal life, change the subject.

, When you are around people, in public, one of the best ways to communicate your desire to be alone is to be silent. Don't say anything at all, unless it's absolutely necessary, and even then try to limit your speech to the bare minimum of communication. Be like a Clint Eastwood character. Let your stare do the talking, then answer in monosyllables.

, It's unlikely that you'll be able to ever be truly solitary, but that doesn't mean you have to be a social butterfly. To keep your contacts as limited and controlled as possible, try to keep things one-on-one, as much as possible.


Don't have birthday parties for yourself, spend time with a close friend, hanging out at home, or having dinner. If you're invited to a party, make contact with the host and tell them you can't come, but invite them for a one-on-one hang-out, if necessary.
If you choose to date, make sure to be honest with people. If you're dating someone who likes to hang out with people on a regular basis, that might be a deal-breaker for both of you.

, try to make sure there's as little web record of you as possible. Cancel or suspend your social networking accounts for the time being, and delete them if you're serious about this antisocial thing.


Make your other online accounts as various and randomized as possible, to keep yourself anonymous. Don't use the same user names and passwords, and don't use your real name to register for things.
You're not being anti-social if you stay at home on the occasional Friday night, live-Tweeting your TV binge. Increasingly, our social lives exist online, and if you want to keep people out of your business, you need to stay out of their business as well. No more Facebook snooping.

, The less you need to rely on other people for help, the more you'll be able to rely on yourself. Be as self-sufficient as possible and endeavor to find your own solutions to your problems, instead of asking other people for help.


Google is your friend. If you don't know how to do something, research it and try to figure it out on your own. At least get informed about topics before you take it to an expert, or someone who's more experienced.
You don't have to interact with people at the body shop if you can change your oil properly, rotate your tires, and do other basic vehicle maintenance. You don't need to go the farmer's market if you can grow your own vegetables in your garden.

, In the movie Heat, Robert De Niro's bank robber likes to say that he doesn't have anything in his life he couldn't walk out on, if he saw the cops coming around the corner. If you want to live the solitary life, you've got to keep yourself unattached and distant. You might consider cutting off relationships when people get too close.


If you feel like someone's too much in your inner life, encroaching on your solitude, cut it off abruptly, at least for a time, to put some distance back into things. In general, it's helpful to live alone, so you've always got a home-base to return to.
Of course, in the movie, De Niro gets too close to someone and rethinks everything. It happens, and it's hard to be truly antisocial in the longterm.

, Stay distant from your neighbors and make it hard to form long term relationships by uprooting yourself. It's helpful to be a rolling stone. Try to switch towns every couple years, if it's possible, and switch apartments or living spaces more regularly, when you're in the same town.


Moving around also serves to help keep your life lively and interesting. If you live in the same house all the time, never see new people, and nothing changes, being antisocial could get pretty boring.

, To move around and stay as mobile as possible, try to limit your belongings as well as your social interactions. Think of it this way: the less shopping you do, and the less stuff you need, the less you'll need to be around people and deal with the consequences of all that stuff. Limit your buying and selling as much as you can. Simplify.

, There are a variety of careers and fields that work well with antisocial types. If you're not a big fan of ""people,"" consider looking into any of the following career fields as possibilities in the long term:


Night security
Writing
Data entry
Long haul truck driving
Nature photography
Computer programming

, You don't need to apologize for yourself and the way you are, or position yourself underneath others socially. If you're introverted and prefer being alone instead of going to parties and socializing, you don't need to attempt to ""change"" your behavior or yourself. Don't apologize for the way you are.


People with antisocial personality disorder will often display an inability to show remorse, which can be a serious problem, and a distinct difference from introverts who apologize too much. If you're actually unable to feel sorry for someone, it's a sign of a serious psychological problem. If you think your antisocial behavior may be a problem and you wish to change, seek counseling immediately.

, Negotiating your school career is a common problem for antisocial people. It's important to remember that you're not above your peers, your teachers, or anyone at your school. The more you can accept the things that make you alike, instead of focusing on the ways in which you're different, the easier getting through school will be.


If you struggle to make friends in school, things can be a lot more challenging. Try to find a small group of people that you trust and enjoy to spend time with. Often, people who struggle with antisocial tendencies can thrive with a good group of friends.
The ""popular"" kids at your school don't make for ideal friends in every case. Ignore them and make a different group of friends. Antisocial teenagers commonly describe a disdain for the popular crowd, and it's always more healthy to ignore that scene as much as possible.

, The workplace can be another challenging environment for antisocial people. Having to deal with a variety of personalities and authority figures can tax anyone's social skills, especially if you prefer your own company. While lots of the specifics of negotiating your work day will have to do with your particular job, you can learn to do a few things to keep yourself happy and healthy.


Avoid group projects and collaborative efforts, which can cause conflicts for people with antisocial tendencies. Do your own work.
Nod and smile to authority figures. You don't have to like your boss, but if you want to keep your job, you need to keep your feelings under control. Avoid awkward confrontations.
Have a variety of other hobbies and interests outside of work. If work proves to be a challenging social environment, make friends and spend time doing lots of things outside of work to help keep your personal time busy and engaged.

, Big crowds of people yelling and dancing and screaming and taking selfies? Parties are a big bummer for introverts and antisocial people alike, and trying to negotiate invitations can cause stress and anxiety. Stop worrying about whether or not you'll let an acquaintance down by not showing up to the party because you want to stay home and read. Plan to make a quick stop in and then go back to doing what you want to do.


Do a quick run through the party, stay long enough for a snack and a free drink, make a break for the bathroom, then ditch out the backdoor and make your getaway.
If you can't sneak away, make up an excuse to leave, or don't. You don't owe anyone an explanation more complicated than, ""Well, I've got to get going. Good party!""

, If you pick up your kids from school and want to avoid awkward, pointless conversations with the other parents while you wait, just learn to time your trip better to avoid having to wait for long periods of time. Grab a coffee on your way to the school and show up the moment school lets out. Wait in your car until you see your child, then make up an excuse to get going.


Fake a phone conversation, if you need to. You don't need to be a great actor to pick up your phone and say, ""Mmhmm...yeah"" once every 20 seconds or so.

, Antisocial behavior is generally characterized as a disorder, not something that someone chooses, because it involves an inability to follow the traditional laws and expectations that govern a society. People displaying antisocial behavior may have repeated problems with arrest or other behavioral problems.Other signs of antisocial behavior in need of medical and psychological evaluation include:


Repeatedly lying or conning others
Failing to plan for the future
Overly aggressive behavior and recklessness
Inability to keep a job
Lack of remorse for behaviors

Be on the lookout to see how the people around you are reacting to a given situation, or just how they're feeling when they walk in the door. People who are caring are attuned to the moods of others and can tell when someone is feeling down or upset, and take measures to do something about it. The next time you are around other people, whether you're in class or hanging out with friends, pay attention to how they are feeling in a given situation.


People who are self-absorbed or who only care about themselves tend not to care when other people around them are upset, even if they caused it. Make sure this isn't you.
Even if you're not the one causing the hurt feelings, be aware of how others around you are reacting to a given comment or a piece of news. If you're in a meeting and notice that many people are visibly upset when your boss explains the objectives for a new project, you may want to talk to your boss about it.;
, You may be too busy trying to further your own needs to always think about the impact that a certain thing you do or say can have on a person. The next time you do something, whether it's leaving the kitchen for your roommate to clean up because you're having a busy day, or ignoring your best friend's phone call about her breakup, ask yourself how this person would react to whatever it is you did. If the answer is ""not well,"" then you should think about changing your actions to something that would better suit people.


Of course, this doesn't mean that people always have to like or agree with everything you do. Sometimes, you have to do what you believe in without trying to pander to others. But if your behavior is selfish, rude, or unpleasant, then you have to start thinking about making a change.

, Caring people tend to focus on maintaining positive, healthy relationships. Sometimes, this means having arguments or engaging with conflicts with others in order to resolve an issue. However, if you want to be caring, you can think more about cutting people some slack, and about maintaining positive, healthy relationships instead of fighting all the time. The next time you begin an argument or conflict with someone, ask yourself if it's really worth having or if you just want to get some anger off your chest. If you don't think an argument or confrontation can lead to anything productive, then you're better off skipping it.Caring people do voice their concerns when they are having a problem in a relationship or situation. But they tend to focus on keeping things positive instead of fighting if they can avoid it.

, If you want to be a more caring person, then you have to appreciate the people in your life as much as you can. Be thankful and grateful for your family members, your friends, your significant other, or any of the people who make your life more meaningful and positive. Don't focus on the things that you're missing or the rude comments you have to deal with sometimes, and think about all of the joy and happiness that people bring to your life instead. This will not only put you in a better frame of mind, but it will make it easier for you to care about the people around you more.


In order to really appreciate the people in your life, you have to thank them as much as you can. Thank them for helping you out during a hard time, for doing you favors, or just for being amazing. Let them know that their presence really does matter in your life.
Don't underestimate the power of a written ""thank you"" card. These cards aren't as common as they used to be, which will make the person who receives them feel all the more special.

, Though it's hard to decide to stop being completely selfish one day, anyone can work on being less selfish in his or her daily interactions and everyday life. If you want to be less selfish, then you have to spend more time thinking about how others are feeling instead of always worrying about me, me, me. The next time you have an interaction with someone, focus on how the person is feeling and what he's been up to instead of talking about yourself or only thinking about your own needs. The more aware you are about not being selfish, the easier it will be to truly care for others.


Remember that there's a difference between being selfish and in taking good care of yourself and not neglecting your own needs for the sake of what others want.

, People who are caring enter their daily lives with an attentive perspective. They pay attention to what people do when they are talking to them, and they are sensitive to their needs and feelings. Paying attention to people's facial expressions, gestures, dress, and even their offhand comments, can help paint a complete picture of how that person is really thinking and feeling, and can lead you to be more caring.


Your friend may be telling you that she's totally over her breakup, but if you look closely, you'll see bags under her eyes or a puffy nose that indicate otherwise.
Your roommate may have a big exam coming up and you may notice that she hasn't had a solid meal in two days; cooking extra food for dinner can make a big difference in her life, and will show that you care.

, You may not think that being polite has much to do with being caring, but in fact, being polite will make you a more caring person who is determined to treat the people around him or her with respect. Being polite means having good manners, not being overly vulgar or rude in front of people, holding doors for people and asking people about their day. It also means smiling at people, having common courtesy, and not getting in another person's way. Whether you're at the office, walking down the street, or talking to your sister, you should have a goal of being as polite as possible.


You don't have to be overly formal to be polite. You just have to be considerate of other people and make them feel comfortable in your presence.

, People who are caring give affection to the people they love or care about. Whether you're cuddling with your son or holding your girlfriend's hand, it's important to give people affection as a way of showing that you care. Hugs can be very powerful and can bring comfort to people in need. You shouldn't go around giving physical affection to the people you don't know well, but you should give hugs, light touches, kisses, affectionate pats, or other signs of physical love to the people close to you.


Actions really can speak louder than words sometimes. Though telling a person you care can make a big difference, sometimes giving that person a hug or putting your arm around him or her can have that extra impact.

, People who are caring take the time to listen to others. They don't spend all day talking about themselves because they are genuinely interested in what other people have to say. When someone is talking to you, make eye contact, put away your phone or other distractions, and don't interrupt the person. If you have advice or a comment, wait until the person is done talking. As you listen, pay attention to more than just the words; watch the person's face and gestures to get the best understanding of how that person is really thinking and feeling.


When the person is done talking, don't just compare his or her experiences to your own or say, ""I know exactly how you feel."" Don't make this about you. Look at the situation on the person's terms.
Pay attention to the details. If a person is telling you something important, don't just forget about it once the conversation is over; ask about it later.
You don't have to say, ""Uh, huh,"" or to nod too aggressively when the person is talking to show that you are really listening. Strong eye contact will do a lot of that work for you.

, Being generous, whether it's with your time or your money, can go a long way in being a more caring person. If you want to be caring, then you have to give to others and to not be selfish with what you do have. We all have busy schedules, but it's important to make the time to donate your things, do favors for people in need, or just to compliment a person close to you. Be giving in all senses of the word without forgetting about yourself, and you'll be on your way to being a more caring person.


Being generous with your time is very important. Though you don't want to sacrifice all of your ""me time"" for the sake of someone else, make a habit of taking the time to listen to a friend or loved one in need.

, This may sound very obvious, but you'd be surprised by how few people actually live by this law. If you want to be more caring, then you have to be kind and thoughtful toward others, and think of how you would feel if you were in their shoes. You may not care much when you make a rude comment to your waiter because you're cranky, but think about how the comment would make him feel. You may not care about being rude to your little brother, but you should think about how your words really affect him. Making a habit of putting yourself in someone else's shoes can make a big difference in how you see the world.You may not be down on your luck, but someone else may be. Try to imagine what that's like before you're brusque or uncaring to someone who is less fortunate than you.

, Being considerate is another major aspect of being caring. If you want to be considerate, then you have to respect the people around you, and to avoid making a nuisance of yourself. This includes not talking too loudly on the phone on a crowded bus, not minding your own personal space, and not asking your sister how she feels about you inviting her ex boyfriend to your party when she'll be there. Look out for other people and make sure they feel comfortable and respected in your orbit.


Being considerate also includes asking people questions to make sure they're okay. Don't turn up the thermostat in your office before asking if everyone else is as freezing as you are.
You should remember that your words, as well as when you say them, are also an important aspect of being considerate. If you have some negative feedback for a friend or coworker, make sure your language is inoffensive and that you bring it up at the right time.

, Helping people in need is a major aspect of being caring. You can't be a caring person if you're only out to help yourself. Helping other people means helping both the friends and family members who need help in their lives, and also helping out the less fortunate people in your community, or even people you may not know that well who need assistance. Be on the lookout for people who need help and find a productive way to get involved if you want to be more caring.


Your friends and family members may not always admit it when they need your help. However, it's up to you to notice when they are just being polite and really need some extra help, whether they want you to do some more chores or to run some errands.
Get involved in a soup kitchen, literacy center, local library, teen help program, or another program in your area that allows you to make other people's lives more full.

, Another way to be caring is to put more effort into learning about how other people are doing. The next time you talk to someone, whether it's your neighbor or your best friend, ask him or her how he or she is feeling, about what he or she has going on that weekend, or about how his or her day is going. Making the effort to ask the little questions can add up to showing that you really do care. Don't just ask out of obligation, but because you genuinely want to know how the person is doing.


Have a balance of talking about yourself and about the other person in any conversation. You don't want to ask a million questions and not reveal anything about yourself, but you also don't want to talk about yourself and not learn anything about the other person, either.
Remember that this doesn't mean you have to pry. Asking something innocent like how the person's dogs are doing or if he or she has any fun summer plans, can make the person see that you care without you coming on too strong.

, Caring people care about how their actions affect other people. Therefore, they are quick to apologize when they've done something wrong. They don't deny their mistakes, and they are comfortable admitting they're not perfect. If you know you've hurt somebody, then you have to swallow your pride and say something as simple as, ""I'm so sorry I hurt your feelings. I really regret what I did,"" to show that you're aware of how your actions impact others. Doing this shows that you do care, because you think about how others are feeling.When you apologize, make eye contact and avoid other distractions. Show the person that he or she is worth your time.
Don't say, ""I'm sorry you felt hurt when I made that comment,"" because this is an empty apology that will only do more damage.

, Caring people spend time doing favors for people and helping them out when they need it. This doesn't mean you have to become someone's errand boy, but it does mean that you should make an effort to help people out, whether you're picking up coffee for your boyfriend, giving your little brother a ride to school, or helping your best friend pick out the flowers for her wedding. While there should be a balance and the person should do favors for you also if he or she is capable of it, you should make a habit of doing favors for those you care about.


Though you don't have to spread yourself too thin, sometimes the greatest joy can come from doing a favor for someone you don't know that well. If you shovel your neighbor's driveway while you're shoveling yours after a snowstorm, the effort will be much appreciated.
Be on the lookout. People won't always ask you if they need a favor. Sometimes, you should just be able to tell when they really need your help but don't want to impose.

, Sharing really is caring. If you want to be a more caring person, then you should be willing to share your things. This means sharing things you actually care about, like clothes you like, or half of your favorite sandwich, not sharing something that means nothing to you, like a book you didn't like much anyway. Be on the lookout for opportunities to share things, whether it's a material object or a piece of advice. People who are caring are unselfish, and sharing is a key trait of a person who is selfless.Sharing doesn't only mean material goods. You can also share knowledge. Take the time to talk to a high school student about the college admissions process if you're in college. Talk to someone starting out in your career field about your experiences. Help a younger person on your tennis team master her forehand. Look for opportunities to improve a person's life by sharing what you know.

, Another way to be caring is to let people know that you're thinking about them even when you're not together. To do this, you should check in with your friends or family members, whether it's through sending a text message after your best friend's exam, or calling your cousin on her birthday. Sending cards also gets the message across. Though people are busy and it's unrealistic to talk to multiple friends every day, make a habit of checking in on at least one friend a week will make a big difference.It's one thing to care about someone when he or she is standing right in front of you, but it's another to check in on that person when he or she is out of sight.
If you know a friend is having a hard time, you should check in on your friend, even if you're just saying hi. You don't have to keep saying, ""How are you feeling?"" or that might get annoying, but emailing an interesting article or sending your friend a funny text can help cheer him or her up.

, Another way to show that you really care is to pay attention to the details that people tell you. This could mean the name of your co-worker's cat, the time when your mom is waiting to hear if she gets a promotion, or the fact that your new friend grew up in Topeka, Kansas. Hold on to these details and bring them up later to show that you care. If you keep forgetting every little thing a person tells you, then it'll start to look like you don't care very much. Make a point of remembering as much as you can about a person's life, and to follow up about it when it matters.Of course, you don't have to remember every little thing. But if you focus on the important details, you'll have a better sense of who the person is and what matters to him or her.

, Volunteering is a major way to be more caring. You can volunteer in your community to help out people in need, and you can also find other ways to help out. Volunteer at a local bookstore or library. Volunteer to help clean up a park in your community. Volunteer to bake something for your school's bake sale. Be on the lookout for more opportunities to improve your community and to make a difference in the place where you live.You can also volunteer in a different city, or even a different country. Spend your spring break building houses for Habitat for Humanity in a different part of your state, or even working to help out in a different country. You'll become more caring by spending more time focusing on improving other people's lives.

Most relationships can’t sustain the constant criticism of one partner toward another.Make your commitment to veganism about you, not them. Don’t give them the “stink eye” during meals, nag them to agree with your food choices, or criticize what they eat.;
, Along with not being judgmental, you should remain open-minded and understanding of your partner’s choice to remain omnivorous. Showing compassion instead of saying “I told you so” when your partner gets food poisoning from undercooked meat, or offering to cook meat for their meal, shows that you are willing to work with your partner.

, If you are in a relationship with a non-vegan, this means that your partner is most likely open to your lifestyle choice. Be thankful that your partner likes you more than what you eat or what products you don’t use. Express this thankfulness so that they know you feel it.


Do things like give them cards with heartfelt sentiments of thanks, cook them an omnivore meal, or offer to go to a restaurant they like but you don’t like.

, Just like in any relationship, pressuring your partner to change isn’t a great idea. It expresses your displeasure with who they are, which makes them want to get away from you rather than stick around. Don’t nag them to eat like you do.


Some even suggest that the best way to recruit a romantic partner to becoming a vegan is to live by example only and not try to convert your partner at all., Enjoying your partner is an important part of any relationship. One way to do that when you are in relationship with someone who has chosen a different lifestyle is to agree to disagree. When differences of opinion arise at meal time or when purchasing cleaning products or furniture, laugh about your differences and choose something that you can both live with., Another key to living happily with someone who doesn’t believe in the vegan philosophy is to focus on what you do have in common. You probably both like white potatoes, watching TV together, and working out at the gym. Look for activities that are neutral (neither vegan nor non-vegan) and do those more often than either vegan or non-vegan ones.

, At first, your partner, like many people, might mistake you for a vegetarian. Explain this difference so that they know what foods and products you don’t like so that there are no hurt feelings or miscommunications down the road. Tell them that vegetarians limit their diets to merely lack of meat (including fish and poultry), but vegans go beyond this., Explain how vegans are vegetarians but they have a lot of additions. Vegans avoid animal food by-products like eggs, honey, and dairy like butter, yogurt, ghee, and cheese. They also avoid material and cleaning products that have involved animals.Vegans avoid materials like leather, fur, silk, and wool, as well as cosmetics, soaps, and other cleaning products. They stick to buying cruelty-free products.

, To help your non-vegan partner understand your lifestyle choice, you need to offer an explanation. It is much easier to accept the differences of others when you understand their reason behind it. You may have chosen to be vegan for environmental reasons, or to improve your health. Whatever your reason, make sure your partner clearly understands it.People also choose to become vegan because of ethical reasons. Vegans might choose to avoid dairy like cheese and butter because they feel it supports the meat industry.

, Keep a humble and open demeanor whenever you encounter a vegan choice, such as when eating or purchasing items for the home. Avoiding a pretentious attitude is important for staying in your relationship with a non-vegan.


Also try to compromise on items when you can. Always maintaining your vegan standard can get exhausting for your non-vegan partner.

, Even though both partners in a vegan and non-vegan relationship should try to be open to the other’s lifestyle, sometimes your partner may try to recruit you to become an omnivore. Your partner may also question your beliefs and even criticize you sometimes. Knowing that this might happen can keep you from getting bitter.


Explain to your partner that this hurts you just as much as when you constantly nag them about their lifestyle.

, Many people question the vegan avoidance of meat because meat is such a common source of protein. Your partner may not understand how you can get enough protein in your diet, so explain to them that it’s actually easy to get enough protein if you eat a lot of different healthful food.


Vegan sources of protein include legumes, tofu, soy milk, nuts, leaf greens, whole wheat, and much more., Your partner may also question your health because your diet limits you to foods without meat or meat by-products. Explain to them that vegans can actually get the full spectrum of nutrients through a varied diet. Explain your commitment to a varied diet that contains vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and seeds., When you live with or date an omnivore, you are going to eat very differently. This means that you will have to eat completely different meals both at home and when you go out. Since sharing meals provides emotional connection, you should be prepared to feel a little less of this connection since you can’t enjoy some meals together., When you go out to eat, don’t make one person’s lifestyle dictate the choice of restaurant. Try to find restaurants that cater to both your lifestyles by considering what you could order from the menus at different places. Some cities actually have vegan restaurants, and omnivores can enjoy these restaurants just like you can enjoy omnivore restaurants., Look for recipes that can become a staple for both diets. You might often have to cook different meals, but having a list of recipes that you can quickly choose from prevents frustration at dinnertime.


For example, you can make vegan versions of your partner’s meat-based meals, such as veggie burgers thrown on the grill alongside beef burgers.

, At home, it is a good thing to find recipes that contain flavors and foods that you can both enjoy. Being able to cook a meal together means that you get to share it together, which promotes emotional connection.For example, many omnivores enjoy potatoes and whole grains such as whole wheat bread, as well as nuts and leafy green salads.

, Vegans do not usually enjoy touching meat, so putting your hands into a sink full of greasy water from meat residue is repulsive. Keep the peace in your house by having each person wash their own dishes.

Understand what drives some people to call you weird.,
Treat the term of ""weird"" as a compliment.,
Love yourself for who you are.,
Act like yourself.,
Make showing your true self a habit.,
Learn to respond with humor and a light touch.,
Show off your style.,
Find the other weird girls and guys out there.",How to Be a Weird but Appreciated Girl," Being quirky isn't bad at all, but for some people, not conforming to a current ""normal"" is a little confronting and even scary. Some people have very tiny comfort zones and whenever they come across someone who just doesn't fit with their culturally conditioned view of what is normal and right, they find it disorienting, bothersome and awkward. In some cases, their mouth shoots off before their brain clicks in, and they call you weird. It isn't your fault, it's a default reaction from them and they actually have a responsibility to be more respectful.


People often reject what they cannot understand. This isn't a reflection on who you are, it's a reflection on their narrow understanding of the diversity of the world and the humans within it.;
, Be proud of not being like the others. Sticking to your outlandish personality whilst being appreciated for who you are is a rare but wonderful thing but nevertheless, not always easy. Yet, if someone calls you weird, it is vital to learn to see that as a major positive in that they don't see you as conforming to what everyone else does or thinks and therefore, you are an original and you're an authentic person following your own drumbeat. In a time in human history where innovation, creativity and originality are becoming highly desirable traits, you're ahead of those who try to fit in all the time.

, Before you get others to love you, love yourself first and seek to understand the depths of your personality, your style and what matters to you most in this world. Write down all the things you love about yourself and why this makes you a great, funny, incredible, caring and happy person. Not feeling the need to compare yourself to others is a way of journeying through this world with your eyes wide open and your heart ready to accept others for who they are. Loving yourself enables you to better love others. If that's weird, it's only because a lot of people don't know it yet.


Remember that it is better to be rejected for being yourself than be accepted for being someone you're not.

, Don't be afraid of being yourself, it's the real definition of what is ""normal"". When people know who you are and you aren't afraid of showing off your awesome personality! Remind yourself when it seems all too hard, that being weird is a side-effect of being awesome. You're an original, a limited edition.

, Don't overdo it though, you will likely regret not trying to fit in when the occasion really calls for it, such as during someone else's special event or during those essential ""more serious"" parts of life like funerals and exams.

, Don't look surly, hurt or angry. Remember that thing about treating it as a compliment? If people call you annoying or crazy or a maniac, appreciate it. Remember to treat being called weird as a compliment to you, even if you're embarrassed about it.


Respond to an accusation of being weird with a smile, such as: ""Me weird? Always."" Or, ""God bless you for noticing. I love my weird too."" Or, ""Yep, might seem so, and I'm the coolest person when you get to know me.""
If you are shy, don't make a fuss about it. Lighten yourself up a bit, and don't get too shy about laughing at a joke. Soon, you can make new friends and live a happy life being weird and appreciated.

, Maybe make up a new, funky nickname matching your quirky and individual style. It's better to celebrate it than to masquerade as someone you're most uncomfortable trying to be.

, Shine your light brightly so that they can find you and be appreciated as they appreciate you. A mutual admiration society will never go astray! Remember that every person has a little weird inside them. Some have more than others, some are just brave enough to let it show. Find those people who connect with your weird and they are most likely a soul mate or friend.

Begin with the title.,
Be careful about the grammar used and the wording of the title.",How to Write an Advertisement for a Pet1," Don't underestimate the importance of a good title, especially when posting an ad online. The most important thing to remember is to keep it short, detailed, and attention-grabbing.


Instead of just writing ""Buddy needs a home"", include basic information (type of animal, for example);
, People respond positively to well written messages; they respond negatively to things that are badly written or that carry negative connotations. For example:



A less impressive title: VERY FRIENDLY LABRADOR 4 SALE CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In this case, the capital letters create the impression that the advertiser is ""screaming"" at you, which seems a little unprofessional. While it also suggests that the Labrador is very friendly, the misspelling of the dog's breed and the excessive exclamation points suggest immaturity and maybe even irresponsibility, which can lead to the potential buyer wondering if the dog has been well cared for. Moreover, adding the word ""cheap"" automatically diminishes the worth of the pet, which is most certainly not the message you're looking to get across.



A positive and welcoming title: Friendly, Beautiful Guinea Pig for Sale!

In this second instance, the overall impression of the advertiser is that he or she is sensible and intelligent enough to spell correctly and restrained enough to take good care of a pet. The title catches your attention, but doesn’t create the desperateness that the first title suggests.




While neither impression may be accurate, impressions do matter and when there is so little to go on, it pays to get it right immediately.

Think about the way in which you'd like to present the memoir before writing.,
Design the look of the document or format you're producing as a memoir.,
Decide what form of writing you'll use to write the memoir.,
Start writing.,
Consider asking others to contribute to the memoir.,
Keep copies of the memoir where it can be easily accessed.",How to Write a Pet Memoir," This can have an influence on the way that you write the memoir. For example, if you wish to accompany the writing with images, this will require a greater focus on the specific images and why the images are of importance to you and your family. Or, if you want to write an essay style, this will require more of a story, which may or may not be accompanied by images, either retelling the animal's life or perhaps picking out key happenings that you identify with as being most indicative of the personality of your pet. Consider some of these possible ways for presenting the memoir:


A journal style with a retelling by years, from the beginning to the end of your pet's life.
A scrapbook of favorite images of your pet, accompanied by text explaining relevant things about the pet related to the image and its date.
An essay, letter, poem, etc., about your pet. This could be produced digitally, in book form, or both. It could be accompanied by images, or be mostly text, perhaps with one photo of your pet.
An online piece of writing (on a website, social media site or a tailor-made memorial site).;
, It's best to leave actually forming the design after the writing has been completed, to ensure that the writing is the feature, and the design work simply boosts the memoir material.


If it's going to be digital, consider using borders, background images, occasional photos, etc. to brighten it up.
If choosing a hard copy version, use quality materials that are long-lasting. A lovely hard-covered notebook or a quality scrapbook might be ideal.
If making a scrapbook memoir, also find scrapbook pieces that are relevant to the pet's life, such as a collar tag, a piece of fabric from a favorite toy, photos, cut-outs of the animal species, etc.

, There are no hard and fast rules on how a memoir should be written. The best approach is to choose the writing format that you're most comfortable with and that reflects the things you really wish to capture about your pet's life. This could be:


An essay, short story or long piece of free-writing about your pet's life
A book that you will have published
A poem or a series of poems
A combination of writing and poetry
A blog post or Facebook update, and so forth.

, A memoir is about memories of your beloved pet, the ones that move you, remind you of time spent together and the ones you want to capture for the future. Some of the things you might like to write about in your pet's memoir include:


When you first got your pet and why you wanted the pet.
Any identifiable features, quirks or personality traits of your pet that you noticed early on, or that grew over time. Describe your pet as best you can. (Images or self-made drawings might help you with this.)
Interactions with other people in the household or neighborhood; interactions with other pets or animals.
Eventful situations with your pet, such as rescuing the pet/the pet rescuing you or someone else; losing your pet and finding it again; showing your pet in a show; traveling with your pet; having your pet at your wedding, etc.
How your pet made you feel. Did your pet help you feel better when you were down? Did your pet bring you joy even when you felt the rest of life was hard? Was your pet an important companion to you?
Ways in which your pet inspired, enlightened or informed you.
Things you want to always remember about your pet.
Favorite activities together, such as going for walks, singing together, doing tricks, eating together, dancing, riding, etc.
The circumstances surrounding your pet's death, such as its age, an illness or an accident. This is optional, as you may not feel ready or desirous of adding these details to the memoir.

, If the pet was a beloved member of your family or household, it's likely that the pet developed special and differentiated bonds with them. Ask family or household members to contribute their writing (or other mementos) to the memoir too.


You could make separate sections of the memoir devoted to each person's take on the pet's life and how they interacted with it. This can make a lovely memento for everyone if you make copies.

, If hard copy, place it on a bookshelf, or perhaps rest it on a book stand, with the pet's name and photo clearly on the front. If in digital format, name it so that it's easy to find again and be sure to back it up. Email it to others, if appropriate.

Enter a contest.,
Try a reality show.,
Get an agent.,
Prepare to spend money.,
Go where the action is.,
Know your community.,
Be persistent.",How to Become Famous As a Child1," Contests are one of the main ways that people can become famous. There are writing contests, dance contests, beauty pageants and more. Look for contests that will allow you to show your talents.


Get familiar with the contests that are well-respected in your field. Some contests are just money-makers for the sponsors who put them on. If a contest isn't well-respected by professionals in your field, you won't get famous.Always do your best in a contest. Even if you don't feel like it's a good one, it will be good practice for your next time.
If you don't win your contest, don't quit trying. The judge's personality and the kind of competition there is that day all impact the results of any contest.;
, Shows such as American Idol, The Voice, or other well-known competitions are great ways to become famous. Auditions for these shows are held in locations all over the country.Remember that competition for these shows is very tough! You'll find yourself in line with literally thousands of other children, all dreaming of becoming famous.
Part of these shows includes the judges being mean to the contestants. Be prepared to be ridiculed, no matter how talented you are.

, Look at the professional journals and magazines, such as Backstage Callsheet. This lists all the talent agencies in Los Angeles and New York. Look for the ones who represent famous children, and contact them for representation.Remember, no quality agent will sign you without your parents' consent if you are younger than 18. Never follow an agent's direction without consulting with a responsible adult.
Always be honest in representing yourself to potential agents. If you don't look anything like your photograph, no agent will sign you.
Never lie about your age if you're under 18.

, Every contest costs money to enter. You'll have to have the best gear you can afford for your talent or sport, which may be expensive. You'll need to dress well, and look good. While you can save money by learning to do some things yourself - like sewing your own outfits, or shopping in thrift stores - there are certain inevitable costs associated with becoming famous.Talk to people who might be willing to support you financially.
Look for scholarship opportunities in your area of interest.
Consider trying a crowdfunding site, such as Go Fund Me, to help raise money for your endeavor.

, It is easier to become a famous singer, if you're already living in Nashville. If you're in Los Angeles, it will be easier to break into show business. If you are in an area where other famous people are already, it will be easier for you to become famous.Use the connections you have. Talk to everyone you know about your talent, and follow up on suggestions for meeting others.
Attend events whenever you can which are part of your talent or area of skill, even if you're not on stage.
Be supportive of others who are trying to get famous. After all, that person may end up helping you!

, If you really want to be famous, you'll need to know everything you can about your talent area. Find the people who are famous in your field, and follow everything they do. Can you imitate them, or improve upon what they're doing? What were they doing when they were kids?Follow your role models on social media. Learn more about the things they do, the places they go, and their routines of daily work and life.
If you pay attention, you'll likely learn that nobody is perfect. Even the most famous people make mistakes. Learn from their mistakes, and try not to repeat them.

, Everyone can be famous, but most people aren't. This isn't always because they're not talented, but because they decide that other things in their life are more important than being famous. If you truly want to be famous, you'll have to be persistent.If one agency turns you down, move on to the next one.
Most people lose more contests than they win. Keep entering contests and your chances automatically improve.
Don't get distracted. If you're serious about your career and getting famous, you don't have time for getting involved in petty quarrels with classmates, siblings or neighbors. Stay focused, and your chances for success increase.

Write the description.,
Be careful to avoid describing things the potential buyer isn't interested in.,
Include a picture.",How to Write an Advertisement for a Pet2," This is the most important part of the advertisement as it tells the potential buyer what he or she will be getting by way of your pet's habits, temperament and behavior. It is also a place to reassure the buyer that you are selling your pet for a genuine reason. Some things to consider when writing the advertisement up include:


Provide a short description of the animal’s type, breed, size, behavior around kids/dogs/cats/etc, temperament, health, and appearance.
Explain why you're selling the pet. No need for copious details but just a little something to reassure the potential buyer that you're not mean-spirited or running a puppy mill, etc. Be careful with sob stories––too much of this can turn a potential buyer off as he or she will have to meet ""the sad you"" when transacting for the pet, and if you sound like you're really down, the potential buyer may pass for fear of the emotional fallout.
Add in special quirks or habits of your pet that will endear a potential buyer to the pet; such as ""Fido can jump hoops"" or ""Flossie will groom any other cat in your house without a fuss.""
Focus most on the positive, the good, the great and the fantastic about your pet. A potential buyer wants to know that he or she is going to be getting one amazing pet in his or her life, so help that buyer to see the best in your pet, something you've always striven to do anyway!

, Using the advertisement to have a go at the cause of offloading your pet is unhelpful and only serves to make you look like a mean-spirited and difficult seller.



Here is what to avoid: SUPER friendly pit bull, name is Maxwell, MUST GO ASAP my landlord is a --- and won't let me keep him EVEN THOUGH HE IS PERFECTLY BEHAVED. He is GREAT with kids doesn’t like dogs though. I’m really angry @ my landlord and HE MUST GO TO A GOOD HOME, NOT for fighting!!!!!! there is a fee to make sure he goes to the right home. My phone number is 111-111-1111.

In this example, most of the ad is dedicated to describing the landlord. In turn, you receive very little information about the dog other than that he’s male, friendly with kids, not good with dogs (a downside that could be written with greater care), and he's called Maxwell. The advertiser makes the common mistake of vaguely saying there’s an adoption fee; potential buyers are much more likely to contact you if you have an already stated price or price range.



On the other hand, here is a much better description: Hi, I’m Lily. My Budgie Baby is so sweet and I’ll be sad to see him go, but I’m moving and can’t take him with me. He’s a gorgeous light blue color, not the usual green/yellow markings. He’s great at talking and can say “Hi,” “I love you,” “Baby,” and “Lily.” He’s wonderfully behaved with men, women, and children, and mostly ignores our cat. Never had a health problem; you can verify with our vet. There is a $50 adoption fee; his cage (which is large and in good condition) and seed comes with him. Please contact me at 222-222-2222, serious offers only. Thanks for your time!

By introducing herself and thanking the reader, a more personal edge is added to Lily's advertisement. She keeps the reasons for selling the budgie short, using it to her advantage by promoting how well-behaved Baby is. She also emphasizes on his coloring and speaking ability, and includes the adoption fee. After reading it, you’re left with the feeling that Baby is well-behaved and charming and Lily is trustworthy enough to pay Baby a visit.



, A pet ad with a picture included is much more likely to receive offers than an ad without one; it helps potential buyers work out whether or not they're interested in researching further.


When taking a picture, make sure that you can clearly see the animal, and include the entire body in the picture - not just a head. See How to photograph pets for more details.

"
"
Add your contact information.",How to Write an Advertisement for a Pet3," This should include your phone number and email address. Include when you would prefer to be contacted and whether you'd prefer texts or calls by phone. Indicate if you'll reply faster by any method over another method, as this helps guide the potential buyer toward choosing the best method to reach you.

It’s a good idea to include your last name, though not necessary. #*Example: Joe Twig, 333-333-3333, joe@yahoo.com (I’ll respond to you quicker if you call me, but email is okay.)

Some things you could do include riding a bike or skateboard, drawing, writing a story, going into the woods to make an imaginary world, play games with your dog, etc. Try to choose strange, unique activities.;
, Clothes are not very important, but they do say something about you. Basically, pick plain colored shirts, vests and sweatshirts. Dress very simply. Always have blue jeans on, preferably ripped or distressed. For accessories, wear peace signs! Also, get buttons at Hot Topic to put on your clothes. You can make arm warmers, too.

, Okay, so when you are in public, let's say at school or at the store, here is how you should act. You should be quiet, but when you speak, speak lowly.

Think about if you can make alterations to something other people are doing to make it better, or more outrageous.
Talk to your friends and family for ideas. Maybe you can do something together with them. After all, even the most famous singer has a band and backup singers to help. You don't have to do this alone.

, You'll need to have videos to show people what you've done. This involves getting a video camera, and learning to record, edit and upload to the internet. Make sure the video has good sound quality. If it doesn't, consider adding music soundtrack.One video might be enough, or you might need to make several.
Make your video more interesting by adding cool effects like animation or stop-motion.
If you wouldn't be interested in watching your video, other people won't either. Be entertaining, funny, and friendly.
Don't break the law to do your idea, or your video won't be allowed on social media.

, Make yourself a website, a video channel, and get active on social media. Don't stick just to the most popular social networks, but seek out trendy new social networks.Don't share your personal phone number, home address or other personal information about where people can find you on these websites. Not only is this unsafe, but it makes you seem less popular.
Make sure that everything about you online supports the idea of yourself you're trying to market. For example, if you're trying to become famous for gymnastics, make sure that people get to see you doing a lot of gymnastics, not getting drunk at a party.
Seek out other people on social media. Twitter is a great medium for marketing yourself directly to other famous people. Don't overdo it though, or you'll be a pest. It's a fine line between promotion and spam.

, There is a well-known expression by the artist Andy Warhol: ""In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."" Being famous isn't always a long-lasting thing.

Listen to the things your parents say and ask of you.",How to Be the Best Girl Ever," Use basic grooming to stay clean and neat. Brush your hair regularly and keep it well washed. Brush your teeth at least twice a day. Avoid getting caught up in beauty regimes that suck away time you could be using more productively to play sport, read a book, get more sleep or invent a new life-changing product. Instead, find quick and easy ways that work best for your needs.


Soap and water are just as good for keeping clean as any other product and they're cheaper and contain less unknown ingredients. Don't feel that you have to slather on shower gel, bath lotion or smelly products unless you really enjoy these items.;
, Join a sports team or just go for a run or jog every day or few days. Eat healthy, don't stuff yourself with junk food and sit at the computer all day.


Eat seasonal foods; these are nutritionally better for you as they haven't been stored as long. Eat locally, the food won't have traveled as far and will also be nutritionally good for you.
Find a sport or form of exercise that works for you. Don't assume that you have to use the gym, jog or do crossfit if you don't enjoy them. There are plenty of ways to stay active and feel good about what you're doing to stay fit. Look for your preferred ones and link up with friends who also enjoy the same activities.
If you don't want to go outside to exercise, know that you still could do simple exercises at hone. You could to crunches, sit ups, push ups, curl ups and pull ups. You could also watch a fitness DVD and follow along with them.

, Don't assume that you have to use them and always be informed about what the products are made from and what the ingredients might mean for your health and well-being. In some cases, products can cause allergic reactions, which is not healthy for you. Check out the Safe Cosmetics website at http://www.safecosmetics.org/ and the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database at http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/, so that you can make informed choices about the makeup products you choose to use.

, Have the best grades that you can by studying in a focused and purposeful manner. Try as hard as you can in school––never think ""it's just a test."" Instead, think ""This is a test! What if it counts? Even if it doesn't count for much, I want to do the best that I can, for my own sake!""

, Learn to think critically, ask questions and assume nothing. The world is filled with polarized opinions that cause arguments daily, and much of this is wasteful rather than productive because it assumes there are only two sides to any argument, when in actual fact there is often a multitude of opinions, ideas and solutions. Seek them all out, so as to be well informed and fully aware. Learn to spot the difference between serious thinking and blabbermouths. Always find out the facts before reaching conclusions about people, situations and incidents.


If your school doesn't cater to critical thinking, look for online courses from reputable universities and colleges that do. Take a course in your own time.

, Loving who you are and knowing that you're beautiful without having to change your body or yourself will help you to be more confident and self-assured.


Say who you are and be what you say! Realize that over time, you may well change considerably and it's called maturing––such personal growth is normal as you continue to learn more about yourself, other people and the world in general. You are always a work in progress, so be prepared to be a lifelong learner. If anyone suggests you are being fake or insincere for changing over time, be careful not to confuse this with the natural changes every person undergoes and someone who is actually fickle enough to constantly change their mind. These are two very different things.
Don't change for a boy, or to be friends with the ""popular girls."" Just be yourself. Make them like you for who you are. Not for you trying to act different. Just you! Any changes you do make should be made because you want to become the best that you can be, not because someone has criticized you.
Learn to understand other people's motives. Not everyone has sincere or genuine reasons for suggesting you be a certain way. People have many reasons that are about themselves, such as jealousy, fear, a sense of living through someone else, etc. Don't be afraid to probe other people's motivations and only accept criticism that is fair judgment and relevant to improving yourself.

, Being organized is key to being the best girl ever. Even the prettiest and happiest girls can be caught up in clutter. Lay out your clothes every morning, make your bed, keep your room clean, and always have the project that is due ready for the next day at school!

, This might be yoga, meditation, swimming laps of the pool, going for a walk, etc. Do whatever helps you to find a calm space amid the busyness of your life. This will allow you to cope with times of stress better, such as during exams or relationship breakups.


Relax. Daily meditation or affirmations can be useful for keeping you both relaxed and focused on the purpose that you've chosen for yourself.

, Be likeable by being best friends with everyone without preferring a clique. Try to be outgoing and happy, be a force for good around other people. Make friends, and stay busy. Not only will this make you the best, but it can increase your joy around other people and it can prevent stress.


Avoid gossiping and the gossips. It's fine to share information and news with one another but don't embellish it and turn it into mean, thoughtless and unkind words about other people. You wouldn't like it if somebody insulted you so don't do it back. Someone day, it'll get back to them and it could easily also be you.
Do not spread rumors––instead, stop such things in their tracks by demanding to know who would be so unkind to say such things and that you don't think there's an ounce of truth in secondhand news.
Be a defender. Defend people who are in the weaker position by stating the obvious, that the bullying, thoughtless or mean person is being unkind, lacking in manners and is lacking in the facts.

, Keep up with trends, you don't have to follow them though. Just keep up with what's going on, keep up with the drama in school, just don't participate in it. Knowing what's going on will allow you to have your finger on the pulse, to avoid the drama and to be on top of anything that might affect you.

, If you listen to them, they will appreciate your respect and will in turn listen to you as well. If you help your parents around the house and by being a good listener, they will treat you as responsible. This will benefit you greatly.

The vet will be able to tell if someone owns the cat if a microchip exists. The vet may also have notices of any missing cats you can check.


If the microchip doesn't exist or the owner cannot be traced this way: Leave a message on online sites that help people find lost cats. Take a digital photo and upload it, along with a short message about where and when you found the cat and any distinguishing markings. Auctions sites, animal welfare organization sites and even Twitter and Facebook can be great places to use for finding an owner.;
, In the meantime, care for the cat as you'd care for your own. If the cat does not have an owner, you will be able to adopt it.

, Get everything treated before keeping the cat.


Ask the vet about the cat's temperament. The vet will be a good source of advice as to whether or not a crotchety cat will be likely to calm down enough to be kept by you safely.

Be informed about the issues.,

Establish a board of directors.",How to Start a Non Profit Animal Rescue1," If you want to start a nonprofit animal rescue, the first step is being well informed about the issues. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the current dialogue surrounding animal care and rescue. You should also learn a bit about nonprofit management before starting your journey to forming a non-profit.


If you're passionate about animal welfare, you may already have some idea of what resources to seek out to educate yourself. Read the latest books and studies regarding animal welfare. You can seek out the newsletters of other organizations, such as HSUS, the ASPCA and Greenpeace, for an idea of current topics of concern.In addition to researching issues through reading, so some hands on searching as well. Visit a local rescue in your area. Talk to the managers, volunteers, and staff and ask them relevant questions about their experience. What's most important to them about the rescue they're working at now? What do they think their organization does best? Where do they think there's room for improvement? Is there a need that's not currently being met in your community? How could you fill that need through your own organization?Nonprofit management is a difficult subject in and of itself. Many states even have certification exams, lasting up to 3 hours, you must take before managing a nonprofit. Look into the regulations in your state. Consider reading up on nonprofit management. You should also consider higher education regarding the management of nonprofit organizations. Take a few courses online or at a local college.If you're not sure you have time to gain extra education in nonprofit management, consider teaming up with a friend with experience in the field. If you know someone who's itching to start his or her own nonprofit, approach this person about your desire to create an animal rescue. See if he or she would be willing to start the endeavor with you.;
, Every organization needs a solid mission statement. There are many different kinds of animal rescues. Drafting a brief mission statement can help you get a sense of what your organization will do. This can help you down the road with financial and hiring decisions.


A mission statement answers the questions, ""What exactly are we trying to do here?"" It should be brief, no more than one or two sentences. Use a clear and positive tone and avoid use of jargon and complicated terms the average person does not understand. Not only does your mission statement help you clarify your goals as a nonprofit, it can be used as a marketing tool later on.Read mission statements of other nonprofits you admire for brainstorming. Pay attention to the length, word choice, and goals used in these statements.Your mission statement is important so spend some time coming up with a good mission statement. You will need to use your mission statement filling out financial forms, many of which require a statement of purpose. As nonprofits rely heavily on donation to cover cost of operation, you'll also need a mission statement that helps rally support for your cause. Allow your passion to shine through., As stated, there are many different types of animal rescues. Take some time to lay out your goals so you know what direction you're taking in regards to your nonprofit rescue. Your goals will likely appear later on as you establish a web presence, so make sure they're easily readable for a wide audience.


What kind of rescue are you forming? What are you policies? Are you taking in animals rescued for testing facilities? Are you focusing mainly on domesticated pets, like cats and dogs, or adopting livestock? What is your policy on euthanasia? Are you hoping to find homes for animals through your rescue or provide a permanent sanctuary?To start writing your, focus on long-range goals and then work your way back to the present. Consider where you want to be in 10 years. What do you hope to accomplish in this timeframe? Then, work backwards. What are actions you can take to accomplish these goals?Once you've established short and long term goals, consider how you will accomplish them. Get into specifics here. Say you live in Michigan and want to help re-home abused and abandon pets in Detroit and hope to, in 10 years, have reduced the rate of stays in the city by 30%. In the short term, what actions can you start with? Should you start by spreading the word across the city about where to report abuse an abandonment? Should you establish a center within Detroit city limits where people can drop off strays within you first 2 years of operation? Try and take some time to consider specifics.Goals, much like your mission statement, are important marketing tools. People are far more likely to give you money if they know exactly where their funds are going. Being as transparent as possible about your company goals can help kickstart marketing and fundraising down the road., A nonprofit cannot run on its own. You will need a board of directs, which is a group of people who govern your organization. Your board of directors will help determine what direction your organization will take financially and ethically as well as look out for the nonprofit's legal well-being.You may already have a group of people in mind for your board of directors. If you're passionate about animal welfare, you may have already networked with likeminded individuals who you would be comfortable working with. However, if not there are plenty of ways to find board members in your area.There are two key components to consider when selecting a board: skills and talents you need for your organization. Identify what types of skills you need. For an animal rescue, people with legal skills, public relation skills, veterinary skills, and business skills. Start making a list of people to contact. Schedule meetings with potential board members to see if they would be a good fit for your organization.Usually, a board of directors should contain about 7 individuals. You may need more than that as your organization grows, but in the early stages stick to around this number."

Explore your motivations for wanting to start a dog rescue to be sure it's something you really want to do.,
Study the area in which you live to learn about the population of homeless dogs before you start a dog rescue.

,
Determine how much support you might get in your area for your dog rescue organization.,
Interview the volunteers at other dog shelters and rescue organizations to learn from those with experience what starting dog rescues is like.

,
Organize a group of people who are willing to do various volunteer activities to help with your dog rescue organization.,
Decide where you want run your dog rescue organization, whether it includes using temporary foster homes to house the dogs or building a shelter.

,
Prepare all of the necessary paperwork including a mission statement outlining the mission of your dog rescue organization to get ready to file for tax exempt or 501 (c) 3 status.

,
Hire a professional, either an attorney or accountant, to file for your tax exempt status.,
Raise funds to support your dog rescue efforts by holding a variety of fundraisers and by applying for grants.

",How to Start a Dog Rescue,"


Rescuing dogs can be quite rewarding. However, starting your own dog rescue organization will also be expensive, time consuming and often emotionally draining when you become aware of the countless numbers of dogs in need.
Start by talking to the staff of pounds, shelters and animal control organizations in your area to get an idea about the numbers of dogs and their needs.;
,,


Local veterinarians, dog trainers and pet sitters are good contacts to start with to get an idea how receptive your area might be to a dog rescue organization. These contacts also might give you leads to obtaining a network of helpers and volunteers.
Those who work in the business can advise you from first-hand experience about the problems and pit falls of dog rescue.

,,


This is vital, because dog rescuers have many tasks to meet the needs of the dogs.
These include fundraising, transporting, fostering, feeding, walking and providing basic dog care.
Both have options have pros and cons. Fosters must be ready to deal with all of the issues that can arise from keeping dogs in their homes. If you have the money it takes to build a shelter, it must meet specific codes and pass certain government inspections.
Many dog rescues rely on loving foster families to temporarily house homeless dogs, while others build a kennel-type facility.

,,,


This is difficult to do without professional assistance. In addition, 501 (c) 3 tax exempt status protects you and your organization and allows you to raise charitable funds to pay for your needs.
Having enough money on hand to support your dog rescue efforts is key to making sure the dogs' needs are met and that your dog rescue stays fiscally sound.

Find things you have in common with people in each group.,
Be realistic.,
Be sincere.,
Enjoy the company of others.",How to Be the Girl Everyone Likes Without Changing Who You Are," This cliché is often stated but it's based in the reality that without knowing who you are. Stay yourself because if you're a follower people will take advantage of you. This can lead to shaping yourself to fit in with them and it can also leave you open to being manipulated by selfish or uncaring sorts. It takes time to grow into your own skin, so don't fret about not knowing yourself yet; indeed, it's an ongoing process because a healthy person remains flexible and accepting of personal change. Being yourself is important for some of the following reasons:


It allows you to follow your own path and to be guided by good advice, not swayed by people with bad intentions. You can change on your own terms, because as hard as it sounds you can forget who you are.
It means that you can handle criticism from other people. It doesn't mean you don't have feelings; rather, you understand better that unless people have decent advice to offer, their barbs are not worth taking on board.
You know what you want from life and won't be willing to change who you are just to fit in with someone else's plans or likes. You are free to reach negotiated compromises that don't leave you any worse off, in the spirit of sharing and getting along with others, but you don't compromise who you are.;
, Value the dignity of other people around you and accept differences. Being liked by many people is about showing a genuine interest in them for who they are and making it clear that you're not judgmental. Show interest openly by asking questions about things they care about or are interested and making an attempt to remember what they tell you. When you see them again, ask how whatever it is they like is going, to show them you've cared enough to remember and follow up.


Avoid judging people by appearances. Give people a second chance if you feel instant discomfort around them; maybe they need someone like you to reach out and let them be heard. This will get you another friend.

, Remember to stay sincere though. If everyone only listens to rock but you only like it sometimes, make sure you tell them that. It's most likely that they will value you even more for ""freshness"" you bring to their clique.

, Not everyone will like you, no matter who you are or how you come across. There are many reasons for this but this reality is never a reason for you to put yourself down or feel unwanted. You may never know why some people choose to dislike you, and even if you do know, it's just one of those things and not a reason to feel less worthy or to try to change to fit in with them. Leave them be it's their loss anyway. Sometimes they'll come around when they realize you really aren't affected by their put downs or choice to ignore you, so stay strong. Aim to not care about their attitude but still respect their dignity as a person. This includes staying polite and helpful and not spreading rumors or being mean towards them.

, Changing what you think or believe in for each clique will quickly earn you a bad reputation, as people compare notes and realize you've been pretending to like all sorts of things and it soon becomes clear you've been stretching the truth somewhat. When seeking to be liked, do not seek to simply say what you think others want to hear or mistake being liked with being the exact same as the others. You can show sincere interest but that doesn't mean you have to agree with or like the same things. Learn how to politely say that you find the other person's point of view, approach or hobbies interesting but that they're not your personal way. This is being sincere––showing genuine interest in the person, listening carefully but not leading them into thinking you have the same viewpoint or interest.


For example: Jenny tells Alice that she loves going to movies every weekend. Alice personally thinks this is both expensive and a waste of time. Rather than saying ""Yeah, I love the movies every weekend too!"", Alice says: ""That sounds like a really cool way to enjoy your weekend. I am sure you know lots of movie trivia––it'd be great to have you on our quiz team for the movies section! I only see movies about two to three times a year, I just find I'm so busy with other things."" In this way, Jenny's interest in movies is validated as a good thing to do, Alice has shown interest and made it clear that she's appreciative of the interest but doesn't do the same thing herself. Jenny might offer to tag along when Alice does want to go to the movies some day but she won't expect Alice to come to the movies every weekend now!

, Don't turn wanting to be liked into a chore or your destiny. Instead, seek to be friendly to all and to want to have fun around people. Getting to know people, learning about them and spending time with them is a hobby in itself and if you enjoy people's company, this will be reflected in your actions, your smile and your whole demeanor.

, The students who do best are the hardworking ones—so cultivate a strong work ethic. If you can't figure out something by yourself, find someone who can help.


Raise your hand in class to ask questions.
Talk to your teacher or tutor outside of class.
Ask a parent, friend, or older sibling to help you with a concept.

, Nobody can work to their peak performance when they're tired and burned out. Make sure you take the time out of studying and school work to get some decent sleep, and take study breaks between big bouts of focused time.

, Everyone needs an outlet from their school or work. Whatever healthy ""de-stressors"" you enjoy in life, make time for them. Join a sports team, do some yoga, go hiking, read a book, do some art, or watch a good movie; whatever you need to do to help combat stress, make time for it.

, It's easy to forget about your health and hygiene, but kick-starting your young adult years with good habits sets you up for a healthy future, and is overall a smart choice. Get regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, and maintain good hygiene.

, Nobody out there has all the answers, but part of making smart choices as a teen can come down to getting input from your parents and mentors. Will they always know what to do? No. But they may have advice for you as you tackle difficult decisions, particularly if they've faced similar situations before. Be open to input from others to help you make smart choices both in your day-to-day life and in planning your future.

, All smart people make mistakes. It doesn't make them unintelligent. Being hardworking is what counts in the long run, and bouncing back will bode well for your future.

Let go of childish behavior you still have.,
Make independent decisions.,
Like the things you like.,
Respect authority figures, without needing their constant approval.,
Seek out constructive criticism.,
Develop goals and stick to them.,
Don’t blame others for your mistakes; own them.",How to Become an Adult3," Recognize if you have these common tendencies and work on changing them through simple intention, mental exercises, or therapy:


Sulking, whining, or complaining,
Manipulat­ing others to get sympathy
Continually seeking direction from others
Acting in a disorganized or irresponsible way
Procrastinating, carelessness, and frequently being late
Driving recklessly, or acting without regard to yours or others’ health and safety., Make choices in your life, whether they’re about colleges, jobs, relationships, or goals, because they are important to you and make you happy, not because your parents, friends, or other people tell you that you should.

, It may sound obvious, but just own up to the things you genuinely enjoy and that make you happy. If you like a band that most people you know would deem corny or outdated, don’t make excuses or say that you like them in an ironic, joking way; just enjoy them., Let go of any tendency to rebel against or defy those older than you or in a superior position. Listen respectfully to those above you, and know that just because you’re an adult doesn’t mean you don’t have to listen to others. On the other hand, don’t do everything you do just to seek approval of superiors in your school, work, or social life.


For example, if your boss or teacher tells you a report is due, listen and respond by completing the report on time. But don’t come back to your boss/teacher after every section of the report is done to seek his or her praise or approval before you can move on to the next step.

, Listen to and even seek out feedback from teachers, peers, bosses, coworkers, and others in your life, without jumping straight into defending yourself.


First, listen carefully to everything the person has to say about you or your performance. Then, decide which parts of their feedback you agree or disagree with, and what could be helpful to you. Finally, respond to them with mature and genuine questions, concerns, and thanks., Make goals that are both readily attainable (such as “Make a new friend this week” or “Go somewhere you’ve never been”) and more long-term (such as “Become a chef in a 5-star restaurant” or “Save enough money for a house”). Write your goals down to keep them in your mind, and reward yourself every time you attain one.

, When something goes wrong, avoid blaming other people or circumstances for the problem. Instead, follow this process to recognizing your mistakes without shame and using them to create better circumstances:


Acknowledge when you’ve made a mistake
Do whatever is possible to correct it
Think of how you can prevent it from happening again
Come up with a mantra or a phrase to repeat in your head to avoid shame, such as, “It’s over and it won’t happen again.”"

Look in the right places.,
Know how to attract different types of animals.,
Once you have an animal in your zoo, check its body to see if it is hurt in any way.,
Know what to do when a new animal comes along.",How to Start a Pet Shelter in Your Own Home2," Want to have animals in your animal center, but don't know where they are or how to attract them? Well, it depends what you want and where you live. If you live in a forest area, look for animals in a nearby bush or on a tree. If you live in a grassland area or field area, look for animals in holes and big grassy patches. If you live in a snowy area, dig up some snow and a small layer of dirt to find creatures.

, For a basic home animal center, some known attractions are:


Bunnies-carrots
Deer-fruit and roses
Squirrels-nuts
Garter snakes-worms and plenty of grass
Bugs- plants and compost
Birds-bird seed and trees

, If the answer is no, then put it in a box and add some water, food, and grass, then put a lid on it. If the answer is yes, then wipe it with a safe wipe and put something like a towel around the animal, and then leave it to relax. You may also want to wash the animal if it is bleeding.

, If you are looking after an animal and another comes along and you have no hired help, what should you do? Here are some answers:


If the current animal is healthy and the new animal is healthy, then put down the current animal in a box and get the new one. Do the same if the current animal is healthy and the new one isn't.
If the current animal is sick and the new one isn't, then you must decide if it is common. If the new animal is common in your area, leave it. If not, you must decide if the current animal is fine alone for a minute or not.
If both animals are sick, then you have to decide which is more important to you and which is more sick or unhealthy. If you experience this, try looking in your area for a friend nearby that is good with animals and ask them if they would like to help with your animal center.

Get the needed supplies.,
Leave your new cat alone at first.,
Set out some food and water.,
Talk when you enter the room and leave new food.,
Take your stray cat to the vet frequently for checkups.",How to Take in a Stray Cat2," Once you bring the stray cat home, get some supplies. All you need is a food and water bowl, a scratching post and litter box (and litter material).

, Choose a safe, small area that can be closed off. Choose a place that has nothing precarious that could fall on the cat and avoid any rooms with too many hiding spots, or you may never find the cat again.

, The cat will come out and eat it when it is good and ready.

, When your cat gets braver, it will start to associate your voice with good things. In time, the cat will not hide anymore but will likely be curious about you and come forth a little more each time.

, Being a stray, you cannot be sure what your cat has been exposed to in the past, so regular checkups are important.

Be flexible about the cat's choice of favorite person in its new household.",How to Take in a Stray Cat3," Strays tend to get attached to one person, not everybody. Most likely, that will be you because you're feeding it and caring for it directly. Don't be surprised if the cat runs off when introduced to new people, including household members. Give the cat plenty of time to get used to everyone. In some cases, the cat will never be happy with anyone but you, but may tolerate others from a distance. It depends on the cat's prior experiences and how other people react around it.

Take it slowly.,
Offer treats straight from your hand.,
Play with the cat often.,
Talk to the cat all the time you're around it.",How to Take in a Stray Cat4," It will be a while before the cat feels comfortable in your home. It will take even longer if you have other pets and/or loud, noisy householders. Patience is a virtue when it comes to reassuring a scaredy cat.

, This can build a touch and smell bond between both of you, plus it's a good reminder for the cat that you equal yummy food.

, Play in a respectful manner, noticing when the play is scaring or annoying the cat, and backing off. Follow the cat's cues, not what you wish the cat would do.

, This will build trust in your voice and helps the cat to listen for you if it gets into any bother, knowing that you're trustworthy.

Call your Secretary of State's office.,
Talk to the IRS.,
Research by laws.,
Define your organization's policies and standards.,
Look into zoning and building issues.",How to Start a Non Profit Animal Rescue2," Legality varies from state-to-state in regards to establishing a nonprofit. The best way to answer any questions you have is to phone your secretary of state's office and ask them about legal issues.


In most states, you'll need to register the name of your nonprofit. Forms vary, but you can get information about the right form for you by talking to a representative at the Secretary of State's office. There may be some fees depending on where you live. Chose a name that's unique and reflects your mission statement.When starting a nonprofit, there are many forms you must fill out at both a national and state level. These forms legally establish the fact your business raises funds for operating costs alone and may entitle you and your board members to certain tax exemptions down the road. Ask the representative where to get the proper forms and how to file them.Ask about any existing regulations in your state. You want to make sure everything is squared away before beginning to fundraise, hire employees, and advertise your nonprofit., There are a variety of tax forms you need to fill out when establishing a nonprofit. These forms once again reiterate the fact your organization does not operate for profit. You must fill out forms at both the state and local level. To figure out what forms you need to fill out, call the IRS at 800-TAX FORM. You can also visit www.irs.gov., Bylaws are essentially your organization's operating manual. Established by your board of directors, bylaws establish legal, business, fundraising, and fund allocation proceedings for your nonprofit.Your nonprofit's bylaws must be in compliance with the state and federal government's regulations regarding nonprofit operation and management. Do some research to assure your company's bylaws are in accordance with the law.


Your local law library will likely have documents related to bylaw regulations for your state and on the national level. Ask a librarian for assistance if you need help location relevant legal books and documents.It may be a good idea to hire a lawyer during this process. Bylaws can be confusing if you do not have experience reading legal documents. If you have someone on the board of directors with experience in law, ask this person if he or she would be willing to look over bylaw regulations for you., You need to establish transparent policies and standards for your organization and then share them with everyone involved. Keep in mind as your organization grows and changes, policies and standards will as well.


Policies and standards should outline expectations for members, staff, and volunteers of your organization. People work together more successfully when they understand shared goals and values.Your policies are the types of services you provide, protocol for veterinary care, and individuals allowed to provide care to animals in your rescue. Standards include the expectations for how these policies will be carried out.You should draft a 5 to 10 page document outlining your policies and standards. Share this with everyone involved in the organization so your goals are clear. This can minimize the misunderstandings that sometimes lead to tension in an organization., You will likely need space to operate your nonprofit. You'll need to select a suitable location and then figure out how to legally obtain said location for your organization.


The type of land you'll need depends on what kind of rescue you're building. If you're taking in mainly domestic animals, like dogs and cats, you'll need some kind of building. If you're focused on livestock, farm land is necessary. You'll need to consult real estate and legal experts here who can help point you to the right land and help you watch out for common mistakes and pitfalls when selection a location.Look into local zoning laws. Zoning laws outline what land can be used for in a given area. If there are zoning laws that affect you're ability to operate a nonprofit in a given space, you may have to select a different property. However, you can also consult a lawyer to check for any legal loopholes.If you're purchasing a building, keep in mind most buildings will need to be adapted for your use. Try to talk to a contractor to get an estimated legal cost of repairs and renovations you'll need for your purposes.If you're hoping to help families and individuals adopt animals through your rescue, look for a building that's easily accessible to the general public. Consider things like parking, traffic, and what kinds of establishments surround your area."

Cultivate public support.,
Start a membership program.,
Make phone calls.,
Send e-mails and direct mail.,
Establish an accounting system.",How to Start a Non Profit Animal Rescue3," To operate a nonprofit, you'll need to raise funds. The first step to finding donors is to make an effort to cultivate public support for your organization. Here is where your mission statement and goals will come in handy.


Host a public meeting to talk about your organization's goals and plans. Advertise this meeting through press releases, newspaper articles, social media outreach, and paper advertisements. Explain what your organization hopes to accomplish and why at your first public meeting.Develop an online presence. As you begin to publicize your nonprofit, it's vital to develop a web presence. You want people to be able to locate your website for more information. There are many sites that provide website templates and allow you to operate a website for free or a small price.Create a mailing list. Compile a list of animal-loving friends and colleagues. Ask them to suggest additional people to add to your list. Ask people to provide their e-mail and physical address when hosting your first public meeting. When you begin setting out requests for donations, you'll have a list on hand to pull form.Contact the media. Hit up local newspapers and radio or TV shows. Send out press releases. A short human interest interest segment on the nightly news can do wonders for gaining support for your organization., A membership program can help support operating costs of your nonprofit. Members are not the same thing as board members in that they do not get voting power. They are simply regular donors for the organization.


You can make your membership program as simple or complex as you want. Some membership programs offer benefits for members, like special prizes like tote bags or water bottles. Other nonprofits simply ask members to donate because they believe in the cause. How you execute a membership program is up to you.To recruit members, send out pamphlets and other publications explaining what you're doing for animals and why. Explain any benefits or perks of membership. If you have different levels of membership (such as gold, silver, and bronze) explain what each level entails., Sometimes simple phone calls are a great way to raise funds. Have board members phone people on your mailing list and ask for donations. Keep in mind many people are wary about giving money over the phone, so prepare for setbacks and resistance., Once again, go to your mailing list. Use this to send out e-mails and letters asking for money. Have a simple means to donate online. A GoFundMe page can work well, as well as a section of your own website where people can easily donate. You can provide addressed envelops in letters so people can easily mail in checks to your organization.

, The first step to dealing with your organization's money is to establish some kind of accounting system. A good system will document income and expenses in easily understandable categories.


It's a good idea to hire a bookkeeper or accountant at this stage. If you do not have familiarity regulating money, a qualified accountant can help you decide how to allocate funds.Create a budget. Based on your goals, needs, and current funds decide how the money you've earned will be allocated in the coming financial year. Once again, a qualified accountant or bookkeeper can help with this process.Establishing an accounting system is vital to a nonprofit. Not only does it help board members have a clear understanding of how money is being spent, the IRS requires you put together a budget to prove your nonprofit status."

Select a volunteer staff.,
Hire any necessary professionals.,
Hire other staff members.,
Establish a training program for volunteers and staff.",How to Start a Non Profit Animal Rescue4," Volunteers are the backbone to any nonprofit. They keep your organization running smoothly. However, as volunteers are not paid dedication is sometimes an issue. Spend some time recruited solid, hardworking volunteers.


Appoint one board member to head volunteer recruitment. Select someone with past experience in nonprofit or volunteer management. Provide written descriptions of what volunteer duties will entail.Be active in seeking out volunteers. Rather than waiting for people to come to you, look for likeminded people with the skills you desire and reach out to them. Go to local college and recruit people from zoology and veterinary programs. Visit existing animal shelters and see if anyone's looking for supplementary volunteer experience., If you're operating an animal rescue, you'll need to staff some professionals for a small salary. Keep your eye out for skilled professionals looking to work in the nonprofit field.


Most rescues require at least one staff veterinarian. Local vets are often willing to part time discount services for non-profits.If you're hoping to rehabilitate animals, you may need trained wildlife or livestock zoologists to assess behavioral problems in abused animals.If you're hoping to re-home animals as pets, you may need to hire a team of animal trainers. Dogs and cats that come from abusive backgrounds may have behavioral problems that require professional training to work out., In addition to professionals, you'll need staff members to maintain basic operation of your facility. Things like clerical work, manual labor, repairs, and janitorial work will all require staff. Keep a portion of your budget open to pay janitors, repairmen, secretaries, and other basic operational staff members., You need to train your volunteers and staff. Make sure they have a clear understanding of your policies and standards and know how to efficiently accomplish any required tasks.


Anyone providing hands-on animal care should undergo a training program first. You can consult with the professionals you've hired for advice on training volunteers.You should make sure staff and volunteers are familiar with general animal health-care information as well as the basics of handling animals safely.Make training a priority. If you want your organization to run smoothly, you need to make sure volunteers and staff are well-trained and know how to safely interact with a variety of animals."

Once your zoo has at least a few animals in it, tell your friends about it!",How to Start a Pet Shelter in Your Own Home3," Remember, if the animal center is at your home, then it is not a good idea to post about it on the internet. Home zoos are not something everyone worldwide should come to visit. However, if you would like visitors, put posters up in covered places in your neighborhood."

Set up a tank for your African Dwarf Frogs.,
If you intend to have an unfiltered tank like a goldfish bowl, 1–2 gallons (3.8–7.6 L) per frog is ideal so you will not need to change the tanks water every couple of days.,
A filter is a must.,
Use gravel or sand as a substrate, 1 inch thick (2 cm), or enough so when you push down with your finger you cannot feel the bottom.,
Use live or frozen food, such as bloodworms, and brine shrimp.,
Cleaning the frog's tank once a week will ensure health.,
Provide hiding places such as small terracotta pots, logs, plants and moss.,
Use real or fake plants.,
Water should be around 70-75 F. Use mini water heaters if necessary with caution.,
Young African Dwarf Frogs prefer to be housed in groups.,
African dwarf frogs (ADFs) are often mistaken for African clawed frogs (ACFs), but the two are very different from each other.",How to Care for African Dwarf Frogs," They can live peacefully with some types of fish and snails that live in water.;
, Otherwise, you need to have some method of filtering to avoid toxic ammonia from the frogs waste to build up. African Dwarf frogs do not need a lot of space. In nature, these frogs evolved in very shallow small pools of rainforest swamp-water. They do not school like fish, preferring instead a safe, quiet, predator-free world with plenty of places along the bottom to hide. As long as there is an effective filtering system, any size shallow tank will do. Also, make sure the tank has no gaps in the top as many frogs have escaped and sadly died.

, In nature, African Dwarf Frogs live in water depths shallower than 7-8"" deep. Deeper water depths can add stress to African Dwarf Frogs who live on the bottom, yet must swim to the surface to breathe. While African Dwarf Frogs can co-exist with tropical fish in an aquarium, in doing so, always set up your tank for the needs of fish, not frogs in mind. African Dwarf Frogs can tolerate water conditions that can be toxic to fish.

,


If you use rocks or pebbles, be absolutely sure that the rocks aren't too big. African Dwarfs can easily get trapped under a rock and suffocate. However, do include some structure along the bottom of the tank, some nook or cranny, where the frog can hide. African Dwarf Frogs are sensitive to vibrations & movement, and will often seek the security of a confined space in an instinctive quest to avoid predators. Simply be sure the frogs cannot get trapped. On the other hand , make sure the gravel is not too small because African dwarf frogs may accidentally swallow some gravel and could potentially die.

, You can also feed them commercial frog pellets. Variety is healthy. Do not feed freeze dried food because it may cause bloating. Be sure to remove any uneaten food after ten minutes. You may also feed them sinking pellets if its a must, but be sure to put them  on a plate first so they are easily found

, Do partial water changes weekly to stabilize the ph and remove any nitrites/ nitrates. Remove about twenty percent of the water and replace with de chlorinated tap water .

, Household mugs also make a good hiding spot for your frogs. 

, Make sure that the fake plants are silk, not plastic. Hard plastic plants will scratch and cut their bodies. If you would like real plants make sure you meet the requirements of those as well.

, Monitor water temperatures closely if you use any heater.

, Older mature frogs prefer a solitary existence except during breeding season. Males housed together won't fight; however, males and females may breed. Female Frogs are the more dominant of the species, more aggressive & hungrier during breeding time.

, ACFs grow to be much, much bigger than ADFs, possibly reaching the size of a softball in adulthood. ACFs will eat almost any fish (or frog) that they can fit in their mouths, so they should not be kept with ADFs. ACFs can carry diseases that are fatal to ADFs. ACFs have no webbing on their front feet, so they have long claws (if you see small black claws on an ADFs back feet, don't be worried; they are supposed to have these). ACFs can also be good pets, but be sure to research them and accommodate their needs in a separate place from fish and ADFs.

Make a career in wildlife conservation!,
Lend your helping hands by volunteering for NGOs.",How to Save Animals by Participating in Indian Wildlife Conservation Projects," Your awareness is very important. For taking an active participation in the conservation of the wildlife, you should first be aware of the status of wildlife in India. You should also know what threats are being faced by Indian wildlife. Internet and various publications media are the means through which you can stay informed about different projects for wildlife conservation. There are many efforts that are being made to save wildlife, some of which are in the form of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in India. For instance, you should know that wildlife conservation in India first started with Jim Corbett National Park. The up-to-date information about these conservation projects can also be obtained from the local wildlife organizations.;
, You should not buy products that are made from the parts of the body of a wild animal. Your smart consumption will decrease the demand for the items made from the rare wild species. By purchasing items like meat, souvenirs, leather items, etc, you may unintentionally stimulate illegal wildlife traffic.

, Recycling and reusing goods reduce the negative effect on the environment. Moreover, decreasing the energy consumption also decreases the load off the natural resources. The environmental balance saves the habitats of the wild animals.

, Although pesticides and herbicides may be helpful for the preservation of crops but it is harmful for wild animals. These preservatives are especially hazardous for the amphibians. The wild animals suffer a lot because of the presence of preservatives in their habitat.

, Once you have acquired sound knowledge about wildlife conservation, disseminate what you have learned among the people. You can organize events to enlighten people about the importance of conserving wildlife and ways to save endangered species. You can also write letters to editors. You may file petitions to the leaders for saving wildlife, if you see anything that may compromise wildlife safety. To strengthen you voice in support of animal safety, you may start writing blogs on, say, the importance of conservation.Pictures can speak louder than words. Use graphics, illustration, photographs and images to spread awareness. You can even host a photography exhibition highlighting the gracious cause of wildlife conservation. This effort will help to prevent the barbaric poaching of wild animals and is a helping hand for the preservation of animals.

, Money is an important factor in the conservation effort. You can also help save animals by raising funds or donating money to the various organizations working to save the animals. To collect donation money, you can organize various fundraising campaigns at your school, colony, etc. By following methods, you can raise money for donating-


You can ask people to donate money during family celebrations such as birthdays, wedding, etc.
You can organize various events to collect money like a sale, an exhibition and so on; or you may also take part in a marathon held for wildlife conservation.
You can encourage your colleagues to make it a habit of donating money from their payroll for wildlife conservation.

, Wildlife in India is in deep crisis and thus it requires the participation of more and more people for its success. Hence, choosing a career in it will be a major step towards saving these animals. A career in this sector is indeed challenging and exciting. Although, there is not very well-paid job opportunities but it gives immense satisfaction of doing a noble deed.

, There are several N.G.Os that offer volunteer programs in wildlife conservation. The range of these programs incorporates working with animals, helping in wildlife events, saving animals in need, cleaning the wildlife habitats. It is a great way to participate in wildlife conservation projects effectively. One can find a list of the numerous events being held for the conservation of the fortune creatures of nature.

There needs to be a person at the cash register, people finding stray cats, and if you'd like, people could be passing out updates and news along the streets., Buy cat supplies as well for the customers to take too. Make sure there is an appropriate amount of space for your cats and supplies., For example, Saturdays and Sundays only or from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. Put a sign up that states whatever time you are going to start and end. Make sure the whole group has time for it and agrees on it.

Try doing it at a time when people are most active so more people will come.

, Make sure they aren't rabid or have any diseases. Trap them in safe traps and put them in a carrier to take to a vet. After a checkup, give the cat a bath or parasite medication in case they have fleas, worms, etc.


Help each cat to be healthy before giving them away or selling them. That's what a pet rescue is about, after all. That way, more animals won't get sick from the cat, and people will want to buy it.

, Then the city animal control would pick up the animal to be euthanized.


Ask about free and reduced cost services - there are vets in the USA who specialize in vaccinating, neutering and spaying at a reduced price in a program supported by grants and donations. And, then only in the case that a cat is brought there in a safe trap early (about 7:00AM), it will be vaccinated and spayed or neutered free of charge (or for a small fee) and must be picked up between 3:00-3:30PM. But, if they are not picked up on time there is a fee - and if they not picked up by a set deadline, then they will be turned over to an animal shelter (adopted-out or euthanized according to their rules).

, Make sure the price isn't to low or too high. Put a price tag onto each cat's carrier or cage., Be proud of yourself for the hard work you've done."

This can help you more effectively catch a salamander or many of them without harming the animal.Contact your local county extension to help identify salamanders in your local area. Some facts to know about salamanders you should learn are:


they are completely harmless to people and plants
most don’t grow beyond 6 inches
they are smooth-skinned
they live in moist places like under rocks, logs, and in mulch.healthy salamanders will be skittish around humans.;
, It can be fairly easy to trap salamanders in ponds or near other bodies of water. By putting together trapping materials before you start, you can effectively catch your salamander(s). You’ll need the following items:


24 ft. of 18 inch wide aluminum window screening or 15 ft. of 28 inch wide screening for the cylinders
15 ft. of 36 inch wide fiberglass screening for the funnels
25 ft. of string or small rope for the handles
Utility knife and scissors for cutting the screen and rope
Stapler with 1000 staplesA small fish net if you want to catch or other container, such as a jar with some water in it. Make sure it has holes in the lid so the salamander can breathe.
A glow stick or outdoor light bulb, which studies have shown can be an effective bait for trapping amphibians., Although you can purchase commercially made funnel traps for salamanders, they may not be as effective as traps you make yourself. Using the material you gathered, put together your funnel trap and place it in the water to catch your new pets.Cut a rectangular piece of aluminum window screening using the scissors or utility knife for the cylinders.Roll the cut piece of screening into a cylinder 18” long and 8” in diameter. Leave a 1” lip on the top of the cylinder by holding the 18” end and rolling it towards the other end.Staple the 1” screening lip along the base of the lip where it meets the cylinder screening to hold the cylinder and lip together.Cut out two funnels from the fiberglass screening with a 9” opening on the wide end, and 1 ¾” opening on the narrow end of each piece.Roll the wide ends of the funnels over the outside edges of the cylinder and staple every ½” with the stapler.Attach a 30” string handle to the lip and attach it with duct tape to both ends of the 1” aluminum lip., Most salamanders live and breed near water because their skin requires moisture.Where you place your funnel trap will depend on the time of year, since many salamanders burrow in the winter.Find a stagnant, or non-flowing, water source like a swamp, pond, or vernal pool.Place the trap near the bottom of a pond in the winter.Put the trap by burrows and wooded areas in the late spring and early summer. Make sure these are close to stagnant bodies of water as well., Within twenty-four hours of setting your traps, see if you’ve caught any salamanders. You may also capture species other than salamanders and can return these to the wild. If the trap is empty, leave it in place and continue to check until you find a salamander.


Take a plastic bag or jar with pinholes or a bucket of water to catch and transfer your salamander to its new habitat.

, If you choose to actively net a salamander instead of using funnel traps, find them in the same places where you would set traps. Consider using a glow stick to attract salamanders into your net.Wear a pair of waders or tall water proof pants so you can walk out into water.
Sweep the net through the water by holding the net from the handle. Run the net, hoop first, through the water down-angled into the muck at the bottom of the pond or stream.

, When you catch a salamander, check its health before you take it home to its new habitat. This can ensure that it doesn’t die or introduce diseases to a currently salamander colony you have.The following traits indicate a healthy salamander:


Plump but not bloated
No visible bones in the rib, abdominal, or hip area
Clear skin with no cuts, scratches, or discolored patches
Clear and alert eyes
No secretions or inflammation., If you have an established colony of salamanders, quarantine your new animals for a few weeks. This can ensure that they are healthy and don’t wipe out any other animals with disease.Be aware that fungal infections are very common in salamanders and often fatal.Keep quarantined animals in buckets or, ideally, in separate aquariums., As adorable as salamanders are, it is very important to not handle them unless absolutely necessary, such as transferring the animal to its new habitat. Secretions, salt and heat from human skin or substances on it can harm salamanders.Wash your hands in hot and soapy water before handing the salamander.Make sure to remove any soap residue from your skin so you don’t harm your salamander.Transferring or touching your salamander with a small net is the best way to not harm it., Once you’ve checked the health of your salamander, you are ready to move her to her new habitat. Giving her a clean and fun environment may help her live for up to 20 years.Your habitat should include:


a clean aquarium large enough to accommodate all of your salamanders
two to three inches of sloped and washed aquarium gravel to line the tank
plants that have been washed so they don’t introduce diseases or fungi to the salamanders
a sufficient source of sunlight
a water filter
a lid., All species of salamanders are carnivores but may eat their meals very slowly.Salamanders eat different types of animals depending on their size; larger salamanders will go for larger prey. Give your salamander food on alternate days five days a week.These foods can include:


earthworms or wax worms
slugs
snails
crickets
frozen brine
Mysis shrimp
fish
crayfish
mice
shrewsspiders
centipedes., Salamander enclosures are havens for bacteria and fungi.Keep your salamander’s aquarium very clean to maintain her health and prevent the growth of harmful organisms.Place a water filter in the aquarium to keep the water clean between more thorough disinfection.Disinfect the aquarium with hot, soapy water every couple of weeks or more often if you notice it is dirty. Transfer the salamanders to holding tanks while you’re cleaning.
Make sure to rinse the aquarium thoroughly so any residue doesn’t harm your salamander., If you’ve got multiple salamanders in a habitat, they may reproduce.Keep an eye out for salamander eggs under the water in the tank or on ground surfaces.Be aware that many salamanders go through egg, large, juvenile, and adult life stages.Some species, however, will hatch directly into small salamanders.Capture eggs or larva in a small net and release them into the wild if you don’t want to keep the babies.

These glass enclosures allow you to observe your salamander closely as well as being very sturdy and reliable. The tank will need a secure wire mesh for the lid to allow a free circulation of air.One adult tiger salamander will need a 10-gallon tank. The dimensions of this will be approximately 50x25cm, or 20x30 inches.
Two salamanders require a 20-gallon tank (73x30cm/29x12 inches). Do not house two males together or they might fight.Tigers are often best kept individually.The surface area of the tank, that is the length x width, is more important than the height.
A cheaper alternative to an aquarium tank is a plastic storage tub with a tightly fitted lid. If you opt for this you will have to drill plenty of small holes to enable the circulation of air.;
, You should get a good substrate that will prevent desiccation and enable your salamander to do some burrowing. It should be at least 4 inches or 10cm deep. You should get a substrate that retains some moisture, but doesn't become muddy, or dry out. It should also be able to break down some organic matter, such as uneaten food and faeces.


Good substrates include organic top soil which is free from chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides. Coco-fiber is another good choice. A mix of the two is recommended.
You should avoid peat moss, or soil mixtures that contain peat moss. These are often acidic and can lead to your salamander becoming ill.
Similarly, you should always avoid using gravel or pine or cedar chips., Tiger salamanders will like to have places to hide in their habitat. You should provide two hides on each side of the tank. They should be dark and secure, and can be easily fashioned using pieces of cork bark. You can also buy commercially produced coconut halves which make excellent hides.Alternatively, you can just turn an empty plant pot on its side.


You can introduce plants and stones to create a more varied and stimulating environment. Your tiger will want around and explore his surroundings.
If you introduce anything from outside, such as stones or branches, you need to sanitise them first. Soak them in chlorine/water solution, rinse thoroughly, soak in clean water, and then allow them to dry naturally.Fake plants available from pet stores are a more straightforward option.

, Compared to some other reptiles, it is relatively straightforward to provide the appropriate temperature and lighting for good health. Tigers will do well kept at a temperature of around 77 Fahrenheit, or 22 Celsius, or a little lower. In captivity they generally tolerate lower temperatures better than they do higher ones. Sustained exposure to temperatures over 78°F (25.5°C) can be stressful and harmful.Tiger salamanders don't need additional UV lighting like some other reptiles.As long as the salamander has exposure to ambient light during the day, and is in a dark environment during the night, you should not need to make any further provisions., Salamanders are carnivores. They are attracted to prey by its movement. They will hunt for food and it can be interesting to watch them feed, and they will most often just ignore already dead prey and food pellets.Because of this, you will need to feed your tiger with a varied diet of insects every day. Good food choices include meal worms, crickets, earthworms, flour beetles, caterpillars and moths. Try feeding your salamander 3 or 4 insects in one session each day.


Your salamander may get insufficient calcium and vitamins from the insects. You should guard against this by dusting the live food with calcium and vitamin supplements once a week.Crickets are a particularly poor source of calcium so don't rely on these too much.You can feed your salamander an occasional pinkie mouse, but keep this irregular as your salamander can easily become obese if he has regular mice., Your tiger salamander will need access to water in the air which he will absorb through his skin. You should provide a water dish that your salamander can climb into that is large enough for him move around in, but still shallow. The water should be changed daily and the bowl kept clean. If you are using a heat bulb, ensure the water bowl is on the opposite side of the enclosure.As well as a water bowl, you will need to mist the enclosure by spraying water into it. This will help maintain the environment and provide more water for your tiger.
There is no fixed amount amount that you should mist your enclosure, but monitor the substrate, and mist when it looks to be losing moisture.Misting a few times a week will often be enough.You can provide a variety of different levels of moisture in different parts of the enclosure and allow the salamander to seek out the environment it wants at that moment., You should spot clean the enclosure every day to remove any uneaten food, shed skin, and faeces. You can do this when you change the water and check the moisture level of the substrate. Clean out and sterilise the tank completely every few weeks. Use a reptile friendly disinfectant which you can buy from your local pet store. Be sure to sterilise all the items in the tanks including plants, logs, and stones., Tiger salamanders have very sensitive skin so you should generally avoid handling them. These are not creatures which you can play with in the same way you would with a different kind of pet. The fun comes from observing them rather than handling them. There may, however, be occasions when you need to handle a tiger salamander, so it's important to know how to do this safely., If you are going to handle your tiger salamander it's crucial that you make sure your hands are clean first. Salamander skin is very sensitive to oils, salts and any other residues on your hands. Because salamanders absorb liquid through their skin, exposure to the elements on your hands can cause health problems, and can cause the tiger to become dehydrated., After washing your hands be sure to thoroughly rinse them with purified water, such as bottled mineral water, before you handle the salamander. After washing and rinsing, wet your hands again with purified water before you handle the salamander. Wetting your hands like this will limit the chances of your tiger becoming dehydrated.Even after taking these precautions, you should only handle your salamander for short periods.
If you are moving your salamander to a separate container while you clean the main tank, ensure that you have wet the floor of this container with purified water before you put him in."

The size of an adult. An adult fire-bellied newt is approximately 4-6 inches long; sometimes pet stores carry juveniles as small as two inches long.Its habitat in the wild. Fire-bellied newts originate in Japan, where they are semi-aquatic and spend most of their time in clear, cool bodies of water like lakes, ponds, and streams.This means that pet newts need a home that has water to swim in but also some areas of land; a good rule of thumb is to divide its home with 70% being water and 30% dry land.Its habits. Newts are amphibians, so they go through metamorphosis from a tadpole, to larva, to fully developed adult. They spend the first part of their life in water, and as adults spend time on land and in the water. Older fire-belly newts are more aquatic and are generally easier to keep as pets.They can live up to thirty years with excellent care; most live to be about fifteen.Its diet. Newts in the wild are carnivorous and like a diet of insects, but you can also feed them dried reptile or amphibian food such as Reptomin Floating Food Sticks.While it's fine to feed them primarily dried food, they need a varied diet including live food such as bloodworms, blackworms, guppies, and crickets; this keeps them active and alert since they have to ""hunt,"" and also helps to ensure they get the proper nutrition. Before you purchase newts, be sure that you have a local store or source to regularly purchase these insects. You must also be sure you'll be comfortable keeping such food available for the newts and feeding live food to them.;
, Salamanders are not social nor are they solitary; that means they really don't care either way if they live alone or with others. However, you must only put fire-bellied newts with other newts of the same species and no other types of animals or creatures.Fire-bellied newts secrete a toxin from their skin that can be harmful to other species and other types of animals, so it is important to keep only newts of one species in your aquarium.Be aware that Japanese and Chinese fire-bellied newts are actually two separate species and they should not be kept together. They are hard to tell apart unless you have seen both types, but Chinese newts are a bit smaller, smoother, and have slightly rounder tail tips than Japanese newts.If in doubt, buy your newts from the same tank at the same store, so that you know they are the same species.

, You will need a 10 or 20 gallon tank, depending on how many newts you plan to have. One 10 gallon tank can house from one to four newts; for five to ten newts, go with the 20 gallon tank.


The tank will be heavy and needs to be placed on top of a secure piece of furniture that can hold its weight without risk of tipping or breaking. It also needs to be away from windows and air vents so that heat and cold does not affect your newt.

, You can purchase these online or in your local pet store or big box store, or shop local garage sales or classified ads to find a used one at a discount.


Glass or Plexiglas is a good choice so that you can observe your animal. Be sure that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid since newts are notorious for trying to escape their habitats and can climb the glass walls of an aquarium., It is easier to clean a tank with a smooth bottom, and newts do not need rocks or other substrate in their habitat; but rocks provide an attractive addition to the tank.


If you use rocks at the bottom of the tank, purchase smooth, rounded stones or gravel and ensure it is large enough that it cannot be ingested. Rough stones will injure the newts' skin., Newts have thin skin and chemicals in the water will affect their health and can even kill them. Before filling the tank, check the pH and ammonia of your water with a home test kit (available for purchase online or at your local home or pet store), and use a liquid dechlorinator to prepare the water.


A pH of 7.0 is ideal for newts, but they will do well in water between 6.5 and 7.5 pH.Test your water for ammonia as well (test kits are available in the aquarium section of most large pet stores). Ammonia is lethal to newts.Dechlorinating chemicals are available at pet stores in liquid and tablet form. Simply add the recommended amount to the water and let it sit for a few minutes.
You can also use bottled spring water if you prefer to skip these steps., There are many options and newts can thrive in many different set ups, so it depends mostly on what is available and what you think looks best aesthetically. Remember, the goal is to give the newts dry land in about 30% of their aquarium, which can be made from:


a rocky slope. You can simply arrange smooth pebbles and rocks, peat, live moss, or sandy soil to come out of the water at a slope so that the newts can climb up to eat.
floating corkbark, turtle platforms, or live or plastic plants. The ""land"" does not have to actually be land, as long as it is floating out of the water and the newts can climb onto it., Newts like to have a place in the water where they can hide and have privacy. You can use something from around your home or purchase something specific for this purpose.


Pet stores sell all types of hiding places for aquariums, such as tunnels, treasure chests, etc. But you can also use a simple small terracotta pot placed on its side in the bottom of the aquarium. Even a mug you no longer use will work in a pinch.
You could also use logs, branches, and stones, which can be purchased at a pet store or found in nature. If you use found objects, be sure to sterilize them before putting them in your pet's habitat to ensure there are no insects or parasites present., Newts need about 10 inches of water but since they use the water as their toilet, bacteria will grow quickly unless you change the water frequently. You can change it less often if you only have one or two newts.


Use a turkey baster or small measuring cup to remove most of the water, and then add in treated, room-temperature water to bring the water level back up to 10 inches.

, Newts only need to be fed 2-3 times a week and most newts will eat 3-4 small insects such as bloodworms, crickets, earthworms, or maggots at each feeding.Remove any uneaten bugs or insects after a few hours.

, Every week or two you should remove the newts (using a fish net or your hands, if you can catch them) to a small holding container with a lid while thoroughly sanitizing the entire habitat.


The water should be completely refreshed and the inside of the aquarium sanitized, including any additions to the habitat like rocks or plastic plants. Any live plants should be removed while cleaning the enclosure to be replaced when everything is sanitized.Be sure that you let the water in the tank come to room temperature before you put the newts back in, since they are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures.

, Newts do not require additional heating or lighting, and can become overheated if they are too close to a light source. However, you can use an aquarium light to help you see the newt in its habitat.


Ensure that you switch off any lights at night.

, Although most people enjoy handling their salamanders occasionally, newts are fragile and can be injured easily. Try to limit your time holding the newts to once a day for a few minutes.


Ensure that your own hands are moist when you handle the newts, as this helps to protect its protective mucus covering on its skin.Newts also secrete a toxin from their skin, so it is very important that you do not handle them if you have an open cut or wound on your skin as the toxin can be harmful. Be sure that you wash your hands very thoroughly after handling the newt and do not rub your eyes or face when you are holding them, as the toxins can cause temporary blindness."

If this is your first pet frog, it's highly recommended that you choose a suitable breed for beginners, like one of the following:



African dwarf frog: African dwarf frogs are a good option for beginners as they are small, active and easy to take care of. They don't require live food and are complete aquatic.

Oriental fire-bellied toads: These frogs are a good option for beginners who want a terrestrial (non-aquatic) frog. They are fairly active and don't grow too large.

White's tree frog: White's tree frog is perhaps the easiest tree frog to take care of -- they are somewhat active, easy to feed and even tolerate being handled from time to time (which is unusual for frogs).

Pacman frogs: Pacman frogs are large, terrestrial frogs which are easy to care for. They tend to be quite sedentary, which lowers their space requirements but may make them a boring pet for kids.
As a beginner, you should avoid poison frogs or frogs that cost a lot of money. Poison frogs tend to be quite fragile and have complicated care needs, while more expensive frogs are a risky choice for people new to frog care. It's better to start with an inexpensive, easy breed and work your way up.;
, Although it is possible to catch wild frogs to keep as pets, there are several things you should consider first.


Firstly, it can be difficult to identify what species of frog you have caught. Different species of frogs have very different requirements in terms of foods, temperature, and habitat so if you try to keep a wild frog in the wrong conditions, it could die.
If you do decide to take a frog from the wild, make sure to take note of the surroundings in which you find it. Was it hopping around a leafy, grassy forest bed, hiding under a rock or swimming in a pond? These are the conditions you will most likely need to replicate at home.
However, you should still try to find out the exact species of your frog, by searching for images online, consulting a frog book or asking a local nature expert. This will help you to identify the frog's exact requirements.
Secondly, many of the frog species found in the wild are facing population declines or even extinction. Taking a frog from its natural environment could be harming wild frog populations, especially if it is an endangered species.
In fact, taking protected species from the wild is illegal in some areas, so be sure to check your state/country regulations before capturing a wild frog.

, The size of your frog (when it's fully grown) and the size of the tank it requires should be a top consideration when choosing your pet frog.


Sometimes, the teeny-tiniest looking frogs in the pet store will become giant monster frogs when fully grown. For example, pixie frogs (whose name would suggest a miniature frog) start out measuring under an inch in length, but can grow to a length of over eight inches.
Large frogs require a lot of space. For example, a fully grown bullfrog will require a 75 gallon (283.9 L) tank, or larger. If they are housed in undersized tanks, these frogs can become unhappy and sick.
Large tanks take up a lot of space in the home and require more effort to keep clean. These frogs will also eat more food, making them more expensive to feed than smaller frog varieties.
This is another reason to do your research and find out the exact breed of frog before you buy.

, Before you jump headfirst into buying the cutest (or ugliest -depending on your preference) frog in the store, you should take some time to figure out what it eats.



Most frog species are happy to eat crickets, worms (such and red wigglers and night crawlers) and other creepy crawlies. However, it's important to keep in mind that frogs usually prefer live food, especially if you're squeamish about that sort of thing.
Larger frogs will often require more substantial food, which might include mice, goldfish or guppies. Providing your frog with these items can be a lot of work and is not for the faint of heart!
In addition, you will need to consider where the frog's food will come from -- your local grocery store probably doesn't stock live crickets! Do you have a large pet supply store nearby which caters for more exotic animals?
Of course, it is possible to find food for your frog in the back garden but this can be pretty time-consuming and unreliable. In addition, garden pests are often exposed to chemical insecticides, which is unhealthy for your frog.

, Another major consideration is the activity level of your preferred species of frog. This is especially important if the frog is a children's pet, as most kids want a pet who'll keep them entertained.


A lot of the larger, cool or weird looking frogs are a popular choice among beginner frog keepers, however, these frogs tend to be the least active and will simply sit still as a statue and sleep all day. This can become boring very quickly.
If you're looking for a more active frog, you're better off going for smaller frogs, aquatic frogs and certain species of tree frog, as these will often hop or swim around, making them more fun to look at.
You should also bear in mind that even the most active frogs won't do much other than hop around or eat some crickets -- you can't take a frog for a walk, teach it tricks or even handle it all that much. Therefore, it's important to consider whether a frog is really the ideal pet for you (or your child).

, It's important to realize that getting a pet frog is not the same level of the time commitment as a goldfish -- in fact, a large, well-cared-for frog can live up to 25 years!


As a result, you need to be prepared to take care of your frog for many years to come -- to feed it, keep its environment clean and care for it when it's sick.
You should also think about how you will deal with future vacations as someone will need to care for your frog while you are away. A willing volunteer can be difficult to find if your frog only eats live crickets or even mice!
If you get a pet frog but discover it's too much work or too much of an expense to keep, you will have to get rid of it through the proper channels.
If you picked a wild frog from your backyard or a local park, you should be able to release it in the same place you found it. Be specific and replace the frog as close to the original location as possible -- whether it was underneath leaves on the forest floor or beside a stream.
However, if your frog is a store-bought, non-native species, you will not be able to release it into to wild. You will need to give the frog back to the pet store, sell the frog to a new owner, donate the frog to a local school as a class pet, or contact a nearby animal care organization.

, In some places, you are required to possess a license to keep certain frogs as pets, especially if they are endangered or poisonous.


For example, the African clawed frog is illegal in states like California and Oregon, where it would pose a threat to native wildlife populations if released.
Contact your local government office for more information on the licensing requirements in your area.

, Different species of frog have very different requirements when it comes to tanks, so make sure you do your homework before buying.



Terrestrial tanks: These are the simplest frog tanks, but should only be used for frog species that come from dry environments.

Aquatic tank: This type of tank is only used for purely aquatic species of the frog -- it is basically an aquarium filled with water, just like a fish tank.

Half and half: This is the most common type of frog tank, where half of the tank is filled with water, while the other half is dry. Most frogs will do well in this environment.

Arboreal tank: The arboreal tank is designed specifically for tree frogs who prefer to spend their time climbing on branches. These tanks are typically taller and narrower than other types of tank.

Pond: In some situations, you can keep native frog species in a pond in your backyard. Sometimes simply building a pond will attract local frogs to your yard and you won't need to go to the trouble of catching them at all! However, you should never keep non-native species in an outdoor pond as they might disrupt the local ecosystem by feeding on native frogs and other endangered insects.

, Once you have the tank, you will need to decide where to put it.


It should be kept out of direct sunlight at all times, as this can raise the temperature, making it uncomfortable (and perhaps dangerously) dry and hot inside the tank.
The tank should also be kept away from the kitchen, as smoke and other fumes from cooking can be harmful to your frog.
You also need to be careful not to expose the tank to any aerosol sprays (such as spray paint in the garage or hair spray in the bedroom) as these can be absorbed through the frog's skin, potentially making him ill.

, The substrate is the material used to cover the bottom of the tank. Your main considerations when it comes to the substrate are how damp or dry the tank needs to be and how easy the material is to clean.


Gravel stones are a good option for most common frog species -- the gravel is easy to clean and comes in a variety of colors and sizes. Other good options include potting soil, pine bark, sand, and cedar or pine shavings.
Once the substrate materials are in place, you can set about decorating the inside of the tank to your frog's liking! You can cover gravel substrate with a layer of moss, which makes the tank look a lot more natural. Just make sure to keep the moss damp by spritzing it with clean, stale water every so often and remember to keep an eye out for mold.
Placing a few rocks or stones inside the tank is also a good option, as it gives your frog something to climb on. Just make sure that the rocks have no sharp edges that the frog could injure itself on.
You can also decorate your tank with plastic branches or small live plants while a hollow log provides a good hiding spot. Buy or make a colorful background for your tank, such as a rainforest backdrop, as this helps to keep your frog feeling at home.

, The temperature and heating requirements for frogs vary greatly by species, so make sure to do some research before you set up your tank.


Unlike lizards, snakes, and turtles, most frogs do not require any special lighting, as they get all of their vitamin D requirements through their food.
However, you will usually need to provide a light source for up to 12 hours a day, especially if the tank doesn't have access to natural light.
Fluorescent lighting is the safest option for frogs, as it doesn't tend to get too hot. Hot lights can be dangerous if the frog decides to jump on them.
In terms of heating, the ideal temperature for your frog will depend entirely on species. The easiest way to change the temperature inside the tank is to change the temperature in the whole room.
Alternatively, you can buy heating lamps (which go above rather than inside the tank) or heating pads (which wrap around the outside of the tank) to raise the temperature inside.
If you need to heat the water in an aquatic or half and half tank, you will need to purchase a glass tube or fully submersible water heater.
Make sure to run any heaters a couple of days before you put the frogs in the tank. This allows you to monitor the temperature and makes sure it is right for the frogs.

, As mentioned above, most common frog species will eat crickets, worms, and other insects, while larger frogs will also eat mice or goldfish as an occasional treat.


How much and how often you need to feed your frog will depend on the individual frog and may come down to a process of trial and error at first.
Try feeding your frog three crickets per day to start off. If he quickly eats all three and starts to look hungry over the next few days, you can increase the number of crickets. However, if he only eats one or two and ignores the rest, you may be able to cut back.
You can also experiment with different types of food, such as mealworms, waxworms, and grasshoppers to see what your frog prefers. Aquatic frogs will generally eat frozen bloodworms or brine shrimp.

, It is very important to provide your pet frog with clean water daily, as he will use it for both drinking and bathing.


Frogs absorb water through their skin rather than drinking with their mouths. As a result, they tend to spend long periods of time just sitting in their water baths or ponds. This water should be dechlorinated, if possible.
You will also need to clean out the tank every couple of days to remove any droppings, wipe down the side of the tank, check for mold or algae and generally maintain a healthy environment for your frog.

, Frogs don't like to be handled, plain and simple. Therefore, you should try to leave your frog inside the tank as much as possible and content yourself with just looking at him.


If you can't resist picking him up, make sure to thoroughly wash and dry your hands first and avoid putting on any lotions, as frogs can absorb these things from your skin and potentially fall ill.
Be aware that he might squirm when you pick him up and potentially wet on you -- this is a sign that your frog is stressed by the handling and you should put him back in his tank as soon as possible.
Also be very careful not to drop your frog while handling -- even if it squirms -- as falling from a height could seriously injure your frog.

, Once a frog gets sick, it can be very difficult to treat and the prognosis is rarely good. Therefore, the best way to keep your frog healthy is to prevent it from becoming sick in the first place.


If your frog starts to look in any way skinny or malnourished, ask yourself whether you are providing enough variety in terms of food. A frog can't survive on a diet of crickets or mealworms alone. One of most common frog deficiencies is a lack of calcium, so consider sprinkling your frog's food with a powdered calcium supplement before feeding time.
Watch out for signs of red-leg, which is a potentially fatal illness that commonly affects captive frogs. Red-leg manifests as a reddening of the skin on the underside of the frog's legs and belly, while suffering frogs tend to become lazy and pathetic. If you suspect your frog might have red-leg, you should scrub out the tank to remove the parasite, then give your frog daily sulfamethazine baths over a two week period.
You also need to look out for fungal infections and illnesses like dropsy and spring disease. In these cases, you probably need to seek treatment from a veterinarian who can prescribe an appropriate antibiotic for your frog.

Separate tadpole eggs from the adults.,
Watch for the eggs to hatch.,
Look for them to swim freely.,
Feed the tadpoles once they start swimming freely.,
Make sure they aren’t taking too long to eat.,
Ensure the food is circulating properly.,
Use a scoop instead of a net.,
Change out 20-30% of the water every day.,
Clean the tank every week to two weeks.,
Switch the tadpoles to adult food.",How to Care for African Clawed Frog Tadpoles," A female frog can lay anywhere from 500 to 1,000 eggs and the rate of survival depends on the conditions of the tank. The most important factor is to keep the adults separate from the eggs. Otherwise, the tadpole eggs are in danger of being eaten by the adults.After you notice the first egg, watch out for more to follow in the next 2-4 days. There’s a good chance the eggs will hatch at night, so check the tank every morning.
Dedicate one tank to the eggs. The tank should be fairly wide but not overly tall.
A good tank size is anywhere from 6-10 gallons with a water level of 7-12 inches deep.Keep the water temperature a bit higher for tadpoles at around 75 degrees fahrenheit. Once the tadpoles are older, they can be kept in water that is slightly cooler at 70 degrees fahrenheit.You can purchase an aquarium heater from a local pet store, to heat the water. Just be sure to have a thermometer in the water so that you can monitor the temperature.
This is also the point where you need to decide how many frogs you'd ultimately like to raise, as most of the tadpoles will reach maturity so long as the environment is suitable.;
, Eggs typically hatch within 2-4 days.Once hatched, the tadpoles will be white in color, transparent and extremely tiny.


Despite their initial small size the tadpoles will grow quickly. This is why it’s so important to keep the eggs in a large tank., Being able to swim freely is a big milestone in the life of a tadpole. Initially, they will simply attach themselves to the side of the tank, but within a few days you’ll notice they will be swimming head down.


This is an important milestone in the life of a tadpole, but it’s also your cue to start feeding them. Up until this point they will be living off of the yolk sac they are born in.

, Now that the tadpoles are swimming freely, it’s time to feed them tadpole food. There are a few different food options including powdered egg and extremely fine goldfish food.


You can find powdered egg at major retail stores such as Walmart. Goldfish food can also be found at major stores or pet supply stores.
If you choose to use goldfish food, the flakes will need to be ground into a powder. You can use a mortar and pestle to grind the flakes into a fine powder.
Tadpoles should not be overfed. A good rule of thumb is to create a small “O” of food for each of the tadpoles at the top of the tank. The ""O"" should be small and roughly the same size as 14 point font. That should be sufficient for the day., If you notice the tadpoles are taking longer than an hour and a half to eat, this is an indication that they are being overfed. It is actually dangerous to overfeed the tadpoles, as the excess food accumulates in the tank and prevents oxygen from getting to the tadpoles.Because of their transparent appearance, you can actually see the food in their stomachs. Their bellies should not be bloated.
If they are being overfed, make the “O” of food slightly smaller. Continue to monitor their eating habits. As they grow, you may need to increase the amount of food you’re feeding them.

, It’s important to make sure the food is small enough and circulating properly. Tadpoles don’t have a mouth at this stage, so food is absorbed through a filter. If the food isn’t circulating they aren’t able to receive the proper nourishment.Make sure to space out the “O’s” of food. Do not place them all in one spot. Having an adequate amount of water, about one liter per tadpole, will help to ensure there is enough space to properly spread out the food.

, To ensure the survival of your tadpoles, never use a net to touch or retrieve them. If you must move them, use a cup to gently scoop them out of their current space and into a new one.Similarly, you should never use your hands as a method for transporting tadpoles. This is just as dangerous as using a net.

, It is crucial to the tadpole’s survival to keep their tank clean. Changing out a part of the tadpole’s water every day will help to ensure the cleanliness of both the tank and water.You do not need to empty the entire tank on a daily basis. Instead, you should carefully scoop out about 20-30% of the old water and replace it with fresh, clean water.
Use either bottled water or de-chlorinated water. However, as long as the water isn't overly acidic your tadpoles should thrive., Even though the aquarium only needs to be cleaned on a weekly or every other week basis you should still try to inspect it every day to ensure its' cleanliness.


To clean the bottom of the tank, try using a turkey baster. This will help you to extract some of the dirt and debris at the bottom, without disturbing the tadpoles.
When you do fully clean the tank, transfer the tadpoles to another temporary tank. Make sure the water conditions are similar to that of their aquarium.
Once the tadpoles have been moved, thoroughly clean the tank and sterilize everything including any decor. Use a cleaning product that is reptile friendly. Products can be found at any major retail store or specialty pet store.Tadpoles are sensitive to their environment, so in order to ensure their survival, be sure to keep up with the regular cleaning. As long as the environment is kept clean, you should expect the majority of your tadpoles to reach adulthood.

, You will need to closely monitor your tadpoles for physical changes, which indicate they are ready for adult food. Some of these physical changes include the appearance of front legs, as well as the disappearance of their tail.The appearance of front legs is your first sign that your tadpole will be transforming. Make note of this change on a calendar.
Wait for the tail to shrink down to a stump. At this point, you should begin feeding the tadpole adult food.
It will take approximately 10 days, from the appearance of front legs, for the tail to shrink to a stump. By marking the date on a calendar, you’ll have a good idea as to when you’ll need to purchase adult food.
Lean, raw beef or an earthworm is an acceptable first food for the adult frog. The food should be bite-sized so that they are able to easily consume it. Plan on feeding them only 3-4 times a week.

Make an appointment with an equine vet for the abused horse.,
Have the vet check your horse for basic care issues.,
Find out if the horse has worms or other health issues.",How to Rescue an Abused Horse1," An abused horse may have suffered physical abuse or neglect. Both leave scars in their own way. First off, get the horse examined by an equine vet. You will need to know the extent of any physical damage that has been done to the horse, and should have a frank discussion about the long term and ongoing cost of medication, should that be required.;
, It is likely that basic health care, such as worming, vaccination, teeth and hoof care, are lacking. The veterinarian needs to examine the horse’s teeth to see if they need filing down.


The vet should also check the hooves to determine what remedial action is required to get them back into good condition.

, In addition to other physical examinations, the veterinarian may take a fecal sample away for analysis to investigate what types of worms the horse may have. He or she will also decide on appropriate worming treatments. Worming treatment will be discussed in Method 2.


In the case of a starved horse the vet can also advise on how to gradually improve the horse's body condition in the way that is least likely to induce health problems. Weight gain will be discussed in Method 3.

"
"
Be aware that the horse’s chances of having worms is high.,
Understand that there are many worms that horses can pick up.,
Work with the vet to determine what medicines your horse needs.",How to Rescue an Abused Horse2," Even well cared for horses pick up parasites from eating in the pasture, so they require regular deworming (regular means two to four times a year). It is likely that the neglected horse has not been wormed, and there is a good chance that the horse was placed in a pasture where worm eggs were in abundance.


Worms can cause a number of health problems so it is important to get them treated as soon as possible. The worms irritate the gut lining causing pain and diarrhea. They interfere with digestion and rob the horse of vital nutrients. In extreme cases the sheer number of worms physically blocks the gut causing impactions or colic.

, There are many different types of worms. To ensure the worms die, treat the horse with the appropriate wormer. To determine which wormer should be used, the vet will take a fecal sample for analysis to find out exactly which species of worms are present. The common parasite species and the problems they cause are:


Strongyles (large red worms): These worms cause lethargy, ill thrift, and colic.
Cyathastomes (small red worms): These worms hibernate in the lining of the bowel. They can cause severe damage when they migrate and may cause pain or colic.
Cestodes (tapeworm): These absorb nutrition from the gut and robs the horse of precious nutrients.
Dictyocaulus (lungworm): The presence of worms in the horse’s lungs can cause a cough and secondary lung infections.
Ascarids (roundworms): Although these are intestinal worms, they can cause a cough due to larval migration through the lungs. These are mostly a problem in foals and young horses.
Oxyuris (pinworm): These irritate the anus.
Gastrophilus (bots): These are not a worm but fly larvae. They can cause irritation, inflammation, and pain in the stomach.

, Once the type of worms plaguing your horse have been determined, you will have to get medication for your horse to get rid of the worms.


Ivermectin or moxidectin are two common deworming medications."

Resist the urge to give the horse a lot of food.,
Plan the weight gain out over several months.,
Feed your horse small, frequent meals.,
Feed your rehabilitating horse forage.,
Troubleshoot if the horse won’t eat hay.,
Add high calorie foods if the horse is not gaining weight with hay alone.,
Add oils to your horse’s meal to help her gain weight.,
Do not give your horse concentrates.",How to Rescue an Abused Horse3," The temptation when you rescue an emaciated, or very thin, horse is to feed her a lot to help him regain weight. However, this is not as simple as it sounds because suddenly providing an abundance of food causes digestive problems and is likely to trigger potentially serious health issues such as colic or laminitis.

, Weight gain has to be mapped out over several months. It must be done carefully and methodically. The ideal food for helping the horse regain weight is forage (good quality hay) and the amount you feed the horse should be the amount recommended for her current body weight, plus 10 or 15%.


Use a measuring tape to assess the horse’s current weight, and cross reference this with a body weight-based feeding chart.
If you are concerned that you are not feeding the horse the right amount, talk to a vet.

, After a period of starvation, the horse’s stomach will need to repopulate the good bacteria that aids digestion. Feeding the horse a large meal will put a lot of pressure on the horse’s stomach that could lead to digestion problems.


Rather than giving the horse her allotted amount of feed all at once, space the amount of feed you give her out over the course of the day. This will keep the horse from gorging herself.

, Forage, or good quality hay, is the ideal food for a horse in the initial stages of rehabilitation because it is high in fiber, takes time to chew, and it difficult to bolt down. Bolting a lot of feed quickly can lead to choke, or a blockage of partially chewed, dry food in the esophagus.


Alfalfa hay is high in protein and low in carbohydrates, which can help to keep the horse energized.
If the horse is eating hay well, increase her daily ration by about one flake a day, and after a week of eating well, consider allowing her free access to hay.

, Some horses won't eat hay; if this is the case with your horse, try hay cubes or roughage chunks. These can trick the horse into thinking she is eating a concentrate, which will make her more likely to eat.


If the horse if having trouble eating because of dental problems (for example, dropping food or drooling) try soaking the hay cubes to soften them.

, If the horse is not gaining weight on hay, then add beet pulp or rice bran to her diet. Both foods are higher in calories than forage but are also high in fiber.


Avoid beet pulp that contains molasses as it will cause a ""sugar rush"" or a wash of sugar into the bloodstream that could overexcite your horse.

, Vegetable oils are an easy way to add calories to your horse’s feed. Most horses will eat 1 to 2 cups (250 ml each) of oil mixed into the food, though some horses may be picky. Try different types of oil, including:


Canola, cocosoya, and standard vegetable oil.

, Although concentrates are high in calories, they are also high in the starches and sugars that trigger metabolic problems such as insulin resistance, colic, and laminitis.

Have patience when dealing with your horse’s damaged hooves.,
Deal with severely overgrown hooves.,
Help your horse’s hooves recover from cracks.,
Manage founder occurring in the horse's hooves.",How to Rescue an Abused Horse4," An abused horse will most likely have misshapen or damaged hooves. Horse hooves continue to grow like human fingernails, so if they are not cared for properly, they can become mangled.


It can take months of regular foot trimming by an experienced farrier to gradually trim the hoof back and encourage it to grow in a healthy shape.

, Severely overgrown toes look like an Aladdin's slipper, with a curl of extra horn beyond the forward profile of the hoof. The farrier will trim back the excess horn, but will avoid cutting into the living part of the hoof, as it contains blood vessels and nerves.

, Because of illnesses or poor nutrition the keratin of the hoof wall may be in poor condition. This causes it to flake, peel, or crack. Superficial flaking and peeling may be pared away, but cracks are potentially more serious. If a crack extends through the whole thickness of the hoof wall it may split apart and cause extreme pain.


The farrier can use special horseshoes in order to stop the hoof from spreading under the horse's weight. This helps prevent the crack from growing longer and extending up to the coronary band where the hoof grows from. However, just like a broken fingernail, you have to wait for the damaged area to grow out which can take six to twelve months.

, Hooves affected by founder are often misshapen. The delicate laminae in your horse’s hoof suspend the toe bones inside the hoof, allow the bones to move within the hoof, and alter weight distribution. Founder can damage the laminae. These hooves tend to be of poor quality keratin, and the foot grows long and sloping, in an elongated shape, instead of upright and blocky.


The farrier will take remedial action by trimming back long toes, and raising the heel on an orthopedic horseshoe. This helps place the weight more on the toe than the heel, and encourages further growth in a better alignment. Again, this is a lengthy undertaking that may take up to a year.

Be patient when trying to help a horse with behavioral issues.,
Look for signs of a fearful horse.,
Watch for signs that the horse is a ‘shutdown horse’.,
Be calm around your rehabilitating horse.,
Avoid catching the horse by surprise.,
Remove the horse’s shoes.,
Get the horse used to touch.,
Avoid a battle of wills and encourage rather than punish.,
Understand that rehabilitating an abused horse can be dangerous.",How to Rescue an Abused Horse5," An abused horse most likely has a jaundiced view of people, either because contact with them has been unpleasant, or she has had limited contact and is unused to them.


It can takes years to resolve the behavioral issues of an abused horse; you should seek the advice of a qualified trainer to keep yourself safe.
A horse’s wariness of people can manifest itself in one of two ways: as a fearful aggressiveness, or as a complete shutdown.

, A fearful horse could be mistaken for being aggressive, but she is really just protecting herself. This will manifest as a lack of trust the the horse openly displays towards you. She may refuse to be caught when out in pasture, or may refuse to open her mouth for a bit.


She may also shy away, kick, bite, rear, buck or bolt.

, A shutdown horse withdraws into a cocoon whereby she walls herself off from emotion. From day to day she appears dull and resigned, and to some extent she can be regarded as a model horse because she is biddable and doesn't argue.The danger is that when pushed beyond a certain point she is forced out of this cocoon she may behave unpredictably by bucking or shying when you least expect it.

, The key to rebuilding trust is to approach the horse quietly and calmly. Speak in a low, sing-song voice, and be careful never to take the horse by surprise. Offer out treats to win her confidence. Successful rehabilitation depends on building the horse's trust and making her feel safe in your company.


If the horse is head shy, avoid petting this area while also getting her used to contact with other areas, such as her neck or shoulders.

, Always alert the horse to your presence by talking to her as you approach. Never stand directly in front of the horse. Standing directly in front of the horse may increase her anxiety because she cannot see an escape route.


Instead, stand either to the left or right of her head where she can assess you and the situation.

, When working with an abused horse, it is a good idea to have her shoes removed. This way, if she does kick out and makes contact with you, it will hurt less. Also, consider wearing protective clothing such as a hard hat, gloves, and steel-toe capped boots when working with the abused horse.


Where possible work in a circular arena. The lack of corners literally means she cannot feel cornered, and if she can keep moving she is less likely to resort to violence.

, If the horse won't tolerate a pat, use a false hand attached to a pole to gently touch her at a distance. By trial and error try to find an area on her body that she is least sensitive about, such as her withers or neck. Start with brief contact for a few seconds and praise her verbally in a gentle, patient manner.


Work for just a few minutes at a time so she does not get tired or worked up. Try to end each session on a positive note by giving her a treat, or lots of praise. Even then, it may take weeks or even months before she will accept your touch.

, Never get drawn into a battle of strength because the horse will win. If she has a halter and rope on, and she starts to barge you, don't push back. This only encourages her to push in return. Instead, rattle the rope where it joins the halter;doing this should cause her to step away, which is all that you need.


Again, when she steps away, give her lots of verbal praise, or a treat if she will take it.

, Horses are large, heavy, powerful animals and an aggressive or fearful horse is not suitable for a novice to rehabilitate. The process of building trust takes months and the horse has the potential to do real harm to you if she panics. On the other hand, half the battle is winning the horse's trust. Once you have established that you are no threat, and she can trust you, the rewards are immense.

, If they know you have the goal of getting a horse or making enough to save up for the horse, they might be more generous., If you like to bake, try some recipes for horse treats (there are lots on the internet) or invent your own. Find a few that your horse likes and start making them and offer a set amount for a fair price, try to beat the feed store if you can.


You can have some fun with this one! Find old horse treat containers and make new inventive labels with reminders to buy more when the treats are gone.

, If you have room for a garden full of fruit or veggies, sell produce. For example, grow watermelon and set out a stand and sign by the street. The best part is, you don't even have to be out there with the stand the whole time! Just set out a money box for people to put theirs in (honor system).

, Have a sale of all that extra tack too-small riding clothes you do not/cannot use anymore.


See if other horsey friends would like to sell their stuff too for a small commission.

, If you do not have time for a full on sale, you can sell your stuff through the internet, in the classifieds, or at a friend's garage sale.

, Make things such as jewelry, bookmarks, pin cushions, saddle pads, soap, bubble bath, and animal treats. Sell these items at car booths. Another idea would be to buy some grooming kits, and decorate the brushes with a waterproof pen. You could sell all the stuff in the list above on your own web store or perhaps buy a market stall.

, Horse wise, that means no new tack unless you need it. When you do, try to get it second hand or on sale.

, Do you need that candy bar? Those sneakers? Think about how the money could go toward your horse instead.

, Put it in safe box or jar. It'll really add up!

Enjoy your bullfrog.",How to Take Care of an American Bullfrog," American bullfrogs are the largest species of North American frogs, capable of growing up to eight inches long and weighing up to one-and-a-half pounds.


They are also fairly long-lived, with an average life span of seven to nine years in the wild.Bullfrogs are voracious and cannibalistic feeders, requiring a large and steady diet of live prey (more on this below).
The males, as well, are territorial and often aggressive, and are known for occasionally cannibalizing tadpoles and young frogs. For these reasons, you'll want to think carefully about why (and whether or not) you really want to commit to raising an American bullfrogs.;
, While bullfrogs can be fascinating to raise from the tadpole stage, and while raising them can provide countless educational opportunities to children, they nonetheless are not the best candidates for pets.


Bullfrogs should not be handled. The oils from our skin can be harmful to the frogs, and similarly, the frogs can be carriers of dangerous salmonella. Because bullfrogs can live so long, you should be sure that you'll be able to commit to caring for your frog(s) in the long-term. If your child's interests are varied and quick-changing, you might want to reconsider your choice!
If you can no longer care for your bullfrog, you must be very careful about releasing your bullfrog into the wild unless your bullfrog was native to your area. Non-native bullfrogs are considered invasive species, and can cause quite a lot of damage and disruption to local ecosystems. Because bullfrogs are known to cannibalize, it's recommended that you keep only one mature bullfrog in a tank., Frog legs have long been a delicacy, and the meat of the American bullfrog is similarly prized. It's possible then, that you may be thinking about raising bullfrogs for a commercial endeavor.


While it might seem appealing to raise frogs for meat, overall, the venture is quite risky. Those operations which have been successful have been in locations which naturally provide optimal outdoor living conditions for bullfrogs. ; Should you decide to proceed with your business operation, you'll obviously need a more more extensive set-up and habitat for your frogs. You'll also need to research and verify the particular regulations to which you'll be subject, acquire all of the necessary licenses, etc. Keep in mind that these will vary by state.

, If you're lucky enough to live on property with a pond that is already populated with bullfrogs or suitable for their introduction, you really won't need to do much to prepare your bullfrog's new home. If you plan to care for your bullfrog indoors, however, you'll need to take additional steps.

, Your tank should be as large as possible. If you're only raising one frog, you'll need at least twenty gallons, and as a general rule of thumb, an additional five gallons for each frog. (Keep in mind, of course, that you may lose young frogs to cannibalism on the part of the older mature frogs.)

,


There should be a “wet” area in the tank, with the water being deep enough to cover approximately half of your frog's height.
Be sure to add plenty of hiding spots in the tanks (with the rocks and plants you've collected). , You will want to purchase a good, powerful filter for your tank to keep your frog's new home clean.


Depending upon the tank placement in your home, you may also need a light.
Assuming that the room in which you keep the tank is relatively warm (25-28 degrees Celsius), you won't need a heater for your aquarium.
Bullfrogs require a humid environment, so it's possible that you'll need to use a humidifier on occasion.You may also want to cover the sides of your aquarium (excluding the front, where you'll be observing the frogs) with colored paper or aquarium backdrops. This will help prevent the bullfrogs from jumping against the glass and injuring themselves., The consensus among experts is that it is best to harvest local tadpoles as opposed to ordering or purchasing tadpoles or breeding pairs of frogs.


You'll need either a cage or lidded container depending upon whether you are collecting mature frogs or tadpoles. Make sure that your cage has a tight-fitting lid so as to keep the mature bullfrog from jumping out.
If you're catching tadpoles, bring a sturdy net to wrangle the little guys. Check that the holes are smaller than your smallest finger so that the tadpoles won't slip through.
If you plan on catching an adult bullfrog and plan to catch it with your hands, wear gloves.
If you haven't already set up your aquarium with water, soil, etc. from the pond, make sure to collect sufficient materials from your frogs' first home now.

, This step is pretty self-explanatory! Once you've caught your new bullfrog friend, transport him home carefully and place him in his new home.


Give your new pal time to acclimate, and be sure that you've provided your bullfrog with plenty of tasty food to hunt. See the next part for more detailed instructions on how to feed and care for your bullfrog.

, Feeding requirements for tadpoles are fairly simple. Tadpoles are primarily vegetarian; thus, so long as you've populated your tank with native plants from their natural habitat, your tadpoles should have a sufficient food source.


You can also supplement with animal feed, available from pet stores. American bullfrogs remain in the tadpole stage for an extended period of time—up to a year or longer depending upon the species and climate.Once they reach their mature stage, their feeding needs will change.

, American bullfrogs are known for their voracious appetites, and so you'll need to be prepared with a steady supply of varied food options.


Adult bullfrogs eat insects, worms, tadpoles, small fish, and even young frogs and small snakes.
They will only eat moving prey, so you'll need to supply them with live food. Because bullfrogs have a seemingly unending appetite, you'll need to be careful not to overfeed them. Young juvenile frogs should be fed only once every couple of days, and adults only need to be fed only two to three times a week.
You may also want to consider adding a calcium supplement to the frog's prey., While you have been careful to create as natural of an environment for your bullfrog as possible, the ecosystem you've created is not self-sustaining, so you'll have to commit to a fair amount of maintenance.


You'll find it handy to purchase a pair of aquarium forceps. These will be useful for removing frog feces and any leftover food. You should do this regularly (ideally, every day). Be sure to replace replenish your frog's water supply regularly. Every week or so, you should remove approximately one-third of the tank's water and replace it with fresh, dechlorinated water.
The frog's water should be slightly acidic, and free from pesticides or other contaminants.
You may need to use a commercial dechlorinator., Bullfrogs are susceptible to a number of diseases and illnesses. Be on the lookout for any changes in behavior or appearance:


Is your frog lethargic?
Is your frog eating less or not at all?
Is your frog's belly bloated?
Is your frog's skin reddened (or different in color at all)?
If so, these are all signs of failing health, and you should be prepared to take your bullfrog to a qualified veterinarian., It may seem as though preparing to welcome your bullfrog is an involved process, but it really isn't! With care and attention, you should be able to observe and enjoy your American bullfrog for years to come!

Review job requirements.,
Look for open positions at public and privately-owned ranches.,
Ask about what might exclude your application.,
Have your supporting documents ready.,
Work your way up.,
Attend wrangler school.,
Learn from your peers and your mistakes.,
Get the right clothes and gear.,
Expect to be tired.,
Make friends while you’re there.,
Have some prior knowledge of horses before you become a wrangler.",How to Become a Horse Wrangler," There isn’t any one tried and true job description for horse wranglers. Most horse wranglers work on ranches, although some are employed in Hollywood to assist in filmmaking. At the minimum, most horse wranglers:Clean up horse poop.
Feed, brush, and clean horses.
Herd horses.
Lead tours.
Some horse wranglers may assist in training horses also.;
, The federal government maintains millions of acres of protected lands, much of which houses wild and tamed horses. Also, there are privately-owned ranches throughout the country, from one coast to the other. You can search websites, local horse enthusiast groups, and also the government’s employment website. Also, local feed stores are a great resource for wrangler openings.If there is a particular area of the country that you’re set on living and working in, limit your search to that area. Otherwise, you’ll have the best chances of finding the perfect position if you open up your search to a region or, better yet, nationally.

, Privately-owned and government-run ranches each have their own exclusions, so you’ll want to review each application carefully before you submit one. For example, when applying to work for the federal government as a Horse Wrangler, you can’t hold an active real estate license, nor can you have any interest or stock in federal land. Some private ranches may exclude smokers or convicted felons.Each job announcement should include any exclusions. If you’re unsure, though, make sure to ask if you think there might be a conflict with your application.

, When you’re hired, you’ll need to provide supporting documents as part of your new-hire paperwork, and possibly to support your application. Before you apply for horse wrangler positions, gather your supporting materials so that you have them ready to go as soon as you’re asked for them. This not only makes a good impression with your future employer, but ensures that you won’t hit any snags when getting hired. You’ll want:A state-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license
Your social security card
Proof of first aid and CPR certifications
Proof of wilderness survival training, if you have it
Proof of address, such as with a utility bill in your name

, If you’re just starting out and don’t have experience as a wrangler, you won’t likely work as an actual wrangler right away. Usually you have to work your way up to that position through experience, training, and seniority. Ultimately, you should be promoted to Lead Wrangler, making you the supervisor of all other wranglers on the ranch., You may get a leg up on the competition if you put yourself through wrangler school, although many, if not most, positions will send you to wrangler school as a condition of your probation. Wrangler school will teach you the essential information necessary for any horse wrangler, whether they work for a private or public property.Most horse-wrangler programs take anywhere from 4-6 weeks.
You’ll learn a variety of important skills, such as knot tying, trail riding, anatomy and behaviors of horses, saddling and shoeing horses, and other relevant skills.
The cost is typically $1000 – 1700 dollars. Ask potential employers if they will reimburse you for the cost of attending wrangler school.
Some schools use a letter grade system (A+ – F), whereas others use a pass/fail system. Most schools require you to pass quizzes and tests to successfully complete the program.

, As a new horse wrangler, nobody expects you to know everything that it takes to be a great wrangler. You will be expected to pay attention to what others are doing, listen to their guidance, and certainly to learn from your mistakes. If you don’t know how to do something, just ask someone to explain it to you.Don’t pretend to know how to do something that you don’t have experience with. The safety of the horses and your colleagues relies on everyone doing specific jobs.

, Most employers will supply you with a saddle and the basic tools of the trade, but it’s up to you to outfit yourself correctly and to purchase any gear that you might want. Clarify with your employer what they will provide and what you’re expected to purchase.You want to bring sturdy jeans, boots, t-shirts, and long-sleeve shirts.
You might want a hat or bandana as well.
To save some money, look at local thrift stores for your clothing. You’ll be getting very dirty and there’s no need to spend money on clothes that will get ruined pretty quickly.
You might be expected to bring your own bedding, flashlights, and toiletries too.

, Horse wrangling is physically and mentally exhausting work. Your job will start daily before the sun comes up and end long after it’s gone down. You’ll be on your feet or on a horse all day with little time to relax. Remember, too, that some ranches don’t allow days off; instead, they expect that you’ll work a couple of months with no days off for the span of a “season.”>


More permanent positions will give you time off, whereas more temporary positions typically will not.
Whether this is a permanent position or seasonal work, you will put in long hours and a lot of hard work. You’ll be tired.

, You may be hired with a group of other new wranglers, or you may be a single addition to an already-established team. In either scenario, you want to make friends with your colleagues if you can. Don’t force the relationships, of course, but always keep in mind that you rely on one another, and that you’re all learning how to work together.It’s important that you communicate effectively with your colleagues and that you don’t get frustrated with them or yourself.

, It wouldn’t make any sense for you to try and be a mechanic having no knowledge of cars and it makes just as little sense to try and be a horse wrangler without some knowledge of horses. Your employer will want to see that you know about horses, their temperaments, how to care for them, and that you show a true passion for these animals, all before you’re hired.Your local library should have a variety of books, videos, and digital resources available to instruct you about horses and their care.

Choose appropriate housing for your frog.,
Add items to make the house more comfortable for the frog.,
Fill the tank.,
Add the finishing touches.,
Purchase frog pellets or sticks.,
Feed other food types.,
Clean the tank every month for most aquatic frogs.,
To clean the tank, take a bucket and put about 5 inches/12.5cm of room temperature non-chlorinated water in it.,
Using a different bucket, scoop the old water out and throw it outside.,
Dump the shells and pebbles into a pile.,
Rinse the tank.,
Set the pebbles and shells back into the tank.

,
Put the bucket of water with the frogs in it back into the tank.",How to Take Care of an Aquatic Frog," It will need a tank of a size that allows it move around with ease.;
, You'll need some small rocks, gravel and some shells (shells are optional but look good). Algae killer will be needed to keep the housing safe; follow the package directions for use.


Frogs also like plants to use as hiding places.

, Put room temperature, non-chlorinated water into the tank. Fill the tank until it is three quarters (3/4) full.


Each frog needs about a gallon of water.
Water temperature matters, especially if raising tadpoles. Tadpoles grow faster in warmer temperatures, around 62ºF-70ºF is suitable for tadpoles.

, Place a bunch of shells, pebbles, etc in the bottom of the tank. Position them so that the frog has plenty of places to hide.

, One good food type is ReptoMin Floating Food Sticks. These are manufactured for aquatic turtles, newts and frogs. You can probably get it at most pet stores.


For average sized frogs 3-6 sticks a day, broken in half are fine. You need to break the stick in half though, to make it easier for them to swallow.
Sprinkle the food on top of the water.

, Aquatic frogs will also eat, brine shrimp and fish food. Sometimes they eat leftover food from the bottom of the tank but it's a good idea to remove uneaten food before it creates a mess and becomes a hazard.

, However, be aware that some frogs like the water murky, such as African Water Frogs, so you won't have to clean it as often.

, Take a net and quickly scoop the frog into the bucket.

, Keep doing this until the tank is light enough to carry. Then carry it to your sink.


A vacuum tube made for cleaning tanks can make this easier.

, Use water and a scrub brush to scrub out any algae and slime.

, Put it back where it normally lives. Put fresh room temperature non-chlorinated water in it, again filling to 3/4 full. Add some non-harmful algae killer in with the water as you pour it in.

,, Do NOT pour the frogs back in because your pet frog may be harmed in the process. Done.

Look for suitable habitat where you can expect bullfrogs to live.,
Choose the proper season for searching for bullfrogs.,
Consider looking late in the evening, or after dark, since bullfrog's large eyes are reflective, and are more easily spotted than their bodies.

,
Travel the banks of the body of water you are searching quietly and slowly, so the bullfrogs do not startle them and cause them to leap into the water.

,
Stop and scan the water's edge frequently, looking for the glossy skin of the bullfrog.,
Listen for their distinctive call, or croaks to help you locate the general area bullfrogs are in.

",How to Spot a Bull Frog," There should be clean water with little or no current, and sufficient aquatic vegetation to offer them concealment.;
, They are amphibians, and so, are cold blooded creatures which are only active in warm weather, from spring through early fall. Breeding season is usually late spring to early summer, and males can make considerable noise during this time.

,,, Also be aware of their distinctive profile against the similarly colored background where they await prey.

Some species may be illegal to raise under any circumstances, usually because they are an endangered species. Search online for information about national and regional laws in your area, or contact a local department of wildlife management or department of natural resources.


Australia has especially strict laws about raising frogs, and these vary from state to state. A summary of each state's laws can be found here.
If you are purchasing tadpoles from a pet store, you could ask the store's employees about laws in your area.;
, Short, wide containers are better than tall, narrow ones, because the larger water surface results in more oxygen from the air entering the water.You can purchase a plastic ""critter tank"" at a pet store, or use any clean plastic or styrofoam container. Do not use any container made of metal, or tap water that runs through copper pipes.Try to find a large container to avoid overcrowding your tadpoles. Use a plastic kiddie pool if you are raising a large quantity of them.
Even frog eggs can die if kept in a small container, although the reasons for this are unclear., Tadpoles require clean water, and could die if placed in tap water which has not been treated to remove chlorine and other chemicals. Ideally, use water from a pond where tadpoles are swimming, or rainwater. If this is not possible, treat tap water with dechlorination tablets purchased at a pet store, or leave the container of tap water in sunlight for 1–7 days to break down the chlorine.Do not use rainwater if you area suffers from acid rain or there are industrial operations nearby.
If your tap water contains fluoride, you may need additional filters to remove the fluoride before it is safe for tadpoles.

, Some species of tadpoles forage in the sand for small particles of food, and will thrive in a container with 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) of clean sand at the bottom. You may use small, non-sharp aquarium gravel, or gather sand from a river bank.


Sand collected from beaches or quarries is not recommended, as it contains harmful levels of salts or other substances. In order to remove these substances, fill small containers (not the tadpole container) halfway with the sand, then to the top with water. Let sit for 24 hours, drain the water away, then repeat with fresh water at least six times., Almost every tadpole species requires a way to leave the water once they have transformed into a frog, as they may no longer be able to remain underwater indefinitely. Rocks that extend above the water surface are a good option. Aquatic plants gathered from a pond or pet store provide more oxygen and a place for tadpoles to hide, but do not cover more than 25% of the water surface, as this prevents oxygen in the air from entering the water.Note: Place the rocks near the edge of the tank, as some species of frogs will only look for land at the edge of the water, not the center.Do not use plants that have been treated with pesticides or other chemicals, as these could kill the tadpoles.

, Tadpoles, just like aquarium fish, are sensitive to changes in water temperature and could die if moved to a container with a much higher or lower water temperature than the water they came from. If you're buying the tadpoles or eggs from a pet store, ask what temperature you should keep the water at. If you're collecting them from a stream or pond, use a thermometer to measure the temperature of that water. Try to get your new water temperature as close to this as possible.


If you cannot get an expert to identify your species and offer more precise advice, try to keep your water between 59 and 68ºF (15–20ºC).Be prepared to move the container indoors before a frost occurs. Keep the water in partial shade if the weather becomes too hot.

, If your container is wide and there are aquatic plants in the sand, but not covering the surface, it likely gains enough oxygen from the air, and an additional aerator could cause the tadpoles to bloat.If you are only raising a few tadpoles, they will usually get enough oxygen even if the conditions are not ideal. If you are raising a large number of tadpoles, and the conditions described don't match your tank, you may wish to add an aquarium aerator to keep air moving through the tank.

, Keeping regional and national laws into account, you may collect the tadpoles or frog eggs from a local pond or stream. Purchasing them from a pet store is another option, but do not purchase exotic or imported species if you intend to release the tadpoles into the wild. Frogs can survive many years and can require a substantial amount of care, so it is recommended that you raise local species only for your first attempt.


Use a soft net or small bucket to scoop up the tadpoles and place them in a transportable container filled with the water they are swimming in. Tadpoles can be damaged if bumped or scratched, and cannot breathe in air.
As a rough guideline, each 1 inch (2.5 cm) long tadpole requires 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Keep in mind that most tadpoles will grow much larger before they become frogs. Overcrowding the tank can lead to disease or insufficient oxygen.

, If your water temperature is different than the temperature of the water they came from, place the container of tadpoles in their old water inside the new container, but keep the container opening above the surface so the two bodies of water don't mix. Leave it there until the temperatures of the two bodies of water have equalized, then release the tadpoles into the larger container.

, Tadpoles thrive best on a diet of soft plant matter, which should be given to them in small quantities whenever they run out of food. Leaves with algae growing on them can be collected from stream or pond bottoms and fed to the tadpoles. Alternatively, rinse baby spinach (never adult spinach), dark green lettuce, or papaya leaves thoroughly, chop them into small pieces, and freeze them before feeding. You can also feed them very small pieces of peas that have been soaked in luke-warm water and placed on the surface of the water. Check with a pet store employee or online before you feed the tadpoles any other type of plant.


Fish food flakes are not typically as high quality as straight vegetables, but can be used if they contain mostly spirulina or other vegetable matter, not animal protein.Crush large flakes into tiny pieces and feed a pinch a day.

, While tadpoles should be given a little animal protein occasionally, their digestive systems cannot handle large amounts of it. To keep these protein supplements to safe levels, and ensure that the tadpoles are able to eat them, use frozen food intended for fish fry, such as frozen bloodworms or daphnia.Give these to the tadpoles in small quantities once a week. You may feed them larger quantities of insects once they become frogs, although they may not eat for a short time following the change.


Fish fry food is available wherever live fish are sold.

, Whenever the water becomes cloudy or smelly, or when the tadpoles stay clustered near the top of the tank, it is time to change the water. Make sure to use the same type of water the tadpoles are swimming in, treated with dechlorination tablets if necessary. Leave the new water out until it is the same temperature as the existing water, or the temperature change could kill the tadpoles. Replace 30–50% of the old water with the new water at a time.The water will stay cleaner for longer if you don't feed the tadpoles large amounts of food at once. Each serving of food should be gone within 12 hours at most, and then immediately replaced.
Avoid using aquarium water filters to keep the tank clean, unless you are sure they are too weak to drag the tadpoles in or force them to swim against the current.Sponge filters can be used safely.

, Tadpoles need calcium to grow their skeletons, and may not be able to acquire enough from their regular diet. Pet stores sometimes sell cuttlebone for this purpose, which should be rinsed thoroughly before placing in the container, then left there permanently. Alternatively, use a liquid calcium supplement intended for aquariums, adding one or drops for every quart (liter) of water whenever you change the water.Once cuttlebone piece about 2 inches (10 cm) long should be enough for a small tank.

, Depending on the species and age, the tadpoles may become frogs within a couple weeks or take several months. Once they develop legs and begin to lose their tail, the froglets should try to exit the water. Have a plan prepared as soon as you start to see changes in your tadpoles:


Most frogs cannot breathe underwater indefinitely, so be sure they have a rock or other non-metal platform at the edge of the tank to climb onto and reach the air. A few species will fail to climb out on their own, so you may need to lift them out with a soft net once their tails are half gone.Attach a secure lid to your tank, with plenty of air holes. Weigh it down with heavy objects if it does not latch shut to prevent the frogs leaping out.

, If you caught your tadpoles locally, you may release the frogs in an area of damp vegetation near the same water source you caught them in. If you cannot release them immediately, keep them in a plastic tank with a cover of leaf litter, and bark pieces large enough to hide under. Do not fill the tank with water, but provide a shallow water dish for the frogs to sit in, and spray the tank's sides with water once a day.If you wish to keep raising your frogs, or if you need to care for the frogs for more than a day before releasing them, continue on to the next section.

, Some species of frogs require extensive care, so make sure you know the needs of your frog species before you acquire a new pet. If you are a beginner, you may wish to start with a non-poisonous species that do not grow to a large adult size.Many frog species don't like to be handled or remain still for large periods of time, which may make them less interesting for children.


You may wish to choose a local species which you can legally release back into the wild if you change your mind about raising it.
Be aware that some national or regional governments require an amphibian license or forbid the raising of frogs entirely. Search online for laws which apply to your region.

, Many frog species need access to both land and water in order to thrive, which may require a special two-part aquarium tank that allows it to move between the two. Others only require a shallow water dish to sit in, while still others are entirely aquatic and can breathe underwater even in adult form. Make sure you know your frog's needs before setting up a tank.


If you collected your frogs from the wild, get a biologist or someone from the nearest department of natural resources to identify the species.

, Glass aquarium tanks or terrarium tanks are best suited for most frog species. Clear plastic tanks will work as well, but be aware that some frog species require an ultraviolet light which could damage the plastic over a long period of time.Make sure the tank is waterproof and escape-proof, but also contains plenty of air holes or mesh for ventilation.


Do not use metal mesh, as the frogs could injure themselves on it.For tree frogs and other climbing frogs, pick a large, tall tank with room for place branches and climbing structures.

, Whether or not you need a heater and/or humidifier for your tank depends greatly on your frog species and local climate, so seek expert advice or search online for more information about your species' temperature requirements. If you need to keep the tank to a certain humidity, consider purchasing a hygrometer to measure this number so you can spray the sides with water if it drops too low.


In a two-part tank setup (air and water), heating the water with an aquarium heater may be the most effective way to keep the tank warm., Whether in air or water, the frog needs a natural base to walk on. Once again, the exact way you should accomplish this depends on species. A pet store employee or experienced frog owner who knows your species may recommend sand, gravel, peat, moss, or a mixture of these.Burrowing species require a thicker layer to dig into.

, Some frogs require an ultraviolet light for 6–8 hours a day.Research your species to find out if this is necessary, and ask a pet shop employee about which UV light to use. There are many types, some of which may overheat your tank or provide them with the wrong wavelengths of light.As for regular artificial lighting, fluorescent lights produce less heat and therefore dry out the frog's skin less quickly than incandescent bulbs.

, For land-dwelling species, provide a dish of rainwater or other frog-safe water large enough that the frogs can sit in it up to their shoulders. If the frog species requires a two-part tank or a fully aquatic tank, treat it as you would an aquarium tank. This means using rainwater or other frog-safe water, installing an aquarium aerator and a water filter, and replacing 30–50% of the water with clean water at the same temperature whenever it gets cloudy or bad-smelling. Change once every 1–3 weeks for best results, depending on how crowded the tank is.


Tap water can be treated with dechlorination tablets and, if necessary, a fluoride filter to make it safe for use by frogs. Do not use tap water if your plumbing has copper pipes, as the trace amounts of copper can be toxic to frogs.If your tank is kept warm, as it should be for some species, warm the new cold water to the correct temperature in a stainless steel saucepan. Do not use hot tap water.

, Underwater aquarium plants in underwater portions of the tank may help clean and oxygenate the water, and provide hiding places which frogs enjoy. Climbing frogs need natural or artificial climbing branches, while most frog species enjoy hiding spots such as large, upside down bark segments.

, Almost all frog species eat live insects in the wild, and sticking to a diet of varied insects is usually a good choice.Worms, crickets, moths, and insect larvae are usually appropriate foods, and many frogs are not picky about what they eat if they are not used to a particular diet already.However, it is always a good idea to check what your species requires, and to provide it with food appropriate to the size of its mouth. Mice or other non-insect meat can strain the frogs' organs unless they belong to a large species that had adapted to live on this type of protein.


Do not feed your frog large ants, which are capable of killing frogs.
Many frogs will not recognize non-moving objects as food, but you could try to feed a frog individual dead insects by holding them near its mouth with a pair of tweezers.

, Frogs require a source of calcium, vitamins, or both, since they cannot get enough of these nutrients from insects alone. Amphibian vitamin and calcium supplements are available in powdered form for sprinkling on the insects before feeding. There are many brands of supplements available, and the best one to use depends on the frog's diet and characteristics. As a general rule, use separate calcium supplement and vitamin supplement, not past the expiration date, and avoid high-phosphorus supplements if crickets are the frog's main food.It may be easiest to place the insects and a small amount of the powder in a container and shake the container around to coat the insects.

, The exact needs of your frog depends on species, but you may follow these guidelines if you have no specific instructions that match your species. Young frogs may not eat at all immediately after emerging from the water, but will soon begin to eat rapidly, and have food always available to them. Adult frogs are usually fine being fed once every three or four days, eating 4–7 insects appropriate for their size. During cooler weather, frogs do not require as much food.Remove dead insects floating in the water whenever you see them.

, Many frogs do not enjoy being touched, or can even irritate your hands or be damaged by contact with your skin.However, if your frog belongs to a species that is safe to handle and does not squirm or urinate when you pick it up, you may handle it carefully. Research your species to learn whether it is safe to handle. Even if gloves are not required, wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling, rinsing two or more times to remove all traces of soap or lotion.

They are, however, most numerous in the more tropical regions.In the entire world there are about 4,740 species of frogs. In the United States, for example, there about 90 different species of frog.;
, You want to make sure you're looking for frogs in the right season. They're most active in spring and summer, because this is when they're looking for food and spawning.In autumn the frogs tend to be trying to settle down for the colder months and for winter they usually bury themselves somewhere protected (like beneath a log) or beneath the mud at the bottom of a pond.

, Frogs take in water through their skin, so they need water around in order to keep from drying out. The water should have little to no current and should preferably be somewhat protected.Good places to check for frogs are: swampland, watersheds, or along the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.

, When you do go out looking for frogs, go to an area that has lots of insects, earthworms, minnows, and spiders. These are the types of food that frogs like to eat.

, Frogs tend to be more active at night than they are during the day. This is when they get out and hop around looking for food or for a mate. Usually when it's day they hide and wait until the sun's heat and light has passed on by.Be careful when you're hunting frogs at night, especially if it's in a more isolated area. Bring a flashlight and check out the area sometime during the day before you go that night, so that you can make a note of any potential dangers or problems.

, You do not want to scare or injure the frog. Frog species are already disappearing at a rapid rate due to changes in their habitats and encroachment by humans.


Check beneath decaying logs, in bushes, and even in piles of leaves.

, When you approach an area where frogs are living they will be likely alerted to your presence and will try to hide. They may hop into the water, alerting you to the fact that there are frogs.


Not all splashes in the water are going to be frogs, however. They could also be fish, or even snakes, so make sure that you're paying attention.

, The holes in the net must be small enough so that your frog can't fit their head through them. Frogs can injure themselves if they stick a leg or their head through a hole and get stick.


Make sure that the mouth of your net is big enough to cover the frog. Otherwise you might bring down the sides of the net on some vulnerable part of the frog.
Avoid using a butterfly net to try to catch a frog. They are built for more delicate and fragile creatures and will be too flimsy to contain the frog.

, Once you've found your frog and you want to catch it, you have to make a plan based on whether the frog is positioned on the ground or in the water. If it's on the ground you'll need to bring the net down over its body. If it's in the water, you'll need to position the net under it and scoop it out of the water.


If you've trapped it in the net on the ground, you want to put your hands gently around the frog's back and legs. You want to be holding onto the frog's hips, with its legs pointing out behind. In this position you can lift the frog and cradle it in your hand, while it's still in the netting.
If you're scooped it out of the water, you'll need to grab it gently by its hips with its legs pointing out behind it.

, If you're using your hands, you want to lower your hand without the frog noticing (this means slowly and quietly). Gently grab onto the hips and the back legs of the frog, so that it can't escape.


Avoid squeezing the frog hard. You hand just enough pressure so it can't escape, but too much pressure can hurt the frog.

, Shining a bright light at a frog in the middle of the night will cause the frog to freeze, making it easier for you to catch it. Using a flashlight will also help you locate the frog at night, because the beam of the flashlight will reflect off their eyes.

, Unless you have a permit for gigging (hunting) them, you need to return the frog to where you found it. Some frogs are protected as endangered species, so make sure that you check regulations concerning the frogs in your area.


If you want a frog as a pet it is best to get one from a licensed pet store and raise it from a tadpole.

, The more you can landscape naturally in the environment that you live in, the more likely you are to attract frogs into your very own yard. You don't even need to have lots of space to do so.Plant native forbs, shrubs, and trees to provide foliage, nectar, pollen, berries, seeds and nuts that wildlife need to survive on. Frogs are considered a good indicator of the health of an ecosystem so by attracting other animals, you'll also attract frogs.
Make sure that there is good cover for animals, especially for frogs. Cover can be things like: native vegetation, shrubs, thickets and brush piles, or even the logs of dead trees.

, Water is necessary for a frog to survive. By building a natural-seeming pond in your backyard you can entice frogs to come and stay. The size of your pond depends on how much space you have.Obviously it isn't possible for everyone to create a pond in their backyard, but you can create a water source out of a low, wide trough, or pot used for planting.
If you are going to construct a pond you'll need to consider things like how deep it needs to be (if your area freezes, for example, it may need to be deeper to keep things alive throughout winter), how to keep the algae in check (barley straw is a good natural way to eliminate algae).
You want your pond to resemble a natural pond, as much as possible. This means native plants, debris settling on the bottom of the pond, perhaps even a log or branch floating on the surface. A pond like this will balance itself naturally with minimal seasonal algae growth.

, This is basically a little ceramic house for a toad or frog. You can easily create one yourself by turning a ceramic flowerpot upside down. Create a crack or hole in one side to act as an entrance. Or you can prop it up on a rock so your frog can get in and out.Keep it in a shady spot that's close to a water source (a pond, or even a largish saucer of water).

, Keep updated on the kinds of frogs that are native to your area. Invasive frog species, such as the Cuban tree frog taking over in Florida, can eat native frogs, as well as competing with them for food and territory."

Choose your tools.,
Find a good bullfrog habitat.,
Listen for the chorus of bullfrog calls.,
Go hunting at night.,
Shine an LED light along the shoreline to find bullfrogs.,
Move slowly and quietly.,
Shine the light in their eyes to “jack” the bullfrog.,
Pounce quickly and use a firm grip.,
Put the bullfrog in a closed container.,
Let the little bullfrogs go.,
Use a five-pronged frog gig for the large bullfrogs.",How to Catch a Bullfrog1," Bullfrogs can be caught bare-handed. However, you may want to consider other tools, such as a frog gig. A frog gig is especially good for catching larger bullfrogs. If you don’t have a frog gig, a fishing net is also a good option. You’ll also need a flashlight and something to hold the bullfrogs, like a bucket.If you are catching frogs to keep in an aquarium, you may want to use a net or your hands.
A fishing net with a longer pole works best!
The brighter the flashlight, the better!
If you use a fishing pole, a fly fishing lure without a barb is a good choice.
If you're transporting the frog, consider bringing a large plastic bucket with a lid.;
, Bullfrogs dwell in freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. They tend to live where there is a tree canopy, cattails, and little to no current. Make sure you are hunting on public land during bullfrog season.Never hunt for bullfrogs in a conservation area.
Don’t hunt on private property, unless it is your own.

, Bullfrogs make a distinctive low-toned bass-like call, which sounds like a low ""Ru-u-umm - Ru-u-umm."" From early spring until summer, the male bullfrogs will sing together in a deep, roaring tone. Follow this sound to catch them., Wait until the moon comes out to go frogging. Since it is easier to see the bullfrogs at night, you’ll want to wait till it is really dark outside., Use your LED flashlight to light up the shoreline of the pond or stream. Move the beam of light slowly until you see a pair of bullfrog eyes.If the eyes are set wide apart, it is a big bullfrog., If you are walking, take gentle steps. If you are in a canoe, don’t let your paddle hit the side of the canoe. Stop and pause occasionally, since you are likely to spot frogs more easily if you search for movement on the banks or in the river or bog., As soon as you get to around 10 or 15 yards away, direct the LED light right into their eyes. This method is called “Jacking.” The bullfrog will go into a trance, like a deer in your car headlights. Use this opportunity to catch the bullfrog with your hands, frog gig or other instrument.“Jacking"" a bullfrog means using a strong flashlight directed at the frog's eyes at night.

, Since bullfrogs are quick to respond to movement, you’ll need to pounce quickly and use a firm grip. They can easily slip out of your hands, so grab them firmly around the upper thighs. You will probably only get one chance.Hold the bullfrog by grasping around the upper thighs with its legs together. This position minimizes chance of injury, while making it difficult for the critter to get away.

, Take the bullfrog off the gig, if you used one, and put it in the sack or container. Close the lid. If it is a burlap sack, pull the drawstring to close the bag. Unless you close the container or bag, the bullfrog will hop away!, If you are catching bullfrogs to eat, you should let the little frogs go! Use your hands to catch the the little ones and then put them back in the water., If you see a larger size bullfrog with eyes set wide apart, you’ll need a bigger tool! Don’t bother with the regular sized, 2-inch frog gig. Rather, pick the five-pronged frog gig to ensnare the larger bullfrogs."

Find out the bullfrog season in your region.,
Decide whether you are going bullfrog hunting or fishing.,
Get a fishing or a hunting license.,
Stay within the fishing or hunting limit.",How to Catch a Bullfrog2," You’ll need to find out the local bullfrog season for your region. Although a few places, like Texas and Florida, allow bullfrog hunting all year, most places have a few summer months designated for bullfrog hunting. Your local tackle store should be able to give you the dates for bullfrog season but, if they can’t tell you, you can always contact your local department of parks and wildlife.For instance, the bullfrog season in Kansas goes from July 1st to October 1st., Since the type of license you require to catch bullfrogs often depends on how you will catch them, you’ll need to make this decision before getting your license. Once you have an idea of what kind of fishing or hunting instrument you want to use, such as a frog gig or a rifle, you should contact your department of fish and wildlife to find out if it is legal and what type of license is required.A traditional and challenging way of catching bullfrogs is by hand, which is a lot of fun!
Many people prefer to use a six or eight-foot pole with barbed tines, which is called a frog gig. People also use fishing lines, dip nets, bows, and rifles.
If you are using a rifle, you may need a hunting license.
If you are using a fish net, you may need a fishing license.

, Call your department of parks and wildlife to find out what license you need. If you are using fishing methods to catch bullfrogs, you’ll need a fishing license. However, if you are shooting bullfrogs, you’ll obviously need a hunting license. Pay for the license that is required for your region and the instrument you want to use., Your region will have a limit on the number of bullfrogs you can catch during bullfrog season, which is typically set by the department of parks and wildlife. Give them a ring or look on the website to find out the limit for your region. It is important to stay within this limit, which will help to ensure the integrity of local ecosystems and allow you to come back and catch more frogs next season!For instance, Kansas has a limit of 24 bullfrogs.

Generally frogs are found in ponds or swamps, but can often be found in any location near clean water without a lot of current.,
Using a simple net is generally the easiest way to catch a frog.,
Position yourself once you find a frog.,
Capture your frog.,
Transfer the frog to your other hand or a bucket.",How to Catch a Frog," Muddy spots or logs in the sun are great places to see frogs. Reedy banks with shallow water also play host to quite a few frogs.


If you hear splashes when you approach a body of water, it is likely to be frogs. Try to move as quietly as possible without disturbing any reeds, branches or the like around you.
Frogs learn to be afraid of humans. If an area of frogs get a lot of people trying to catch them, they will be very shy and elusive. It may be worth finding an area that may have frogs not used to chasing them. They will still jump away--they aren't stupid--but will be easier to catch.;
,


Choose a small mesh net which can handle your quarry. The holes in the net should be small enough that even the tiniest frog would not be able to fit his head through them. Nets with large holes (such as those used in fishing) can allow frogs to stick their heads or legs through, which in turn can injure the frog. Butterfly nets are typically too flimsy to be of much use.
The mouth of the net should be round and large enough to entirely cover a frog. The mouth can be flexible, as flexibility will allow you to pursue a frog around a rock or under a log.
The rod should fit your body size, or can be a little longer than you think is normal. Extra long rods, such as those used for most butterfly nets, are generally a little long for catching frogs. Shorter rods are easier to wield.
If you're catching a frog at night, try spotlighting. Shine a bright light at a frog or toad in the middle of the night. The frog will act like a deer caught in headlights, making it easier for you to catch it.

, The way you position yourself depends on the type of terrain your frog is located in. If it is on flat ground, you will want to position yourself so that you can bring your net down directly on top of the frog, making sure that it is firmly on the ground with no holes under the mouth of the net. This is the best way to catch a frog—if you are a beginner you should attempt to find frogs that are on flat ground.


If your frog is in the water, you will want to position yourself so that you can scoop the net up and under the frog.
If you are using your hands, you will want to position yourself so that you are behind the frog. Frogs have a relatively good range of vision but cannot really turn their heads to look behind. Because you will need a bit of extra time to sneak up on them when just using your hands, being behind them is the best position for you.

, The way you do this also depends on where your frog is sitting. If your frog is on the ground, you will have placed your net over the frog. If your frog was in the water, you will have swooped the net under the frog and up.


On the ground: Now that you have placed your net over the frog, you will want to reach your hand down and place your hands gently around the frog’s back and legs. Your hand should be placed so that you hold onto the frog’s hips, with the frog’s legs pointing straight out behind it. You can then lift the frog up so that is cradled in the netting and your hand.
In the water: Now that your frog is down at the bottom of the net, it will most likely want to jump out. Either transfer the frog directly to a bucket, or gently hold the frog by its hips, so that its legs are pointing straight out behind it.
If you are using your hands: Slowly and quietly lower your hand until you are close enough to gently grab the hips and back legs of the frogs. Do not squeeze too hard, even if you are excited, because this can really hurt your frog.

, Get the frog out of the net by gently transferring it to your other hand or placing it in a bucket. If you transfer it to your other hand, hold the frog in the same way, by holding its hips so that its legs are straight out. Allow it to rest its forearms and fingers on your other hand. Holding it this way will ensure that it does not jump out of your grasp and hurt itself in the process.


If you transfer the frog to a bucket, make sure that the bucket has high enough walls that the frog will not be able to jump out. You should also make sure to put a little water in the bucket, as well as some mud and a few reeds. Doing this will make this whole ordeal a little easier for the frog, who is most likely rather scared and confused. If you keep him in the bucket for a while, you may consider placing a breathable covering (a top with holes or a mesh screen) across the top, just in case your frog gets bold and tries to escape. Be sure the lid is very secure; a determined frog can often jump higher than you would think!
If you decide you want to keep your frog, you should already have a tank set up waiting for him back at your house. Learn how to properly care for your frog here.

Note the signs of aggression.,
Solve the problem quickly.,
House the aggressive frog separately.",How to Lessen Aggressive Behavior in Poison Dart Frogs," If you have more than one frog in the terrarium, watch carefully for signs of aggression. These can include chasing one another and wrestling. Sometimes one frog will sit on top of another, preventing the one underneath from moving. It might look funny to you as an observer but it is highly distressing to both the attacking frog and the attacked frog to be worked up into such a state.;
, If you do not fix the problem quickly, the victim frog will deteriorate quickly and may sicken and even die. There are several steps that you can try:


Change the ""terrain"" or scenery of the terrarium. Consider adding new elements of interest to deflect the bullying frog's interest in the other frog. Possibly the bullying frog is in need of space or is bored. Provide new shelter spaces, extra plants and different cage furniture (for example, waterfall, pond, logs, rocks, ledges). Watch carefully to see if any of this makes a difference for the better.
Change the lighting. Dim or increase the lighting that is falling into the terrarium. It may be overwhelming or insufficient for the frogs' needs - you will have to check this by trial and error but be conscious of the origin of your poison dart frogs. Those that come from nearer to the equator will be used to more regular lengths of daylight throughout the year; whereas frogs from other regions may be more used to light variations.

, If making changes to the layout of the terrarium does nothing to alleviate the aggression, it is time to put the dominating frog in its own terrarium. It cannot be reintroduced to the other frog (or frog community) because it has now learned this behavior and will only repeat it. If you have difficulties finding space for a new terrarium, consider dividing the existing one in two. If you use something transparent, you will need to add some sort of camouflage barrier to prevent the frogs from seeing each another.

Keep your frog in an aquarium that is either all water of part aquatic and part land.,
Consult with the retailer to determine what size tank your breed of frog requires.,
Add water and plants to your tank.,
Cover your aquarium tightly so frogs cannot escape, but make sure it is well ventilated.,
Place your aquarium out of direct sun, drafts or extreme temperatures.

,
Maintain the recommended temperature for your frog using heat lamps and water heaters.,
Make sure you give your frog water that has been dechlorinated.,
Feed your frog crickets or other food recommended by the retailer, such as mealworms, insects and larvae.,
Watch your frogs for signs of illness.,
Recognize that frogs do molt, so do not take this as a sign of illness.,
Talk to your vet or the person you purchase the frog from to get an idea as to what kind of behavior is normal for your frog.",How to Care for Your Frog," The type of aquarium you need depends on your breed of frog. When you purchase your frog, ask if it is completely aquatic or not.;
, Small frogs may need only a 1 gallon (3.8 L) tank while large frogs may need 10 gallons (37.9 L).

, Consult with the store you buy the frog from as to what types of plants your breed of frog will be most comfortable with. Avoid using gravel on the bottom of your tank, as some frogs will eat this and become sick.

, A screen cover works best.

,, Make sure you find out what temperature your frog will be most comfortable in. This may range from room temperature to 80 degrees.

, Change water that is dirty, but try not to change relatively clean water too often as this may shock the frog. Changing a portion of the water every three or four days is sufficient.

, Large frogs may need baby mice. Most frogs like food that moves. Food can be supplemented with powdered vitamins. The frog should eat all it needs in about 15 minutes. Do not overfeed.

, Red leg disease is common. The frog's underside and legs turn red. Contact your vet at any signs of illness.

, Frogs also hibernate. The frog may appear to be very still and may attempt to conceal itself. Do not disturb your frog when it is hibernating. If it is breathing, it is okay.

, If your frog suddenly behaves differently, contact your vet.

Buy a tank.,
Add flooring.,
Add plants and hides.,
Pick the right foods.,
Feed them appropriately.,
Feed them once daily.,
Get a light.,
Mist their tank daily.,
Add springtails or isopods to their soil.,
Add a humidity gage and thermometer.,
Do not try to play with them.,
Only handle them to move them.,
Always wash your hands!",How to Care for Poison Dart Frogs," You are going to need a safe, relatively large space for these frogs to feel at home in. A 10 gallon tank is a good size for one frog. For every frog you buy, add 10 gallons. Most people will use an old fish tank, or go to a pet store to buy a new one. Most tanks come with a screen lid but for dart frogs, a glass lid is recommended. This keeps the humidity in so the frogs don't get too cold.;
, When constructing your frog's home, you should add a bottom layer of clay pebbles, so the humidity and water that builds up can drain into this layer. It’s ideal to lay the pebbles on an angle so the buildup of water will naturally drain to the lower end. You can remove the excess water by simply using a turkey baster. Add a substrate barrier cloth over the pebbles; this will keep the dirt from mixing into the drainage. Once you complete those steps, add soil, sphagnum moss, and quite a few dry leaves on top of that.

, Once you lay the soil, it helps the frogs feel more at home if you add plants. The plants will grow into the soil and will be cared for every time you mist the tank.


When choosing which plants to add, keep in mind they need to be rainforest native and able to handle high levels of humidity. Bromeliads and orchids are a few examples of some plants that will thrive in this setting.
Hides are places where the frogs can go at night or when they want to be reclusive. The leafs you add on top of the soil can serve as hides but adding plants with big leafs are good as well. You can also buy plastic, dome shaped hides at pet stores.

, Poison dart frogs eat a large variety of insects in their natural habitat. In captivity you have many options on what you can feed them. Flightless fruit flies should be their main diet as they are relatively easy to obtain at pet shops or online. Some may choose to use isopods, crickets, and even different types of beetles, but these flightless fruit flies seem to be the easiest.

, When feeding the frogs, there are a couple of steps you should follow.


For healthier and more active frogs, before feeding you should put the container of flightless fruit flies into a bowl.
Release the amount you want to feed your frogs into it (adults can eat up to 50, younger frogs about 25) and coat them in nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D3 powder. This gives the frogs nutrients that may be harder for them to obtain being in captivity, keeping them healthy and helping them grow.
Open the lid of the frog's tank; dump the bowl of coated flies on the soil. The frogs will notice them moving and begin eating.

, They are day feeders, so do so anytime from when you wake up in the morning to the evening. It is extremely important that you feed them every day and coat their food in nutrients so they keep from getting sick and becoming weak. Healthy dart frogs make for a better pet-owning experience.

, You should obtain a UV light to set on top of their tank. Do not use a heat lamp, it will dry out the air and if the temperature in their tank gets above 85 degrees Fahrenheit they may die. The UV light is beneficial for not only the growth of the plants but the frogs. It also allows you to spot any buildup of mold easier, along with more lighting for you to view your beautiful new vivarium and frog(s)!

, This adds humidity to their home and this is also essential to their health and survival, since they're from the rainforest. It is important you use R.O filtered water, it is best known to leave a residue. Just fill an empty spray bottle with the water and spray down the whole tank well. This also will water your plants and keep the soil damp.

, Springtails are classified as hexapods and isopods are classified as crustaceans. They are small and will help clean bacteria and stool out of the soil, keeping it nice and clean. Most of the time they will form a culture but the frogs will also eat them, so you will only need to apply them to the soil once they are no longer present.

, This is another very important step because it allows you to read the percentage of humidity inside of your tank. The humidity needs to fall between 70%-100% in order for the dart frogs to thrive. The thermometer is essential because the frogs are very sensitive. The temperature (in Fahrenheit) must stay between 72-82 degrees. Anything above or below may harm or even kill the frogs.

, Unlike other exotic pets such as reptiles or tarantulas, you should not try to hold them. They are very small and sensitive so they should be kept inside their tank at all times. If you are looking for a playful, interactive pet these aren’t the amphibians for you. They are more of a museum pet, which means they should be left alone and just observed. Don’t be discouraged, this doesn’t make owning them any less fun. They are very active, especially during feeding time.

, You should only move them when you are remodeling their tank or moving them to another tank. When you do so, scoop up the frog in your hand and cup them. Transfer them to a container that is breathable and an appropriate size. It doesn’t need to be too big, unless you will be leaving them inside of it for more than a few hours.

, Do this before and after handling them. Although these frogs are not poisonous in captivity there’s a slim chance that their skin may still secrete poison. It wouldn’t be enough to harm you but it’s best to be safe. Also wash before you handle them because you do not want to spread toxins to their skin, remember they are very sensitive.

Understand the breeding habits of northern cricket frogs.",How to Care for Northern Cricket Frogs," Since these frogs are endangered in some areas of the United States, it may not be a good idea to catch one and take it from its natural habitat.Currently, the populations of this species are increasing and stable. Make sure you do a search to find out the population levels of this frog in your area, and determine if it is safe and allowed to catch them.
Alternatively, you might consider making your own backyard a better environment for the frogs. If the population is still recovering in your area, you can help rebuild it by enriching its natural habitat. Avoid using fertilizer, and avoid cutting down vegetation surrounding any natural water sources in your vicinity.;
, Even though these frogs don’t need a lot of height, they do need a good amount of width and length in their tank or aquarium.


Most frogs do well in a 20 gallon tank, so check your local pet store for a tank this size or larger. This will allow the frog enough space to thrive.Make sure you have a lid on your enclosure. Use a soft screen lid. This will allow air to flow into the tank, while keeping the frog inside and safe.Northern cricket frogs are non-climbing frogs, so they do not need branches in their enclosure to climb on, and the enclosure does not need much height., Since these frogs normally inhabit areas near lakes, streams, ponds, and other water sources, they need moisture to thrive.Create a slight slope with the soil in the bottom of the enclosure. These frogs live on the banks of water sources, so having a slope will make the enclosure more similar to their natural habitats.Use organic soil without any chemicals or fertilizers in it. You want to make sure it is as close to the frog’s natural habitat as possible. You can also use pine bark that is easily found at any garden supply store., Use these plants to create a canopy in the enclosure. In the wild, northern cricket frogs live in areas with canopies created by vegetation, along the banks of different water sources.You can use artificial or plastic plants. You can buy these at most pet stores in the aquarium section. You can also get small hollowed out logs or rocks for your frog to hide inside of.The canopy can partially or completely cover the enclosure, but you might consider leaving some areas for light to peek through to the bottom.

, You can use a water dish or simply place water at the bottom of the slope you created with the soil. This will recreate the natural habitat of the northern cricket frog. Use clean, filtered water.


You can buy a kit that will separate your tank into two parts—land and water. This will allow you to use an automatic filter in the water.
Cleaning a frog’s tank is a lot like cleaning a fish tank, but you might have to do it more often because frogs tend to shed pretty often. A water filter will help keep the water clean between actual tank cleanings.
Regardless of how you incorporate the water, make sure there is enough of it to allow the frog to keep himself wet as needed.

, If you have a different species of frog already and want to get a northern cricket frog, give the new frog his own enclosure.You can house multiples of the same species in the same tank, but don’t overcrowd your tank. Keep only two or three frogs in any one 20 gallon enclosure.
If you choose to keep different species in the same tank, make sure the other species you choose require the same environment as the northern cricket frog. You will want to choose a species that does not need too much height, and enjoys a damp environment.

, The primary diet of northern cricket frogs is insects, particularly mosquitoes.But, as a rule of thumb, most frogs will eat and enjoy crickets as a meal.


These frogs will also eat an abundant amount of different species of water bugs and arthropods. They are generally opportunistic in what they eat, and since they dwell near fresh water sources, they will eat whatever is present in their habitat.
You could even keep some earthworms in the moist soil in the frog’s enclosure to allow the frog to eat those., Northern cricket frogs and most other frog species feed almost entirely on living, moving prey that they have to catch to eat. If the prey is dead or not moving, they may overlook it entirely.


If your frog doesn’t seem interested in the live food at first, he may just not be hungry. Leave the food in the enclosure and the frog will eat it eventually, when he wants it., You may need to feed your frog more or less than this, depending on their appetite and how fast they eat what you give them. This may take some guessing and testing at first.


Since you will likely be putting live insects into the enclosure for your frog to eat, it may take a little while for your frog to find and eat the prey.
Every frog will have different feeding behaviors. Just watch your frog during each feeding session and evaluate his needs. Start with 2 or 3 insects first, then see how fast they eat them. Deciding how much and how often to feed your frog will take some time and evaluation of your frog’s feeding habits., You can catch insects on your own, or go to a pet store to purchase insects for it to eat. Since this frog is particularly small, you will want to make sure you buy or catch very small insects for it to eat.


You can use a net to catch insects like mosquitoes and keep them in a jar with a few tiny air holes poked in the top.When you purchase insects from the pet store, they will come in a container that you can keep them in until you are ready to feed your frog. Or, you can make your own container to use and reuse to house your frog’s food. Just use a thumbtack to poke air holes in a small plastic container, to allow air in but not allow bugs out., You want to make sure your frog feels at home in its enclosure. This means maintaining the vegetation, soil, and water.


Use a spray bottle to wet the enclosure a few times a day. This frog lives in naturally damp and moist environments, so a spray bottle can help maintain this level of moisture.You can buy a product called vermiculite which retains water and slowly releases it over time. This will help keep your tank’s humidity and moisture level more stable.Your frog will need high humidity in its enclosure. The misting will help with this, but make sure to keep the enclosure relatively warm to aid in keeping the humidity level stable.
These frogs exist in the wild in many different climates, but keeping your enclosure between 75 and 80 degrees fahrenheit will keep him the most comfortable.

, Even if your enclosure is properly outfitted with a canopy of vegetation, these frogs are more likely to be active in lower light. Too much bright light could also be damaging to their vision.


Don’t put your tank in too much direct sunlight. This will cause algae to grow more rapidly and you will have to clean the tank more often.In the wild, these frogs are most active around dusk, when the light isn’t too bright, but it isn’t quite nighttime yet. If you want to catch one of these frogs, try looking around this time., Make sure to change out the water in the enclosure and clean the interior when it appears dirty. Like any other pet, this frog will require fresh water and a comfortable living environment.


Remove the frog from the tank to clean it. Keep your frog in a safe container with a vented lid while you clean the tank.
Empty the tank completely and use warm water only to clean everything in the tank, including your plastic plants. Replace the soil with new soil, and refresh the water., There are some easy to spot symptoms of sickness or injury that you should be mindful of when caring for your frog.


Sitting totally out in the open during the daylight hours, cloudy eyes, discoloration, looking very thin, and swelling of the body are all symptoms of illness.The best thing to help your frog recover is to seek advice from a vet, and to keep it safe and out of harm’s way while it recovers. , If you have a male and female cricket frog in the same enclosure, they may breed. Their breeding is aquatic, meaning it will happen in the water.If you end up with two frogs that breed, the eggs will be laid in the water. Be mindful to check for eggs before cleaning the water should you have a male and female frog in the same enclosure.Females can lay up to 400 eggs at a time in small groups of between 2-7 eggs. Monitor how many eggs your female frog lays should you breed your frogs."

Get a container to use for a habitat.,
Consider using sand in your habitat.,
Fill your container with water.,
Provide ways to provide oxygen for the tadpoles.,
Keep water at an even temperature.,
Keep temperatures consistent.",How to Care for Common Frog Tadpoles1," The best container will be rather short and shallow, rather than deep. Having a wide top allows more air to be exposed to the air, allowing oxygen into the water. Good containers can be purchased at most pet stores, and are good for small numbers of tadpoles. You can easily reuse a container of your own, however.A plastic container will be easiest to move. Glass containers are not recommended, as they may break. Metal containers, including those covered with enamel or porcelain, should not be used.
Make sure your plastic container hasn't been used to carry or store chemicals, which may damage your tadpoles.
If you have the space, plastic molded ""kiddie"" pools can provide a good living container for many tadpoles.;
, Tadpoles generally enjoy having sand on the bottom of their container. As they often feed on microbials (small life forms) found with the sand, this makes it a good choice. However, having sand in your habitat will make it more difficult to keep clean.River sand is best, as it doesn't contain salt (which is a problem with beach sand)
If you are getting sand from the beach, make sure to rinse it multiples times to remove any trace of salt from the sand.
You may also use rocks in the base of your habitat. Very tiny, round rocks can be purchased at many pet stores. Never use sharp-edged rocks, larger pebbles, or glass, as these can damage your tadpoles.

, Unpolluted pond water or fresh rain water is ideal. Never use water straight from the tap, as it may contain chemicals that are hazardous to growing tadpoles. Make sure you use enough water: ""best practice"" is to use 1 liter per tadpole.Tap water may be used only if it's been allowed to sit for at least 3 days, so that any harmful chemical will have evaporated. Don't use tap water containing fluoride unless you can treat it with reverse osmosis or another special water filter which specifically says it removes fluoride.
If you live in an area where rainwater is scarce, use bottled spring water, distilled water, or water treated with reverse osmosis.

, The two best ways to do this are to have an aerator which adds air into the water, or to grow leafy plants within the habitat. Good choices of plants are those which grow entirely under the water, have a long, stringy growing habit, and lots of small leaves along the length of the stem.If you will be collecting tadpoles from a stream, having a gentle aerator running in your habitat is a good way to provide oxygen.
If you'll be transporting the tadpoles from a stagnant pond, an aerator may be too disruptive.

, The ideal temperature for common frog tadpoles is between 59° and 68° (15°C and 20°C). If your outdoor temperatures will make this difficult to maintain, you'll need to be able to keep your tadpole habitat inside.If the temperature rises above this, pollution can be a problem.
To raise the temperature in your tadpole habitat, you may need to invest in an aquarium heater. Hanging heaters in glass tubes are the most common, but nonbreakable heaters in titanium or stainless steel can also be purchased.
To lower your tank's temperature, try positioning a fan that blows air across the water's surface. This will also increase evaporation, so make sure that you're replacing the lost water as your water cools.You can also freeze water in plastic bottles and place these bottles inside your tadpole habitat. This functions as ice cools liquid in a glass.

, If you can, remove only about 1/3 of the water from the tank as you clean it. Take care when scooping out the water and refill slowly so that the tadpoles and any material on the bottom does not get churned up.If you need to, create another container with fresh rain water in it and gently scoop up the tadpoles with a cup or net, and deposit them into the new tank.
The water you're bringing the tadpoles from should be about the same temperature as the water you're bringing them to.
Transitions between different temperature water can result in shock and death.

Collect frogspawn.,
Watch for frogspawn to hatch.,
Feed your tadpoles.,
Ensure that your tadpoles get sufficient calcium.,
Clean your tank frequently.,
Look for signs of infection.",How to Care for Common Frog Tadpoles2," You can easily capture all the frogspawn (frog eggs) you want to raise from a local pond, lake or stream. Bring a net or a bucket to this water source. When you arrive at the prepared habitat, use a small mesh net to collect and transfer the frogspawn.Make sure you can put the frogspawn directly into their new habitat.
Raise the tadpoles separately from other aquatic animals. They should get their own habitat.

, When tadpoles are first hatched, you should have a quantity of fresh pond weed, partly as food and partly as support for young tadpoles. Dried stinging nettle leaves crushed into a fine powder can also be fed to the young tadpoles.Scatter the pond weed and nettle leaves across the surface of the water.
Tadpoles eat only vegetarian fare until their legs start to grow.

, Tadpoles in the wild normally feed on algae, but this may be difficult to find where you life. Feeding each tadpole two tablespoons of boiled lettuce or spinach is a good substitute for algae. Vegetarian fish flakes are another option, but avoid any fish flakes that incorporate animal byproducts. You should feed your tadpoles twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.Add two crushed rabbit food pellets to supplement the diet of each tadpole. You don't need to feed them this more than once a day.
Twice a week, you can add some hardboiled egg yolk to their diet to provide protein.

, Calcium is necessary to build the young bones of your tadpoles. The easiest way to do this is to add 2 drops of liquid calcium per liter of water, or 4 drops per gallon.Read the label carefully to make sure it doesn't contain additives that may be harmful to your tadpoles.
Adding a piece of cuttlebone (a sea shell) to the tank will also provide a nice, natural source of calcium.

, You'll know that the water needs changing if you notice a cloudy appearance or unpleasant odor to the water. Watch for tadpoles lingering near the surface or waste settling at the bottom of the tank. Make sure that any new water is the same temperature as the water already in the tank– drastic changes in water temperature can kill your tadpoles.To clean your tank, you will need to have a second location where you can keep the tadpoles while you clean the inside of their tank.
If your water isn't very dirty, you can leave the tadpoles in their habitat, while removing about a third of the water.
Never use commercial cleaning products, which may contain harmful chemicals
A clean tank will help prevent your tadpoles from getting infected or diseased.

, Ranavirus is the most common virus to affect cold-blooded amphibians like tadpoles. Tadpoles affected by ranavirus may appear lethargic, or you might notice them swimming erratically, weakly, or on their sides.Bacterial infections are the main cause of death among frogs and tadpoles.
The best way to prevent infection is to improve your tadpoles' immune system through proper maintenance of their habitat, nutritious food, and adequate oxygen.
Signs of infection might be easiest to see by looking at the water. If you notice your water appearing cloudy yellowish-white, or a slimy series of bubbles all along the top of the water's edge, there's likely to be a higher chance of infection developing.

"
"
Watch for metamorphosis.,
Put a lid on your tadpole tank.,
Put something the frogs can climb into the tank.,
Know how long your tadpoles' metamorphosis will be.,
Know when it's time to release your tadpoles.",How to Care for Common Frog Tadpoles3," The first signs of your tadpoles' development into a full-grown frog will be the front legs (or arms) starting to bud. Soon thereafter, the mouthparts completely change. The tadpoles' gills stop functioning and their lungs start to work, so that they can breathe air. The skin changes from a smooth and slimy skin to a rougher, porous skin which allows air and water through.Internally, the tadpoles' intestinal tracks will change from the long intestine of a plant eater to the short intestine of a protein eater, which will comprise most of an adult frog's diet.
You'll see limbs containing a skeleton grow out of a body which had no limbs or bones, as the tail muscle and fin deteriorates and is reabsorbed by the body.

, As your tadpoles develop limbs, they'll be at risk of making their way out of the tank. You'll want to prevent this from happening, both for the safety of your fledgling frogs and for your human habitat!The best lid will be well-ventilated, in order to let in fresh air while still keeping your frogs safely inside.
A lid that attaches to the tank is best. Some commercial tanks come with snap-on lids, which work quite well.

, While you want to make sure your new frogs don't get out of their tank, you'll also want them the opportunity to climb from the water and use their developing lungs to breathe air. A fat stick or a wide rock that rests on the base of the tank is a good choice.Once the frog starts to use its lungs to breathe, it's unable to use its gills. Without some way to climb out of the water, the frog may drown.
Make sure the object is fixed, so that it can't move when the frog is on it.

, The common frog takes about 10 weeks to transition from tadpole to frog. At this point, the legs and lungs will have developed enough to allow the frog to emerge from the water.


These new frogs are known as ""metamorphs"". The metamorph will continue to have a small tail for a short time before it is absorbed by the rest of the body.
It will take the metamorph 2-3 years to reach breeding age.

, When your tadpoles have developed arms and legs, it's time to let them go back into the wild. Ideally, you'll be able to release your frogs back into the same area from which you took them. If you can't do this, make sure you're releasing them into an area in which the common frog is commonly found.If you aren't sure what variety of frog you've raised, check with an expert before releasing your frogs into the wild.
When you've identified your frogs, look at a frog guide to find out what habitat this species of frog typically prefers. Then locate a setting that will meet the needs of your new frogs.

Decide what animal you will write about.,
Research topics related to animal's name and appearance.,
Know animal's lifespan and breeding pattern.,
Identify animal's habitat and range.,
Learn about animal's diet.,
Notice animal's behavior.,
Get to know your animal's enemies.",How to Write an Animal Report1," You'll be spending a lot of time thinking about the animal you select, so make sure you choose one that you will enjoy! If your teacher has given you a range of animals to choose from, pick one that you feel interested in.Choose an animal about which you can find a good deal of information.
Read as much about the animal as you can, either online or in books and other resources. Encyclopedias are a great resource for learning about animals.;
, Your report should include facts about your animal's name. Most animals have a Latin name in addition to a more common name. Sometimes an animal is known by one name in English, and other names in other languages. Include this information in your report.Describing what your animal looks like will be an important part of your report. You might want to know if your animal changes appearance over the course of its lifetime. Does the male look different than the female? If so, how?
Include details about how the animal's appearance might be an adaptation to its environment. For example, polar bears developed white fur because they live on glaciers. Now that glaciers are melting, the bears' camouflage is losing its effectiveness.

, Knowing how long your animal tends to live under natural conditions will be good to include in your report. Whether the animal lives for hundreds of years (like a giant tortoise) or has a lifespan of only 24 hours (like the mayfly), this fact will be important to include.


Including information on the breeding habits of your animal will be part of showing your understanding. Does your animal have a mating season? If so, when is it?
Perhaps your animal reproduces by itself. Any information related to its breeding will be important to include in your report., Where does your animal live? Does it move around a great deal during the course of its lifetime, or does it live in a limited range? It will help your reader to know more about your animal if you include this information in your report.Knowing where your animal lives might have implications for other parts of your report. For example, if your animal migrates annually from the Arctic tundra to South America, it probably requires water stops along the way. You might want to include any information about pollution in the ponds, lakes and rivers along its migration route.
Learning about the animal's home will help you understand the animal better.

, Is your animal a carnivore, or meat-eater? Does your animal only eat plants? Or does he eat a combination of foods, depending on what he can find.Notice the way an animal's diet affects his habitat, and the other way around.
Is there anything surprising in the animal's diet? For instance, the Great Blue Whale is the largest mammal in the world, yet its diet is almost entirely comprised of tiny fish only 1-2 centimeters long., What are some interesting patterns of behavior that you've learned about your animal? Does it have different behavior in different parts of its life? If your animal is most active at night, write about this. If it spends much of its life dormant (not moving), this is interesting to know.The behavior of your animal likely affects its habitat, living area, and eating patterns.
It's good to show adaptive reasons for the animal's behavior if they're known. Continue to read and research until you find as many of the answers to your questions as possible.

, What are your animal's predators? What animals eat or otherwise kill the animal you are researching? How have the animal's predators resulted in adaptations, such as camouflage or development of protective shells?A large predator in many animals' environment is mankind. Explore the ways that human activity affects your animal.
Is this animal in danger of extinction? If so, what has happened to make this the case?

If you are interested in working for the National Parks Service either in a permanent or a temporary or seasonal role, the first thing to do is to browse the types of job opportunities that are advertised online.All National Park Service jobs are listed on the government's online job database at https://www.usajobs.gov.
Just type ""national park service"" into the search bar to see the positions that are currently open.;
, As well as many permanent positions there are lots of opportunities for an internships and student jobs with the National Parks Service. Student jobs tend to be filled locally rather than advertised nationally, so if you are interested in working part-time while you are a high school, college or graduate school student, you should contact your local park to see what possibilities there are.There are a number of specialist internship schemes for those with particular knowledge and interests, which include:


Historic Preservation Training Internships.
Geoscientists-in-the-Parks Internships.
National Park Business Plan and Consulting Internships.
Maritime Documentation Internships., There are lots of volunteer opportunities with the National Parks Service, which can be a great way to learn some new skills and find out more about how the Parks are maintained. Experience as a volunteer can be a good way to move towards a career in the Parks Service at a later date. Because there are so many possibilities for volunteers you should look first at your local park.


Use http://www.nps.gov/getinvolved/volunteer.htm to find volunteer opportunities near you.
Volunteer positions include helping with one-off events, as well as more regular and recurring work.
There are specific possibilities for youth groups, families and individuals.More than 220,000 people currently volunteer in the Parks., Once you have a clearer picture of type of job opportunities that exist in the National Parks Service, you need to think about what kind of work you are most interested in and best suited to. Because of the wide variety of jobs that exist, it is important that you really understand the requirements of the different roles. One way to do this is to find an open position, and examine the job description and required qualifications and experience.For example, a Park Ranger might be required to have a year of specialised experience as a Park Guide or tour leader, or in a relevant area of preservation, or forestry.
For a specialist role you may require a relevant degree or graduate degree in a field such as earth sciences, history or archaeology.A Visitors Service Assistant may require a year of experience in a comparable role, with experience of greeting the public and disseminating information to diverse audiences.If you see that you do not have the required experience or qualifications, you can use this as a guide for how to prepare yourself for a future career in the Parks Service.

, As well as specific requirements for certain roles there are a number of basic checks which you may have to pass to be eligible for some jobs in the National Parks Service, such as Park Ranger jobs. These checks can include physical tests to assess your fitness and physical capabilities if the role is demanding. You may also be subject to drug testing.


For some positions US Citizenship is required, so be sure to check this if it is relevant to you.
In some instances, you will be required to have a valid Driver's Licence and perhaps a qualification in first aid, or a willingness to acquire one when in post.
These requirements will vary by post, but for physically demanding positions like Park Rangers, the standards are generally high., In addition to full-time positions, which may begin at any time, thousands of seasonal employment positions become available during certain periods of the year. Summer jobs typically run from around May until September; winter jobs, much more limited, may run from October to March. Each position, however, will have a different length.


The best time to look for seasonal jobs is in the off-season, so don't wait until the summer to start looking for a summer job in the Parks.
Seasonal jobs can be filled six months before they are set to actually begin.

, Once you have found a position that you want to apply for you should approach just like any other job, internship or volunteer role. Ensure you meet the requirements and go through the application process as guided by the online application portal. If you are applying through the government's online job site, https://www.usajobs.gov, you will most likely need to create an account with the website.Before you apply ensure you do plenty of research on the Park you are applying to so you know about how it works and what the main features are.
The online account will save some of your personal details and make it quicker and easier to apply for other National Parks Service jobs in the future.
You will be contacted through your account on the website as to the progress of your application.

, Being a Park Ranger is perhaps the most popular way to work with for National Parks Service, and there is a variety of specialisms for different Rangers. In short, Rangers look after the parks and everything within them, from flora and fauna to the visitors. The responsibilities of Rangers can vary from law enforcement, to more cultural and educational roles.


Consider which of these areas you are most interested and best qualified for.
The requirements for each job vary by the specialism, so an enforcement and protection job will be more focussed on different skills and experience than a Ranger who collects scientific data., Law enforcement Rangers patrol the park, enforcing regulations, issuing citations, and conducting investigations. They may also conduct search and rescue operations, so physical fitness is an important part of the assessment process. You will need to pass a Physical Fitness Battery, which consists of a bench press test, and 1.5 mile run, an agility run, a body composition test, and a sit-and-reach flexibility test.You must have completed a Seasonal Law Enforcement Training Program within the last three years.
You will need three years of relevant experience in National Parks or law enforcement.
You should have certification as an Emergency Medical Responder.Educational qualifications will vary, but in most cases a good bachelors degree is required.

, Cultural Park Rangers will act as the connection between visitors and the Parks. The job will involve helping visitors have an educational, fun and safe experience in the park. Candidates for cultural jobs will be assessed according to their oral and written communication skills, their abilities as educators, and their customer service skills. These Rangers will need to meet the requirements of the GL-5 level, which includes:


A year of relevant experience in an area such as fish, wildlife, or recreation management, scientific work, or law enforcement.A relevant bachelor's degree with related coursework in a discipline such as conservation, botany or forestry., You can get training at one of the National Park Service's own Learning and Development Centers. There are three of these, one at the Grand Canyon, one in Maryland and one in West Virginia. If none of these centers are reachable for you, contact the National Parks Service to investigate more local training options. The National Park Service Learning and Development Centers are located at:


Horace Albright Training Center at the Grand Canyon.
Historic Preservation Training Center in Frederick, Maryland.
Stephen Mather Training Center in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia."

Organize your research.,
Decide what to focus on.,
Choose what sort of paper you will write.,
Create an outline.,
Have someone check your outline.",How to Write an Animal Report2," By this time, you'll have gathered a lot of information about your animal. Make sure that it's all written legibly or typed so that you can read it. You'll have to make sure that you've connected the information you've gathered to the sources from which it came.You might use handwritten index cards to keep track of your information, or you can use computer apps or programs such as Evernote.
If you use index cards, you can easily sort them into topics.
If there are research facts that don't easily fit into topics, set them aside. When you're done, return to this pile. Carefully go through the stack, and see if there is anything that they have in common. If not, it's okay to have a topic you can label for yourself as ""Etc.""

, Your report may be a generalized report that includes many different aspects about the animal. You can also write a more focused report, looking at particular aspects of your animal's life, habitat, breeding patters, possible extinction, etc.Your teacher's assignment will likely supply more information on how to focus your paper.
No matter what sort of focus you bring to your report, it should open with an introduction to your animal. The appearance and name should be in the introduction.

, Think about the kind of class you're in. Are you writing your animal report for a general science class? If so, you may want to keep your report to an descriptive paper about your animal. If you're writing for a class in environmental science, you probably want to include more information about the threats to the animals' habitat or changes in environment. You may wish to write an analysis essay, a persuasive paper, or an argumentative essay.For any style of writing, you'll need to include your research results. However, the research that you include may vary depending on the way in which you organize your paper.
Consider using a graphic organizer to help you., Once you've completed your initial organization of research, you're ready to make an outline of your paper. All reports should include an introduction, followed by the report body, and closed with a brief summary and conclusion. Whether your animal report is 5-7 paragraphs (the standard length for learning report-writing) or 20 pages (an undergraduate thesis), this format should apply.A topic outline doesn't have to be made up of complete sentences, but your intentions should be easily understandable.
Use your sorted research notes to help you write your outline. For example, if you have a topic called ""Habitat"" for your animal, make notes about the habitat location, environmental needs, environmental threats, and the way the animal interacts with its habitat for your outline.

, Having a teacher, a parent, or a friend check your outline will often help you know if you've gone off track before you start the task of writing your report. If you need more information on how to make an outline, check with your teacher.You may wish to include your thesis sentence in your outline. A thesis sentence is like a topic sentence for your animal report. It sums up your idea about the full report.
Make sure that your proofreader can tell the purpose of your report. What were the words that the teacher used in her assignment? Make sure your report is on the right topic.
Does your outline include an introduction, a body, and a closing? This is a good time to check and make sure all your report's parts are present.

Write a rough draft of your report.,
Check your spelling.,
Correct your grammar.,
Write your final version.,
Include your sources and references.,
Proofread your final report.",How to Write an Animal Report3," Your first draft, or ""rough draft"" of your final report is not meant to be perfect. Just do the best you can at including all the information you found about your animal when doing your research. Write one sentence at a time, and follow your outline.Make sure your paper is the right length. If you're supposed to turn in a 10-page paper, your rough draft should be about that long.
Keep your notes organized as you write. Make sure that you note all sources.

, When your draft is complete, go back through and check your spelling. If you have spellcheck on your computer, turn this on and check all words that are highlighted as ""misspelled"".Notice that your word may need to be added to your word program's dictionary if it doesn't recognize it. Sometimes words that appear misspelled to your computer are actually spelled correctly.
Look for habitually misspelled words. Everyone has certain words that she regularly misspells. If you know your own habits, you'll be more likely to avoid repeating your errors.

, Your computer's spellcheck doesn't check for grammar or parts of speech. When words have multiple spellings, such as they're, their or there, you'll need to identify the correct word by grammatical context.Read your paper aloud. You'll often notice out-of-place words or typos when reading aloud.
Make sure you've left enough time to carefully go through your paper before turning it in.

, Writing your final draft means going back and rewriting the rough draft of your paper, making all the changes in spelling and grammar that you've noticed. Follow the rules of good writing. Use active verbs, and don't make your sentences too long.Watch for fragment sentences, run-on sentences, and other common errors of writing.
Remember the tip of reading out loud. If you're not sure if a sentence is good or not, read it out loud. Your ear may be able to tell you what your eye can't.
Take a break as you need to.

, Your sources and references will all be available from your research notes. Don't forget to transfer these references to your final paper. Giving credit to your research sources is an important part of completing your animal report.If you are at a university, your teacher may want you to use a certain kind of citation, such as Chicago or MLA format. Make sure you know what's expected from your teacher.
If you aren't expected to use any particular format, just make sure that you're including the author's name, the title of the source you are using, and the date it was published.

, Once you've completed the writing, take a break to rest your eyes. Then, return and proofread to make sure that you've written the best paper you can write.Have you included the basics? Is your name on the report? If your teacher requires page numbers, are they included? Is your report legible?
Try to avoid proofreading at the very last minute before you must turn in your paper. Leave yourself time to make corrections if necessary.
Have a friend or your parent read it for you, if you have time. Sometimes another person will see errors you've missed.

Check other common venues for job postings.,
Consider which positions you are willing to work in.",How to Work With Animals at a Zoo," This will be especially valuable if you’re doing tasks such as cleaning cages and helping care for the various domestic animals. This practical training will appeal to zoos and show that you’re willing to perform the tedious roles that come with caring for animals., This will often allow you to get hands-on experience with wild creatures in a much shorter time than it would take at a zoo. At a rehabilitation center, you can feed baby birds and mammals, bandage injured animals, provide public-information talks, or help maintain endangered-animal databases.Volunteer positions are great ways to build up your experience working with animals in a professional setting.
If there is not a wildlife rehabilitation in your area, there are many other locations to volunteer at, although these may not all feature wild animals.Check if you can volunteer at: local farms, horse stables, or veterinary offices (especially with vets who specialize in large animals).

, Most of today’s zoos are no longer run for the primary purpose of displaying exotic animals that most people would otherwise never see. Today’s zoos serve as a way to preserve endangered species.


Endangered species groups work to preserve animal habitat, and also to educate the public about the plight of endangered animals—whether they are harmed through poaching or through continual habitat loss.Volunteering with an endangered species is a great way to gain experience, especially if the endangered species is of particular interest to you.
Endangered-species work will also look attractive on your resume to your potential employers at a zoo.

, Specifically ask about their education and experience. When you talk to them, as specific questions like:


“What was your college major? Do you think this major helped you get your animal-keeper job, or would another have been more helpful?”
“How many years of animal-related experience do zoos look for when hiring a zookeeper?”
“What does the majority of your day-today work look like?”

, This is an excellent way to get hands-on experience in working with exotic animals and develop an understanding of the actual work involved in maintaining happy, healthy animals in a zoo setting.


These departments will acquire animals, whether by purchasing them from other zoos, or working with police to confiscate endangered or threatened animals that are illegally owned (e.g. in a private residence or an illegal circus).
Internships are available as both paid and volunteer positions. If you only qualify for the volunteer internship and can afford to do it for no pay, take the opportunity. The experience will prove valuable in the future.

, Whatever level of school you are in (even middle school or high school), you can study animals and the ways that zoos breed, train, raise, and care for their animals.Read whatever books you can find about animals, especially if the books relate to a specific type of animal that holds your interest or discuss zoos and the animals who live there.

, Most zoos require their exotic animal care specialists to have a minimum of a Bachelor’s of Science in Zoology or Animal Science (or a related field, such as Animal Husbandry).Although four-year degrees in Animal Husbandry or Zoology are most common, there are colleges that offer two-year Associate degrees in related fields.
Even if you are not planning to attend a two- or four-year college, you can still enroll in individual zoology courses through a community college.

, Even if you’re already majoring in Zoology or Animal Science, you can still take classes that delve into animal-related topics outside of your own major. This will look good on your resume and show that you have a broad awareness of how to work with animals.Take courses like:


Specialized biology topics like mammalogy, herpetology, etc.
Wildlife and forestry.
Ecology and ethology (topics of animal behavior).

, Familiarize yourself with the tasks frequently performed by zookeepers and, whenever possible, perform them yourself (in an academic or volunteer setting). As a zookeeper working directly with animals, you’ll need to be able to:Prepare the food for animals, and often feed them.
Shovel and dispose of animal excrement, and keep their cages clean.
In some cases, you’ll need to answer visitors’ questions about animals, and show visitors certain features of animal behavior and habitat.
Apply rudimentary veterinary knowledge to the animals in case they are injured or ill.

, This is a great resource. Look for for volunteer job openings that you are qualified for, and apply for the job. Getting a foot in the door and proving your abilities and willingness to help may help in getting that coveted job later. Some of the most common volunteer openings in a zoo are:


Grounds-keeper assistant
Gift shop attendant
Special events or fundraiser assistant
Children’s zoo volunteer
Maintenance worker

, Since most zoos draw their zookeepers from a relatively small group of people (e.g. animal enthusiasts), they will often advertise these positions in publications related to animal science.Specifically, check zoo-based job listings in:


The Zoo News Digest website.

Cage & Aviary Birds magazine

International Zoo News magazine

, There are other zoo-based jobs, other than simply being a zookeeper, which will allow you to work closely with animals.Unless you are determined to be a zookeeper specifically, consider planning to work as a:


Veterinarian or animal-health technician.
Field researcher or research assistant.
Animal behaviorist or animal trainer.

Remember to keep these frogs separate.,
Obtain a tank the right size.,
Choose a substrate or bare-bottom habitat.,
Check the temperature.,
Supply hiding places and other décor.,
Maintain your tank.",How to Care for African Clawed or Dwarf Frogs1," Although the living conditions for both types are frogs are similar, it is crucial for you to keep ADF and ACF frogs separate from one another. When ACFs grow to be full-sized, they will actually eat smaller creatures like ADFs., The only major difference between tanks for ACFs and tanks for ADFs is the size of the tank and the amount of water it holds. For ACFs, a good rule or thumb is to have ten gallons of non-chlorinated water per frog. For ADFs, the rule is to have only one gallon of non-chlorinated water per frog. This is quite a big difference!A filtered tank is your best option.
You can get away with an unfiltered tank if you clean it thoroughly every two weeks.
Be sure to secure the lid on your tank. These frogs are known for trying to escape., Both types of frogs enjoy either a substrate made of rocks or a bare-bottom tank. Be sure to use rocks too large for the frogs to eat. (For ACFs, you’ll want large river rocks and for ADFs, medium sized rocks). Bare-bottom tanks may not be as pretty too look at, but they are much easier to keep clean., ACF and ADF frogs thrive in similar temperatures. When they are froglets, you should aim for temperatures between 74 -78F (23-25C). When frogs are adults, aim for temperatures between 70-75F (21-24C ).


As long as you maintain a warm temperature in your home, you should not need to use a fish tank heater (although that is an option).
Frogs can survive as long as the temperatures stay between 65F and 80F (18 and 26C).

, Both types of frogs need hiding places in their tanks, such as terracotta pots, caves, driftwood, and silk plants. Without adequate places to hide and recharge, frogs can actually become stressed to the point of death.Avoid both real and plastic plants. Both can be toxic to these frogs.
Stick to silk plants.

, In order to keep your frog habitat healthy, you will need to do some daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance. Each day, you must check the filter, water temperature, and any other equipment. Each week, you must check the overall water quality. Finally, and most importantly, once a month, you must remove 10-25% of the total water volume and replace it with fresh water."

, Volunteering at animal shelters or human societies can give you hands-on experience working with animals and prepare you for your future career.


Remember, any experience you plan on submitting to a college as evidence of your commitment and work ethic needs to be well documented. Be sure to obtain proof of your involvement in these activities, and request letters of reference.It may also be helpful to have experience interacting directly with horses, so try working, volunteering, or interning at a stable, or even participating in activities like horseback riding.

, The college application process is lengthy and involved, so get started on it as early as you can.Expect to fill out information about extra-curricular activities and compose a personal essay. Keep track of any community service or volunteer work you may have done—many colleges will look specifically for evidence that you’re donating your time to worthy causes.


Most high schools have guidance counselors who will walk you through the application and admissions process. Take advantage of this and any other resources your high school provides for prospective college students.

, As an undergraduate, enroll in a pre-veterinary program of study to prepare for veterinary school. Expect the courses to be demanding and science-heavy with a heavy emphasis on biology. But beyond just being challenging, pre-veterinary programs will give you hands-on experience and allow you to make connections within your field. You can even join clubs within your program to get advice from older students and teachers. Graduating from a pre-veterinary program typically takes 4 years.


Every veterinary school's expectations of an undergraduate's coursework are different. If your undergraduate college doesn't have a specific pre-veterinary track, consult with an academic adviser and take a science-heavy course load. This typically takes 4 years.

, The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) is the main body of accreditation for veterinary schools. It represents more than 89,000 professionals in the veterinary field, and while it’s not a requirement that every veterinary school be accredited, the vast majority of well-respected schools have opted for AVMA accreditation. Accredited schools are held to higher standards of education and obtaining a certification from an accredited program can make it easier to find a job.Depending on your veterinary school of choice, you may need to take the Veterinary College Admission Test (VCAT) exam before applying. This is a standardized test designed to indicate an applicant's level of readiness for graduate level coursework and your scores may determine your eligibility or likelihood of acceptance.

, Here, you will earn your Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree (DVM). You’ll learn about things like diagnostic procedures, radiology and imaging technology, and preventative techniques. This degree typically takes 4 years to complete.

, In your last year of school, gain additional experience while completing your DVM degree by pursuing clinical rotations that focus solely on veterinary medicine for equines. Fourth year clinical rotations are a crucial preparation for your day to day work as an equine veterinarian. You should expect it to be challenging yet informative, as you’ll be working directly under a certified veterinarian., In order to legally practice equine medicine and be licensed, you’ll have to take and pass the board exam. Like many other professions, becoming a veterinarian means you have to be board certified. Passing the state veterinary board exam can be difficult, so be sure to study and take advantage of any preparatory classes that may be available., After finishing the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree and licensing, many graduates choose to pursue a one-year internship. Internships can hone your diagnostic and therapeutic skills and boost your chances of finding a job.These paid, hands-on opportunities can be found through networking or listings through the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) or the American Association of Veterinary Clinicians., After completing an internship, some people choose to specialize even further within their discipline. The American Board of Veterinary Practitioners recognizes several subspecialties within equine veterinary including sports medicine, radiology, theriogenology, large animal surgery or equine internal medicine.


Before you can apply for certification, you must complete a residency program that typically lasts 2-5 years and is best carried out at an accredited equine specialization facility. These programs are designed to familiarize you with large animal veterinary practice and to prepare you for certification within your specialty. Sometimes you’ll be required to work with other large animal species as well, but the majority of your residency will be spent working directly with horses.Certification will be complete once you have passed the 4-part exam. Upon passing, the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners will recognize you as an equine specialist!

, Most equine veterinarians work in private practice, but many others work for the government, in labs, or in classrooms as educators. Read testimonials by professionals working in these different work environments to find out which one is best suited to your talents.


As of 2015, the median salary for equine veterinarians was about $88,000 dollars, but this salary can vary depending on which working environment you choose. It’s important to consider how much you’ll need per year to support your lifestyle before applying to jobs., Once you’ve determined what type of job you’re interested in, gather the necessary paperwork documenting your various internships, residency, and applicable experience. Once you feel confident in your resume,seek out and apply for jobs in your area.


If you like the people you worked with during your internship or residency, and you feel like you made a good impression, try applying there first.

, Once you’ve landed your first interview, dress appropriately (when in doubt, business casual is usually a safe bet), and emphasize your strengths to your interviewer. Most employers end up hiring people who are inventive or offer solutions to problems, or who they believe will add value to their practice.Think back on your experiences and review your qualifications to communicate your worth to your would-be employer.


If you don’t get a job right away, don’t take it personally. Be persistent in seeking out new opportunities and applying to jobs—perseverance is key!

Buy from a reputable pet store.,
Look for a healthy, clear skin.,
Choose a lively, animated specimen.,
Wear gloves when you handle your frog.,
Always buy captive bred (CB) frogs.,
Keep only one frog in the tank.",How to Care for an Ornate Horned Frog1," If you can, visit a couple of different pet stores before you decide on a frog. Stores have different quality standards of care, so some stores will have healthier frogs than others. Buy the healthiest, most robust specimen you can find – it will be easier to care for, and is likely to live longer.Only buy a frog if its tank is clean, with no feces floating in the water. Poor sanitary conditions lead to sick frogs.;
, Skin that appears clouded may be a sign of illness. A milky or cloudy looking skin might simply be a sign of recent shedding, as these frogs shed and eat their skin periodically. But to be on the safe side, start with a clear-skinned frog.Ornate Horned Frogs are usually medium to dark green or yellow in color, with patches of red and black.
Cranwell's Horned Frogs – a specialized variety bred in captivity – can also be brown, beige, orange, yellow, and even albino.

, Approach the frogs, and pass your hand near them in front or on top of the tank. A healthy frog will react by rapidly moving the sac under its mouth, and may make a “mooing” sound. If you don't get a reaction, the frog is probably unhealthy.Look for frogs that seem alert and have clear, bright eyes.

, A frog's skin is a delicate membrane that acts as a secondary breathing organ. The oils on human skin can be harmful or even toxic to a frog's skin.


Pet frogs are for looking at – they don't want human love or affection.
Frogs don't like to be held, and will sometimes make loud distress calls to let you know they are upset.
Ornate Horned Frogs will try to eat anything that comes near their mouth, and they will bite your finger.

, Wild caught (WC) frogs are unsuited to captivity, and suffer from stress. Therefore, it is considered cruel to keep them.


Wild caught frogs often carry parasites or diseases, which will infect your other frogs.
Wild caught frogs are often old, so you won't have as much time to enjoy your frog.

, Most frogs are cannibalistic; large frogs often eat smaller frogs. It's dangerous to put more than one Ornate Horned Frog in the same tank. One is very likely to eat the other, especially if they are different sizes.Never mix different types of frogs in one tank, as each species of frog has its own particular care needs.

Determine how often you should feed.,
Serve food the right size.,
Sprinkle pellet food in the tank.,
Provide bloodworms, brine shrimp, and mysis shrimp.",How to Care for African Clawed or Dwarf Frogs2," How often you should feed your frog will vary depending on the species. ACF tadpoles should be fed daily, while adult ACFs should be fed every 2-3 days. As ADF frogs are smaller in size, they must eat smaller quantities of food more often. Both ADF tadpoles and ADF adults should be fed 1-2 times per day., In general, ACFs and ADFs can consume the same diet. The only major difference is that ADFs must have their food broken down into much smaller pieces for them. Additionally, ADFs will consume much smaller portions.There is not an exact science to portion sizes for frogs.
Start with a small amount of food at each feeding, and gradually increase until you have an understanding for how much your frog likes to eat.

, Both ACFs and ADFs can eat pellet food for aquatic life. You can find this pellet food at any pet store. Pellet food is particularly important for tadpoles of either species, but it should also be a staple component of adult frog diets. Simply sprinkle a small amount in your frog’s tank at each feeding.You will want “sinking pellets.”
Do not feed your frogs “flake” fish food.

, Bloodworms, brine shrimp, and mysis shrimp are other staples in the diets of ACF and ADF frogs. Look for these items at your local pet store. You may find them fresh, dried, or frozen, all of which are good options for your frogs. If you have ADF frogs, be sure to break up the food into small pieces.When using frozen food, be sure to thaw beforehand.

Understanding the size difference.,
Research laws in your state.,
Evaluate the eyes.,
Look at the claws and webbing.",How to Care for African Clawed or Dwarf Frogs3," Although ACFs (African Clawed Frogs) and ADFs (African Dwarf Frogs) look almost the same when they are small, ACFs will grow very large as they age. As a result, they must be kept in larger tanks, and cannot be kept with small fish or frogs (including ADFs). In short, it is crucial to know if you are dealing with ACF or ADF frogs., Additionally, ACFs have been outlawed in some places. In certain areas, these frogs have gotten into the water supply and gobbled up everything in sight. If you would like to keep ACFs as pets, be sure to research the regulations in your area.For example, ACFs are currently illegal to own in California and Oregon.

, Although the differences in these frogs are subtle (when they are young), there are a few notable characteristics you can look for. The first has to do with the eyes. ACFs will have “buggier” eyes that protrude a bit, while ADFs will have flat eyes that do not stick out. Also, ACFs will have eyes positioned on top of their heads, while ADFs will have eyes on the sides of their faces., Another way to distinguish these types of frogs from one another is to take a look at their claws. ACFs will have claw-like front hands. ADFs, on the other hand, will have dark colored, claw-like back feet. Additionally, ADFs will have webbing between the fingers of all four hands, whereas ACFs will only have webbing on their hind legs.The claws will become more defined as they age, so this is not the easiest way to tell the difference in very young frogs.

Buy a 10-gallon glass aquarium.,
Provide a deep substrate for your frog to burrow in.,
Provide a water bowl.,
Add foliage for decoration.,
Add a heat source.,
Moderate tank temperature.",How to Care for an Ornate Horned Frog2," Ornate Horned Frogs are native to tropical and mountain rain forests, so they need an aquatic/terrestrial habitat. Glass aquariums are easy to clean and you can watch your frogs through the glass.These frogs aren't jumpers, so you don't strictly need a screened lid on top. However, a lid is still a good idea because it helps keep the tank warm.

, Your frog feeds by “ambushing” its food, meaning it will hide in the deep substrate until prey comes near, then jump out and attack. Be sure the substrate is slightly moist at all times, never soggy or completely dry.Good substrate materials include coconut husk fiber (Bed-a-beast, Eco-earth, Forest Bed, or similar products.)
Soil is a good option because it stays moist and allows your frog to dig. It looks natural, as well. Be sure to purchase safe soil that does not contain pesticides, vermiculite, perlite, or any other harmful chemicals.
Cypress mulch, sphagnum moss, and leaf litter are not generally recommended, because your frog can choke on a piece of bark or moss. If you use these items, you'll need to feed using tweezers or tongs.
Never use sand, gravel, or fir bark as substrate.

, Add a large, shallow bowl to the tank, which should be filled with water at all times. Always use de-chlorinated water – tap water will harm your frog.Glazed ceramic trays that come with flowerpots make excellent water dishes.
Most frogs defecate into their water dish, so be sure to replace the water at least daily.
Place little stacks of rocks next to the bowl and in the water, so your young frog can climb in and out.

, Horned Frogs don't need foliage to hide, because they burrow into the deep substrate on the bottom of the tank. But you can add artificial or real plants, if you want to make the tank look nice.Real plants can be difficult to grow indoors, and will need to be thoroughly washed and disinfected before you add them to the terrarium.
Artificial plants are easier to keep clean, and you can buy a wide variety of these online or at a pet store.
Air plants are living plants that do not require soil or water, apart from an occasional misting. Keep them away from harsh sunlight and heat lamps, or they will dry out., Position a low-intensity (15 watts) heat lamp over the terrarium, above the highest point in your frog's habitat. Be sure there is a screen lid to the tank between your frog and the heating bulb.Don't use under-tank heaters or heated rocks in your Ornate Horned Frog tank.

, Horned frogs will thrive in a fairly large range of temperatures, and do not require careful humidity adjustments like most amphibians. Their tank should be between 75°F (24°C) and 84°F (29°C) during the day, and a few degrees cooler at night.Hang store-bought temperature strips on the side of the tank to measure environmental conditions.

The ""busy season"" for wildlife centers starts in the spring. This is when baby animals are born, and the boom continues through the summer. Most places have limited acceptance periods, so they can have a trained staff on hand for spring. Think about volunteering at a couple different places to see which kinds of animals you’d like to work with., Your experience might include doing office work, helping to fundraise, or assisting with some of the animal care. At first, you will not be doing much with animals, but you might be helping to prepare food or ready or clean cages or bedding. As you get more experience, you might be able to do more hands-on work with the animals. You will need to meet these basic criteria before beginning:Be 18 or older
Fill out a volunteer form for the center
Have enough time to do a shift per week, minimum (usually 4 hours)
Participate in annual trainings
Be willing and able to transport injured animals

, You might think that you want to train to be a wildlife rehabilitator, but it might be different than you imagine. Ask a wildlife rehabilitator if you can interview him or her to get a sense of what they actually do every day.Some sample questions might be:


What does a typical day look like?
How did you get into wildlife rehabilitation?
What is the most difficult part of your job?
What kinds of suggestions do you have for me?

, Do you want to try and get a job at one of the centers where you have volunteered? Talk to them to see if they are planning to hire any time soon. Are you planning to do a broad search? You can search internationally here Do you want to start your own rehabilitation center? How will you do that? If you want your own center, where will you get the money to purchase and build the facility? Make sure you are prepared for what your job prospects might be.

, Even though for some positions a college degree is not required, it is for most. A major in a biology-related field, including coursework on mammology, ornithology, animal behavior, and ecology would be the best preparation for becoming a wildlife rehabilitator. These courses would give you a background in the way animals function and their environment., This is a year(or more) in which your hours are carefully documented and cataloged, followed by a test. Most states will require this time period before you are able to be licensed.

, They will have a list of the requirements for becoming a wildlife rehabilitator. It’s common for the list to include specialized training regarding the animals you want to work with, exams to demonstrate proficiency, and possibly participation in a mentorship program., Most states require wildlife rehabilitators to have a license issued by the Game and Wildlife Department. Make sure you have all of the qualifications before you apply for the license. Some of the requirements may include:Veterinarian training, or a period of apprenticeship working in a wildlife rehabilitation center
Passing a wildlife rehabilitation exam for the species you will deal with
Completed application

, Keep in mind it might take a while, and it might not be full-time. You can search one database here for possibilities:http://www.nwrawildlife.org/networking/ Hopefully you’ve been able to network and meet enough people during the time you were volunteering and training that you have a group of people in the field that know you. Keep up with these people as you look for a job. If you want to work at one particular location, keep in contact with them until they have an opening, and always let them know that you are ready to help at any time.

, Most wildlife rehabilitators work closely with a veterinarian to care for wild animals in their care. As a wildlife rehabilitator, each day is likely to be different as you care for a variety of hurt and sick animals. You will be caring for traumatized or wounded animals, new babies whose parents cannot care for them, animals who are disabled in some way, all of whom are wild and undomesticated. Each case will require strong knowledge of animal behavior and biology as well as a medical expertise to make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan., Stay in touch with the other people in your network involved in wildlife rehabilitation. Take courses to stay current in your licensing. Read about the latest innovations and discoveries. Think about whether you want to stay in your current position, or if you want to change in the future -- perhaps to open your own center once you’re an experienced wildlife rehabilitator."

Keep feeding areas out of a cat's reach.,
Place motion activated sprinklers in your yard.,
Plant cat-deterrent plants.,
Use commercial cat deterrents and repellents.,
Put out natural scents that deter cats.,
Make a perimeter around your yard.",How to Protect Small Yard Animals from Cats1," One way you can protect small animals in your yard is to place areas where you feed them out of reach of cats. For example, place bird feeders in locations that a cat cannot reach even by climbing. This is usually at least 10 feet from shrubs or other areas where a cat could hide.Placing bird feeders away from all hiding places can be difficult in yards that have lots of bushes and hiding places. If this is a problem for you, you can try fencing off the area under the feeder to slow down cats that may try to sneak up on birds or squirrels.;
, In order to deter cats from coming into your yard you can place motion activated sprinklers that will soak a cat if it walks by. Water is a good deterrent for cats and it will hurt anything but their pride.Remember, however, that motion activated sprinklers can be set off by other animals, such as the wild animals that you want in your yard and humans that forget to turn off the sprinkler before coming in the yard.

, There are some plants that you can put in your yard that will protect small yard animals from cats because they are spiky or prickly. Planting one of these plants, such as holly, under areas where you feed wild animals can be very helpful in keeping cats at bay.There are also plants, such as herb rue, lavender, pennyroyal, and lemon thyme that cats do not like the smell of. Planting these in areas where you have a lot of wildlife activity can help protect that wildlife from cats.The key is to put plants in your yard that will make hiding and stalking small animals more uncomfortable for cats. If you have a very persistent cat that always hides in the same place, consider replacing what is there with a holly bush. Hiding in a holly bush will be very uncomfortable for that cat.

, There are products that you can use to keep cats out of your yard. One product is an ultrasonic cat deterrent that claims ot emit ultrasonic noises that cats do not like, but that do not bother other animals or humans. Putting one of these up can potentially keep unwanted cats out fo your yard.There are also chemical repellents that you can spray around your yard. These give off smells that keep cats away.
Commercial deterrents and repellents can be found at most large pet stores, big box stores, or from online retailers.

, There are some products that you may have in your house that can keep cats away from the small animals in your yard. These are strong smelling products that cats do not like the smell of, such as citrus, vinegar, and essential oils.Simply put your strong smelling product in a spray bottle and spray along the edge of your property and on the ground in areas where wildlife congregates.
If you choose to use a strong smelling deterrent, you may need to reapply it regularly. This is especially true if you live in an area where it rains, as this can wash away your deterrent.

, To deter cats from entering your yard, you can make access more difficult. Putting up a fence the doesn't have a top edge cats can walk on can limit a cat's access to your yard. Fully fencing the yard with a tall fence will make it less likely that cats will come in. However, they still may occasionally find their way over the fence.Making a complete perimeter around your yard may also limit the number of wild animals from entering it, such as raccoons or squirrels. However, birds may find it a wonderfully safe refuge.
Putting a tall fence around your yard may not keep cats out completely but it will make it less likely that cats simply wander in.

Feed your growing frog insects and worms.,
Feed your adult frog larger prey items.,
Supplement their diet.,
Watch your fingers.,
Keep the tank clean.",How to Care for an Ornate Horned Frog3," Juvenile Horned Frogs will enjoy small earthworms, crickets and wax worms. They need to eat live prey, so this may not be the pet for you if you are squeamish.Feed juveniles 2-6 food items, at least 2-3 times per week.

, Adult horned frogs can handle larger foods such as night crawlers, roaches, superworms, silkworms, earthworms, locusts, crickets, mealworms, feeder fish, slugs and snails.Adults can be feed once per week, or even once every two weeks, if you provide large quantities of food items.
During aestivation periods, adult Horned Frogs will go as long as four months without food, if fed heavily beforehand.
You can feed pre-killed pinky or larger mice to your frog occasionally, but they should not be a regular part of your frog's diet. Do not feed your frog live mice or other vertebrates.

, In addition to a well-rounded diet, rub calcium and vitamin D3 supplement powder onto their food. You can purchase amphibian vitamin supplements online or at your local pet store.Juvenile Horned Frogs should get supplement powder at least 2-3 times per week.
Adult frogs should get vitamin-dusted meals at least once per week.

, Ornate Horned Frogs are not picky eaters, and they will bite anything you put near their mouth including your finger. Although they don't have teeth to speak of, they have strong jaws and their bite can be very painful.If your frog bites you, resist the urge to jerk away. You may accidentally fling your frog across the room and injure him.
If your frog does not let go within a few seconds, try running cold water over him until he releases his grip.
Clean your finger with antiseptic and apply a bandage.

, Once a month, remove your frog from its tank and place it in a small holding tank. Thoroughly wash all surfaces with hot water. Wash the items in the tank with hot water as well, and let everything cool before you put it back.Use gloves when moving your frog to a holding tank. The natural oils in your skin are very harmful to frogs.
Never use chemicals to clean. When cleaning the frog's enclosure, never use chemicals. Even trace amounts of chemicals can burn or kill your frog.

Investigate the different types of work you could do. These include government agencies or other public and private institutions such as universities or museums, or even with pets.Helping animals, their owners, and participating in research projects that help animals or even humans can be incredibly rewarding and make this career path seem less like a “job.”;
, Before you decide to pursue becoming an animal behaviorist, consider meeting someone who is already one. This may help answer questions you have and get you started on the right path, but also guide your goals for the future.Ask questions about how she pursued her career. Inquire about her education and any practical experience she had.If you enjoy learning and striving for specific goals, being an animal behaviorist could be a great option for you.
Ask her if it would benefit you to work or volunteer in places such as zoos, research labs, or at vets’ offices., Consider the ways in which being an animal behaviorist fits into your lifestyle. Factors such as your ultimate goals, time, location, potential demands, and salary may help guide your decision and shape your career path. You might want to ask yourself some of the following questions:


Are there physical demands? Depending on your work location and environment, you may be sitting or standing for long hours.Are there emotional demands? If you get easily attached to animals, you may want to consider if it will be easy to separate yourself from the animal in order to do your job effectively.
Does being an animal behaviorist fit your personality? Working with animals, their owners, colleagues, authorities or public organizations can be a significant part of your job. If you’re interested in working as a researcher, you may spend significant amounts of time by yourself in a lab.
Ask yourself if you prefer to have day-to-day contact with animals and their owners, or if you'd be happier working strictly with animals and other scientists, such as in a research facility.What is the compensation? Animal behaviorists earn on average $61,640.This amount can differ according to your experience and location. Be aware that there may be strong competition for jobs as animal behaviorists, especially within academia., You will need to finish your Bachelor’s degree to pursue a graduate degree or career as an animal behaviorist. Take courses specific to a major in animal behavior or get a degree in a related field such as biology, zoology, psychology, neural sciences, or anthropology.Some universities offer programs towards a Bachelor’s degree in animal behavior science.
If your university doesn't have a degree program in animal behavior science, consider getting your education in one of the two fields most directly involved with being an animal behaviorist: ethology and comparative psychology.Ethologists, who are often considered a sub-branch of zoology, specifically study animal behavior, and usually receive training in university departments such as biology, zoology, entomology, or other animal sciences.Other fields closely associated with animal behaviorists are behavioral ecology and anthropology.Take classes that complement being an animal behaviorist. For example, if you are a biology major, you may also want to take classes in psychology and anthropology to expand your understanding of the field.

, Most positions as animal behaviorists require advanced degrees such as a Master of Arts or Science (MA or MS), a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) or Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) once you’ve finished your Bachelor’s degree.Getting the right education ensures that you have mastered the required information to optimally perform the job of being an animal behaviorist.Get a graduate degree. Since most animal behavior scientists teach and do research at universities or colleges or in government labs or other institutions, you will probably want to get a graduate degree. Most of these institutions require a PhD, though some may only ask for an MA or MS.Be aware that some universities, such as Indiana University, offer programs specific to becoming an animal behaviorist.The Animal Behavior Society offers a guide to educational programs and other opportunities in animal behavior studies and related fields at http://www.animalbehaviorsociety.org/web/downloads/ProgramsAnimalBehavior-Feb-21-2008.pdf.

, Either while you’re obtaining your education or immediately thereafter, consider getting an internship or job that will add practical experience to your coursework.Your university or college can help you find an internship or a residency to complement your education.Understand that many degree programs and employers may require internships or residencies to graduate or start a job.Diversify your internship experiences. This will give you an overview of the different types of work you could do and help you figure out what suits you best. For example, you may want to work for your university lab and pursue an internship at a zoo or government institution for the summer.
You can find accredited educational and practical programs at the Animal Behavior Society’s website., If you are a student or have finished your education, submit applications for grants and fellowships. These can help you do any research or other work you may like as an animal behaviorist.


You can find grant and fellowship opportunities at different universities and colleges, research institutions, or independent groups. For example, inquire at your local university about fellowship opportunities or look at organizations such as the National Science Foundation or Animal Behavior Society.

There are many options for animal behaviorists at places such as zoos, aquariums, museums, conservation groups, veterinary offices, and private homes.You may be able to find advertisements for professional positions in academic publications, so check these in addition to other job listings in newspapers and professional recruiting sites. Asking headhunters is also a good idea.
Send letters of interest and inquire about internships and full-time animal behaviorist career opportunities to places that interest you.
Ask to set up an informational interview with someone who can tell you what the institution looks for in employees and the working environment.

, You may want to use your skills as an animal behaviorist with pets. You can do this either for a company or a veterinary office or you may want to consider setting up your own company.


People who work with pets are called Applied Animal Behaviorists.You will need at least a Master’s degree to pursue this field: Associate Applied Animal Behaviorists have a Master’s degree, while Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists have PhDs.Work with a vet’s office or on your own if you want to be an applied animal behaviorist.
If you want to be a vet and treat pets’ behavior, you will need to get a DVM and specialize in treating behavioral problems. Some universities offer specific programs for this field., Meeting and talking with other animal behaviorists or professionals from related disciplines can greatly expand your ability to find a job and increase your education. Attend conferences, set up local seminars, and join professional organizations to network with other animal behaviorists.


Become a member of organizations such as the Animal Behavior Society or the Association for the Study of Animal Behavior. You may also want to join an organization in your specific discipline.
Attend conferences including panels and any social events offered. These can often help you meet new people who may share your interests.
Set up a seminar or regular meeting for other animal behaviorists in your local area.

Choose the proper enclosure for your marsh frog.,
Maintain the proper environment for your frog while he is with you.,
Provide lots of water for swimming in your tank by making a low barrier using a piece of plexiglass and aquarium silicon, and filling one side of the barrier with dechlorinated water.,
Maintain the land area in your tank as well as the water area.,
Feed the right foods to your marsh frog.",How to Care for a Striped Marsh Frog," The enclosure must be waterproof, escape-proof, and non-toxic. A 20 gallon (75.7 L) 'long' aquarium will happily hold four of these frogs, but remember that these frogs can jump quite high and any loose, non-locking lids will need to be taped or weighed down.;
, The temperature in the tank should not drop below 45°F (8°C) and not go above 77°F (25°C). Temperatures are preferred around the middle of this spectrum. These frogs do not need special UVB lighting, but a photo cycle, or night and day, should be provided using regular lighting.

, Remember to change this water often, and even more often if you do not provide a filter. These frogs do not like currents so a strong filter should be avoided. Provide several resting places in the water and a ramp up to the land area of the tank.

, The land area should be well-drained and kept moist. Use a substrate like peat or rain forest bedding to provide a moist land area for your frogs. Remember that frogs like hiding places, so cover the land with small rocks, leaf litter, and logs.

, Provide them with insects dusted with a calcium and D3 mixture. Suitable foods for young frogs include crickets and flies, and should be available at all times. Older frogs have a habit of eating anything they can fit in their mouths, and so should be fed about 15% of their body size in food three times a week. Remember to remove all dead food from the tank!

Keep your cat indoors.,
Place a bell on your cat's collar.,
Place a bright-colored collar on your cat.,
Keep your cat well fed.,
Build a cat patio.",How to Protect Small Yard Animals from Cats2," The simplest way to keep a cat from killing wild animals is to keep it inside. Cats can thrive inside, especially if they are given lots of toys and stimulation to keep them occupied. In exchange for limiting a bit of your cat's freedom, you will protect the small yard animals in your area.Most organizations interested in protecting wildlife in urban areas promote keeping cats indoors in order to protect wild bird populations.

, In order to limit a cat's ability to sneak up on small yard animals, you can put a bell on its collar. As the cat moves, it will make a small ringing sound that will notify squirrels, birds, and other small animals that the cat is stalking them.Some cats eventually figure out how to move without the bell making sounds. However, it is worth a try if your cat is constantly stalking and killing small yard animals.

, Cats that are sneaking up on small wildlife rely on blending into their surroundings to pounce on unsuspecting prey. In order to limit a cat's ability to do this, you can place a brightly colored collar around your cat's neck. Birds are especially adept at spotting bright colors, so they will have more warning to flee from a dangerous situation.Whenever you put something around your cat's neck, be sure that it has a safety clasp that can come apart if the cat gets it hooked on something.

, One reason that cats kill small yard animals is because they are hungry. To avoid this behavior, make sure that your cat is well fed whenever it goes outside. This may minimize the cat's instinct to hunt.There are a variety of motivations for cats to hunt and hunger is just one of them. Thus, keeping your cat well fed may not eliminate all killing but it could minimize it.

, Instead of letting your cat outside, where it could kill or injure wild animals, consider building it contained patio, also called a catio. A catio is an outdoor space where your cat can enjoy fresh air and the sounds of nature but it is fully enclosed, so your cat can't get its paws on wild animals in your yard.Catios can be a variety of sizes and can either be connected to your house, so your cat can go in and out of it when it likes, or they can be stand alone areas that you have to put your cat in.
You can either create a catio by enclosing an existing porch with screening or by adding a new area onto your home that is enclosed. Basically, a catio is a ventilated box, so you if you plan on building one from scratch the supplies you will need include lumber, screening, and hardware."

, Do some internet searches or refer to the links below. These frogs are aquatic, do not withstand handling, and need to be cared for like you would care for a fish. The larger females can grow as large as an adults fist (plus the legs!) They are great fun to watch - especially at feeding time - and can learn to interact somewhat with their caretaker. Adult frogs might even ""sing!"" Carefully cared-for, they can live from 8 to 30 years.

, Check the ""Things You'll Need"" list, below. Little infant frogs don't need much room at first, but they grow very fast and appreciate having space in which to swim. They also need something to hide under when they feel like it. A light and filter are optional, but a cover is absolutely not optional. A heater is recommended for most North-American locations.

, Fill the tank at least 3/4ths full, but do not fill to the top. Aquatic frogs need air to breathe! Treat the water according to directions and allow 12 to 24 hours for it to reach the proper temperature before introducing your frog.

, You can order a second tadpole or another infant frog shortly after the first one transforms. These frogs are social animals, and will enjoy the company of a frog friend.

, When you picking a frog, you want to make sure that it's healthy and without any abnormal features like skinny stomachs, weak legs, or cloudy eyes.

, A 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium is suitable for one or two frogs. If you have more, increase the tank size. A half land/half water set-up or a terrestrial set-up is good enough for the frog.


Make sure you have a top so that the frog can't get out.
If you use gravel, make sure it's large enough for the frog not to swallow. Water depth should be 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm).
Soil or sphagnum moss is suitable.
Make sure you have a water dish large enough for the frog to soak in. Tadpoles can handle an aquarium filled water.
Add hiding spaces like caves or plants for your frog/tadpole. #*You can use a fluorescent light for the frog to bask on and to get its nutrients.

, You can use Vitamin D3 to powder the frog's food. You can get it from your local pet store.

, When cleaning the frog's tank, you want to remove the frog into a little container while you clean. Use 1% of bleach solution to clean the tank. When pouring the dirty water out, use a tank vacuum cleaner or turkey baster. Wash the rocks and furniture with hot water to kill the germs.

Look for an assistant or technical position.,
Get a job as an oceanographer.",How to Become an Oceanographer," It's a good idea to get a head start on your studies if you want to pursue a career in oceanography. Taking advanced math and science classes in high school will ensure that you're properly prepared once you get to college.


Some of these classes may include earth sciences, biology, geology, geography, physics, etc. If the thought of taking these types of courses is not appealing, then oceanography probably isn't the right career path for you.
If your high school offers college credit for advanced classes, take advantage of those classes. If you're able to start college with some pre-existing general education credits (science, math, english, history, etc.), you'll be able to skip some of your general education classes and move onto classes that are more exciting and interesting.;
, There are tons of extracurricular activities and summer programs that will allow you to learn more about different career paths through science and math. Many of these programs are state-run, so look online if your school doesn't have any extracurricular activities that interest you.Joining a science club or your school's mathletes are great extracurricular activities for you to try.
Some colleges offer summer programs for high school students, so look into the programs that your local colleges offer. This could be a great way for you to get scholarships to college as well. Some examples of these programs are:

Upward Bound Math and Science programs all over the country
The Baylor University High School Summer Science Research Program in Waco, TX
The Biotech Academy: Earn a Certificate of Achievement in Bio Science in Berkeley, CA, There are many nature and wildlife organizations that are always looking for volunteers. Doing volunteer work in the field you want to work in is a great way to better familiar yourself with your industry (and it also looks great on college applications and job resumes).


Go online to research marine, wildlife, and nature volunteer organizations near you., Once you've determined what kind of oceanographer you want to be, you'll be able to choose specific majors and minors to get your degrees in. This decision will be an ongoing process that may change as you study for your Bachelor's and Master's degrees, but it's important to know that there are different types of oceanographers who have different specialties before you start choosing college programs.


Physical oceanographers study currents, waves, tides and ocean circulation. This type of oceanographer would typically get their Bachelor's degree in physics.
Chemical oceanographers determine the chemical composition of sea water and oceans. This type of oceanographer would typically get their Bachelor's degree in chemistry.
Biological oceanographers study how marine animals, plants, and organisms interact with their environment. This type of oceanographer would typically get their Bachelor's degree in biology.
Geological oceanographers examine the ocean floor, including rocks and minerals. This type of oceanographer would typically get their Bachelor's degree in geology., Oceanographers usually get their Bachelor's degrees majoring in biology, physics, chemistry, or geology. These majors will help prepare you for your Master's studies. There are also some schools that offer undergraduate Bachelor's degrees in marine biology, which is another option for your undergrad degree. Undergraduate education gives students the necessary knowledge and experience that is needed when pursuing advanced degrees in subjects related to oceanography.


For your senior thesis, consider writing about an oceanography related topic.
Find a mentor or advisor who works in oceanography or a related field who can write a good letter of recommendation for your graduate school.
There are usually internships or assistant positions available for those who only have undergraduate degrees. To have a career as an oceanographer, students must pursue a Master's and PhD level education.Bachelor's degrees focus on general areas of study. You'll be able to study specific oceanography sciences when you return to school for your Master's degree and PhD.

, Oceanographers always have a postgraduate Master's degree in their field of interest. Going to school for your Master's degree will allow you to focus on the particular kind of oceanography that you're interested in.

, Most oceanographers attend school until they have a PhD in their field of oceanography. Schools that offer advanced degrees in oceanography are often equipped with the best faculty, resources, facilities, and training possible. Most of these schools are also located in the best locations to study oceanography – along coasts.Some of the best schools for oceanography majors and degrees include:

Duke University in Durham, North Carolina
Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island
University of California (UCLA) in Los Angeles, CA
University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, CA, Although professional certification is not typically mandatory to be hired as an oceanographer, many oceanographers choose to get certified voluntarily. Earning professional certification can have many benefits, including the potential for a higher salary


Contact professional groups like the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society(CMOS), or the American Geophysical Union (AGU), to get more information about professional certification in oceanography., Many organizations and schools offer internships to those who are either in school for oceanography, or have earned degrees in oceanography. Getting an internship provides you with hands-on experience, and is a great way to familiarize yourself with different elements of oceanography. Having numerous internships throughout your academic career will give you a better chance of landing a good job in oceanography after you've finished school.School advisors and mentors can help you locate good internships. For this reason, it helps for you to develop relationships with your teachers and school faculty.

, Having a Bachelor’s of Science degree will typically enable you to work as a research assistant or as a computer technician within your desired field. After you've gotten your Bachelor's degree, apply for research assistant jobs, or any other support position jobs, while you go back to school for your advanced degrees. This will allow you to keep learning while also making money.You can usually find these jobs at colleges and universities or research companies and facilities.
Mentors and teachers can usually help you find actual jobs in addition to internships.

, There are numerous organizations that need the special skill sets and vast knowledge of oceanographers. Some oceanographers will work strictly for science and research organizations, and others will apply their skills to different types of corporations. For example, an oceanographer could be hired by an oil company to help determine the best location to place an underwater pipeline.


Many different types of companies and organizations hire oceanographers, including:

Colleges and universities
Environmental and engineering consulting firms
Federal government laboratories
Marine science institutions
Marine transport companies
National Defense Research (NDR) establishments
Private corporations, like oil and gas companies
Private research institutions"

Set up a frog-friendly habitat using an aquarium, fish bowl, or large glass jar.,
Feed the tadpoles.,
Change the habitat to accommodate the baby frogs.,
Feed the baby frogs.,
Release the frogs to their natural habitat as soon as possible.Use the notes you made earlier about where you collected the eggs or tadpoles.",How to Breed Frogs1," Contact your local conservation department to ensure that you do this project safely and get any necessary permits.


In Australia, for example, you will need to get a free permit in order to collect tadpoles for genuine educational reasons.Don’t trespass in order to collect eggs or tadpoles.Never collect eggs, tadpoles, or adults belonging to endangered species. Many kinds of frogs are threatened around the world. Find out which species of endangered frog lives in your area, and learn how to identify their eggs and tadpoles in order to avoid collecting them.;
, Visit a pond, small lake, or creek to find eggs or tadpoles in the spring to early summer. Use small jars or nets to capture the eggs or tadpoles. Measure the temperature of the water, and use insulated carrying cases to maintain that temperature in the jars you used to transport the eggs or tadpoles.


Frogs lay small eggs in clusters or strands, usually under water and attached to vegetation. Tadpoles resemble small, dark fish with large heads.Your area may limit the number of eggs, tadpoles, or frogs you can collect, and it may require you to have a permit.
Keep track of where you collected the eggs or tadpoles to facilitate return later on.

, A shallow bowl with a large rock in the middle works well; you don’t need deep water. Use water from your collection site, and add to it using only de-chlorinated water, providing about half a gallon per tadpole. Never use straight tap water. Aerate the water using an appropriate aeration device. If you have collected eggs, add them directly to the tadpole container – don’t keep them in a smaller container at first., The natural food for tadpoles is algae and tiny plant matter. If you can’t obtain algae, you can replicate this at home or school by grinding up commercial goldfish food and by boiling and cooling lettuce or spinach (not cabbage).Feed tadpoles twice daily, removing any uneaten food within an hour to keep the water clean.
Supplement this diet twice a week with flakes of hard-boiled egg yolks to add protein.

, Tiny frogs need to be able to climb out of the water immediately to avoid drowning. Once tadpoles start to develop hind legs, provide a gently sloping area such as a small pile of rocks or natural (not treated) wood., Frogs eat insects and small crustaceans. You can feed your baby frogs on meal worms or aphids (which can be found on infested houseplants)., Release the frogs early enough that they will have time to hibernate for the winter. Early fall is the latest you should release your frogs.Never transport frogs and release them in a new location. You risk introducing non-native species, diseases, or parasites.

Make sure it's not hot, it should be not warmer than lukewarm.


Make sure you only fill the container with a little bit of water. The water should be shallow enough so that the frog can stand in it.;
, Hold you hand above the frog while you're holding it to prevent it from leaping off your hand.

, With your finger, gently rub the frogs back, belly, arms and legs.

, It helps if you've cleaned the terrarium before you let the frog back in it to make sure everything is neat and tidy.

Know what you're getting into.,
In order to purchase these toads, you should contact your local exotic animal store and be sure to only purchase from sustainable captive bred facilities.

,
Get a standard ten+ gallon aquarium, which is usually large enough for a group of 2-4 adults.,
Add ornaments/decorations.,
Create a semi-aquatic setup in a small aquarium by using a large water dish for a water area.,
Control the temperature.,
Provide of a photoperiod of 12-14 hours with fluorescent lighting.,
Provide a source of clean water at all times.,
Fire-Bellied eat soft-bodied invertebrates.,
The food shouldn't be longer than the width of the toad's head.",How to Care for a Fire Bellied Toad (Bombina Orientalis)," Research the species before you get one.


Fire-bellied toads are brightly colored, diurnal (active during the day), and quite hardy; a combination that’s hard to beat. Most are dull to bright green with a bright red, orange or yellow ventral (underbelly) side. Their entire body is covered in warty black spots and blotches, which are broader on their ventral region, and form a reticulated pattern. The dorsal side of some captive toads can be dark muddy green, dark black or brown instead of bright green. It is believed that this is caused by an improper diet, light levels, stress, improper temperature, humidity, or a combination of all the above. Just remember that just because their skin is warty it doesn't mean that give you warts. It's just how their skin has evolved.
Fire-bellied toads reach 1.5 and 2.5 inches (3.8 and 6.3 cm). Males are usually smaller than females and can be distinguished by their more streamlined appearance and vocal ability. The ventral side of fire-bellied toads is bright to advertise their toxicity, and some will flip over to expose this when threatened. These amphibians are toxic, but only in the wild. In captivity, where their poison food source is not available they can cause only mild stomach irritation in say a dog who eats them or a hardy ""blech"" if tasted by a human.;
,, Use a secure screen cover to prevent escapes while providing proper ventilation. The standard enclosure size applies to these toads as does apply to all frogs and toads: 2.5 -10 gallons (9.46–37.85 liters) per toad. The enclosure should be all glass with the above mentioned screen top. You can use the metal screen tops that rest on the top of the aquarium or the pre-installed sliding screen tops; either one is fine.


Fire-bellied toads are semi-aquatic amphibians that should be provided with both a land and clean water area. The land area can compose roughly one half to two thirds of the floor area, and should contain hide spots such as cork bark, driftwood, rocks, coconut halves, and live or fake plants.
The best substrates to use are:

Soil
Java moss
Sheet moss
Coconut husk fiber
Jungle soil (pre-packaged and shrink-wrapped)
Large grain 1/2"" (1.27cm) river rock/gravel


These are suitable substrates which will prevent the toads from swallowing earth, like small grade gravel, while eating. These toads rarely swim underwater, but prefer to float at the surface or near a shoreline. The water depth should gradually slope towards the gravel to allow for easy access and exit.

, These can be placed on land or in deep water to allow the toads the chance to rest in water, if needed and/or hide to feel safe. Some suggestions for appropriate decorations are:


African Driftwood - which is a misnomer as this wood sinks like a stone
Artificial branches and driftwood
Coconut Shells (Sold as a half a shell with a little rounded outdoor/opening)
Aquatic plants
Large rocks

, The dish can be as simplistic as a plastic storage container, or large commercially available water dishes. These dishes can be submerged into a safe soil substrate, such as the ones listed above to provide easy access to the water. Because the volume of water is low in this type of container, it can become soiled quickly, and for this reason the water should be changed daily.


Another suitable semi-aquatic habitat is to create a small shoreline setup. 1/2” (1.27cm) river rock can be pushed to one side to form a thick layer of gravel that creates a land area, while the layer of gravel on the other side can remain thin. The aquarium can then be filled with enough water so that the water level remains just below the surface of the land area.

, Fire-bellied toads are tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, which is one of the reasons they make good captives. Daytime temperatures should range from 72°F to 78°F (22°C to 26°C) and can drop at night to 65º-70º (18ºC to 21ºC). Cool temperatures are tolerated well, and occasional drops down to 60°F (16°C) don’t present a problem for short periods of time.



Avoid temperatures above 85°F (29°C). With this in mind, keep their enclosure away from windows. This is the case for all enclosed creatures.
Temperature control can be easy for these little critters as if you're comfortable in your home with the temperature, so will they be.

, Set this lighting on a timer to help prevent forgetfulness in turning the light on and/or off. Any standard UV bulb will do. Growth bulbs can be used if using live plants. You can purchase regular UV bulbs at any hardware supplier and the growth bulbs can be purchased at pet stores, online, and at hydroponics shops.

, If tap water is used it should be treated with a tap water conditioner to remove all chlorine, chloramines and heavy metals. Bottled spring water can and should be used instead of tap water. Change this water daily. Make sure the water level is relatively low as these frogs are not adept at swimming and can drown easily. Keep in mind that the lower level of water you provide, the more often it must be cleaned.

, In captivity they can be fed a diet that consists largely of crickets. Never use garden insects. They have most likely been exposed to herbicides and/or pesticides. Other invertebrates include:


Wax worms
Small silkworms
Soldier Fly maggots
Dubia Roaches - These roaches are unable to climb glass.
Moths
Houseflies
Red Wiggler Worms


Food can be offered in a small feeding dish to prevent them from burrowing into the substrate or wandering into and fouling the water areas. Inset the food dish within the substrate to allow for easy access. A feeding schedule of two to six food items per toad every 2 to 3 days is recommended. Juvenile animals should be fed daily in small quantities.








It’s important that any uneaten food or dead feeders are removed from the enclosure to prevent disease and/or injury to the toads.
Do not provide food items larger then the frog can eat. Simple rule:

, This rule does not apply to worms. But be weary of worms that are too fat.

You should dust their food with reptile/amphibian vitamins and calcium once every other feeding. A good recommendation is to rotate between vitamin one feeding and calcium the next feeding. Juvenile’s should have their food dusted at every feeding.

Make sure you have male and female frogs.,
Manipulate your frogs’ environment to induce readiness for breeding.,
Place frogs ready to breed together in an optimal environment.,
Return the adult frogs to their usual home once their eggs have been laid.,
Feed tadpoles with finely-ground fish food.,
Feed baby frogs on insects such as wingless fruit flies and small crickets.,
Prevent in-breeding by not allowing siblings to breed with one another.",How to Breed Frogs2," Depending the species, you can tell the sex of adult frogs in various ways. Ideally, you should have a group of frogs that contains more males than females.


Male red-eyed tree frogs are larger than females, and only the males vocalize.By contrast, female tiger-leg monkey frogs are larger than the males., In the wild, frogs breed seasonally, to give tadpoles and baby frogs the summer to grow and develop. You will need to use light and temperature manipulation to simulate seasonal changes to your frogs.


When breeding red-eyed tree frogs, cut down on the frequency of misting the terrarium. Lower the temperature by about five degrees Fahrenheit. Your frogs may need to eat less during this time, but monitor their health. After a month, return the temperatures to normal, mist heavily, and feed plenty of food., Learn how to recognize the signs of breeding readiness in your species of frog. You will need to design an environment that mimics the situation in which frogs breed in the wild.


Female red-eyed tree frogs will swell with eggs, and males will begin to vocalize frequently. They will need to be moved into a “rain chamber” designed to mimic a rainy forest setting. An overhead hose should provide falling water, and there must be large leaves for depositing eggs., Allow eggs to develop into tadpoles, making sure that newly hatched tadpoles can immediately enter warm water.


Red-eyed tree frog tadpoles require a water temperature of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit., Maintain water quality by changing occasionally, using an aerator, and not allowing old food to linger in the water.


Make sure that tadpoles have a way to climb out to air when they become baby frogs.
Cover the terrarium with a screen to prevent tadpoles from climbing out.

, Keep baby frogs moist. Baby frogs may die if they become dried out. Maintain adequate temperatures and simulate day and night using a light source., Do not continually breed from the same small population of frogs. This decreases genetic variation and may lead to the development of inherited diseases."
"
Have realistic expectations.,
Follow any local laws and regulations.,
Choose the appropriate species for your purposes.,
Set up your breeding area.,
Feed tadpoles on boiled potatoes, vegetables, and meat scraps.,
Feed frogs on live insects and small crustaceans.,
Prevent and treat diseases.",How to Breed Frogs3," Frog farming for human consumption is not economically profitable in the United States right now.Most frog legs come from Bangladesh, Belgium, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan.They are often harvest wild there due to the difficulty of intensive frog farming.Be wary of “get rich quick” schemes based on farming frogs for human consumption.Focus instead on producing frog legs for personal or small-scale enjoyment.

, You may need to purchase a wildlife breeder’s permit in order to raise frogs.Be sure that your frog farm does not violate local zoning laws or disturb protected species or wetlands.

, Edible frogs include the green frog (Rana clamitans), the leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the pickerel frog (Rana palustris), and the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). The bullfrog is the one most often farmed for food in North America., Many frog farms are natural marshes or ponds that have been modified to limit predators, retain frogs, and allow for easy supplementation of food and capture. Set up a fence to protect the area.An adult bullfrog needs about twenty feed of shoreline for its feeding territory. Increase the available shoreline by building inlets, coves, and islands.
Ensure that the water is deep enough to protect the frogs and tadpoles from extreme temperatures. In areas with cold winters, six to twelve feet may be required to allow for hibernation in the bottom mud.

, Don’t feed them the remains of butchered frogs, because this might transmit disease., Paying for a supply of live minnows, crayfish, and insects to feed your frogs will be one of the most expensive aspects of a frog-farming operation. However, frogs generally refuse to eat food that is not moving.Use a strong night-time light at outdoor farms to attract flying insects.

, Many diseases arise from over-crowding; be sure to allow plenty of room for your frogs. If you see evidence of disease, isolate affected individuals and treat them with antibiotics."
"
Provide a stable living environment.,
Use forest floor (sold in dried bricks) and have about 2” (5cm) of soil for the floor of the enclosure.,
Provide plenty of live broad leaf plants, like pothos and other philodendrons, pillow moss, or bromeliads.,
Be sure to keep either a large shallow bowl of distilled or RO (reverse osmosis) water or create a waterfall/pool for the frogs.,
Keep the humidity high (90% or higher is ideal).,
Provide a source of light with the appropriate spectrum and intensity for all the live plant specimens.,
Keep the temperature stable.,
Provide a wide variety in the diet for optimal health.,
Spot clean the enclosure as needed.",How to Care for a Glass Frog (Centrolene Prosoblepon)," Considering that glass frogs are typically arboreal in nature, they need an enclosure that provides more vertical than horizontal real estate. They need plenty of branches and vines to scale and preferably a nice cork background. The size of enclosure is the standard 10 gallons (37 liters) per inch (2.5 cm) of frog. Some find this a bit extreme, but they love to explore. The more room you give them, the happier they will be.;
, Forest floor holds humidity longer and allows for Coprophagous insects to develop and help break down any missed fecal matter. This is essential to help with the ecosystem of your enclosure.

, Jungle moss, sold in bricks, is good to disperse about too. However, pillow moss may be preferable, as it tends to feast upon frog excrement, considering it's living moss.

, Just be sure to provide the frogs with multiple easy escapes from the water; they aren't good swimmers and can easily drown. Water should be kept clean and changed daily or as needed. Frogs tend to like to eliminate their bowels in water.

, Provide enough ventilation though to allow fresh air to constantly enter, but be careful not to over-dry the enclosure. An ecosystem that is too arid can be as harmful as one with stagnant humid air. The vivarium should always smell humid and fresh (like fresh damp soil).

, If you choose not to use live plants, be sure to allow dim to moderate lighting to help keep the frogs on their normal photoperiod. Typically, this means 12 hours on and 12 hours off. The use of an automatic timer is nice too, especially for waterfall systems.

, Average temperature in the enclosure should fall between 76ºF and 82ºF (24ºC - 27ºC) during the day with a drop to 68ºF - 72ºF (20ºC - 22ºC) at night.

, Crickets, Drosophilidae flies, flightless fruit flies, newly born soldier fly larvae, red wiggler worms (only the smallest you can buy), newly born dubia roaches are good too.


Supplement their diet with vitamin powder, Calcium powder, mineral powder (V, C, M). Simply lightly dust the food items before each feeding with my foolproof method of V – C – M – 2 days off. In this formula, you supplement day one, day two, day three, then you give two days off and repeat.
Feed juveniles once a day. Feed adults every other day. Give them enough to fill their stomachs but not bloat themselves. Best practice is to feed about 30 minutes or so after the light shuts off.

, Fully clean the enclosure once a month, unless it's a full living vivarium. Then you should only have to spot clean daily. Never use chemicals. Only water and a drop or two of bleach. Just be sure to get every bit of the bleach out (even a faint scent of bleach can be a lethal amount to absorb).

Find a suitable container to house the tadpoles.,
Lay a suitable base on the bottom of the housing.,
Provide shade for about three-quarters of the area if the tadpoles are outdoors.,
Keep about 5-10 tadpoles per litre of water.,
Keep the water clean.,
Change the water regularly.,
Boil romaine lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Be patient.,
Prepare for their metamorphosis.,
Do not feed the tadpoles when they have sprouted arms.,
Provide more food after metamorphosis.,
Be aware that many froglets dislike being handled.",How to Raise Tadpoles," Tadpoles can be raised in most containers, though it's best for them to be housed outside so that you attract more mosquito's to lay their larva for the tadpoles to eat, nature provides a cleaner and more oxygenated atmosphere and because it's more natural. Be sure to keep them in the shade at all times, though. Suitable containers include:


A large tank.
A large oven roast bowl
A small pool if outside.
A tub.;
, Use gravel to cover well. Add a big rock or two for shelter and land when the tadpoles transform.


Put small weeds and grass with the roots attached in the water so the tadpoles can hang onto them, and they eat the roots.
Make sure there has not been a recent application of pesticides on any plant life added, as this will kill the tadpoles within a day.

, The tadpoles must be able to get out of direct sunlight when they want to.

, You can keep more, but they may die out faster or become carnivorous.

, Tadpoles need clean, dechlorinated water. Bottled water is ideal, but if the water is from the tap let it sit in a container for 24 hours. Rainwater is one of the best waters to keep your tadpoles in since it contains mosquito larva and doesn't contain any chemicals.


Some advise using water from where you found the tadpoles.Do not use tap water; it's too full of chemicals that can harm tadpoles. If you want to use tap water, let it sit uncovered for 24 hours, to allow the chlorine to dissipate.

, Try to only change half the water at a time to keep the pH of the water balanced. A turkey baster is good for this and disturbs the tadpoles as little as possible whilst making it easy to remove debris that gathers at the bottom of the container. But this is optional––not many tadpole/frog owners have these.

, It's ready when the leaves are soft and squishy. Drain and cut it into little pieces. Feed a pinch every day.


Other types of lettuce should work too. However, only use softer leaves. Also, all pieces should be small enough for their tiny mouths.
Tadpoles can also be fed normal flake fish food but only in small pinches, as it's not the absolute best for them. A couple of pinches a week should keep the tadpoles hunger satisfied depending on the number of tadpoles you keep. Too much food can cause death to the tadpoles from over-eating.

, They usually develop from egg to tadpole in 6 to 12 weeks. Keep that in mind and don't panic when it gets cold; in winter the tadpoles will grow more slowly. The ideal temperature is between 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit, or around 20-25 degrees Celsius.

, When your tadpoles develop legs you will need a container with dirt for them to crawl up onto, or they will drown.

, At this time the tadpole will be using its tail as food and it will become an adult frog.

, If you aren't releasing the froglets, they will likely need larger housing.

, The tank or housing for them must be kept clean daily, otherwise, bacteria will spread rapidly and can kill them.

Research the herbs that you would like to keep very well.,
Gather all materials, and organize them well.,
Pour a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of gravel on the bottom of the terrarium.,
Pour about 1 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of soil or mulch over the gravel.

,
Place a few pieces of cork bark on the substrate.,
Place down the forest branches, coming up from the soil to the corners of the top of the terrarium.,
Plant many tropical plants.,
Add driftwood or stones to furnish the rest of the terrarium.,
Add leaf litter to any uncovered area on the substrate.

,
Introduce the herbs one by one to the terrarium to avoid any sudden stress.

",How to Create a Tropical Community Terrarium,";
, A good way to organize are groups of different materials (wood, rock, plants, etc.).

, This is needed for drainage, which protects the plants from 'drowning'.

,, These will provide multiple locations for any animals to hide, and will reduce stress.

, Be sure to place them in one general side of the tank. These will provide adequate basking sights for your critters.

, These provide more shelter to your reptiles an amphibians and reduce stress greatly. Some good choices are philodendron, pothos, ficus or other ivies and small shrubs.

, Small waterfalls are also good decoration and will add humidity to the terrarium.

Know your amphibians.,
Understand the amphibian life cycle.,
Recognize the common traits amongst amphibians.,
Find out more about amphibians.,
Be aware of the importance of amphibians as ""environmental indicators"".",How to Learn More About Amphibians," Amphibians are:


Frogs (tadpoles)
Toads (tadpoles)
Salamanders
Newts
Caecilians (legless, burrowing, similar to salamanders);
, In general, amphibians hatch from eggs and live in the water in their baby stage. During this stage they grow legs. Once they change (metamorphosing), their gills usually disappear and for frogs and toads, the tail disappears.

, Amphibians tend to have in common:


Soft, moist skin
Cold-blooded
An affinity for water throughout their lives; most can swim and walk on land
A need to hibernate in colder climates
Ability to change body temperature with the environment

, There are several ways to find out more information about amphibians:



Self-study: Observe nature for real. If you are near a pond on a farm, in a park or in another area frequented by amphibians, you can watch them for yourself. Frogs are usually the easiest as tadpoles are easy to spot. You can catch them gently with a net to observe the different stages that the tadpole is at; for instance before legs, with legs, at froglet stage and then as a frog. Always handle gently and place back into the water with care. Do not keep tadpoles out of the water for too long.

Library: Research in books on amphibians in general or on the specific animal that interests you. Look in the reference section, as well as the children's and adult's non-fiction sections. Books with colourful pictures will help you to identify the different types of amphibians, which is especially important if you are either studying them or planning on keeping them as pets.

Internet: Some of the best websites for learning good information will come from museums, wildlife parks, zoos and very experienced amphibian keepers. Using a search engine, type in the name of the amphibian you are interested in learning more about. There are some useful links provided below.

Visit a wildlife park/zoo or aquatic centre: Often such places will have big displays of amphibians through glass. This enables you to see the life cycle easily and will likely be accompanied by information. Ask an attendant if you want more information.

Ask a biologist or zoologist: ask a local university professor or someone you know who works in this field for more information.

, Did you know that frogs are one of the world's best indicators of environmental health? When the frogs disappear from an area they are supposed to be in, that is a sign that the environment is not well. Major threats to amphibians include pollution, accidents such as being squashed under vehicles, invasive species, natural disasters (for example, fire, flooding) and illegal trade. You can learn more about this fascinating aspect of amphibians through websites dedicated to protecting animal species or visit Global Amphibian Assessment as one example.

Determine the mudpuppies' range.,
Check local restrictions.,
Find a body of water.,
Examine the water.",How to Spot a Mudpuppy1," Mudpuppies are found throughout much of the Midwestern United States, and particularly the Great Lakes Basin. They are limited by the Appalachian Mountains to the east, but follow river systems outside their normal range. They reach:

West into eastern Kansas and Oklahoma,
East into New York State,
South into Louisiana,
North into Southern Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec.;
, In some regions, mudpuppies may be endangered or threatened, and federally protected as a result. Verify with your state's Department of Natural Resources if a permit is required, or if they are protected. In addition, make sure you are not within a state or national park, as it may be illegal to catch anything within the park., Mudpuppies can be found in lakes, streams, rivers, and large ponds. As they are completely aquatic, the body of water must be permanent, and cannot be manmade. The more isolated or undisturbed the better, due to less activity and pollution.

, Mudpuppies, like any species, live best under certain conditions. A body of water that meets these conditions is most likely to have mudpuppies in it. Here are some attributes preferred by these salamanders:


Mudpuppies require cover. During the day, they will hide underneath rocks, logs, and plants at the bottom of the water source. This cover is necessary for their survival.
Mudpuppies require clean freshwater. You will not find mudpuppies in polluted environments or salt water. They are very fragile, and susceptible to manmade chemicals in the water.
Mudpuppies prefer cold water. Colder water holds more oxygen, and allows them to breathe easier. As such, they can sometimes be caught while ice fishing in the Great Lakes.
The depth of the body of water required changes with water temperature. They can range from being found at 12"" (30.5 cm) to 88' (27 m).
Mudpuppies can be found year round, but will retreat into deeper water as temperatures increase in summertime. In spring and fall, they will be more likely to be seen as a result.

Do your research.,
Look for frogs or newts at night.,
Look for frogs or newts near ponds or lakes.,
Look for frogs or newts in the spring and summer.,
Go canoeing at night or in the evening.,
Be quiet.,
Approach slowly.,
Be patient.,
Wash your hands thoroughly after you handle a newt or frog.,
Don’t harm the newt or frog.",How to Find Newts and Frogs," While most frogs will be found near water, you’ll want to know what frogs are in your area if there are any dangerous frogs (poison dart frogs, etc.) in the area, and what their habitat is. Research can also help you find useful tips for finding specific frogs by helping you identify their calls or markings. Many states have websites about their local species., Most species are nocturnal, so you may not find any in the day. Be careful of other dangerous species during that time. Snakes are often found in similar areas as frogs and newts, especially as many snakes, including the very venomous cottonmouth, will eat some amphibians as part of their diet. Never put your hands where you can't see them.


It's a good idea to use a flashlight.Using a red flashlight, or covering the flashlight with red plastic wrap or tissue paper will cause minimal disturbance for nocturnal animals.You can also use night vision goggles. Though night birding is often the most common use for specialty night-vision goggles, they can be useful in seeing frogs and newts as well., Most frogs and newts live near water.When looking for newts it’s also useful to look under rocks and logs.Any place where there are ponds or lakes, including forests and meadows may attract different species of frogs., Many species hibernate in the winter. The best time to find them is in the spring or summer. If you live in a colder climate with a late spring or an early fall, summer’s the best bet., A canoe is quieter than a motor boat and will allow you to approach the frogs quietly.Ponds, lakes and river deltas are all great places to look for frogs and newts. You will often find frogs and newts near the bank or among plant life along the shore.If you shine a light on frogs while canoeing, they will often sit completely still., If you are loud, you will likely scare the frog away. To make your search as quiet as possible, wear quiet shoes and clothes, walk softly, and refrain from talking while approaching the frog or newt. If there is a group, make sure not too many people try to approach the frogs at once., Approaching the frog or newt slowly will help with the quiet, as well as keep the frog or newt from recognizing any visual cues that you’re approaching.Frogs are able to recognize movement easily.Newts have very good vision as well, and can even re-grow their eyes if they are damaged!Newts are quieter than frogs, and you may have to look under stones and logs to find them., If you happen to scare the frog or newt away in your first approach, stay quiet and still. The frog will likely return, and there may be other frogs around. If you still hear other frogs, waiting will likely be productive for your search. For the newt, you may have to come back later and look., Some species of newt and frog are poisonous, and though it may be safe to touch them, if the toxins get into your bloodstream or in your mouth, it can be fatal.Even if they are not toxic, they often carry salmonella. It can make adults sick, and can sometimes be fatal to children under five, older people, and people with weakened immune systems.You can use hand sanitizer or some other disinfectant.If you handle a newt, it is important to wash your hands thoroughly with water, so that you get all the toxins off., It’s important to handle the frog or newt carefully if you handle them, and then gently put them back on the ground. Several newts and frogs are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Be careful if you have a dog or cat around frogs or newts, as they might attempt to eat them, which can be harmful to both the pet and the frog or newt."

Catch your captive.,
Set up its house.,
Feed it properly.,
Keep their container clean.",How to Raise a Toad," Go out either early in the morning or at night, and look closely. Toads use camouflage, so it might be hard. They also like hiding under leaves, behind pieces of wood, and around large rocks. When you find it, scoop him up in a net or bag of some kind, and take him to his new house.;
, While you are setting up its house, put him in a smaller container. Take a large, storage box, aquarium, or a large, regular box. Put a couple inches of soil, or sand (they love to dig) and add some dead leaves. Put a small bowl (big so that they can waddle around in it, but the water cannot be above the head) and then, add more soil, to where the bowl surface is level with the dirt. Then, add hiding spots, like big bark against the walls, hollow logs, or plastic decorations from Petsmart, or other pets stores. Remember that you will have to put a top on. It must have air holes, or it will die.

, It is vary easy to feed, them. There are three options.


Go to your pet store, and buy crickets, worms or any other live (it has to be live) insects.
Go outside every day, and catch, worms, pill bugs, crickets, almost anything.
Catch those insects, and breed them. Catch a lot of them, maybe 10 or 20, and put them in a container with some dirt, and a lot of food, soon they will lay eggs, and you can feed the babies to them. There is no way you could over feed them, they can eat 1,000 insects in one day, and still be hungry. Feed your toad daily.

, Change the soil when it smells bad , every day add new food, and when you see the water becoming dirty, change it. It's best to use pond water or use all natural spring water, not tap water. Consider taking them outside for exercise daily, and maybe making a playpen out of wood or buying one at a pet store. If you get one from a pet store, watch your pet closely to make sure that he/she does not get a head or arm stuck in the bars.

Acquire bait.,
Cloud the water.,
Move slowly and calmly in the water.,
Leave the cover alone.",How to Spot a Mudpuppy2," Mudpuppies, like fish, can be caught with a multitude of bait. The staple of their diet is crayfish, but other items such as earthworms, snails, and small fish will be accepted as well. As opportunistic predators, mudpuppies will eat most anything that they can fit in their mouths., Once at a location, you must be aware that mudpuppies are usually nocturnal. Because of this, they will only come out at night, or if the water is murky enough to diffuse the sun's rays. Either go when the day is foggy or cloudy, or be able to use mud or even peanut butter to muddy the water., Mudpuppies make up for their poor eyesight with a powerful sense of smell and an ability to sense vibrations in the water using a lateral line. Any sudden movements may cause them to retreat deeper back into their hideaway., While lifting rocks and logs on the lake or river bed may seem like a quick way to spot a mudpuppy, this will most likely cause it to hide deeper in cover. Even worse, it has the potential to injure or kill the mudpuppy if care isn't taken in moving debris. Leave the habitat the way you found it."
"
Use a net.,
Use a minnow trap.,
Let it go.,
Don't be discouraged.",How to Spot a Mudpuppy3," Using a net is one of the cheapest methods to capture a mudpuppy, but one of the most careful. A  fishing net can be held against the bottom of the water, and if baited and held in murky water, the mudpuppy may walk in to gain a meal. After the mudpuppy enters, quickly lift the net in an arc out of the water., A minnow trap is a device similar to a funnel, leading into a cage with bait inside. Small fish, crayfish, and occasionally mudpuppies wander in, and cannot exit. A mesh or wire trap works better than the version made from 2 liter bottles, due to the increased water flow and ease of entrance. After placing the baited minnow trap among cover on the bed of the body of water, leave it and return after a day, and periodically return and re-bait the trap., If you do catch a mudpuppy, be sure to release it after taking pictures or examining it. Mudpuppies are quite difficult to keep in captivity, and can be easily sickened if not kept according to precise conditions. In addition, their populations are currently declining among parts of their range, and may be federally protected. Releasing it allows the population to remain for future generations., Mudpuppies are hard to find, and may be endangered in parts of their range. If you cannot find a mudpuppy using these methods, try a different location, bait, or time of year. The mudpuppy might not always be caught, but when it is, it is a memorable experience."

Keep a pile of chopped wood in your backyard because those harbor many insects and will draw in toads.,
Go outside just before dark when everything is damp.,
Look for toads by turning over logs and rocks, as well as checking around corners of houses outdoors.,
Act fast when you locate the toad!,
Swoop down upon the toad with your net.,
Pick up the net and make a twist near the top so the toad can hop around but cannot escape.

Do not hold the toad often.",How to Keep a Wild Caught Toad As a Pet," This is the perfect place to catch a toad.;
, Arm yourself with a bug net and a ""critter carrier"" about a gallon in volume.

, These are mini ecosystems for insects, so replace the logs and rocks after you check under them!

, Toads are very shy creatures and dart away when they see something moving, larger than another toad.

, Cover the toad with the net and lie the long net part to the side, and poke the toad until it hops in that pocket of netting.

,,

, Dribble some distilled water into the tank so the toad can soak up some water.

, A tank size of 10 gallons (37.9 L) or more is perfect; any less than that and the toad will not have enough room.

,


Peat moss makes an ideal addition to the base of the tank. It's soft, comfortable and akin to what the toad is used to. Add enough for the toad to burrow into.

, Fill this up with bottled water, or water that has been treated to have it's chlorine, chlorinates and other heavy metals removed and change the water once a day. Never use distilled water as it is completely devoid of minerals and salts. Toads absorb their minerals and vitamins through their water needed for survival through pores in their skin, called Osmoregulation. Therefore it is important that you get a dish they can sit in and keep moist. Be sure not to get one that will be too deep for your toad, and preferably one with easily climbable sides for easy access, as toads are poor swimmers.

,


Make a small cave-like hole for the toad to crawl into. Try using pieces of sticks or bark to build the ""frame"" of the cave, then simply cover it gently with the soil. Clear out any dirt that may have fallen into the hole.

, On the lip, smash a hole about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, and 3 1⁄2 inches (8.9 cm) tall. Put this (lip down) on top of the soil so the toad has another place to hide.

, Place a screen weighted with rocks for a lid.

, If you chose to add live plants to your tank for added comfort and authenticity for your toad, then this step is extra important, as without water your plants will die. Rotting plants in close proximity to a water or food dish poses a health risk due to the formation of bacteria present to decompose the leaves of the plant, so be sure to prune the plants within your toads tank and remove any dead plants or parts of plants before they start to rot.

, You might use the bottom of a pot or a dish. Make sure whatever you use is short, to allow the toad to hop in and out of it.

, Never feed your toad dead things; it will not eat them if it is not moving. You could buy bugs at the local store or catch them yourself.


Suitable choices for food include:

Small toad feeding: 2 bugs, one small slug, or 2 pinhead crickets
Medium toad feeding: 3 bugs, 1 regular size slug, or 2 small crickets
Large toad feeding: 4 bugs, 1 larger than normal size slug, or 2 regular size crickets.


If you have a dog, an easy way to catch flies is to stalk dog poop. Take a bug net, and wait until flies land on top of the poop. Quickly and silently put the net over the flies. Once they are all at the top, bunch the net so they have room to fly around, and twist it so they can't escape.
If you feed crickets, pull off their back legs before feeding (their jumping legs) as they can damage the stomach of a toad, and toss them in the trash. If you keep crickets as feed for your toads, be sure to provide the crickets with plenty of food such as spinach, carrots, sweet potato and grapes. The vitamins and minerals that end up in the crickets belly will end up in the toads belly, therefore providing the toad with much needed supplementation. #* Meal-worms are a cheap and easily accessible food source for your toad. They can be purchased at many local pet stores and all reptile stores. Be sure to store them in a refrigerator as this will make them slow down almost to a hibernation like state, ensuring they stay alive long enough for your toads to make use of them. If left active they will continue their life cycle, eventually turning into a black beetle with a hard outer carapace that can get caught in your toads digestive system causing pain or even death.

, This is so they know it's always going to be there. They don't like the same food all the time, so use a variety of bugs.

, If the toad suddenly stops eating, it may be ill. Look up toad sicknesses online.

, The peat for burrowing, the rocks and flowerpot for hiding under.

, Toads, unfortunately, aren't intelligent enough to form a bond with their owners, and handling the toad will do nothing but cause stress for the creature. Toads are lovely to watch and read about, but taking it out of its tank for entertainment, or cuddles, will just increase the risk of the toad falling and hurting itself and being an unhappy pet..

Make your garden safe for toads.,
Choose a shady location.,
Decide if you want to convert existing garden space or start fresh.,
Provide a water source.,
Add plants and moss to the area.,
Keep it moist.,
Add an optional toad house, if you'd like.,
Add decorations to enliven the space.,
Welcome your new toad friends.,
Try not to disturb the toad habitat.,
Water the garden every day.,
Consider installing a toad light.",How to Create a Habitat for a Toad," No matter how appealing and gorgeous your garden may be, if it is unsafe for toads, they are not likely to want to live there. Make your garden safe for toads by:


Providing cover. Toads are very wary of predators like birds, snakes, and house pets, and they will avoid areas where they are likely to be a meal. You can create cover by providing bushes and other leafy plants for toads to hide.Avoiding chemicals. Toads, like all frogs, have thin skin and are susceptible to pesticides and herbicides in your garden.Use organic gardening supplies including dirt, fertilizers, and pest- and weed-killers.;
, If you're lucky, you have a nice area in your yard with large shade trees that will do nicely. If you don't, you will have to pick a location and provide shade.


Toads like a quiet home, so choose a place where pets and children don't run wild. A quiet corner of a yard is a nice place., You can place a toad habitat in an existing garden, as long as you don't mind sacrificing several square feet of space. Otherwise you can convert another area of your yard into a toad habitat.


Toads tend to prefer to be near lots of plants of various heights, so building your toad habitat as close to your garden beds as possible is best. You also want an area that is out of direct sunlight for a good part of the day, especially if you live in a hot and dry climate.
To convert existing garden space, you will need to clear at least a square foot of space by pulling out a few plants. Choose an area in the garden that likes a lot of water, since your toad will need his area to be watered quite frequently. Unlike some garden plants, toads are not ""drought tolerant.""

, You will need a water source for the toad, especially if you're hoping he will make your yard a permanent home. Toads don't drink water, but instead they soak their bodies in it to absorb what they need through their skin. It is vital that you have a source of water that is big enough for the toad to soak in.Toads reproduce by bodies of water like lakes or ponds, so having a small pond or ditch nearby on your property will make your yard a more welcoming home for a toad.If you do not have a pond or other body of water nearby, you can use a large pot tray (the pie-pan shaped container that sits under a potted plant to catch the water that runs out). Dig a shallow depression in your garden and place this pot there, then pat the dirt around it into place so it sits securely flush with the ground around it. You can place flat rocks around the lip of the dish to keep it in place. Fill the dish with clean water., You want to provide plants that the toad can hide in, and you also want to attract insects to the area so that the toad can feed in the evenings.


Try to include native wildflowers and plants of many types. One favorite among American toads is creeping veronica.To find the correct vegetation for your part of the world, visit a local wetland and see what is growing near ponds., As amphibians, toads need to be moist and have access to water at all times. It's true that they don't live in the water like their close cousin the frog, but they do need to have moist areas to hide.Wooden boards, logs, and large rocks make nice areas of cover for a frog that also stay damp.

, Toad houses are cute living spaces for toads that also serve as a garden decoration. They have the benefit of providing safety for a toad and also staying nice and moist, which is how toads prefer their living spaces. You can purchase a pre-made toad house online or in garden centers, or try your hand at making your own.


The most basic way to make a toad house is to purchase a medium sized terracotta pot and use a hammer to break a large chink out of the rim of the pot. Then, you will turn the pot upside down and place it in the frog habitat, so that the toad can access the pot using the hammered-out opening as an entryway.You can also use a dremel saw or tile saw to cut a smoother opening in the pot if you'd like, and you can decorate the pot by painting it and gluing on small stones or broken tiles as you'd like.
By watering the whole area including the toad house regularly, you can keep it moist inside for its lucky inhabitant.

, This step is optional, but there are lots of ways you can decorate your toad habitat. Many gardeners like to create a woodsy, rustic space for toads, while others like to focus on bright colors and floral designs. Whatever your aesthetic, you can decorate your toad's habitat to match.


Add smooth river stones around the water source, which make the space feel natural and also provide a place for bugs and insects to hide.
Small garden figurines like gnomes or fairies are great accent pieces for a toad habitat, but avoid realistic-looking figurines that resemble toad predators like snakes, birds, or large wildlife.
It's important to keep the safety of the toads in mind, so you may want to avoid putting bird feeders, bird baths, or birdhouses near the toad habitat. Small toads are a favorite food for many birds, so toads are less likely to feel welcome and safe in a toad habitat that's right next door to a bird habitat.

, If you're lucky (and if you live by a pond or wooded area) you will not have to go out of your way to get new tenants in your toad habitat. You will just have to wait a few days for a toad to find the new water source and make himself at home.


If you don't get a resident in your toad habitat within a week or two, you might want to go to a local pond or wooded area and see if you can catch one. You can also purchase toads in pet stores, but it is not recommended to release domestic toads into yards. They may not be used to living in the wild and may not have the skills needed to survive.

, You may be tempted to go out and make friends with the local toads, but it's better to watch from a distance. Similarly, keep pets and small children away.


Instruct older children to observe the toad house from a distance, and be sure to supervise younger children when they are in the yard. If you are unable to keep your pets from the area, you may need to construct a small fence around the toad habitat. Otherwise, toads are unlikely to make the habitat their home.
You can gauge how comfortable the toads are in your presence by watching their behavior when you are gardening. If they don't run from you, you may eventually find that you can touch or even hold them. Just take your time.

, Your toad likes a moist habitat, so keep the area pleasantly moist but not overly wet. Ensure that the water dish NEVER runs low on water or becomes murky or dirty.


Because you must water the habitat frequently, it is important that the plants in the area prefer a lot of water to thrive. Otherwise, you may find that the frequent watering will drown the plants or encourage root rot. If you notice that the frequent watering harms the plants in the habitat, you'll need to plant something else that tolerates more water.

, In most yards, bugs are plentiful and your toads will have more than they can eat without you needing to take any additional steps. If you are lucky enough to live in an area without many nighttime bugs, you may consider investing in a light to attract insects to the toad habitat during the evening and night.Any type of small garden light will do the trick, but it should be no taller than three feet high.

They are most common in tropical areas.Toads like gardens, fields, streams, and ponds. Toads often like dark, damp places that allow them to hide. Take some time to look for places where you might find toads including:Berry patches
Window wells
TreesUnder leaves
Sand
LawnsGardens
Pools of water such as ponds, streams, lakes, and reservoirs
Forests
Meadows
Under rocks and logs;
, Toads eat a variety of foods including insects, worms, and snails.Looking for toads in the places where their food sources are may help you find them more easily.


Look for worms in rich, soft soil. Rain causes worms to come to the surface and this may be an optimal time to check for them—and toads. You may also want to check for worms and toads under old boards, bricks, logs, or debris where the soil is moist.Find snails in shaded areas, when it is cloudy outside, or at night. Make sure you look for snails and the toads that like to eat them in cooler areas., Toads are mostly nocturnal. They also prefer darker spaces to rest in during the day. Looking for toads when they are most active during the day may help you more successfully find and capture them.Check for toads in the late afternoon, early evening, and nighttime. You may also find them if you search in the early morning.
Look for toads under things such as leaves, logs, and rocks if you search for them during the day.

, Toads, like many amphibians, may hibernate during the winter. Though not all species of toad hibernate, most will burrow below the frost line in the winter. Searching for toads according to the time of year can make you more successful in your hunt.Look for toads in the forest and woodlands, grasslands, yards and gardens during the summer.
Check below the frost line during the winter and early spring. You may also find toads at the bottom of lakes, concealed in logs, or tucked into leaf piles.You may even be able to find some toads swimming under ice in the winter.

, If you prefer to not go on a large expedition to find toads, you can easily find them in your yard or garden. Setting up your yard or garden with water features and places to hide can attract toads that you can then catch.Add a small water feature to your yard. You could have a pond or small fountain. Make sure to not use any chemicals in the water feature because they may harm toads.
Set up a toad abode or adobes where toads can hide, preferably near a shady place or water source. You can easily create an abode yourself by turning a ceramic flowerpot upside down. If it doesn’t have a crack or hole in the side, prop it up with a rock to let the toad get in and out. The abode doesn’t need a bottom because toads like to dig. You can also make an abode out of a pile of rocks.Plant perennials with large leaves such as Bergenia or Ligularia. Make sure to not use chemical pesticides in your yard or garden as this can harm toads and decrease their food supply.

, If you are having trouble finding toads or attracting them to your yard, call or visit your local county extension. The county extension can provide you information on the types of toads in your local area and where you might find them. The county extension can also suggest what to plant and how to fertilize your garden without chemical pesticides that may deter or harm toads.Locate your local county extension at http://npic.orst.edu/pest/countyext.htm.

, People have different reasons for wanting to catch toads. It might be to keep them as pets for life or it might even be to get rid of invasive or poisonous species such as Bufo toads.Knowing your reasons for catching a toad can ensure that you treat toads in the most humane way. Ask yourself the following questions:


Am I willing to support a healthy environment for toads to help get rid of insects in my yard?
Can I commit to taking care of my toad for its life, knowing that it could be up to 15 years? Can I afford the supplies and food?Am I prepared to humanely euthanize invasive toads on my property? Is this better left to a professional?, You can easily trap toads on your property or in other wilderness areas. Having your materials ready can help you quickly build your trap and look for toads. Get the following items:


24 ft. of 18 inch wide aluminum window screening or 15 ft. of 28 inch wide screening
15 ft. of 36 inch wide fiberglass screening
25 ft. of string or small rope to make handles
Utility knife and scissors
Stapler with 1000 staplesSmall fish net or other container if you prefer to catch toads with your handsGlow stick or outdoor light, that can attract insects toads like to eat. A 12 volt black light insect tube may be the most effective at attracting insects., You can purchase traps for amphibians, including toads. But they might not work as well as a trap you make. Using your materials, build the trap(s) and place where toads live.Cut the aluminum window or fiberglass screening in a large rectangle. Then roll it into a cylinder that is 18” x 8” around. Make a 1” lip at the top by rolling the 18” end toward the other end. Staple the lip where it meets the cylinder screening. This will keep the cylinder and lip together. Staple every ½” to hold the cylinders together.
Place the light or glow stick at one end of the of the cylinder and cover it with shade cloth or plastic. Leave the other end open for toads to enter the trap., The most effective place to put your traps is near a body of water. If it is winter, when some toads hibernate, then place the traps near refuges such as plant beds.Place the trap near non-flowing, water source like a swamp, pond, or vernal pool in the summer and spring.Put the trap near burrows and wooded areas in the late spring and early summer.

, Check to see if you’ve trapped any toads within 24 hours of setting the traps. If you didn’t catch any toads, keep catching the trap until you find a toad in it.Use a plastic bag or jar with pinholes or a bucket of water to transfer your toad to its new home.
Release other animals in the trap back into the wild.

, You may want to actively catch a toad using a net instead of traps. Look for the toads in the same places that you would place traps. Take a light or glow stick to attract the insects that toads eat.Put on a pair of waterproof shoes or boots so that you can walk through mud or water.
Sweep the net through the water, hoop first, through the water when you see a toad you’d like to catch. You’ll have to be quick so that you don’t miss it.

, There are many myths about toads giving humans warts by touching their skin. You can’t get warts by touching the skin of toads, but you may exposure yourself to other irritants. Many toads have a so-called bufotoxin on their skin, which can cause other small animals death and irritation to human skin. If you’re going to catch the toad you found, use a net or a pair of gloves so that you minimize the risk of skin irritation with a bufotoxin., You’ve located a spot to find toads and considered your motives, and now you’re ready to get your toad. It’s a good idea to know what traits identify toads. Some typical characteristics of toads are:


Dry, warty skinBumps on their heads
Stubby bodiesStubby hind legs
Swellings behind the eyes, which are the parotid glands
Brown or grayish color
Jewel-like eyes
Slightly-webbed toes
No teeth, unlike frogs

, Most toads have the same basic characteristics. However, there are 300 different species of toads across the globe. They can vary in size and color. Figuring out what species may be in your area can help you locate toads and even find unusual species.Check with your local or national wildlife agency for toad species that you can find near you. For example, if you live in Western Europe, you might find the common midwife toad.If you’re in Madagascar, you might find the rare red Dyscophus antongilii.People in the Americas may find giant or cane toads.You can also find these in Australia., You might spot a toad that doesn’t match any basic characteristics. You may have found a frog instead. All toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. This can be confusing! Ask yourself the following questions if you are unsure if you found a toad or a frog:Where does the toad live? Frogs and toads live in similar places, but frogs may live in trees. You won’t find any toads climbing trees.
Is my toad chubby or slim? Toads are chubbier than their frog cousins. They have shorter back legs, which are good for hopping on the ground, or walking and crawling. Toads may be slightly slower and less active than leaping frogs.
What do my toad’s feet look like? A toad won’t have webbed feet or sticky pads on its toes. Frogs have webbed hind find and some may have webbed front feet. Some frogs have pads on their toes to help them climb trees.
What does my toad’s skin look like? Frogs have smooth and moist skin. Toads have drier skin that feels rough and has warts.

First, you will need a tank.,
Next you will need a substrate.,
Then you should put on a background that goes along with what's in the terrariums.,
Next add a rock in the left hand corner that is the farthest away from you.,
Next put a water bowl in the corner right in front of the rock.,
After you get the water dish in the cage and it is level pour some dechlorinated water in it; chlorine is toxic to frogs.,
Then put a place the toad(s) can hide in and can get in and out of easily that can probably fit about two toads in it on the right hand corner farthest away from you.. you can find things like this at a local pet store or you can make one by turning a butter container and cutting a hole big enough for your toad to fit in.

,
Put some artificial or real plants in the terrarium especially hanging over the water bowl.,
Put some crickets in the terrarium depending on how many toads will be in it about two crickets per toad.,
Put a thermometer on the left hand side of the terrarium.

,
Right next to that put a humidifier.

,
On the right hand side you can put an automatic mister up by the top of the side.,
Put the toad(s) in and make sure they have enough room to move around that isn't already taken up that means that is just open space.

,
Once you done all the things you needed to do put the lid on the terrarium and enjoy.

",How to Create a Terrarium for an American Toad (Bufor Americanus)," This tank will serves the animals home for the rest of it's life so get the right stuff because how would you like to live in a house without a TV, toys, or furniture. The size of the tank depends on the size of your toad(s) and how many toad(s) will be in the tank. For one toad get a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank, for two toads get a fifteen, three get a twenty gallon tank. You shouldn't really put no more than three in a tank together unless you get a forty gallon breeder tank for four toads. The toads you have should be all around the same size. The tank should be longer than tall.;
, (ground covering) You should have enough for there to be at least three inches cause the toads like to burrow. You shouldn't have any more than five cause sometimes they will get down to low and they can't get back up cause it is too thick or another toad has burrowed on top of the one already burrowed. You can use some unfertilized soil for the substrate or you can go to the pet store and get some eco earth, bed a beast, coconut fiber, coconut husk, or reptile bark. I don't recommend sand cause sometimes they ingest it and it gets in their mouths and it grinds down there inside of the mouth and can get infected. Also,if they swallow it it can become impacted in their digestive system and kill them.

, The reason for putting the background on is because it makes hem feel more secure and they don't feel completely out in the open. Put this in on the outside instead of the inside because if it's in the inside it can get wet and make the tape to not stick and it will fall off. Don't just check one side of the background cause one side may have a different scene.

, The rock shouldn't be big enough to take up both of the corners in that side because you have to put something in the other corner.

, that isn't deep enough for the toad(s) to have its head cause they don't like to swim but they can just not very well. You should carry this down in the substrate so that the edge is lined up with the substrate but make sure a lot of the substrate isn't pouring into it.

, Aquarium dechlorinating drops may be used or water can be left uncovered in a container for 24 hours to allow the chlorine to dissipate.

,, Don't use real plants unless you have a bunch of extra time on your hands and you know that plant is not poisonous to the toad.

, You can also get some worms of the right size in to but they might not get eaten till you mist the terrarium cause that's when the worms will come up. Don't put more than two for any number of toads.

,,, You don't have to do this but if you want to you can and this makes the toads happier.

Get the right size aquarium.,
Fill the aquarium properly.,
Provide lighting.,
Monitor the temperature.,
Spray the cage with water each day.,
Feed your toads crickets and mealworms.,
Add other insects to your toad's diet.,
Supplement your toad's diet with vitamins and minerals.,
Address shedding issues.,
Give your toads privacy.,
Wash the tank regularly.",How to Care for Fire Belly Toads," In general, bigger is better for fire-belly toads. They are active animals and need room to roam around. Five adult toads can fit comfortably in a 15-gallon aquarium that's 24 inches long, and 12 inches high by 12 inches wide.You can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store.
The aquarium you use should come with a screen cover. This promotes ventilation, which is important for the health of fire-belly toads.;
, You should have a land and water area in your aquarium as fire-belly toads are only semi-aquatic. The land area should be two thirds to one half of the tank. You should attempt to create a natural-like habitat, with rocks, soil, moss, fake plants, and drift wood. You can purchase these supplies online or at a pet store.The land area should gradually slope into the water area. You can use things like soil and driftwood to create an incline into the water.
It's best to use distilled water, which you can purchase in a grocery store. If you do use tap water, buy a water conditioner at your pet store. Use it according to package instructions to decontaminate the water before adding it to the tank.

, If you live in a cooler area, or keep the tank in a cool area in your home, use a small incandescent light bulb. This can provide heat. Fluorescent lights are not usually needed, but are important if you're growing live plants in the tank., Fire-belly toads thrive at a temperature between 65 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 36 degrees celsius). The temperature should not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius). However, cooler temperatures are generally better tolerated. You should monitor the temperature closely by keeping a thermometer in the tank. If it gets too hot, move the tank to somewhere cooler in your home, turn on the air conditioning, or use a fan.A heat lamp may not be necessary, as fire-bellied toads can tolerate cool temperatures and thrive at room temperature., Humidity is not as important to fire-belly toads as it is to other amphibians. However, it's a good idea to spritz the tank with water using a spray bottle every day. This will keep the tank adequately humid for fire-bellied toads., Live crickets and mealworms, which you can buy at a pet store, should be the staple of your fire-belly toad's diet. You should feed your toads as many crickets and worms as they can eat in a 15 minute period.Opt for smaller crickets to avoid a choking hazards., In addition to crickets and mealworms, fire-belly toads can benefit from having other food available. You can add food sources to their water, such as guppies, and snails. As fire-belly toads are active animals, they can benefit from having live food sources in their aquarium.All food should be live. Fire-belly toads do not recognize non-living food sources, and these can quickly contaminate your toad's tank.

, Full-grown fire belly toads can benefit from added vitamins and minerals. Some crickets are sold supplemented with vitamins and minerals necessary to your toad's diet. Usually, toads can benefit from supplemented crickets every one to two feeding periods.Talk to your vet before offering supplements. You want to make sure any supplements you use are healthy and safe for your toads., Fire-belly toads need to shed for their health and wellbeing. Do not be alarmed if you see your frog crunched up in a slouching position. This means it is getting ready to shed. If you see your frogs engaging in these behaviors, it's important you help the shedding process. If your frogs shed improperly, you will have to peel their skin off yourself by gently massaging the frog until the skin slips off. As fire-belly toads dislike being handled, this can be stressful.You will have to increase the humidity in the tank during shedding time. If you notice your frogs crouching, and that their overall energy has slowed down, start misting the cage twice a day instead of once a day.

, Fire-belly toads are not that social. They dislike being handled often and need a great deal of privacy. Only pick up your toads when necessary and be sure to provide lots of hiding places for the toads. You can buy structures for toads to hide in online or at a pet store., You need to wash the tank regularly to keep your toads healthy. The water container should be clean daily with mild dish detergent. It should then be replaced with filtered water or de-chlorinated water.Once every two months, clean all items in the tank with mild dish detergent and wipe down the inside of the tank with vinegar and water (one parts vinegar to eight parts water).
Make sure to rinse all items thoroughly before returning them to the tank.

Release tadpoles if you cannot care for them.,
Make sure the area where you're catching tadpoles is safe.,
Check state regulations.,
Avoid capturing too many tadpoles.",How to Catch Tadpoles," Before setting out to capture a tadpole, you'll want to have certain supplies ready. You can find most necessary supplies around your house. If you can't locate certain supplies, you can purchase them at a local supermarket or drug store.You'll need a fine or mesh net to scoop the tadpoles out of the water. You can also use a mason jar, if you cannot find a net, but a net will give you better control.
You should have something to place to tadpoles in after they are caught. You should immediately place them in a container of clean, chlorine free water. Consider bringing a bucket of water with you when you go to catch tadpoles. Some of the water you caught the tadpoles in may slip into the container, so do not full it up completely.
You may want to wear gloves when catching tadpoles. Depending on the area where you're catching tadpoles, boots may also be helpful. Wear boots if you're catching tadpoles in a muddy area.;
, In order to capture tadpoles, you'll need to know where they typically congregate. You may have seen tadpoles somewhere around your home or neighborhood. This would be a good place to start. However, if you've never seen tadpoles before, look for them in areas where they're typically found.Tadpoles tend to live in streams, swamps, pools, and lakes.
Tadpoles are often found near the banks of such places, and in shallow water. You may see them swimming in large groups.
Occasionally, frogs may lay eggs in flooded portions of grass after a heavy rain.

, Once you've located tadpoles, catching them is fairly easy. You simply need to place your device in the pond, stream, lake, or other body of water. Use your device to scoop up a few tadpoles.A net works best as you can make quick, scooping motions with it. Simply dip the net into the water near the tadpoles and try to scoop water containing tadpoles out of the pond.
If you do not have a net, you can also use a jar. However, always try to scoop tadpoles. Some people attempt to catch tadpoles by placing a jar in the water and waiting for the tadpoles to swim into the jar. Tadpoles are unlikely to swim into an unknown object.

, Once you've caught your tadpoles, immediately transfer them into a container of clean water. Your water should not have chlorine or salt in it. When you've caught as many tadpoles as you want, you can take your container inside and transfer your tadpoles to a safe environment.


Some of the water you caught the tadpoles in will get in the clean water, as it will be hard to remove the tadpoles by hand. Just make sure you only get a small amount of water from a lake or pond into your clean water.
Pick a container you can easily carry. You should have something like a bucket, which has a handle, or a small sealable Tupperware container with some holes poked in the lid. You don't want to accidentally drop your tadpoles while transporting them to your home, as this could potentially kill them.

, You want to store your tadpoles in an aquarium or a similar type of container. The container should ideally be made of glass, although boxes made of foam or plastic products can also suffice. You should never store tadpoles in a metal container.Shorter, wider containers are better than longer, narrower containers.
Make sure the container has a lid. If the container comes with a ventilation system, make sure this system also has a lid. Tadpoles can swim into ventilation ducts and die.

, Unlike fish or other aquatic animals, tadpoles do not require a tank with a bottom lined with mold or rocks. You can leave the bottom of a fish tank bare and fill it with water.Keep the tadpole tank in an area in your home that is 95% shaded.
When the water gets murky, remove the tadpoles using a jar or net. Set them aside in a smaller container and clean the tank.

, Tadpoles need clean water or they will not survive. Make sure you're using fresh tap water. Do not clean a tadpole tank with chemical cleaners, as even small traces of chemicals can harm a tad pool.If you have a water filtration system, like a Brita Filter, it's a good idea to use this to filter going into your tadpole tank. Trace amounts of chlorine are sometimes found in tap water. Even a small amount of chlorine is deadly to a tadpole., Pet stores do sell flakes for tadpoles, which you can use following the feeding suggestions on the package. However, if you can't find tadpole flakes, you can use spinach or lettuce to create tadpole food in your kitchen.Boil spinach or lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes and then drain it well. Use gloves or oven mitts when draining to avoid burning your hands.
Chop your boiled lettuce or spinach into tiny pieces. Put a tablespoon per tadpole in your tank once a day. For example, if you have four tadpoles, you should feed them four tablespoons of the lettuce or spinach once a day.

, A tadpole is a living thing. You should not keep tadpoles as pets if you lack the resources to care for them long term. If you do not want the time and commitment that goes along with tadpoles, re-release them into the wild.

, Tadpoles sometimes tend to congregate in swampy areas. If you're setting out to capture tadpoles, make sure the area is free of poisonous weeds and difficult terrain that could cause you to slip and get hurt. Wear appropriate shoes, like heavy sneakers or boots, if you're catching tadpoles in a swampy area., It is not legal to capture tadpoles everywhere. Some states may have laws against taking animals out of the wild, even in the larval stage. Check the website of your local Department of Natural Resources. If you cannot find the information there, you can call the DNR during office hours., It can be easy to end up scooping quite a few tadpoles in one motion, as they tend to swim close together. If you intend to raise tadpoles, remember they will one day grow into frogs. You do not want to be left with 10 or 20 frogs to care for. Stick to catching a manageable amount of tadpoles, like 3 to 4. If you end up with more than you want, you can release some tadpoles back into the lake or stream before taking your tadpoles home.

Prepare a home.,
Make the habitat as much like the toad's natural area as possible, which includes dirt and sand, grass, water, small logs and rocks.,
Add water.,
Be sure the lid closes securely.,
Be sure that the habitat does not get below 60˚F or above 70˚F. ,
Feed your toad properly.,
Feed toads live food as they only eat things that move.,
Alternatively, catch insects outside.,
Perform regular maintenance.,
If your toad appears to be lethargic or especially thin, look up ""Toad Illnesses"" on Google and refine your search by adding ""thin"" or whatever describes the current illness.,
If you plan on handling your toad, wash your hands thoroughly with water and mild soap and rinse especially well.,
Find a 5 gallon (18.9 L) container with a lid.,
Fill a bottle cap with water.,
Place the toad inside and cover the habitat.",How to Care for an American Toad," Find a 10 or 20 gallon (37.9 or 75.7 L) aquarium. A 5 gallon (18.9 L) tank is too small for a regular habitat depending on the size of the toad, but will work in temporary conditions.;
,


Fill the tank with 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of organic potting soil, preferably with peat moss. Two inches works if you have other refuges for the toad such as a leafy plant or tilted piece of bark. Most pet stores carry ground coconut fiber or forest bark bedding which is an excellent substrate.
Find a medium-sized rock or a piece of slate and wedge it at an angle, near a corner of the tank as the toad may want to burrow underneath a rock.
Put one or two hollow logs and some moss in the tank if you want a natural environment for the toad, or you may use fish tank props to decorate it.

, Using a Tupperware® container that is at least two toads wide and four toads long (big enough for him to swim around in), bury it so the top is level with the dirt, and fill it with filtered/unchlorinated water. Amphibians are sensitive to chlorine so do not use straight chlorinated city tap water; bottled water is okay to use. You can get distilled water at the drug or grocery store.

, Never leave the tank without the lid on it. Never use a cardboard lid.

,, Toads will basically eat any small insect that fits into their mouths. One good rule is to feed the toad every other day.


For a small toad: 2 little bugs per day OR one small slug OR 1 pinhead crickets
Medium toad: 2 small bugs per day OR regular size slug OR 2 small crickets
Large toad: 3 small bugs per day OR large slug OR 3 small crickets

, Do not attempt to feed dead insects as they decompose quickly and there is no point feeding something dead that risks harboring dangerous bacteria.


Toads are predators and have voracious appetites. An adult toad in your garden will eat up to 25 mosquitoes a night. In captivity, a well cared for toad will be fat. A skinny toad is a starving toad. Many pet/bait shops sell crickets. You can buy around 10 crickets and keep them in small kritter keeper with a few apple slices and some hiding spots like egg carton egg holders.

, Go for insects such as small beetles, pill bugs and crickets to supply your pet.


Toads love the little gray roly-poly bugs that can often be found under moist bark or wood pieces on the ground, under rocks, and in other places like that. They are easy to supply, or even cultivate on your own- just take a large container and punch holes in the top, place rotting leaves and bark in with some crumpled paper, and dump in the bugs. They will usually do fine and multiply.

, Change water daily (they use this dish as a toilet), remove any uneaten bugs (crickets can actually nibble on the toad's skin while it is sleeping) and shake dirt or sand off decorations.


If the dirt in your toad's aquarium becomes dry, use a spray bottle to moisten it. Toads also enjoy a misting every now and then. Don't turn the dirt into mud! Just make sure it is not dry.

,


If your toad suddenly disappears, do not worry. He may be burrowed deep in the substrate to cool off or just to take a nap. He will come back up when he feels the need to bathe or air out.

, The oils on your hands can harm the animal.

,


Layer the bottom with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of sand then 1-1 1/2 inches of soil.
Pull small plants by the root and place them in the soil. Add some small stones, pebbles, and twigs.
Poke air holes in the container's lid.

, Find some insects and place them in the habitat.

, Enjoy watching your toad before letting him go.


If handling the toad, wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap before and after handling.

Make sure you have a southern toad.,
Capture your toad.,
Make an enclosure for your toad.,
Feed your toad daily.",How to Care for Wild Southern Toads," Most toads are confused as they have similar features. A southern toad has two rough bumps on their heads, and are likely to have small bumps (also called warts) surrounding their skin. Most people believe toads give you warts. This is not true.;
, Toads are most likely to be caught at night. Around 8:00-9:00 P.M., check your around your yard for hopping creatures. Check around ponds and edges of forests. Toads can be quick and if you are using your hands to capture them, they will urinate on you. If they do this, carry the toad to a safe area and wash your hands with soap and water until clean.

, Toads can live in a variety of habitats but be sure to re-make their environment like where you found them. If you find them on concrete, be sure to provide a bowl of water, no deeper than their noses or drowning may occur. Make sure you have 2-3"" of soil, sand, or potting soil for your toad to burrow in. Also, give shelters like a half-coconut shell house, or tilted bark for sleeping. If you cannot find your toad, there are two possibilities. Either your toad managed to escape, or it is burrowing. Some toads are able to change their coloring to blend (camouflage). You may be surprised to see your toad right under your nose! (Not literally.)

, Toads eat earwigs, crickets, grasshoppers, minnows, ants, cockroaches, dragonflies, butterflies, moths, worms, carpenter ants, flies, and other small insects. You can catch these insects, buy them, or raise them. Toads will only eat live food. Feed your toad at least 10 insects a day.

Enclosure: Red eyed tree frogs are arboreal animals.,
Substrate: Substrate, or ground covering is important, as it helps to make not only the cleaning process easier, but it helps with the aesthetics, humidity control and excrement (poop) collection.,
Branches and climbing surfaces:



Bendable branches are great for altering the look and feel of the environment to your liking each time you clean.,
Water Features: Obviously, frogs need water to survive, just like everything else.,
Lighting/heating: Red eyed tree frogs aren't particular as to which type of lighting is used.,
Feeding: Red eyed tree frogs love to eat.,
Cleaning: Inspect your frog's enclosure daily and remove dead leaves from plants; excrement; dead, uneaten bugs.",How to Set up a Red Eyed Tree Frog Enclosure," This means that they spend most of their time in trees and tall shrubs/plants. Keeping this fact in mind, you should always try to get as tall an aquarium as is reasonably possible. This leaves much to speculation, but keep this rule of thumb at your fingertips (pun intended): You should have 15 gallons (56.8 L) or 20"" x 10"" x 17"" worth of enclosure per adult red eyed tree frog. The enclosure should have limited screen openings as this will make it very challenging to keep up the 80-90% humidity level. Either a removable or liftable screen/mesh top will work fine. That is based upon your preference. You can have both. Glass sides, as opposed to screen and/or mesh make it easier not only for the frogs to climb on but also to keep the humidity up.
, It can, depending upon the type used, also be used to plant live flora (plants). There are many different ways to cover the floor of the enclosure:


Paper towel: PROS: Great for easy clean up during enclosure maintenance, cheap, easy to replace. CONS: Doesn't hold moisture for long, tends to build bacteria and smell quicker, looks very clinical and sterile (frogs don't mind it so much, but it doesn't look nice to the frog owner).

Moss: PROS: Holds moister pretty well, easy to distribute along the floor, consumes excrement and grows (if live moss). CONS: Messy, sticks to frogs (not in a bad way, just tends to get cluttered on their skin), can have a pungent odor, dirties the water, and good luck finding any roaches or crickets that escape the feeding bowl.

Soil: PROS: Holds moisture for extended periods of time, looks natural, works well with or without live or dried moss, has a nice earthy aroma. CONS: Not cheap, if you get coconut husk or tropical soil bricks; messy; dirties the frogs and water; can house fungus and mold, if not controlled.

, They are not too inexpensive, but you can usually find them on Craigslist for cheap. They are also softer and don't come with the risk of scratching, scarring or tearing the frog's delicate skin.

Driftwood is also a nice touch, but tends to gather mold quickly and rots easily in the high humidity environment as is the tree frog enclosure.

African Driftwood is great as it is nice and dark; heavy, so it won't tip or fall once properly secured; hinders mold and mildew; but is expensive. and be sure to check for sharp edges & sand them down.

, How you go about it is entirely an aesthetic approach. There are bowls, running waterfalls, streams, pools...A simple medium sized bowl with smooth stones for ease in exiting from said water feature works best. However, a nice waterfall is great for upping the humidity. Just be sure to keep the filter clean or it clogs up.


Streams and pools typically accompany the waterfall or moving water feature. these are also harder to maintain and clean; not to mention they are typically costly additions.
Always use filtered or RO water. You can buy the water for cheap at any water store or buy it in the gallons at your local grocery store. Clean the water dish out every couple days. They muck the water up quickly as frogs find it easier to eliminate their bowels (poop) in water.

, As long as they can get the 12 hour photo period needed for normal day/night existence. If you have live plants in your enclosure (great idea) then you'll need a UV grow light set at a 12 hour time limit or the plants will decay. Using a timer for the lights is recommended, as this way you won't dash off to work and halfway into your day realize ""D'oh! I forgot to turn on the light!""


Steer clear of incandescent lighting as it is too hot, too wasteful on the environment and doesn't last nearly as long as UV.
The median temperature should be 78ºf – 85ºf (26ºc - 29ºc) with an 80% - 90% humidity.

, Like most all frogs, they are gluttons. Meaning they will eat till they develop a weight problem. Ever see a fat tree frog? It's not pretty. Nothing is sadder than to watch an obese frog try to nimbly climb or jump. The food of choice is of course crickets. The size of all their live food should be no longer that the width of the frog's head from eye to eye. This measurement is cast aside if feeding a red wiggler worm or wax worms. The frog fodder list goes as follows – but is in no particular order:


Crickets
Dubia cockroaches
Wax worms
Red wiggler earth worms
Flies
Moths
Spiders (not recommended as the wrong kind and a spider bite can kill your frog)
Other soft bodied insects.

, Also inspect that nothing has been knocked over. This is a good time to inspect the frogs for injuries and general health conditions.


Fully clean your enclosure every two weeks. Do not use household cleaners. These will leave a poisonous residue and will kill your frogs. All pet stores sell reptile cleaning sprays designed to be used safely on all reptile and amphibian enclosures. After spraying down and wiping off all the walls be sure to go over the walls again with a clean damp towel or cloth, just to make sure. You should smell only humidity and/or soil/moss. Any hint of a chemical spray is too much residue and should be removed. Amphibians absorb chemicals through their skin. So think of any chemicals left behind as being injected directly into your veins. This would be bad.
Remove old substrate or shave off the top layers, if a planted soil-based flooring. Replace with new soil as needed.

Find a toad.,
Catch and handle a toad gently.,
House a toad indoors.,
Provide something in which your toad can dig.,
Outfit the toad’s home properly.,
Feed your toad the finest crickets you can find.",How to Catch a Toad1," You can find toads almost anywhere there is consistent moisture. Toads will be especially easy to find near the concrete foundation of buildings and porches after it rains. Check under logs, near stumps, and under rocks near water as well.During the spring, male toads will relax in pools of water and call to female toads, hoping to attract company, not to mention the chance to procreate.
Once you find a toad, don’t make any sudden movements. Approach it slowly.
Be careful not to squish the toad when moving any rocks or other heavy materials.;
, Kneel down and cup your hands around the toad slowly but steadily. Cradle them gently in both hands to ensure they don’t jump out and injure themselves.If the toad “waters” in your hands, don’t be alarmed - it's not pee, it's water released from their water bladder.
You cannot get warts from handling toads.
Don’t handle a toad too much, as the oils on your skin can hurt it after a while.

, If you’re hoping to keep a wild caught toad as a pet, see the corresponding wikiHow article for more specific steps. The first step, of course, is providing your toad a habitat. Use a ten gallon fish tank, or comparable container, with a tight fitting lid.If you continue to practice your toad hunting skills, each new acquisition requires about 5 gallons worth of space.
If you catch baby toads, smaller plastic ‘critter keepers’ from the pet store will be more than sufficient for housing before the toad nears full size – which can be over four inches long!
Clean the interior of the toad’s enclosure once a month with heavily diluted bleach – shoot for about 5% bleach and 95% water.
If you only intend to keep your toad for a few days, a box with a reliably closing lid and no holes larger than a dime will also work.

, Toads are all about burrowing, so they need something they can dig into. Use non-fertilized potting soil missed or sphagnum moss. Mix them together to really spoil your toad. This material, called substrate, should be at least 4 inches deep.Know that toads are nocturnal, and will likely bury themselves in the substrate during the day – so don’t be worried if you can’t spot your toad.
Lightly spray the substrate with water every day. This will make it easy for your toad to maneuver around their domain and comfortably lounge in choice pockets of substrate.
Replace all of the substrate every 2 to 4 months.

, You also need to ensure the toad’s home is appropriately decorated and kept at the right temperature. Similarly, the proper amount of light is vital, as is adequate humidity.Most importantly, provide a wide, shallow pool of water for your toad to soak in.


Carefully add a piece of wood. Your toad will likely burrow right beneath it.
A hollowed out log is even more exciting, as a lazy toad can simply post up inside of it.
As long as there is adequate substrate and you keep it clean and moist, the toad will be able to regulate it’s temperature.
Room temperature is okay, even with natural cooling of 10-15 degrees F in the evening.
Toads do not need artificial lighting for warmth.
Replace the water in their toad tubs daily.

, Toads eat mostly insects in the wild, with growing toads eating over a dozen small insects in a single evening. Since crickets are readily accessible at pet stores, they will be your most reliable food source.Toads will also eat minnows, earthworms, and other insects as well. You may have to dangle non-lively critters in front of your toad to bait them into attacking.
Make sure you only feed your toad food that is smaller in size than the width of your toad’s mouth. Toads are naturally ravenous beasts, and may attempt to swallow things they probably shouldn’t.
Let your toad eat as much as it wants for fifteen minutes every evening.
Remove any food they attempt to hoard at the conclusion of their nightly feeding session.

Look at the hind legs.,
Examine the feet.,
Consider the shape.,
Take note of the skin.,
Look at the color.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Frog and a Toad1," You can tell the difference between a frog and a toad by the length of its legs. If you can get close enough, get a good look at the back legs specifically.A frog's hind legs are very long, as frogs hop more frequently than toads. A frog's hind legs will be bigger than its head and body.
A toad's hind legs will be smaller, as toads tend to crawl. Their hind legs will be shorter than their heads and bodies.;
, Frogs have webbed feet, as they spend most of their life in water. They will usually have webbed back feet, and some will have webbed front feet. You may also see sticky pads on a frog's feet. Toad feet are generally not webbed and do not have pads., Frogs tend to be slender and athletic in appearance. Toads, on the other hand, are shorter and stubbier.A slender looking amphibian, with longer limbs, is probably a frog.
A short, chubby amphibian, with smaller legs, is likely a toad.

, Frog skin is a lot smoother than toad skin. A toad's skin will be bumpy in appearance. While a frog will have smooth, rubbery skin, a toad may look like it's covered in warts., In general, frogs are lighter colored than toads. They tend to look greener. While toads may have a greenish skin, they tend to be darker overall than frogs.Toads come in various shades that range from a dark green to an olive green.
Frogs are on the more yellowish, brighter side of the green spectrum. Frogs may have a yellow-olive color.
However, do not rely on color alone. Always consider other factors, as some frogs do have a brownish green appearance.

"
First start off with getting a 10 gallon (37.85L) aquarium.,
Put a background (if you want one) on the outside back of the enclosure.

,
Now fill the aquarium with two inches of Eco Earth, Bed a Beast or similar - they're both the same thing, just different brands.,
Then put in on one third of the aquarium with pre-soaked moss and mix them both.,
Next put in your shallow water dish in on one side of the enclosure.,
Put some fresh spring water, RO water, or distilled water in its water bowl.

,
Dampen the substrate with a sprayer or spritzer and always be sure to have a damp but not saturated substrate as these Leptodactylidaes  need a high humidity.

,
Put in some plants - artificial or real, ask a pet shop owner for good species of plant - to hang over the water bowl so the frog doesn't feel out in the open.

,
Next put a log on the side of the wall that leads from the dry side to the moist side.,
Now put a medium size rock in a corner on the dry side.

,
Put a thermometer and a humidity gauge on the side of the tank and check that both are at the right levels (The temperature should be kept around 82ºf (28ºc) during the day, dropping to around 78ºf (25ºc) at night.,
Put your frog in.

,
Put the lid on and put your UVB light on the screen top.,
A 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium should be sufficient for an adult specimen.,
Now put on a heat pad so that during the night the frog tank can stay at the right temperature.,
You should get a background that covers the back and both sides of the cage.,
You should put in two inches of the correct substrate.,
Put in a water dish.,
Now put your RO or distilled water in the water dish and make sure you don't fill it up to high or your frog can drown (mid shoulder height is acceptable).,
Put in a hiding place for your frog.,
Put in some fake plants.,
After all this is done make sure the pacman frog still has enough safe areas to move around in and it doesn't seem too small that it could stress out the frog.

,
Put in a thermometer so you will know how hot it is in the enclosure and know if it the right temperature for the pacman.

,
Put in a hydrometer to check the humidity and to see if it is humid enough for the pacman.

,
Close the enclosure.

,
Put on a heat lamp (if necessary) so you can get the temperature to rise in the enclosure if you need it too.

,
Put in your pacman and enjoy.

",How to Set Up a Pacman Frog Enclosure," These animals are used to staying on the ground, so it is better to have a long terrarium than a tall one.

,, You can ask a vet or pet shop owner if you're not sure what these are or where you can find them.

, You can also help maintain humidity levels by adding coconut husk, fern tree bark, or orchid bark in with your substrate mix. You can buy the moss at a local pet store. You shouldn't use the moss you find in your backyard as it contains parasites that are potentially dangerous to your frog.

, The reason the dish should be shallow is because these frogs can't swim very well. The dish needs to be big enough to have the frog's whole body in the dish with room to move around.

,,,, You can buy a plastic log at a local pet store, but you can also make your own. Go and find a hollow log, soak it in water, cut it in half and take out the middle. Make sure the frog can fit under it and travel through it. It doesn't have to be wide enough or long enough to fill the whole tank. Also make certain that the log was never treated with chemicals of any kind.

,, Heating is best supplied by an under tank heater as overhead incandescent bulbs can be too drying. Humidity should be kept at or near 80%–90%).

,, This should be set to a 12 hour photoperiod.

, You may wish to choose to buy one of these from be beginning or start off with a 5 gallon (18.9 L). Since they rarely move, tanks larger than 15 gallons (56.8 L) will be unnecessary.;
, The heat pad should be put at the bottom of the cage on the outside so when it is burrowing, the pacman doesn't burn itself.

, The reason for getting the background is, it makes the animal feel more enclosed and feel like it's in the natural environment if you get a background that looks like a rain forest. Another boost to the background is it makes the cage seem more visually appealing to the viewer. Always put the background on the outside of the cage.

, The substrate should be coco fiber or coco husk. These are also known as echo earth or bed a beast. You shouldn't use stones or moss because it may cause impaction that could kill your pacman and you wouldn't want that. This substrate is cheap but needs to be changed monthly and sprayed twice a day.

, The water dish should be big enough for your frog to fit in and move around and still have space. Make sure the dish is shallow because these animals are not very good swimmers and can drown. Make it shallow so your pacman can get in and out of the water dish easily. Dig and put it down into the substrate but make sure the substrate is staying out of the dish. Make sure the water dish doesn't take up too much space though. Remember that frogs don't drink like dogs, they absorb it through their permeable skin.

, The water has to be un chlorinated  or the chemicals in tap water can kill your frog. You can use tap water though if you have some water conditioner meant for reptiles, this water conditioner breaks down the chlorine and chloramines that can kill your frog. Water conditioner can be found at a local pet store.

, This hiding place helps the frog because the frog has a place to get out of the light if it wants to. It also lives in the tank. Know this is when most people make a mistake, they buy something that isn't big enough for the frog to fit in and just waste money. Another one of the mistakes people tend to do will be to go outside and find things to put in the tank as hiding places but you can only do that if you put the thing into boiling water and put it in the oven at three fifty for thirty minutes.

, These fake plants add effects to the cage and also creates more places for the pacman to hide and makes the cage look nicer. You shouldn't use real plants because they don't last that long and some are poisonous to the pacman and can cause your pacman to die.

Watch out for invasive species.,
Catch cane toads when they’re still spawn.,
Catch cane toad tadpoles by using cane toad poison.,
Handling adult cane toads.,
Euthanize toads humanely.,
Do not engage in animal cruelty.",How to Catch a Toad3," Invasive species – sometimes even toads – can wreak havoc upon an ecosystem. Native toads are especially vulnerable to attack or competition from nonnative amphibians.Help biologists who study amphibians by participating in a scientific monitoring program online.
Learn about the invasive species in your area and try to keep them out of your habitat, so the toads you know are safe.
Cane toads are a particularly dangerous invasive species, as they can kill larger predators – and even pets – that eat them.

, Finding and removing cane toad eggs is the easiest and most humane way to remove cane toads from where they shouldn’t be.Recognize cane toad spawn: long, jelly-like strands with black dots all along the strands.
Remove strings of eggs from the water and dispose of them in your compost, bury them in your garden, or leave them in the sun to dry out.

, It’s also preferable to catch tadpoles before they turn into toads, in part because it is more humane, but also because it is more effective.Place a dead cane toad inside a funnel trap and submerge the trap in a body of water where you’ve found evidence of cane toad presence.
The secretion from cane toads’ shoulders will attract cane toad tadpoles, helping you curb the species presence in waterways around your home by catching them before they take over completely.
Dispose of tadpoles by burying them in your compost or garden.

, Adult cane toads do have poison glands on the back of their heads – though they don’t release poison unless handled roughly. Still, protect yourself for safety.Wear gloves, rubber boots, and a sack to catch adult cane toads.
Collect cane toads at night using flashlights and other concentrated light sources, which will immobilize toads.

, Though unpleasant, invasive species must often be killed. Do so in a manner that causes no pain or stress to the toads.Put the toad(s) in a plastic container with airholes punched into it.
Place the container in the fridge for at least four hours. This will put the toad(s) into a coma-like state.
Place the container in the freezer for at least three days. This will kill the toads as humanly as possible.
Most communities that struggle with cane toad infestation will have a collection center that will kill and dispose of cane toads for you.

, Do not bash toads with anything or grab them and bash them against hard surfaces. Aside from being incredibly inhumane, bashing cane toads actually presents a risk to your safety; if their poison splatters into your eyes, it can temporarily blind you.A golf club is an immature and sadistic item to touch any animal with in any way.
Similarly, spraying toads with aggressive chemicals is a vile way to treat animals.
In particular, do not use bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or Dettol. While each of these have a reputation for killing toads, they may simply maim them, and cause immense pain to the animals.
Furthermore, avoid the use of chemicals to ensure that you are not adding anything that may harm other species to the environment.

Watch how the animal jumps.,
Notice if the animal ever crawls.,
Consider where you found the animal.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Frog and a Toad2," Both frogs and toads jump. Frogs, however, tend to jump more often and much higher.Frogs take very high jumps, and can also jump great lengths.
Toads take very small hops and lack the ability to jump very far.

, Toads are much more likely to crawl than hop. Crawling is a toad's main form of movement. You will rarely see a frog crawling. An animal that is crawling is very likely to be a toad.Always consider other factors, as an injured frog may crawl.

, Frogs need to be close to water to survive, while toads can spend a lot of time out of water. An animal that stays close to water is likely to be a frog. If you find an animal far away from water, it is probably a toad. A frog is unlikely to wander far from a source of water."

Provide a proper environment.",How to Care for a Sick Frog with Red Leg Disease," You may notice your frog acting tired or being inactive if they are suffering from red leg disease. Always monitor your frog's level of activity to learn what is normal for them, allowing you to detect any signs of illness. If you think your frog isn't as active as it normally is, you may want to take it to your veterinarian to check for any medical problems.Frogs with red leg diseases will move very little throughout the day.
In the later stages of red leg disease, your frog may become nearly totally inactive.;
, One symptom of red leg disease is pronounced weight loss. Any frog that you care for which suddenly begins losing a large amount of weight is likely ill and may be suffering from red leg disease. Frogs that are displaying sudden weight loss should be brought to a veterinarian as soon as possible to look for the cause.Red leg disease causes your frog to almost entirely stop eating.
However, your frog may have stopped eating for another reason. Your veterinarian will be able to tell you more.

, Red leg disease can cause bleeding and open sores to occur in your frog. Displaying open sores or bleeding is a serious sign that an infection has progressed to a very dangerous point. Immediate veterinary attention is required if your frog is showing these signs as it may be near death at this point., The easiest way to identify a possible case of red leg disease is to look for the reddening that the disease gets its name from. The underside of your frog will begin to turn a shade of red, due to an internal infection. As soon as you notice any signs of reddening in the legs or underside of your frog, take them to your veterinarian for treatment.You may first notice the redness in the tips of the frog's toes.
The red legs appear because the capillaries in the frog's legs are dilated.

, If you suspect that your frog may be ill or suffering from red leg disease, you will want to take them to your veterinarian as soon as possible. Your veterinarian will be able to accurately diagnose the problem and learn if your frog has red leg disease. They will also be able to prescribe treatment and medications that you can use to help your frog recover. Red leg can be caused by bacterial or fungal infections. You veterinarian will be able to determine the exact cause.

, Red leg disease is contagious and you will need to keep it from spreading to any other frogs you might care for. It is important that you keep your infected frog in another tank, away from other frogs that have not yet contracted red leg disease. You will also want to clean any tanks or equipment that the infected frog was using to cut down on the risk of red leg disease spreading. You may also be instructed to give medication to your other frogs as a precaution.

, If your frog was found to have red leg disease, your veterinarian may have prescribed antibiotics or other treatments that will destroy the bacteria or fungus responsible for red leg disease. You will be required to give these medications to your frog according to the exact instructions your veterinarian gives you., Once your frog has been to the veterinarian, separated into a clean environment of its own, and antibiotic treatment has begun it's time to let your frog heal. This will be a period of waiting and watching, taking careful note of your frogs condition and behaviors. Try not to bother your frog during this time any more than is necessary, reducing stress levels and allowing them to heal more quickly. Leave your frog alone to recover and keep disturbances to a minimum.
Check in on your frog often to look for signs of improvement.
It should take two or three weeks for your frog to recover.

, A proper diet and feeding practice can be one way that you can help your frog to stay healthy and avoid any illnesses, such as red leg disease. The best diet for your frog will vary from species to species. However, there are some basic tips that you can use to make sure your frog is eating properly.Crickets are often fed to frogs. Dusting crickets with calcium powder can be a good way to boost nutrition and avoid other diseases.
Frogs can also eat worms such as night crawlers. You can find these yourself or buy them from a pet or fishing store.
Large frogs can sometimes eat mice. However, mice should be offered rarely as they are highly fattening.

, Frogs require a great deal of care and cleanliness when being kept in any kind of indoor environment. You will need to make sure the frog's environment is kept as clean as it can be to lower the chances of your frog suffering from red leg disease and other infections. Always keep water in the enclosure clean and dechlorinated. Water should be changed everyday.
Never leave spoiled food in the enclosure. Remove any uneaten items immediately.
Regularly clean the entire enclosure.

, Part of properly caring for a pet frog is giving them a safe and comfortable environment to live in. Improperly arranged environments can increase stress in your frog and expose them to a higher risk of contracting red leg disease. Make sure your frog's environment meets the following needs of your frog:UV lighting can give your frog the health benefits that exposure to sunlight would bring.
Humidity will need to be maintained at a level appropriate for your species of frog.
Keep the temperature at an appropriate level for your species of frog by using a light or heating pad.
Avoid over crowding. Having too many frogs may increase stress levels and allow diseases to spread more quickly.

Attract frogs to a new home.",How to Make a Frog Home in the Garden," Frogs are amphibians, so they can live on water and land, but it’s important to remember that they require both to survive. The first step to making a frog home in your garden is providing them with a water source.Your water source should provide both shallow and deep areas for your frogs.
Frogs will not survive in your garden without a water source such as a small pond.
The water area can be as small as just a few feet in diameter.;
, A flexible pool liner can allow you to create the type of water area your frogs needs to survive without worrying about the water draining into the ground. Pool liners will hold the water in place and allow the water area to be replenished by rain water.Using a pool liner allows you to shape the water source any way that you want without worrying about leakage or erosion causing the water source to grow.
Place rocks on the bottom of the water source for the frogs to hide within as well as to hold the liner in place.

, You may not have the space available to you to create a water source using a flexible pool liner. Frogs have been known to breed successfully in fairly small water sources, so there are a number of other options available to you.Digging a hole for a small child’s plastic pool will hold water well. Make sure to place rocks and plants in the pool to offer higher and lower depths of water for the frogs.
Even things as small as ice cream tubs or buckets can be used to provide frogs with still waters to hide and lay eggs.

, The water area in your frog home should provide shallow areas that are only a few inches deep as well as a deeper area that is eight to twenty-four inches deep. Makes sure the transition from shallow to deep is gradual so frogs can make it from one to the other easily.Make sure the sides of the deep areas aren’t too steep for a frog to be able to jump out of the water area.
Placing a few taller rocks in the deep area can also give the frogs a jumping point in order to leave the water area or get to shallower waters.

, While waterfalls and water fountains can be aesthetically pleasing, they may dissuade frogs from wanting to live in your garden. Frogs prefer tranquil, still waters and may avoid moving water sources.Frogs do not require aeration devices that create moving water like many fish do, as frogs can simply come to the surface to breath if they need more air
Unless you intend to stock your frog home, you need to make sure your water area is alluring to frogs to lay tadpoles in. Frogs prefer still waters for laying their eggs.

, Frogs require shelter for their safety, as they need to hide from both the sun and predators from time to time. You can make shelters out of a number of materials but broken planters are a cheap method that can be functional and pleasing to the eye.Place broken planters on their side so the curve in the planter provides a small cave for frogs to climb under.
Make sure the planters are near the water’s edge to give frogs quick and easy access to and from their water source.
Put soil and plants around and on top of the planter to make it more camouflaged from predators and comfortable for frogs.

, Frogs like to have many places to sit both in and out of the water, so adding rocks and aquatic plants to your water source will give frogs a place to sit while avoiding land-based predators that may live in your garden.Emergent plants grow in water but rise to the surface. These are excellent in-water plants for frogs. Some examples may be reed, flowering rush and wild rice. Aquatic flowers like duckweed are also effective.
Plants surrounding your water source will help prevent erosion and establish a food source for your frogs through insects that take up residence in them. Good plants to place around your pond are sweet flag and swamp milkweed.
Rocks give frogs places to hide between and under as well as a surface to rest on.

, You may be tempted to clean fallen debris out of your frog home in order to make it as pretty as possible, but that’s actually not beneficial to your frogs. Instead, leave things like fallen leaves, bird droppings, or dead insects in the water.Fallen biological debris serves as a natural fertilizer for the pond organisms frogs usually feed on.
Clear water can make it easier for predators to spot frogs and eat them.

, Leaving an area of tall grass near the edge of your frog home water source will give frogs increased cover from predators and offer more sources of food that your frogs can eat.Fertilizers and insecticides can harm your frogs or prevent insects from residing in the area around your frog home. Frogs rely on insects to eat.
Tall grass provides shade and shelter from the sun for your frogs when they aren’t in the water.

, You may begin to consider putting goldfish in the water area of your frog home in order to add another element of natural beauty to your garden, but fish are natural predators for frog eggs and tadpoles.Fish can eliminate all of the frogs in your frog home within one generation as they eat all of the eggs and tadpoles before they grow into adulthood.
Frogs are unlikely to leave eggs in a water area that has a large fish population for the area of water.
Fish require significantly more water area and upkeep in your water area to maintain a surviving population.

, It is not recommended that you transplant adult frogs into your frog home, as they tend not to tolerate environmental changes well and may die as a result. Tadpoles can be transplanted, but doing so can be risky to other frogs in your frog home if you aren’t sure what breed of frog the tadpoles are.Many tadpoles that you can purchase from pet supply companies are bull frogs. Bull frogs can prey on other frogs and have been known to eat tadpoles, which could limit the number of frogs you can have in your frog home,
If you choose to transplant tadpoles, it may be best to transplant them from another nearby pond or water source, as you know they can survive in the environment.

, A better alternative to stocking your frog home is to simply make the area attractive for frogs to come to on their own. This process may take a year or two, but offers the highest survival rate as compared to stocking the frog home yourself.Make sure your frog home and water area are safe places for frogs, otherwise even if any do come to reside in your garden they may be eaten by predators before a population can take hold. Providing adequate shelter and ensuring insects can survive in the area for frogs to feed upon is the most important element to attracting frogs.
Having a nearby compost heap can also help encourage frogs to colonize your garden.

Avoid handling your frogs.",How to Raise Gray Tree Frogs," Many state or provincial governments have laws prohibiting or limiting the collection of eggs and/or tadpoles. States might also prevent you from releasing baby frogs that have transformed back into the wild. Go to your state’s website and check out their fish and wildlife page for details, or contact your representatives., It may be hard to correctly identify gray tree frog eggs. The eggs are light colored, and the egg mass will be gray on the top and white below. The mama frog will lay them in groups of 20-40 eggs. These groupings may look similar to other woodland frogs’ eggs, so wait to collect them until you know you’re in an area gray tree frogs inhabit.Gray tree frogs can be found as far north as Maine in the United States and and southern Ontario in Canada. They live throughout the eastern half of North America, going as far west as Texas in the United States and Manitoba in Canada. Anything below northern Florida is too hot for the little guys.Gray tree frogs live in trees, rotted logs, and shrubs that are located near ponds, swamps, or lakes. Their eggs will be deposited in shallow water and will float near the surface.
If you’re unable to find gray tree frogs in the wild, contact local pet stores. They’ll inform you whether they carry or can find domesticated frogs for you to purchase.

, Gray tree frogs emerge from their winter burrows in April, and they usually begin breeding in May. Begin looking for eggs in late April and continue searching through the spring and early summer months. Don’t collect too many eggs, as you’ll need to provide separate containers for each group of three to four tadpoles., Most public parks and wildlife refuges have extremely strict rules preventing people from interfering with the environment. These spaces are meant to preserve nature with as little human impact as possible, so be sure to respect that mission. Don’t sneak in after hours to grab eggs or tadpoles!, If you have a pond or marsh where gray tree frogs live on your own land, you’re set! If not, but you’ve found a habitat in your neighbor’s woods, talk to them. You don’t want them confused about why you’re trudging through their backyard with plastic containers., Use a long-handled net to gently nudge the eggs directly into the container. Your container should be filled either with water from where you collect the eggs or dechlorinated tap water.


To filter out chlorine, which is harmful to amphibians, purchase chlorine filter tablets at your local pet store. Each tablet will have different dosage instructions, so be sure you’re following the proper tablet-to-water ratio provided on the instructions.You may want to wear rain boots and thick socks when collecting. You’ll probably need to wade into the water, and you don’t want your feet getting wet!

, Clean the containers out with hot water and a good scrub, but do not use soap or cleaners. At first, you can leave your eggs in one container. After your eggs hatch, which should occur within a few weeks, transfer hatched tadpoles with a small scooper to separate containers. Provide one gallon (3.79 L) of water for every two tadpoles.Keep your tadpoles from becoming overcrowded as they grow by putting no more than three in each container.

, Fill your tanks with clear tap water that’s been prepared for your eggs and tadpoles. This will allow you to clearly observe their growth. Dechlorinate water with filtration tablets purchased at your local pet store, following the instructions to get the right water-to-tablet ratio. You may also want to filter out metals or minerals in your water with a water filter before pouring it in your tank., Your tadpoles need to be fed twice a day. Provide each tadpole with two tablespoons of prepared lettuce over the course of the day. You should also give each tadpole a pinch of ground-up fish food each day. Watch their food intake, and decrease the amount you feed if your tank gets overly dirty after a day or two., Your water will quickly become dirty from waste and leftover bits of food. To change the water, transfer the tadpoles to a second tank with pre-filtered water. Then pour out the dirty water and scrub the first tank with hot water and a brush. Do not use cleaning solutions or soap. Rinse the container with filtered water before re-filling it., Your tadpoles need to be able to climb onto “land” as they develop lungs. The rock should emerge fully from the top of the water. Keep this rock at the side of the tank, as tadpoles will naturally swim toward the edge of their water source to find a safe spot for them to surface.When your tadpoles begin to develop their legs, cover the tank with a secure screen or a sheet of cheesecloth. This will prevent the little ones from escaping as they become more mobile., It can be fun and exciting to watch eggs turn into tadpoles and then develop into young frogs. Observe your tank daily to take note of small and big changes. After about eight weeks, your tadpoles should transform completely into young, or juvenile, gray tree frogs., Frogs that are hatched and raised in captivity generally don’t do well when reintroduced to the wild. Some states prohibit release to prevent the spread of any diseases your baby frogs could be carrying. If you’re committed to releasing your young frogs, do so right after metamorphosis occurs, and only let the frogs go in the exact spot where you collected the eggs.If your frogs appear to be sick, do not release them. Contact a local nature center to ask for assistance treating your frog and helping it become healthy again.

, While you may not think your gray tree frogs look active if you watch them during the day, they’ll take advantage of all the space in their aquarium at night. Give your frogs enough space by choosing a 20-gal. (75.71-L) tank that’s 24 inches (60.96 cm) long and 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide for every pair of adult frogs. This amount of roaming space will keep your frogs happy and healthy.Adult gray tree frogs usually measure between about 1.5 and 2.5 inches (3.81-6.35 cm), but don’t be deceived by their small size. Their habitat needs to be much larger than their little bodies might imply.

, Frogs are extremely mobile creatures, and they will escape if your lid isn’t secure. Use a screened cover with strong latches to provide them with enough air while also protecting them from any injuries that could occur if they get out of the tank. Double check that your screen is re-secured each time you open it to give food and water, or clean the tank., Amphibian tanks need to be lined with what’s called a substrate. This is the material you place at the bottom of the tank to give your frogs a safe and normal habitat. Gray tree frogs do well with coconut husk fiber, soil mixtures appropriate for frogs, and even moistened paper towels. Add a few large river rocks for variety.Do not use gravel, small bark, or reptile cage carpeting, as the frogs may swallow and choke on these materials.
You can find substrates at your local pet store or online.

, Gray frogs live in trees and bushes in the wild, so you’ll need to provide them with items they can climb on. Use driftwood, bamboo poles, or PVC pipes resting at different angles in the tank to give them lots of different perches. They’ll also use these items as shelters., Frogs do best when their tank is kept between about 68℉ (20℃) and 78℉ (26℃) during the day. Drop the temperature a few degrees in the room where you keep your frogs at night. Your frogs also need a high-humidity habitat, so mist your aquarium a few times per week to keep it moist.To provide your frogs with a range of temperatures within their tank, place a low-wattage heat lamp close to their enclosure. It shouldn’t be directly aimed at the tank.
If you live in a dry region, increase your misting to once per day.

, UVB lights are especially essential for young frogs. These lamps, which can be purchased in the reptile section of your local pet store or online, give your frogs access to essential vitamin D. Keep the bulb close to the side or top of the tank, as the UV levels won’t be high enough beyond very short distances.Mature gray tree frogs may only need their powder nutritional supplement to get all their essential vitamins.

, Young frogs have very large appetites. It’s important that you keep them well fed to ensure that they grow and develop properly. For the first two years of your frog’s life, feed them daily., Once your frogs reach their second birthday, they’ve reached maturity. These mature, adult frogs should only need to be fed two to three times per week. Start with three to four times per week for the first several months, and ease the frogs down to less feeding times., One of the most high-maintenance aspects of keeping frogs is taking care of their food. Gray tree frogs rely on a diet of live crickets. You can obtain these online or at a local pet store. To keep the crickets alive and healthy, give them a clean and specialized habitat.Keep the crickets in a secured and ventilated container lined with paper towels.
Put an egg carton or crumpled newspaper above the paper towels.
Offer the crickets fresh lettuce, carrots, melons, and apples to restore their nutrients before you feed them to your frogs.
Provide the crickets with a water source by soaking a sponge and replacing it daily.
Keep your cricket container in a space that’s about 70℉ (21℃) or warmer.
Remove dead crickets from the container, and keep the space clean and dry by replacing the paper towel liner every day or so.

, Since you’ve spent so much time caring for your live crickets, your frogs better enjoy them! Offer three to six crickets to each frog at every feeding. Introduce moths, flies, silkworms, or earthworms to add variety to your frogs’ diet every three feedings or so.


Coat your crickets in powder vitamin supplements made for frogs, which can purchased online or at local pet stores. This nutritional supplement should be used every other feeding for adults, and every feeding for youngsters.

, Your frogs need a dish that’s large enough for them to fit their entire body inside. It shouldn’t be so deep that they’ll be submerged underwater when they hop in. This dish should be filled with filtered water and changed whenever it becomes dirty.Frogs don’t “drink” water in the same way as humans and many other animals. Instead, they absorb water through an area known as a “drinking patch” located on their belly. That’s why providing a bowl large enough for your frogs to fully soak their whole body is so important., Each tank will become dirty at different rates depending on the environment and the frogs. When the sides of your tank start to get covered in debris, or if you notice that your tank smells, it’s time for a cleaning.Remove your frogs and place them in a safe temporary container with moistened paper towel linings and one of their perches.
Empty the tank and scrub it down using hot water and a brush.
Rinse the tank with filtered water, and then replace each element of your frogs’ habitat.
You’ll also probably need to scrub and rinse your frogs’ perches and climbing branches.
Use newly purchased material to give the frogs a fresh, clean substrate.

, Frogs may become injured or sick if you handle them. Frogs are pets that are best enjoyed from a distance. This will allow you to protect their delicate, little bodies and enjoy watching them grow and live out full lives."

Care for a pet toad or frog properly.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Frog and a Toad3," Frogs can make a lot of noise at night, especially when they're breeding. Frogs eat insects and bright lights can attract insects near your home. This may also cause frogs to gather in your backyard.Keep things like your porch light off at night.
You can also use curtains at night to keep light from inside your house from attracting bugs.

, Some frogs and toads may be toxic to dogs. If a dog picks up a toad in its mouth, toxins could be released that are poisonous to your dog. If you see your dog carrying a toad, take your dog to a vet immediately. This is a medical emergency.Symptoms of toxins from a toad include excessive drooling, pawing at the mouth or eyes, seizures, difficulty breathing, and unsteady moving.
If your pet has any of these symptoms, it needs immediate treatment.

, In general, refrain from handling wildlife. However, if you touched a frog or toad, wash your hands afterwards.If a young child picked up a frog or toad, make sure to have them wash their hands.

, It's never a good idea to take in a wild animal as a pet. Frogs and toads in the wild are not raised in captivity, and will not take well to being captured. They may also carry diseases. If you want a pet frog or toad, get one from your local pet store.

, Pet stores do sell frogs and toads as pets. If you want a pet frog or toad, make sure you care for it properly. Provide the right environment and shelter for your pet.You will have to clean your frog or toad's tank every day. Dirty tanks can pose a major health risk for a frog or toad.
Frogs and toads need a varied diet. You can buy food from a pet store, composed of crickets and mealworms, but you will also need to give your frog or toad plenty of other insects to survive. You will need to feed a frog or toad things like grasshoppers, snails, and silkworms as well.
Limit touching a reptile pet. Even one from a pet story can carry diseases. Wash your hands after handling your pet, do not clean their cage in your bathroom or kitchen, and do not kiss or cuddle a pet frog or toad."

Enjoy your new froggy friend!",How to Set up a White's (Dumpy) Tree Frog Enclosure," Choose one specifically designed for keeping amphibians. If you're on a budget, a glass aquarium is a good substitute (see method 2) as specialized amphibian enclosures can cost up to $223.37 (£300). Check to see if there are any gaps bigger than 3mm (0.11811 inches) as frogs can escape through very tight spaces. If any gaps are found, silicone or plasticine can be used to seal them.
, A backing can be as simple as an opaque sheet of plastic. This will give your frog a sense of security. Anything from solid black to a picture of the Amazon will work. You will need to secure the background with clear tape. Covering two panels of the glass will give your frog a place to hide during the day., Get a UVA bulb with a timer set to make the bulb stay on for 8 hours a day. The timer will turn the light on and off for you (you will need to replace the bulb every 6-8 months). A heater is mandatory in all climates of the world as it keeps the enclosure at a steady temperature (an electric thermostat will turn it on and off for you). An optional accessory is a mister (humidifier) keeps the enclosure moist. However, this can be substituted with a spray bottle of dechlorinated water (filtered drinking water is best)., Gravel and moss are the most popular (gravel stays the cleanest). However, some people choose dirt which is not preferable for tree frogs, as they do not like getting dirty. If dirt is the only option, do not use potting soil. This type of soil is poisonous for frogs and can kill them. Frogs absorb chemicals and minerals from anything they touch. Keep in mind that lighter-colored substrate will make your frog very green whereas darker substrate will make him/her a chocolate brown. When you purchase your substrate (if it is gravel or moss), you must first rinse it. This will stop any fine particles from sticking to your frog and drying him out. Rinse your substrate in a new strainer. (Avoid using a strainer that has previously been washed in soap.) Then pour it in and spread it into the desired landscape., A shallow water bowl is the best as this makes sure your frog does not accidentally drown. Tree frogs can't swim well since they lack webbed feet like regular frogs. You should include rocks, sticks, logs, etc. in the bowl to help them climb out if they need to.You can have your water bowl sitting flush with the substrate, or you can just place on top (this will make it easier to clean later). It is important that you clean the bowl out every second day as the frog will drink from this water (frogs absorb water through their skin instead of drinking through their mouths)., They are called ""tree"" frogs (not ""ground"" frogs) for a reason. It is important not to choose anything sharp as frogs have delicate skin and can get cut easily. A sturdy piece of driftwood may be used as this will provide a hiding place for your frog. A 3D background may be used as this has a similar purpose to the driftwood (make sure you measure your enclosure's interior before buying your background)., Varying their diet is important - a mix of crickets, cockroaches, earth worms, waxworms, mealworms, and wingless fruit flies can be a balanced diet for your frog. It is important that you feed your frog food so you can keep them as healthy as possible. Feeding your frog two crickets, one cockroach, one earthworm, four wingless fruit flies, or three waxworms/mealworms every second day is best as this ensures your frog will not become obese. For the non-worms, they should be let free inside the frog enclosure so the frog has to for them (giving him/her exercise)., There are three main sizes: froglet, juvenile, and adult. Obviously, the adults are biggest and require more food. The easiest to care for are the juveniles as they are far easier to find than froglets and require nowhere near as much food as the adults. Adding your frog to his/her enclosure is as easy as putting the container you adopted them in into the enclosure and opening it (let the frog jump out in its own time). After the frog has moved out of the container, remove the empty container., Clean the enclosure every second week, mist the enclosure, etc. Read How to Care for Green Tree Frogs for more information."

Know the specifics for your type of toad.",How to Care for a Toad," You will need to purchase a ten gallon tank for one or two toads. You should generally not put more than three toads together in a tank, as many toads can become aggressive. Do not house different kinds of toads together.;
, Substrate is ground covering that is specifically made for terrariums. Putting at least three inches of substrate down on the floor of your terrarium will allow your toad to burrow when he feels like hiding. The type of substrate will depend on your specific type of toad. In general ‘frog moss’, which is sold at pet stores, makes for good covering, as does additive-free potting or topsoil purchased at a garden store. Pulverized coconut fiber is also an excellent form of substrate.


If in doubt about which type of substrate you should buy, ask an amphibian specialist at a reptile or pet store.
Do not use artificial turf or gravel, as these ground coverings are too harsh for your toad’s delicate skin.

, You can choose which sort of hiding spots you would like to give your toad. You could put a stone, tree bark, or piece of slate down that your toad could burrow under. Other toad owners prefer to buy a store-made hiding places or to provide their toad with an empty coconut shell to climb into.

, The pool should be roughly half the toad’s height and four times as long as your toad. It is very important that the water you use to fill the pool is dechlorinated--toads can die if given chlorinated water. Make sure that there is a ramp of some kind that the toad can walk up when he is done frolicking in the water, as toads are relatively poor swimmers.


An easy way to make a water bath for your toad is to buy a shallow plastic bowl. Make a hole in the substrate so that the bowl’s mouth is level with the rest of the substrate on the floor of the terrarium. Put a sturdy plank of some kind into the bowl so that your toad can get in and out of the water easily.

, Again, the temperature you keep your toad’s tank at will depend on the type of toad you are housing. A toad’s preferred temperature can range from 65°F to 82°F (18°C to 27°C), depending on the type of toad you have.


It is advisable to place a reptile heating pad under one end of the tank if your variety of toad needs heat. Putting the pad under one end of the tank allows the toad to choose to be either on the heated side or the cooler side. For your toad’s specific temperature needs, check with your local reptile and amphibian store., Toads should have roughly 12 hours of ‘sunlight’ each day. Use a daylight lamp or a low UV level lamp, but only you have provided your toad with hiding places (so he can get away from the light if he feels like it.)If you want to be able to see your toad at night, you can install a red lamp to light up his home at night. Toads are most active at night. Toads can’t see red light, so they will think they are moving around in the dark but you will still be able to see them.

, While toads do not enjoy the water as much as true frogs do, they still need a relatively moist habitat. Use a mist bottle daily to mist one side of the tank (the side with the water bowl) so that the toad can choose whether he wants to be on wet or dry terrain. Only use water that you are positive is chlorine free!, Wild animals should not be taken from their home in the wilderness, no matter how cute you think a toad’s goofy face is. The fact is, many types of toads are endangered because we have been leveling their homes and turning them into construction sites. Wild toads should be left alone in their natural habitat.

, Standard toad fare includes recently fed crickets, waxworms, and mealworms. Your toad’s age will determine how often you feed him. If you have a young juvenile toad, you should feed him everyday. If you have an adult toad you should plan to feed him two to three times a week. You should give your toad four to six standard-sized food items (standard being the size of a cricket) when you feed him.


Toads will recognize a routine. Try to feed your toad at the same time every other day or so.
Only feed your toad store-bought crickets. Crickets caught in the wild could be carrying parasites that will make your toad sick.

, To give the toad the proper amount of nutrients, you should consider dusting their food with multivitamin or calcium powder. As a general rule, it's best to dust their food with calcium powder every time you feed your toad, and with multivitamin powder once a week.

, It is incredibly important that you only give your toad dechlorinated water. Toads are very sensitive to chemicals like chlorine and you could very easily cause harm to your toad if you give him chlorinated water.

, In general, toads will eat their fill within the first 15 minutes of food being introduced to their home. Wait 15 minutes or so and then remove any uneaten food. You should also change the water everyday., Toads don’t really like to handled and can get scared easily. These animals are much more of a ‘see, don’t touch’ sort of pet. When you do have to handle your toad, like when you clean his cage, you must remember to be very gentle with him. Toads are delicate creatures, despite their bumpy, rugged appearances. Never throw your toad around or drop him.

, You should always wear gloves when you have to pick your toad up. A toad's skin is mildly toxic and will cause some people skin irritation --however, the oils on human skin can also be damaging to toads. Wash your hands after you handle your toad.


Toads are known to be carriers of diseases like Salmonella. You should always wash your hands after you have held your toad, particularly if you didn’t wear gloves while doing so. Make sure you wash your hands with warm water and soap.

, You should try to clean the tank once a week. In order to do this, you must move your toad to a holding area where he cannot escape. Remove all of the old substrate, clean the tank and any props (like hiding places), fill the tank with fresh substrate, and put everything back in its proper place (including the toad).

, While this article goes over the basics of how to keep a pet toad happy and alive, some types of toads are pickier than others. If you have any questions about your specific toad type, you can click on the name of your type of toad below. Remember, when in doubt, call on the help of a knowledgeable amphibian specialist at a reptile or pet store in your area.

Gut-load your crickets.,
Feed your frog insects every two or three days.,
Provide a water dish.,
Spray the terrarium to increase humidity.",How to Care for a Red Eyed Tree Frog1," Before you feed your frog, you should feed its prey. Crickets are the primary food source for captive red-eyed tree frogs. One or two days before you feed your frog, feed the crickets a mix of dried and fresh foods to ensure that they are full of essential nutrients. Some good foods for crickets include crushed dog or cat food pellets, commercially produced cricket feed, mixed seeds, alfalfa, lettuce, broccoli, carrots, and fruit.For adult frogs, dust their prey with reptile calcium/vitamin D3 supplements once a week. For younger frogs, you may have to do this every day. This will ensure that your frog is receiving all of its proper nutrients.The crickets you feed your frog should be no larger than their head. For young frogs, make sure that they are no bigger than a quarter of an inch long.;
, Red-eyed tree frogs are insectivores, which means that they eat bugs and insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and moths. You can buy live crickets from a pet or reptile store. Feed your frog around fifteen live crickets every two to three days.Red-eyed tree frogs will occasionally eat worms as well. Wax worms are recommended for this. Do not feed them meal worms. Not all frogs will accept worms to eat, however., A wide, shallow water dish will allow your frogs to drink and hydrate. A water dish is essential because it will allow the frog to cool down if they are too hot or wash down if they become too dry. It can even increase the humidity in the terrarium.A heavy plastic or clay water dish will prevent spills.


Water should be changed every day.If you have many frogs in one cage, you might want to have multiple water bowls.

, Red-eyed tree frogs need a humidity of around 90%.To help maintain the humidity, spray the terrarium with a water-filled spray bottle twice a day. Spray the walls, substrate, and furnishings.If your frog’s skin is looking dry, you can even spray them. Be careful not to spray them in their face.
You can also invest in an automatic misting system. These are expensive, but they will handle the spraying process to ensure that your frogs are properly hydrated.

Be sure you have a good setup.,
Keep the humidity up.,
The temperature should be kept between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.,

Be sure your frog is healthy.,
You can take your frog out of its cage occasionally, just not too much.,
White's Tree frogs are not only social with humans, but other frogs as well.",How to Care for Your White's Tree Frogs," A terrarium is good, and should be ten gallons at least. Avoid getting terrariums that are longer than they are tall, because these frogs love to climb. The terrain can be dirt, bark, or small gravel. A small water dish also is a must but make sure in is no deeper that 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) for tadpoles and 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep for adults as they are not good swimmers and can drown! Be sure the frog has things to climb on, and lots of places to hide in. Tree frogs enjoy plants. It is better to buy fake plants, because some real ones are poisonous to frogs.;
, If you don't, tree frogs will dry up and die. You need to mist the living space frequently to keep humidity between 65% and 90%. You can do this with a spray bottle, and do it several time per day. If you do not wish to use a spray bottle, or are unable to do so very frequently, an automatic mister can be purchased at most pet stores. These can be set to keep humidity within a certain range. You need a hygrometer to monitor humidity and a thermometer for temperature.

, If your home is cool at night, or has no heating, a small heater can be purchased to keep under the frog's terrarium. If you have no cooling system in the summer, you will have to find a way to keep your frog's area cool. Preferably not a fan, because this can act as a de-humidifier.

, The crickets should have nutrients dusted on them before feeding them to your frog. You can buy crickets with the nutrients already on them at most pet stores, or you can buy the powder separate and sprinkle it on yourself. You can feed your frogs mealworms occasionally as a treat.

, Although White's Tree frogs are among the toughest breeds available, they are especially prone to overeating. Some can even form fat all over the body, especially above the eyes, which can lead to blindness. If you think your frog is too skinny, feed them a few extra crickets per week, but cut back once your frog puts on more weight. Learn how to diagnose frog illnesses to help keep them healthy. If you suspect that your frog may be ill, see a vet with amphibian experience immediately. Almost all frog illnesses are fatal if medical attention is not sought right away.

, Some people are even known to bring their White's with them places, allowing the frogs to sit on their shoulder. However, do not attempt this unless you are certain that your frog will not jump off your shoulder (most can be trained not to) and is not afraid of crowds.

, You can buy your frog a companion. They get along with other White's (be sure they are both the same gender unless you want babies), Red Eyed Tree Frogs, and Green Tree Frogs. Be sure they are all around the same size because large frogs will eat smaller ones.

Fill it with about a water bottle full of water. Make sure the water stays clean and is changed regularly. Bottled water (NOT distilled) is best.;
, Put a screen on top of it, so they can breathe.


We've covered the basic. Now on to the harder care.

, Tree frogs originate in tropical regions, and are used to either type. Getting bark/sand from a pet store is best because it is sifted and is sure not to have any chemicals or harmful agents. Do not use garden potting soil, as there are chemicals in it that will make your frog sick!

, Frogs love to climb, so make sure there are plenty of places for them to jump and climb on. They are also nocturnal, so a dark place to sleep in the daytime is important. Try flipping a plastic bowl upside down (Chinese take-out bowls work well) and cutting a small door in the side.

, In nature, tree frogs have a wide diet. This includes bugs such as crickets, which are found worldwide. Go out at about dawn or dusk. This is when the crickets are most active, and easiest to catch. Crickets are also available at pet stores and are pretty inexpensive. It is good to dust the crickets with some calcium powder (from the pet store) once a week to help your frog's bones stay strong. UV (sun) light also helps with this. Some frogs will also eat meal worms, earth worms, or even pinkie mice!

, It will give them nourishment to pass on to the frogs, and will also prevent them from nibbling on the frogs backs when they get hungry.

,, Maybe you can find your frog's fave food.

, They are scared of you.

Obtain a tank for your tree frog.,
Prepare a tree frog friendly environment.,
Heat the tank by installing an aquarium heater.,
Create a wet and humid environment for your tree frog.,
Light the tank.,
Replace the water daily with clean, de-chlorinated water.,
Wash the tank regularly.,
Monitor your tank’s heat and humidity using a thermometer and hygrometer.,
Feed your tree frog.,
Keep your tree frog healthy.,
Treat your frog… like a frog!",How to Care for Tree Frogs," Tree frogs require a tank at least 10 gallon (37.9 L).Ensure that you get a suitably large tank so that your tree frog will have enough room to be healthy and happy.


Tree frogs are accustomed to living in vertical spaces, so if possible use a tall tank.
Tree frog tanks should be waterproof.
Glass tanks work best, but plastic can be sufficient as long as the material will not break down under prolonged exposure to UV light.
Make sure your tank has a fiberglass fly-mesh enclosure. ;
, Tree frogs need more than just a big empty space to thrive. You should try to make your tree frogs environment similar to the one the frog is used to in order to ensure the frog has a healthy living environment.


Along the bottom of your tank, lay down a substrate to act as the “carpet.” Artificial substrates provide a safe and easy floor for your tree frog. Avoid small pebbles and gravel substrates, as your tree frog may eat pieces of it, which can cause serious health problems in some species of tree frogs.Place foliage, large rocks, and branches in the tank. You can use either real or fake foliage and branches. Fake foliage will be easier to maintain and will not need to be replaced as often. Arrange them so that your tree frog can climb at varying heights in the tank.

, Alternatively, use a heat lamp of no more than 15 Watts mounted above the tank. In either case, maintain a temperature of a minimum of 18 C inside the tank at all times. Your frog will be comfortable in the 24-26 C temperature range. A large rock near the heater will give your tree frog a place to bask in the heat.
Monitor the temperature using two thermometers, one near the bottom of the tank and one near the top., Humidity can be measured using a hydrometer. Humidity levels should be between 50-60%.Be sure to give your tree frog a water dish or even a small pond in the tank. The water should be de-chlorinated using de-chlorination drops that you can get at the pet store.Including a source of running water (like a waterfall) can help keep the tank humid.Such water features can be purchased as a pet store.
Soaking in chlorinated water can harm your tree frog.
You will need to change the water regularly, so ensure the water container is easily accessible to you. Make sure that you tree frog has water available at all times., There is some debate over whether or not tree frogs require UV (ultraviolet) light, although some research says that a complete lack of UV light can cause problems for a tree frog.To set up UV lighting, purchase a UV lamp to mount above the tank. The UV light can run 4-5 hours a day.


To ensure you are using the correct lamp type, purchase an Ultraviolet-B emitting bulb.Your frog will benefit from maintaining a 12-hour day/night cycle.Set up an automatic timer so you do not have to remember to turn the light on and off in twelve hour increments or worry about being home at the right time to ensure proper lighting.
Florescent lighting can provide light without substantially affecting the amount of heat in the tank, which can help you more easily regulate the temperature inside.You can purchase kits to mount lights above your tank at the pet store.

, Dirty water poses a health risk to your frog and should be changed whenever dirty, which can be as often as daily when using a small water dish.


Using bottled water can help speed up the water changing process because it is already de-chlorinated and will therefore save you a step.
Make sure that you have clean water ready to go when you take the dirty water out of the tank. You don’t want your frog to have to go too long without water available.
If you forget to de-chlorinate the water before putting it in the tank, immediately use de-chlorination drops on the water. , In order to keep your tank a healthy habitat for your tree frog, it is important to keep the tank clean. The inside of the tank, any accessories or décor, water bowls, small ponds and branches, etc. should all be cleaned.


Use a disinfectant to clean the tank and the accessories. Use a small brush to help clean smaller items with the disinfectant and make sure to thoroughly rinse everything.
After washing, let everything dry completely before reassembling the tank.While washing the tank, make sure your frog has a suitable place to live. A small, enclosed (but breathable) dish or bowl with a small amount of clean water will suffice, but does not make for a healthy long-term environment. Make sure to reintroduce your frog to its tank as soon as it is clean again.
Frog tanks need to be washed frequently. Inspect the tank daily and clean it as soon as it looks dirty.

, Tree frogs require warm, humid environments. If you have set up your tank properly, heat and humidity should not be a problem. However, it is important to monitor both to ensure that the environment remains suitable for your tree frog at all times.


The tank should be at least 18 C at all times.
The ideal humidity level is between 50% and 60%.
You can also mist your tree frog with clean, de-chlorinated water daily., Crickets are the main food source for most tree frogs and will serve as their primary food. Your frog will have different food requirements depending on its age. If you are ever unsure about your frog’s diet or eating habits, do not be afraid to consult with a veterinarian. Feed your tree frog by putting crickets in their tank.


Young frogs should be fed smaller crickets and will often eat all the time. Make sure a food source is available to them.
Young adult frogs can be fed less often, but can be fed larger crickets.
Adult frogs can be fed about 2-3 times per week with large feedings.
You can find food supplies at most pet stores. Or, if you are more adventurous, you can try to Raise Your Own Crickets!
Occasionally introduce variety in you frog's diet, by feeding them worms, moths, or flies. , If you keep the tank clean and the tree frogs properly fed, your tree frogs should stay healthy, but if they start acting strange, change their eating habits, or look unhealthy, be sure to get them help.


A common problem is dirty or chlorinated water. Be sure to keep your tree frog’s water clean at all times.
Likewise, dirty tanks can allow harmful bacteria to breed in the tanks and can be harmful to your tree frog.
Symptoms to be on the look out for include: weight loss due to a change in eating habits, extreme inactivity, swelling, and difficulty breathing., Frogs are not mammals and they do not like to be cuddled like dogs, cats, or hamsters. Be sure you are taking into consideration what your tree frog wants.


Handle your tree frog only infrequently.
Tree frogs will often wet when nervous or stressed. If they do this while you are holding them, it is a good indication to put it back down in the tank."
"
Shop around.,
Always buy captive bred (CB) frogs.,
Keep only one species of frog in each habitat.,
Always wear gloves.,
Determine your frog's sex.,
Quarantine new frogs.",How to Care for Green Tree Frogs1," Before buying frogs, check out the specimens at multiple pet stores. Different stores have different quality standards regarding the frogs they source, and how well they care for them once they are in the shop. A happy, healthy frog will be easier to keep and will have a much longer lifespan.Look for a bright green coloring. A healthy American tree frog will be a light lime green to a dark olive or emerald green, with a creamy white to yellow stripe on their sides and creamy white belly. They will change color slightly as a means of camouflage and to indicate mood changes.
Look for frogs that have bright eyes and seem alert.
Avoid frogs with brown spots, dull skin, or dry skin. Extreme changes in color, like turning yellow-green or dark brown, can indicate stress or illness.;
, Wild caught (WC) frogs are likely to carry disease, which will spread to your other frogs. Wild caught frogs also suffer from stress in captivity, so it is cruel to keep them. Wild caught frogs may also be very old, so their remaining lifespan will be quite short., If you want to buy a new type of frog, you'll need to set up an entirely different aquarium habitat for it. Different species of frogs also have different care needs.Certain varieties of frogs are dangerous when housed with other types, which will be very stressful to your frog.
Frogs are also cannibalistic so a small frog could be lunch for a larger frog.

, Your tree frog does not need love and affection. These are observational animals and thus do not like to be held. A frog's skin is very delicate and the oils on your skin can be very harmful to them.

, It isn't necessary to know your frog's sex, but the males tend to be a lot noisier than the females. If you will be keeping your frog in your bedroom, try to purchase a female frog.Males are usually smaller than females and have yellow or greenish-yellow throats.
At about 1 year of age, males will begin to call. The call gradually becomes louder and louder, and lasts about 20 seconds.
Females are usually larger than males, and they have creamy white throats.
Females don't call all the time, although they will make a short brief response call to a male. They will also sometimes call in distress when they are annoyed by being handled or by another frog sitting on them.

, Before you add a new frog to an enclosure with existing ones, you should keep it in its own habitat for at least three months. If your frog shows no signs of illness, infection, or parasites after three months, you can introduce him to your other frogs.A lengthy quarantine time is necessary because symptoms of sickness or parasites do not always appear right away.

"
"
Invest in a glass terrarium.,
Lay down a proper substrate.,
Furnish with leaves and natural décor.,
Keep the habitat warm.",How to Care for a Red Eyed Tree Frog2," You will need at least a ten to twenty gallon glass terrarium for your tree frog. This size can accommodate up to four frogs comfortably. Make sure that you have a properly fitting screen-top. This will ensure proper ventilation while keeping everything secure in your frog’s habitat.Pet stores will often sell these terrariums. You will also be able to find them online.

, The material lining the bottom of the cage is called a substrate. For your red-eyed tree frog, you should put down about two or three inches of non-fertilized potting soil. You can mix this soil with bed-a-beast bedding, orchid bark, coco coir, paper towels, or peat moss to give it more texture.The substrate should be scooped out and replaced every two to three months., Your frog will appreciate some items around the cage to climb and hide under. Find some natural, leafy looking furnishings to place in the cage. Make sure that these are non-toxic to prevent damage to your frog's sensitive skin.


Coconut halves make great dens for the frogs.Leaves, driftwood, rocks, cork, and branches can give your frog something to climb and explore.You can put in both fake and living plants, but fake plants are easier to keep alive.

, During the day, the cage will need to be between 78 and 84 degrees F (25 and 28C). At night, the temperature can drop no more than ten degrees. If your room temperature is cooler than this, you may have to invest in heaters for your terrarium. There are several options for heating the terrarium:


Low wattage heat bulbs can attach to the screen top. They provide enough heat without burning your frogs.
Heat pads can rest beneath the cage. Look for ones specially designed for reptiles at your pet store.Be warned that if water touches the hot glass, it can crack the glass.Red or nocturnal bulbs can be left on all night to ensure around the clock warmth.Red-eyed tree frogs are nocturnal so extra lighting isn’t necessarily. Bulbs would simply provide warmth.

"
"
Clean the cage regularly.,
Avoid handling the frog.,
Give tadpoles plenty of space.,
Find a herpetarium veterinarian.",How to Care for a Red Eyed Tree Frog3," The frog’s enclosure should be cleaned once a week. Remove all of the furnishings, and wash them with hot water only. Do not use soap; this could irritate your frog’s skin.Remove visible debris from the substrate, such as leftover cricket parts or feces. The substrate itself only needs to be replaced every two to three months. Mist and wipe down the terrarium walls, but do not use commercial cleaning solutions or soap., Frogs are not pets that should be handled often. They may be skittish and afraid of human contact. In addition, their sensitive skin means that human skin can irritate them. Only handle your frog when necessary, such as during cleanings or if taking the frog to a vet.To pick up a frog, dampen a dip net, and gently coax the animal inside. Place your hand over the net to prevent the frog from jumping out as you lift the net.If you do have to handle your frog, wash your hands first. Keep your hands damp after washing. Frog skin burns when it is in contact with dry human skin.

, If you have multiple frogs in a terrarium, you may find that your females have laid eggs. Red-eyed tree frogs can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The eggs will hatch after 9 days, after which you will have dozens of tadpoles in your water bowl or reservoir. Make sure that the tadpoles have at least two or three inches of water. Feed them crushed fish food until they can walk.If they are swimming on top of one another, they don’t have enough water. Add more water to give them some space.
You may not be able to accommodate so many frogs at once. Be prepared to find these frogs new homes once they grow up. You can call a local pet store or post ads on local pet forums.

, If your frog is showing signs of low energy, appetite, or other unusual behavior, you will want to take it to see a vet. You should find a herpetarium vet who specializes in caring for reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. These can be very difficult to find, so locate one before your frog becomes sick.To find a herp vet, you can contact local veterinary schools, or you can look through the member listings of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians."
"
Try to find a pet store in your location that has Gray Tree frogs.,
Purchase a tank.,
Buy the tree frog for a reasonable price, and make sure to take it home as fast as you can.,
Feed it only soft bodied insects and insects like flies and crickets.,
Add some leaves and cork bark to make it more natural to its original habitat.,
Check daily to see if he is pooping.,
Control the temperature.,
Provide a UVA/UVB FULL SPECTRUM sunlight bulb during the day, when the frog is sleeping.,
Provide a shallow soaking dish as well.,
Enjoy owning your Gray Tree frog!",How to Care for a Gray Tree Frog," Make sure they are captive bred. Wild caught frogs are more likely to die and wild frogs have been showing a decrease in numbers over the years partially due to the pet trade.;
, Be sure it has enough room for the frog. Get one that's tall rather than wide; they like a lot of room. Do not use soap or cleaners to clean your new tank. Very hot water is usually all you need, followed by a rinse with cool water. Dry it well with unbleached unprinted paper towels.


For the first 30 days you should line the bottom of the tank with unbleached unprinted paper towels as well. This is called the ""quarantine"" period. You are watching for feeding, behavior, poop etc. The white makes it easier.

, If not, it may be stressed for a couple of days and may not want to eat during that time.

, No Mealworms or Superworms! The hard exoskeleton can cause severe impaction and cause your frog to suffer a painful slow death. Dust them every 2 feedings with a high quality vitamin supplement made for frogs.


Do not catch wild crickets or moths. Buy them at your local pet store.

, Anything you add should be properly sterilized by scalding water. Avoid chemicals or soap.

, If so, he is eating. Do not leave crickets unattended with your frog for too long! Crickets bite! Hold crickets by one back leg at a time they will break them off as an attempt to get away. Allow them to do this because it is less of a chance for your frog to get injured from the barbs on the crickets legs, but it takes practice. You have to be quick! They can bite people too, but frog skin is much softer than ours and more prone to broken skin. They can cause injury which can lead to illness when there are some left in the tank for a couple of days. Crickets will hide so well that you will not even know they are there! Check very well.


If the frog is not eating and you got him from the wild, let him go only in the area in which the species inhabits. Unless the climate has drastically changed to cold! If you are keeping the frog then you should know that virtually all wild caught frogs have parasites. A vet can take a fecal float test and determine if parasites are present if so they can treat the frog if they specialize in amphibian care. Do this as soon as you can for the long term health of your new friend. Once taken care of, your frog will be as good as new! You should always know where the nearest exotic animal vet in your area is.
If it's not eating bring it to an exotic pets vet. You could always try to coax your frog with wax worms. They are soft and squishy, but only as an occasional treat or to tempt them to eat. Feed them worms with rounded tip forceps or your very clean fingers.
When you see poop remember to scoop! Clean right away. Frogs can get sick from unsanitary conditions.

, The tank has to stay between 68 at night to 75 during the day. Humidity should be between 70 and 80 percent. Mist with a clean water bottle and wash it frequently. Use either (preferably) spring water or use a product such as ""aquatize"" to remove heavy metals and chlorine from tap water. It also helps stimulate and protect what is known as the frog's slime coat.


Make sure you have temperature and humidity gauges inside the tank.

, You can also use a night bulb to watch your frog hunt. You can change the bulbs by hand or get a dual light fixture.


Without a UVB bulb, your frog can get a vitamin deficiency called Metabolic Bone Disease that supplements alone cannot help! UVB light cannot pass through glass. You should still supplement your frog's food with Calcium WITHOUT D3. You do not want to overdose your frog with D3. It can cause kidney failure. That is why the Full spectrum light is best. The UVB light will help with D3 production naturally. Also be sure that the Multi vitamin and Multi Mineral is D3 free as well. (Only if you are using a UVB light bulb!) Otherwise, only one supplement should have D3, But in the long run, Full spectrum UVA/UVB light is best. No captive creature can live in full health without UVB ""sunlight"" Make sure the light passes through a screen top. Again UVB rays cannot pass through glass. Never put your frog's tank in front of the window! The sudden rises in temperature will kill your pet!

, Use a very small amount of Aquatize in this water or use a pure spring water. NEVER USE DISTILLED WATER, IT WILL HARM YOUR PET. IT BLOCKS NUTRIENT ABSORPTION! Make sure their bowl is very easy to climb in and out of and is only deep enough to reach a little above chest level. Petco has great ones with little shallow steps in and out made just for frogs. Otherwise your frog can easily drown! Frogs drink through their skin. They also absorb toxins through their skin, so never wear lotion, hand sanitizer etc. while holding them! Wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and mild soap and rinse very well before and after touching them. Only handle them when absolutely necessary. Some frogs enjoy being gently and lightly misted with Poland Spring water a few times a day. They need constant hydration. If your Gray Tree frog ever starts to burrow in to the substrate they are most likely badly dehydrated! Mist the tank thoroughly and soak them in room temperature spring water at once! Never leave a frog to soak unattended outside of their tank. If they are severely dehydrated you can soak them in unflavored Pedialyte. But only if you are sure they are severely dehydrated, you do not want to stress out your frog unnecessarily., They're really cool pets when you know what you are doing. Have fun if you get one and make sure that you join a community of frog lovers who can help guide you, but never substitute their advice for a specialist vet's expertise!

Buy a glass aquarium.,
Place a lining (substrate) over the bottom of the enclosure.,
Add artificial cage furniture.,
Add natural cage furniture from outdoors, if you wish.,
Add foliage.,
Provide a suitable water bowl.,
Add a heat source.,
Adjust for temperature and humidity.,
Avoid placing the tank in your bedroom.",How to Care for Green Tree Frogs2," Your frog is native to a semi-tropical climate, so it needs a semi-tropical setup. Glass aquariums work best because they are easy to clean and the frogs are clearly visible from outside.You will need to buy an aquarium with no less than a 10 gallon capacity. If you want to go larger, your frog will appreciate it.
Try to find an enclosure that is taller than it is wide, because tree frogs prefer to have vertical mobility.
Add a screened lid on top for good ventilation. If you have other animals in the house, get one you can lock in order to keep your frogs safe.

, Artificial substrate works best, because there is no risk of a frog ingesting anything while feeding. Line the bottom of the cage carefully, making sure you don't leave any open areas at the edges where your frog can become trapped and injure itself.


A good substrate is Astroturf, which you can find at hardware stores and sometimes pet stores.
You can also use reptile carpeting, found at pet stores.

, This is your frog's home, and it will want things to climb on like logs, rocks, and branches. Arrange your wooden pieces on the diagonal, from corner to corner, and slant them upward from low to high so your frog can climb up them.Artificial cage furniture is easy to clean, and you can find a wide variety of specialized items online or at your local pet store.

, Your best choices are driftwood, cork bark, sticks and branches. If you collect items from outside, you must disinfect them before putting them in your frog's habitat.Soak outdoor items in a mild bleach and water solution overnight (one part bleach to three parts water).
Remove the items from the bleach, and soak them in clean water for an additional night.
Allow them to air dry thoroughly before adding them to the aquarium. This should kill any bacteria or bugs that may harm your frog.
Smell each item before placing it in the enclosure, to be sure the items are not releasing any fumes.

, You can use live plants or artificial ones. Live plants can be difficult to keep alive indoors, so it's usually best to go with plastic foliage. Artificial plants are also easier to clean, and you can find a wide variety of them online or at your local pet store.Another option is to use air plants, living plants that do not require soil or water – they thrive with just an occasional misting. Just be sure to protect them from harsh, direct sunlight or heat lamps, so they won't dry out.Sufficient foliage provides “cover” for your frog, helping it to feel safe and secure.

, Your frog will need a water bowl that is big enough to climb around in, because it will want to soak and defecate in its water bowl. Choose a bowl that is heavy enough that your frog won't knock it over. Most pet stores carry bowls specifically designed for small amphibians, that are shaped like little ponds to look natural in your aquarium.Be sure to clean your frog's water bowl daily – or whenever you notice it is dirty – to prevent bacterial infections.

, If you have a glass terrarium, you can use an under-tank heater placed under one end of the aquarium (never in the center.) Alternatively, you can put a nocturnal heat lamp (no stronger than 15 watts) over the tank, above the highest point in your frog's habitat.Never use an under-tank heater with a wooden enclosure, as this may cause a fire.
Try placing a rock over the heated area of the terrarium floor, which will absorb heat. Your frog may enjoy sitting on the heated rock.
If you use an overhead heat source, be sure there is a screen lid to the tank between your frog and the heating bulb.

, Green tree frogs are nocturnal, so they won't need any special lighting. However, you will need to adjust for temperature and humidity in order to keep your frog healthy and comfortable.The daytime temperature of the habitat at the warmest spot (by the heater) should be about 78 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and about 80 degrees in the summer.
The rest the tank (the areas not immediately surrounding the heater) should be about 76 Fahrenheit degrees in winter, 78 degrees in summer.
At night, you should keep the habitat around 70 degrees in winter, 75 degrees in summer.
Keep the humidity in the tank around 30% in the winter, and 35% in the summer.
Hang temperature strips and humidity gauges in the terrarium to maintain proper levels.

, The males ""chirp"" very loudly at night, and it will wake you up. If noises tend to keep you awake, you may want to keep your frog in a room where you will not be trying to sleep.Females are quieter than males, but it is best to prepare for your frog to make noise sometimes.
Frogs may also chirp at vacuum cleaners, running water, lawnmowers, and certain TV commercials.
Males may make loud calls during a falling barometer, so your frog might warn you when it's about to rain.

"
"
Water and mist your frog daily.,
Feed your frog crickets and other insects.,
Feed your frog a wide variety of prey foods.,
Supplement your frog's diet with vitamins and minerals.,
Clean your frog's enclosure regularly.",How to Care for Green Tree Frogs3," Be sure your frog's water dish is clean and full of fresh water. Spray your frog and its enclosure daily with water to keep everything moist and help with the overall humidity in the habitat.Frogs have permeable skin – they drink water as well as breathe through their skin.
Always use Reverse Osmosis (RO) or distilled water for your frogs.
Standard tap water, even if dechlorinated, will still have heavy metals and other contaminants which can harm your critters.

, Your frog will enjoy many types of insects, including crickets, moths, pillbugs, and small dubias or lobster roaches. Feeder insects can be purchased online or at pet stores.Try to feed your frog insects that are no larger than the width between its eyes.
Don't feed your frog bugs you catch outdoors, because they may be infested with parasites or full of poisonous pesticides.
Some insects are toxic for frogs. Never feed your pet frog ladybugs, stinkbugs, millipedes or praying mantis.

, Proper nutrition comes from a well-rounded diet – this will lengthen your frog's life and improve its resistance to illness. In addition to bugs and other insects, your frog will enjoy other small prey animals that are small enough to fit easily into its mouth. These should be purchased at a pet store or online – it can be harmful to your frog to feed it wild bugs and worms from your back yard.Bear in mind that frogs eat live prey. If you are squeamish about putting live insects into your frog's habitat, you may want to consider a different type of pet.
Try feeding your frog caterpillar larvae, such as wax worms, horn worms, and silkworms.
You can also feed your frog the occasional small earthworm or red wiggler.

, Lightly coat their prey items with calcium powder with D3, multivitamin powder, and minerals. All these are readily available, last a long time, and are not very expensive. Dust an adult frog's food every two to four feedings, more often for juvenile frogs., Once a month, be sure to totally clean out the aquarium and thoroughly wash the items inside with hot water and let cool before returning the items to the enclosure. Also, a regular (daily) inspection and cleanup is recommended to help remove feces, damaged plant matter, and dead prey items.If you need to handle your frog in order to clean his habitat, always wet your hands with de-chlorinated water (water from a water bottle.) The natural oils in your skin can be toxic to frogs.
Avoid using chemicals to clean. When cleaning the frog's enclosure, never use chemicals. Even trace amounts of chemicals can burn your frog's skin, or even kill him.

Make a home for the frog in a small 10 gallon (for one frog) fish tank with a wire mesh style lid to go on top.,
Add substrate.,
Provide a place to hide.,
Provide adequate moisture to the environment.,
Feed the frog a diet of small insects.,
Provide a water source at least 4 inches deep.,
Be gentle with them.,
Open the frog tank with care.",How to Care for a Pacific Tree Frog," You can buy both from the pet store. The wire top is important as proper ventilation is essential for healthy frogs. Pacific tree frogs will need a fresh water source, but do not need a humid environment. You can keep one frog in a ten gallon glass tank, but for more it should be 29 gallons or bigger.


Pacific tree frogs are master escape artists! Make sure that there are no gaps between the tank and the lid. Check the lid every time before you open it as your frog(s) can and will often be clinging to the top and escape!;
, For a substrate you can use moist sphagnum moss or organic potting soil with no synthetic additives or fertilizer. Black gold soil is a good brand of potting soil that will not harm your frogs.


A good 1:1:1 blend of coconut fibre ( or organic potting soil ), sphagnum moss, and medium orchard bark is a great ground cover that you can plant low light plants in and will drain well when lightly watered. You can also add chopped dead leaves from a pesticide free yard for extra soil nutrition. Worms will also thrive in this soil with adequate moisture and will create a healthy disposal system for your frog(s) ""droppings"". Make enough mix so that you can layer your tank with at least eight inches of soil mix. This will help retain moisture and provide a fertile ground for planting live plants.
Do not allow a frog to be in contact with chlorinated water; it is toxic to them.

, As for any type of tree frog, they will need numerous places to perch, climb and hide. It is highly recommended you use live plants, but fake plants will work as well.

There are many kinds of low light and medium light plants that can be placed in the frog habitat. Some examples are Chlorophytum comosum ( Spider Plant ), Chamaedorea elegans ( Parlor Palm ), and Ficus pumila ( Creeping Fig ). Check the external links for information on which plants are safe and their growing conditions.
You can use an aquarium ""tube"" fluorescent light 17 Watts or stronger as a light source for your plants. This will also provide light for your frogs as well without the risk of overheating the tank with natural sun.

Plants need to be pesticide and fertilizer free, frogs are highly sensitive to these and you should either purchase organically grown plants or re-pot your plants in organic soil and allow them to grow out for six weeks.
Add large stones, boil them first to sanitize, then let them cool. Frogs will perch on them in the morning and late night as they tend to be slightly warmer then the soil. Your frogs may also huddle under them for warmth if you have especially cold winters.







, Mist the cage with a spray bottle a few times as needed if the soil becomes overly dry.

You may notice that your frogs will seem annoyed by dry substrate, as it will stick to their skin and they will have to brush it off. Do not be alarmed, add a little moisture to the topsoil to prevent sticking. Your frogs will learn how to walk on their new substrate comfortably after a few weeks. Make sure they have a large water source to soak and hide in if they wish.







, Feed a regular diet of wingless fruit flies.


Pacific tree frog tadpoles need a high protein diet, such as guppy food or dried tubifex worms (commercial tadpole food is no good; they will get gas so badly, they explode). Tadpoles can also eat live bloodworms as a treat.
Once your tadpoles begin to grow their back legs you may notice that they stop eating entirely. Do not be alarmed, they will not eat until they morph into young froglets and their entire tail ( which has fats and nutrients for the transition ) is absorbed.
Never give young frogs full size crickets. They can choke or be otherwise injured. For the first 3 months of growth, you should feed them flightless fruit flys and ""pinhead"" crickets. Make sure you feed them generously every three days as they will need the nutrition to grow. Dust the crickets in calcium powder for added nutrition.
Once your frogs reach 3/4 to full size. ( Anywhere from 3/4 to 1.5 inches for the biggest ) you can start feeding them ""small"" size crickets. Additionally, an occasional treat of waxworms, wax moths, and small mealworms is OK for your frogs.
Depending on the personality of your frogs, you may be able to hand feed them waxworms and mealworms. Grip the worm by the head gently and allow it to wriggle in front of your frog to entice it to strike. Be patient, your frogs may stare for quite some time, then suddenly strike. Don't be startled if they miss a few times and try to eat your fingers, they don't always have the best aim.
Adult Pacific Tree Frogs can and will eat insects as big or bigger than themselves. Although they are able to it is recommended you not feed them excessively large insects. Rather, feed them one or two medium size insects or just let them self feed on crickets.
If you leave crickets in the enclosure, put a few pieces of vegetables with the bugs in your frog's cage. Without just a few stalks of celery, carrots, there is a risk the insects will eat your frog alive, as they need food too.Your frog will eat almost anything you put in front of it, so make sure you consider its size before feeding your frog. Since they will eat food that is as big or bigger than themselves, recommended foods are moths, mosquitoes, flies, crickets, snails, worms, and other insects that aren't poisonous. For moths and male mosquitoes, you do not need a food source for the insects because your frog will catch it soon enough. For female mosquitoes, it is best that you kill it before feeding it to your frog.
You can feed your frog dead insects, if you make it seem that it is still alive. This is a skill you must master. You can use tweezers or thin chopsticks to hover it in front of your frog's face, so he or she will ""think"" it is alive and will eat it. If your frog is having digesting problems, you can rub its stomach gently to help your frog digest its meal.

, It is recommended that there be at least 45% water source taking up the tank for your frogs to soak, swim, and hide. You can add a quiet trickling water fountain to circulate the water ( which delays the need to change it ). Adding aquatic or semi-aquatic plants is also a great way to suck excessive nitrogen ( from frog waste ) from the water and provide hiding places for your frogs. If you add plants and a water circulator you can get away with simply adding clean water weekly. Do not use tap water. Use distilled water or tap that has been purified with aquarium water conditioner. If you just have standing water in the tank, make sure you change it out weekly or the water will go stagnant.

, Pacific tree frogs can deal with some handling , but be gentle or they may pee on you. If your frog does poop on you as well, make sure you do not freak out as you may startle your frog and drop it. This will only make your frog more nervous and stressed.


Handle gently and let them crawl on your fingers, but be careful when out in the open and they can quickly jump off your hands on to the floor and disappear quickly. Frogs are easily injured and are very delicate. .
If you need to handle a frog, make sure your hands are clean. The skin of a Pacific Tree Frog is highly absorbent, and the salt, or other substances on your skin is irritating to it.

, Make sure the frog is not on the wall near the lid or door, or he may climb the glass and jump out.

Provide a shallow, non-moving water source.,
Give them a shady, damp shelter.,
Plant to attract insects.,
Keep a compost heap and mulch the beds in your garden.",How to Attract Frogs1," Frogs drink and breathe through their skin, which needs to be kept constantly moist in order for them to perform these basic life functions. Thus, the most essential requirement for attracting frogs is an accessible source of fresh water that’s out of direct sunlight.If you don’t have a pond or other built-in water source in your yard, simply place some large, shallow dishes of water in a shady area of your lawn or garden. Be sure to clean the dish and change the water weekly so that it doesn’t stagnate.You could also try sinking a shallow plastic tub into the ground to provide a makeshift pond.
Frogs also spawn in water. Ideally, your water source or sources should be large enough to accommodate adult and young frogs.;
, Frogs are generally more active at night since too much exposure to the sun puts them at risk of dehydration. Create a simple shelter for frogs that will offer them a safe, cave-like space to rest during the day. It should be out of the sun and predators’ reach.You can create a simple shelter using an overturned ceramic pot propped up by some rocks. Place it in a shady location near to a water source, and leave just enough room between the rim of the pot and the earth for frogs to slip in and out.

, If you want frogs to show up in your yard or garden, you need to provide them with adequate food. The best way to do that is plant a range of seasonal flowering plants that will attract insects throughout the year.Aim to always have something in bloom during the spring, summer, and fall. That way, nectar-eating bugs will flock to your yard.

, The bugs that are attracted to a compost heap and mulch also make great food for frogs. Compost and mulch can also provide the damp conditions where frogs love to live.Do not remove leaf litter from some areas in your yard. Leaf litter provides shelter for frogs and some of their prey also prefers areas with leaf litter."

Measure its size.,
Look for the presence of a vocal sac.,
Check the size of the ears.,
Look for pads next to the thumbs.,
Look for less-common differences in appearance.",How to Tell if Your Tree Frog Is Male or Female1," For most species of frog, males are noticeably smaller than females. Tree frogs generally range from 1-5.5 inches (3-14 centimeters) depending on the precise species.. Females are typically about half an inch longer and slightly heavier than males of the same species.


The reason for this has to do with the way frogs mate. Males have to climb all the way onto females' backs to mate, so the female has to be larger so that the male's weight doesn't hurt her.;
, Since male frogs do the vast majority of the croaking (more on this below), they usually have specially-constructed throats designed for this purpose. Most male frogs (including tree frogs) have something called a ""vocal sac"" on their throats. This sac can inflate full of air like a balloon when the frog croaks. When the frog isn't croaking, the deflated sac may make the skin on the throat seem more thin and baggy than on female frogs.In addition, the skin of the vocal sac will often be a different color than the rest of the underside. Yellowish or black shades are common.

, Instead of having ears that stick out from their heads like humans, frogs' ears are flat discs of skin on the sides of their heads behind their eyes. These discs are sometimes (but not always) a different color than the skin around them. Male frogs tend to have ears that are larger than their eyes. By contrast, female frogs tend to have ears that are about the same size as their eyes (or slightly smaller., Male frogs (including tree frogs) often have special features on their hands and arms that make it easier to cling to female frogs' backs for mating purposes. For example, male frogs sometimes have a patch of rough, raised flesh on each of their thumbs. If the thumb seems to be larger and thicker than the other digits, especially at its base, the frog is probably a male.


This feature may be difficult to see except in the breeding season, when it enlarges in time for mating.

, There are many other external features that can vary between male and female frogs. A few of these are listed below.These vary between species: some frogs may have them and others may not. Some are also time-dependant — for example, the hand hooks described below often develop only during the mating season.


Some male frogs will have thicker arms with more noticeable muscle definition.
Some male frogs will develop hook-shaped adornments on their hands used for gripping onto females for mating purposes.
In some species, male frogs will have rougher skin (sometimes with small spines) while female frogs will have smooth skin.

Watch for lethargy.,
Check for discoloration.,
Consider sleeping habits.,
Look for sores, cuts, and bruises.,
Beware of bloating.,
Monitor weight.,
Consider trouble with eating.",How to Diagnose Your Tree Frog's Illness," This can occur in various diseases such as Red-Leg, Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD), edema, and others. Red-Leg is often fatal because there is no known cure for it. Red-Leg has many other, more noticeable symptoms as well. Metabolic Bone Disease is usually curable. MBD usually makes the frog stop eating and jumping. This is due to lack of vitamin D and calcium. The frog's jaw may also hang open and his legs are usually sprawled out. Edema is when the frog swells up and becomes lethargic just because it is so bloated. If your frog is lethargic and not bloated, then he does not have edema.;
, Red-Leg causes the skin near the frog's legs to turn reddish. Some tree frogs naturally have a bit of red pigment on their legs, the Red-Eyed Tree Frog is a good example. Sometimes something as simple as lack of humidity can cause a frog to have darkened skin. A frog's skin may also be dark due to stress or a poor diet. If his skin is dry, this can also be from stress as well as dehydration. Sores and bruises, as well as cuts, can cause a frog's skin to look strange. If your frog's eyes are smoky, cloudy, foggy, or blueish, he most likely has a condition known as Cloudy Eye. This is from being bashed, poked, or scratched on the eye. This is also a symptom of immune system failure.

, If your frog is awake during the day  then he is probably just stressed out, although this is a symptom of various other diseases that will be discussed later in the article.

, These are probably due to being banged around while they were being shipped to the pet store or on the way to your home. This could also be the result of a bacterial infection, which needs to be taken care of by a vet. If not treated, these infections and wounds can let harmful bacteria into your frogs body. This can result in death.

, If your frog has swelled up, it is almost definitely edema. There are actually two types of edema. One is the bacterial kind (which causes the bloating) and the other is from kidney failure due to vitamin toxicity. If it is the bacterial kind, you should soak your frog in clean spring water for a few hours. The frog should be alright after that. To prevent this, keep an extra clean cage and change water frequently. But unfortunately, kidney failure will most likely kill the frog.

, If your frog has gained or lost a significant amount of weight, then this can usually be fixed. If your frog has lost weight, he may have either an internal parasite or Metabolic Bone Disease(MBD). A vet can cure both MBD and a parasite. It could be that your frog is just naturally thin and needs to be fed more. If your frog has gained weight, this is probably due to overfeeding. Cut back on the amount of food he gets. However, if your frog is still fairly young, he may still be growing.

, This is probably MBD because this disease weakens the bones of your frog and he will become lethargic. This could also be the result of a parasite. If you have more than one frog housed in the terrarium, some frogs (bigger ones especially) could be getting more food than others. You should also make sure you are feeding your frogs small crickets, because medium and large are too big for them to swallow.

Choose a good spot.,
Dig a shallow hole.,
Line the hole.,
Secure the pond’s perimeter.,
Let the pond fill with water.,
Add a bucket of natural pond water.,
Give frogs cover.,
Wait for frogs to colonize your yard or garden.",How to Attract Frogs2," It should be a partially shaded corner of your yard. Ponds need some direct sunlight to be a healthy environment. However, frogs prefer shaded environments for breeding and shelter from the sun., Frog ponds can be as wide as you want, but they should be no more than a foot (or about 30 cm) deep. Be sure that your hole has shallow edges in it so that the frogs can enter and leave easily. Remove any roots, sticks, or stones that could damage the liner.Frogs thrive best in shallow, non-moving water and are surprisingly susceptible to drowning in deeper water.
If you don’t have tapering edges to your pool, you’ll need to provide some sort of incline. Frogs need a gently sloping exit, like a slab of rock, so they can easily get out of the water.If you would like your pond to be a specific shape, mark out the edges with a piece of rope before digging.
If you’re digging up your lawn, keep the pieces of turf to help you secure the pond’s edges.

, To keep the water in, you’ll need a rubber or plastic pond liner. To protect the liner in the long-term, it’s also a good idea to first insert a protective underlay between the plastic and the dirt to cushion the liner.The easiest way to line your pond is to purchase a flexible or rigid plastic pond liner. However, any thick, durable plastic sheeting will do.
Make sure that your liner is big enough to cover the entirety of your pond with a least two feet (about 60 cm) of excess on all sides.
Ponds can also be lined with concrete, but you will need to treat it to ensure that lime does not leach into the water.

, Weigh down the plastic sheet around the edges of your pond with closely-packed rocks, and/or ring it with the pieces of turf you kept from digging the hole where your pond would go. Either way, make sure your perimeter is heavy and big enough to keep the liner in place.Once you’ve secured the pond’s perimeter, you can cut away any excess liner.

, Ideally, you should let your pond fill with rainwater rather than filling it from the hose or tap. You can speed up that process by collecting rain in buckets to add to the pond., If you mix in a bucket-full of water taken from a local marsh or pond, it will introduce millions of microscopic organisms that can jump-start your pond’s ecosystem. They will infuse the water with oxygen, making it more livable and appealing to native frogs in your area.You can also try planting a few native water plants in your pond to attract local frogs. Just make sure that the plants don’t overtake the whole pond and choke other wildlife out.

, At least one edge of the pond should be thickly vegetated with leafy plants that grow well in your area. Plant grasses and leafy perennials around the edges of the pond to provide frogs with adequate shade, dampness, and protection.If you are looking to attract local species, it’s a good idea to stick to native plants when planting around your pond. Pick a selection of native grasses, clumping plants (like ferns and lilies), and ground cover (like shrubs and vines) to grow around your frog pond.

, Keep in mind that it may take a couple years for frogs to populate your garden, even after you have created a suitable environment for them.If attracting frogs takes longer than you would like, you can try seeding your pond with tadpoles in the spring. Make sure you use a type of tadpole that is native to your area.

Avoid using chemicals.,
Keep out invasive species.,
Keep your grass short.,
Thaw water sources when necessary.,
Avoid plants that are toxic to frogs.",How to Attract Frogs3," Frogs are especially susceptible to poisoning from pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilizers, and other common garden chemicals because their hydration and respiration takes place through their porous skin. If you want to attract a healthy frog population, start by using organic gardening practices.Instead of using synthetic fertilizer, encourage growth through picking nutrient-rich soils that are appropriate to each plant, rotating your crops to keep your soil rich, and using organic fertilizer when necessary.
Keep in mind that once you’ve attracted frogs, you shouldn’t have any need of chemical pesticides since a single frog will consume more than 10,000 bugs a season.

, You want to attract the right kind of frogs. Non-native frogs will compete with local ones for food and shelter. Sometimes they’ll even eat local species. Their populations are also generally difficult to control because they have no natural predators.Identify the species of frogs in your yard or garden to be sure that they’re not invasive. Invasive.org has a list of dangerous non-native wildlife that can be searched by animal type and region.If you do find invasive species of frogs in your yard or garden, contact your local government environmental agency, like your state’s DNR, or a nonprofit conservation group, like the National Wildlife Federation, for advice and support about how to remove them responsibly.

, Frogs like to hide in tall grass and are frequent victims of lawn mowers. Be sure that you can see any rogue amphibians in your path by keeping the grass in your yard or garden well-trimmed., Most male frogs hibernate in water over the winter. A thin layer of ice will not harm them. However, if their water source is completely frozen, they won’t survive. Protect any dormant amphibians by putting a pan of hot water over thickening ice., Many flowers and vegetables are poisonous to frogs. Protect the amphibian population in your yard or garden by either not planting species that are toxic to them or by planting them well away from your intended frog habitat.Vegetables that are dangerous for frogs include eggplant, rhubarb, snow peas, and potatoes.
Flowers that are toxic to frogs include honeysuckle, azaleas, hydrangeas, daffodils, and hyacinth.

Keep an outdoor light on at night.,
Don’t trim your trees.,
Make a ground home for tree frogs.,
Hang frog refuges in a tree.",How to Attract Frogs4," Tree frogs love to eat the moths and insects that are attracted to light sources. Keep a garden light on for part or all of the night in order to create an irresistible feeding spot for them., You can provide tree frogs with natural habitat by avoiding trimming back bushes and tree branches near water or food sources. Keeping your trees and shrubs leafy and full will give frogs plenty of cover. It will also provide them with good hunting grounds., Tree frogs won’t gather in normal frog abodes on the ground; give them an alternative with a bit of height. Get a piece of PVC piping that’s about 5 feet long. Drive it into the ground so that roughly half of the pipe is left exposed.Place the PVC pipe about a foot from the base of a tree that’s near a water source.
Water may gather in the bottom of the pipe, but it should be absorbed by the underlying ground before it reaches a dangerous depth.
PVC pipe is available from most home improvement stores.

, Cut standard schedule-20 PVC piping into pieces that are about 2 feet in length. Cap the bottom-side of the pipe, and drill a hole about 3 or 4 inches above the capped bottom so that water can both gather and escape from the refuge.Drill two holes on one side of the top of each pipe. String the holes with heavy fishing line, and tie the refuges around a tree.
If possible, pick a tree that’s near a water source since that’s the place where frogs are most likely to congregate naturally.
Keep the PVC refuges at a height that is easy for you to reach. Take the caps off at least once a month so that water doesn’t stagnate in the bottom of them.

Listen for croaking at night.,
Look for ""humping"" behavior.,
Learn which behaviors aren't indicative of sex.,
When all else fails, ask an experienced breeder or a veterinarian.",How to Tell if Your Tree Frog Is Male or Female2," Male frogs are the ones who seem to croak at night without stopping. They do this to attract mates around breeding spots — female frogs use the calls of the males to determine which ones are healthiest and most attractive. Females, on the other hand, don't usually make much noise..


This isn't to say that female frogs don't make any noise. Female frogs may occasionally croak or call out in response to something else. For instance, female frogs will ""scream"" when grabbed by a predator. However, they won't croak constantly at night like most male frogs.

, There's no nice way to say this — male frogs will occasionally ""hump"" things. In other words, they will climb onto something, grasp it with their forelegs, and press the underside of their bodies against it tight. They often won't use an obvious ""thrusting"" motion like a male dog, but their intention should be obvious.


This isn't just restricted to female frogs (although this is often the case). Male frogs may ""hump"" or hug objects like plants or rocks. They may even hump other male frogs. Female frogs, however, will not hump.

, Some behaviors may seem like things that only male or female frogs would do, but in fact are not. A few of these are listed below:Both male and female frogs will defend themselves or attempt to run if threatened.
Both male and female frogs shed skin.
Both male and female frogs will attempt to camouflage themselves against similarly-colored things.
Male and female frogs of the same species have the same diet.

, It's not always easy to tell male and female tree frogs apart, especially if you are dealing with a very small species or a species without obvious male/female appearance variations. In these cases, you may want to consult an expert. Biologists, amphibian experts, veterinarians, and similar professionals can all be valuable resources.

Make sure the frog has food and water.,
Give the frog a place to hibernate within its tank.,
Keep the temperature stable.,
Provide food during hibernation.,
Resist the urge to disturb your frog.,
Provide plenty of food to pet frogs.,
Release wild frogs back into the wild.,
Consider rescuing wild spawn in cold weather.",How to Care for a Hibernating Frog," When aquatic frogs begin to hibernate in October, they usually need a lake or pond deep enough to escape the frozen surface. If you come across a frog in the wild that is inhabiting a pond less than 16 inches (40 cm) deep, the water may freeze all the way through due to its shallow depth. If this is the case, you'll need to either move the frog to a lake/pond nearby that won't freeze all the way through, or bring the frog inside your home for the winter.Whether you relocate the frog or bring it indoors will depend on your community (especially whether any ponds/lakes are nearby), as well as your ability to care for a frog over the winter.
If you're conflicted on what to do, talk to a local wildlife biologist. Most colleges and universities have wildlife experts, and some high schools may have wildlife biologists as well.;
, If you have a pet frog, or if you've decided to care for a frog over the winter, you'll need to create a comfortable habitat for the frog. For indoor care, a glass aquarium is the best environment you can provide. Make sure your frog has some type of shelter within the aquarium in case it wants to hide, as well as a suitable substrate for digging/burrowing.Consider putting down a bed of gravel in part or all of the aquarium, depending on the type of frog you're caring for. Tree frogs will probably prefer a sterile mix of sand and potting soil.Provide plants in aquatic environments. Frogs that hibernate underwater need to be able to take in adequate oxygen through their skin underwater, which means they'll need lots of photosynthetic plants in the water with them.Some frogs will attempt to eat other frogs. For this reason, it's best to keep frogs of the same size together in the same tank, if you plan on caring for multiple frogs.

, Whether your frog was rescued from the wild or purchased in a pet store, it will need to have its basic needs met. Your frog will need food everyday. It will also need a dish or pool of clean, un-chlorinated water to sit in.Frogs often eat more food than usual to fatten up before hibernation. Make sure your frog has enough food to eat each day to ensure a healthy hibernation period.Frogs typically enjoy insects and slugs, as these are readily available in most habitats frogs naturally live in.You can buy crickets and dechlorination drops at most pet stores.

, Providing your frog with a suitable environment is important, but part of that environment should include a place to hibernate over the winter. Where and how your frog hibernates will depend on the type of frog you're caring for.Tree frogs (including chorus frogs, peepers, and gray tree frogs) typically hibernate on land, often by burying themselves in the soil. These frogs may need a deeper, richer soil substrate for digging and hibernation.
Certain tree frogs, like the wood frog and spring peeper, cannot dig in the soil. Instead, these frogs crawl into spaces in cracked logs or rocks, or occasionally bury themselves in leaves on the ground.True frogs (leopard frogs, green frogs, and bullfrogs) usually hibernate in lakes and ponds. These types of frogs will require a larger aquatic environment to hibernate in.

, Depending on the species of frog you're caring for, it may need an overhead heat lamp. Tropical frogs will also require humidity, which means you may need to mist the tank a few times each day and install a hydrometer to monitor the moisture levels.However, most North American amphibians do not need an artificial heat source.Amphibians in the northern United States typically prefer something in the 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius) range, though you should never exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 degrees Celsius) unless it is a tropical frog species.
Tropical frogs like the Argentine Horned Frog and the African Bull Frog typically need temperatures around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 degrees Celsius) in order to survive.Talk to an amphibian expert at your local pet store to determine what species you're caring for and whether that species needs a heat lamp.

, In the wild, many frogs will abstain from eating while hibernating. However, amphibians in general often come out of hibernation during periods of mild weather, and they typically forage during these periods.Since you're controlling the frog's environment by keeping it indoors, you may want to leave some food nearby, just in case it comes out of hibernation unexpectedly., Frogs may appear dead during their inactive hibernation period. It's best to leave the frog undisturbed during this time, as disrupting the frog or its environment could startle the frog and disrupt its natural hibernation cycle.Some frogs prefer to hibernate in water. Make sure the water dish in your tank is large enough to accommodate a sitting frog.

, Frogs typically use up the remainder of their fat stores when they first emerge from hibernation, but they'll quickly need to resume their usual diets.Since your frog was overwintering in a more mild environment, it may not have stored up as much fat as frogs in the wild would. Make sure that you give your frog a little extra food in the spring when it first emerges from hibernation.

, If you've been caring for a wild frog over the winter, you'll need to release it back into the wild once it comes out of hibernation. Frogs in the wild will seek out mates almost immediately after coming out of hibernation in the spring. Take wild frogs back outdoors and release them near a pond or lake so that they can begin the mating process.Do not release frogs near roadways. Many frogs are hit by vehicles while trying to cross roads during mating season.
Release your wild frog as close to a lake or pond as possible, and do not disturb it once you've released it.
Don't be alarmed if the frog leaves the pond you return it to. Many frogs will stay away from water until they reach sexual maturity (which usually takes two to three years), and frogs generally stay away from water after breeding.

, Your frog will most likely survive a cold spell in spring if it's had sufficient food after hibernation. Its spawn, however, may not survive if the weather gets unseasonably cold in the spring. After mating, frogs lay their spawn in shallow water, and those spawn are particularly susceptible to frost.If a cold spell comes on suddenly, you can rescue the spawn from a wild frog by scooping them up in a bucket. Keep them indoors until the weather gets slightly warmer and frost is no longer a factor.
When you release the spawn, make sure you do so in the same pond that you rescued them from.
Do not attempt to raise spawn. Only take them indoors to save them from a frost, and return them to the wild as soon as possible.

Buy a large aquarium.,
Install a mesh lid.,
Install perches and hiding places.,
Fill the base of the tank with substrate.,
Equip your terrarium with a clamp lamp.",How to Care for a White's Tree Frog1," The tank should be at least 20-gallons. The taller the better, as White’s tree frogs love to climb and to perch themselves high on branches. You can purchase a tank at a local pet store or online through a company like Exo Terra.Arboreal and terrestrial tanks are your two best bets. The former provides room for climbing, the latter has a wide base.;
, White’s tree frogs love to climb, so this lid should be secure and should ideally latch on to the terrarium to prevent your frog from escaping. A mesh material will allow for proper ventilation as well as for natural light to come through. These are usually sold separately from tanks and are available at most pet stores.

, These will satisfy your frog’s instinct for comfort and security. You can buy perches at pet stores. Useful DIY decorations can range from draping a leaf over a perch to creating hiding boxes out of cardboard and moss to strategically placing a few hollowed-out logs.

, You can use moist paper towels, coconut husk fiber, organic mulch, moss, peat bedding, or large reptile bark chips as substrate.Don’t use small substrates like sand, gravel, or pine shavings - your frog could ingest these when they’re diving for prey, and this could lead to death.

, Turn the light on during the day and turn it off at night. This will help establish the appropriate temperature, which should range between 75-85°F (23.9-29.4°C).Use a 2.0 UVB light bulb. These are great for use with live reptiles and amphibians, as they mimic natural light."
"
Gather and organize all the materials.,
Pour about 1"" of gravel on the terrarium floor.,
Pour about 2"" of soil or mulch over the gravel.,
Place the soaking bowl anywhere on the substrate.,
Dig out a portion of the terrarium soil to place the feeding dish if you choose.,
Add some branches that are at least 1 1/2"" in diameter to the cage.,
Plant some plants into the terrarium or use pre-cleaned fake plants.",How to Create a White's Tree Frog Habitat," This will make a specific object easy to find.;
, This drainage level will prevent plants from ""drowning"" and will help regulate humidity in the terrarium.

, These substrates keep the terrarium humid and provide soft bedding in case the frog falls off a perch. They also help to avoid impaction (clogging of throat or stomach because of substrate swallowing) when these frogs are hunting. These frogs are lunge attackers and often get a mouthful of substrate with their prey.

, The corners of the back wall provide perfect places for these water bowls.

, You can also just set the dish on the substrate. They will find their way into the bowl. The opposite side as the water bowl is an ideal place to put this.

, These branches need to be strong enough to support White's Tree Frogs that can grow large and get heavy.


A hiding place will provide security to these shy frogs. Anything as simple as a Tupperware container can be used, but cork bark rounds make excellent naturalistic hides.

, A large Gasteria plant in the back with philodendron as ground cover is perfect for White's.


A fluorescent tube light provides bright light, but light is not necessary as these frogs are nocturnal, and a heat pad or heat emitters will provide heat. Heat is only necessary if your home temperature routinely drops below 78º.

Be able to communicate with both animals and people.,
Consider getting further education.",How to Become a Veterinarian," Preparing for a career as a veterinarian begins long before even graduating from high school. You will want to gain as much experience with animals and in the veterinary field as possible during high school and your undergraduate career. This experience will expose you to what veterinarians actually do, and will give you veterinary experience to put on your resume for veterinary school.


In the United States there are 30 colleges of veterinary medicine which graduate about 3,000 veterinarians a year.You could volunteer at your local animal shelter, or you could shadow your pet's veterinarian. Working at a livestock farm can also help you gain valuable animal experience.
Most colleges of veterinary medicine require a minimum of 400 hours of animal related experience;
, While in high school, you should pay attention to your performance in science courses, such as Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. Also pay attention to math courses, such as Trigonometry, Geometry, and Algebra. If you can excel in these areas, it may be a good indicator that medicine is the right field for you.


If possible, take AP classes. Also, excelling in English class will help, as veterinarians need to be good at communicating to other people.
Alternatively, you can pass the GED exam. Passing the GED exam might seem like a good idea, but many veterinary colleges would like to see that you have completed high school instead.

, You will need to attend a college which offers the pre-requisite courses for admittance into veterinary college. Make sure to complete all prerequisite courses for veterinary school. If one school's prerequisites vary from some of the others, make sure to take the prerequisite courses for all of these schools.


These courses consist of many advanced science courses, such as biochemistry, organic and inorganic chemistry, and physics. They are necessary to prepare the student for the vigorous coursework in veterinary college.

, This may save considerable time and money. According to the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC), more than 10% of recent incoming vet school students did not earn a bachelor's degree. These students may have earned an associate's degree in a field like animal science, or earned no degree in college while completing the prerequisite courses for veterinary school.

, You will most likely need to take the GRE towards the end of your college studies. These tests are standardized tests which graduate and professional schools use in deciding admission to their colleges.Odds are that the veterinary school of your choice wants your GRE scores. However, some schools accept the MCAT as well.The GRE is mainly a test to see if you're ready to study at a higher level (and to weed out those that aren't serious).
The scores you need will vary by school.

, Getting into veterinary school is very hard. There are far fewer veterinary schools than medical schools. So, you need to make your application stand out! Making your application stand out is not hard! First, you will need to get lots of veterinary experience and animal experience.


Veterinary experience only qualifies as work done under a veterinarian.
As for recommendation letters, you'll probably need three: one from your academic adviser, one from a veterinarian, and one from an individual choice. If you can choose to wave the right to see them, do so.It shows that you trust your superiors' opinions of you and when being read, the panel will know that the person writing about you was honest.

, Just like with most colleges, veterinary college is expensive. In the US the average tuition each year for in-state students is $22,500. For out of state students it is $46,000. The average veterinary student graduates with $135,000 of debt.Salaries starting out in the veterinary field are much lower than those of other equivalent professions, such as dentists or physicians. In the US the average starting salary is around $67,000 a year but this varies widely.
There are only a few options to help with loan repayment. These include two government sponsored loan forgiveness programs. These programs are competitive and mainly for people serving as veterinarians in the livestock or food and public health fields., The professional veterinary college program typically lasts for four years before the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree is earned. Two accredited schools in the US, Ross University and St. Matthew's University, have a trimester schedule, which allows students to graduate in just over three years. The coursework involved in veterinary school includes anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, along with specific veterinary courses in surgery and medicine.During the first two years, you will focus on a breadth of subjects in science in order to build the basic framework for your education. During your third and fourth years, you will focus on clinical studies, working directly with animals, and participating in externships and/or research projects. You may also consider doing an internship or residency program while working toward your degree. This will teach you practical skills from professionals in the field, and improve your employment prospects in the future.
There are only 28 accredited veterinary schools in the US, making the program quite competitive.Tuition will vary dramatically depending on the institution you choose.Consider doing an internship or residency program while working toward your degree. This will teach you practical skills from professionals in the field, and improve your employment prospects in the future., At the end of the fourth year of study veterinary students in North America will take the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam. This test is required in order for you to obtain a license to practice veterinary medicine.


In addition, each state board of veterinary medicine may impose additional testing requirements to obtaining a license to practice in the state. You will need to pass these examination with a minimum score in order to be licensed to practice.
In order to be eligible for enrollment, you must have completed a four year veterinary program that is accredited by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).

, This will offer you the chance to have a specialization, like internal medicine or surgery. That way you'll really be a pro in your chosen area of expertise.


Your vet school should be able to point you in the right direction. This one-year period could be just a temporary gig or it could turn into something more substantial. Whatever it is, find someone who can serve as your mentor that's doing what you want to do in the future.

, Most veterinary students begin their job search during their final half of the fourth year of college. Most veterinarians work in private veterinary clinics that provide medical care for small, companion pets. Other veterinarians specialize in working with large animals, like horses, cows, and sheep, traveling to ranches and farms to provide care.


Still other veterinarians specialize in treating exotic animals in zoos or aquariums.
Veterinarians can also find employment in the military (a good option to pay for college expenses), the government, or in research.

, Before you start working and caring for animals, you need to take the veterinarian's oath. You're basically promising that you'll use your powers for good and not evil., In order to succeed in this job, you must be compassionate, confident, and able to communicate and make decisions. Despite the opportunity to work with kittens and puppies (along with all other animals) there will always be a person attached to that animal that you will need to communicate with to give the pets and animals the best care possible.

, Some vets even go so far as to get their PhDs. If you'd like to lead the field in research, this is a great idea. Having a PhD will have the added benefit of potentially giving you a massive bump in your salary!


The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the need for vets is going to increase in the near future. Since there are so few schools, the output to trained veterinarians generated isn't much, which means you stand a good chance of steady employment once you finish school."

Keep humidity at 50-60%.,
Keep track of the temperature regularly.,
Mist the terrarium frequently.,
Clean the terrarium thoroughly once a week.",How to Care for a White's Tree Frog2," You can measure humidity by using a hygrometer. In the wild, these animals live in moist forested environments and are usually found close to sources of water, so they prefer a humid habitat.Keep humidity levels low by making sure the tank stays dry and has a fully exposed mesh lid.Keep humidity levels high by misting the tank, keeping the substrate damp, or covering 2/3 of the mesh lid with plastic., There should be no sudden rises or drops in tank temperature. Instead, maintain a comfortable average of 75-85°F (23.9-29.4°C) during the day and 65°F (18.3°C) at night., To regulate moisture levels, it helps to lightly mist the tank with water once a day.


Don’t mist too much - a soggy tank will be unsuitable for a White’s tree frog., Place your frog in a secure location, then scrub the tank, rinse it with hot water, allow it to dry, and install fresh substrate.

"
"
Feed your frog small insects.,
Change the water daily.,
Wash your hands before and after handling a White’s tree frog.",How to Care for a White's Tree Frog3," In the wild, White’s tree frogs feed on moths, locusts, crickets, and roaches. You should feed these insects to your adult frog 2-3 times a week and to younger frogs 1-2 times a week. Feed your frog, adult or tadpole, 4-5 insects per feeding.Frogs reach adulthood when they are no longer in the tadpole stage. Your frog will be adult when it has developed legs and its tail has re-absorbed into its body.You can feed your adult White’s tree frog the occasional pinkie mouse as a treat. Mice are high in fat, so refrain from giving pinkie mice to your adult frog too often to avoid health complications.Dust the live food with reptile calcium powder and reptile multivitamin supplements once a week., The pool should be shallow enough that the water does go over your frog’s head. Use bottled spring water or charcoal-filtered tap water., Rinse them thoroughly. Residue or oil on your hands can harm your frog, and your frog secretes toxins that could be harmful to you, so washing your hands is important.You can even wear latex gloves as a protective barrier if you must handle your frog.

Although it is not dog training specifically, it will help you understand the anatomical, biological and physiological side of animals. It will also give you an edge over the competition when applying for a dog training position.A college degree is not a prerequisite to all programs. Check with the agency you want to work for.
Some workplaces will sponsor an apprenticeship for you to become trainer, but you need a four year college degree.;
, As a guide dog trainer, you must be able to work with people and dogs, since you are training dogs to interact appropriately with people. A shelter will give you many opportunities to work with both. Duties might be:


Answer incoming calls.
Perform clerical work for adoptions.
Help scared dogs adjust to a new environment.
Match pets with new owners.

, Volunteering at an animal hospital may be less hands-on than at a shelter, because animals are being treated for injuries and illness, but it will help feed your passion for dogs. Research what hospitals in your area take volunteers. Some may be more hands-on than others and require you to complete an application. Expect to do things like cleaning out kennels and checking in patients.Volunteerism looks good to an employer on an application, because it shows you are passionate enough about the field to work for free.

, Get a job working with dogs, even if it’s just at your local pet store. It will give you experience and help you learn how dogs’ minds operate. Work as a dog sitter or dog walker. They are both in high demand, since people increasingly think of their dogs as family members.

, Most guide dog trainers are self-taught through extensive experience working with dogs or they completed an apprenticeship program, but there are a handful of schools. Do your homework before you commit. Some things a good school should offer are:


The history of dog training starting from the late 19th century.
Animal learning including positive and negative reinforcement, and human versus dog learning.
Dog behavior, including breed temperaments and social cues.
How to design classes to best teach owners and dogs interaction skills., Guide dog trainers know through science how dogs operate and think. Apply to a school that offers an Associate of Science, Bachelor of Science or Master of Science degree if you can. Some schools may not offer degree plans, but can still educate on how to be a good trainer. Make sure they offer classes on biology and other life sciences., The Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers is the only widely recognized dog trainer certification. This certification shows your professionalism and that you are familiar with the most current training techniques. To get certified, you need to:

Research breeding commitments.,
Set aside the money necessary for breeding.,
Choose an animal to breed.,
Research the animal you will breed.,
Research breeding license laws specific to your area.,
Apply for the license.,
Apply for breeder’s insurance, just in case.,
Decide whether you want both male and female animals.,
Research other breeders of the animal you want to breed.,
Purchase healthy animals to begin breeding.,
Breed the animals.,
Care for the pregnant mother.,
Help the mother deliver her babies.,
Care for the weaning newborns.,
Advertise your litter.,
Screen any potential buyers.,
Offer reasonable prices.",How to Become a Breeder," Animal breeders have many responsibilities, such as feeding, watering, and caring for animals, organizing medical procedures for newborn animals, and selling or rehousing baby animals.The type of animal you decide to breed also impacts this.
For example, breeding dogs to sell to families is very different from breeding cows to sell to farms.
Whatever animal you choose, it is a huge responsibility.;
, This is essential to take care of before beginning to become a breeder, and the amount necessary to begin will vary from animal to animal, but is expensive no matter what you choose. For example, the preliminaries for Malamute breeding puppies can cost more than $7,000, and this amount does not include vet checkups if the puppies are sick.Although breeders make money, the amount you will earn depends on the animals being bought
Animals that are sought after will make you more money.You will not be able to begin selling a litter until after they are weaned, which can take up to a year depending on the animal.

, Dogs, cats, and birds are the most common household pets, so consider these if you want to sell to families.In general, livestock should be bred in a farm, whereas domesticated animals can be bred from a home. Exotic animals can only be bred in a zoo or by a professional organization.


Only people with bachelor’s and/or graduate degrees in veterinary science can work with these animals.Keep a list of any animals that best fit your living situation.
For example, if you live in an urban area, breeding farm animals or horses might not be the best idea.
If you live on a farm, breeding chickens, dogs, or even bunnies would be okay.

, This is the most important step in the entire process because each type of animal requires specialized knowledge. Though an educational degree is not required to become a breeder, a thorough understanding of the animal you are going to breed is essential.Use a search engine to look up the care required to breed a particular animal, such as bulldogs or a certain type of horse. Take notes on what type of animal seems to fit your lifestyle best.


Type specific questions into a search engine, such as: “How do I breed lizards?” or “How do I care for baby bunnies?”
Ask established breeders for advice.
Libraries will also have many books on certain animals.

, Not all breeding laws are the same; for example, in California, breeding licenses are valid for one year, cost $335, and the animal being bred must be microchipped.In Texas, however, licenses cost $300 if you have less than 25 animals, and the animal being bred does not need to be microchipped.In a search engine, type “breeding license” and the state or area you live in.
To breed animals legally, you must obtain a license.
There are often specific rules, such as not being able to have over a certain number of animals and getting regular inspections., Once you’ve figured out the requirements for obtaining a breeding license, take the steps necessary to obtain the license. This will most likely include paying a sum of money and filling out an application. Often, applications can be found online, but your area may require you to visit the local department of animal services.

, You may be able to obtain this through your existing house or car insurance company. This type of insurance will provide coverage for any personal property damaged by the animals being bred, unexpected vet bills, and other expenses.Ask an insurance agent for more information.

, It is not mandatory for you to own both the male and the female animal: you could own the female and pay to breed with someone else's male, own the male and pay to breed with someone else's female, or own both the male and female. The upside of owning both is not having to negotiate contracts with other breeders.


You may prefer having a male to breed with other females.
Not having a female means you will not have to care for newborns.
Or, you may enjoy having a pregnant female and her litter to care for.

, Whether you choose to buy just a male, just a female, or both, finding animals with high-quality bloodlines is important. You also want to make sure any animal you buy or breed with is healthy. Keep a contact list of potential breeding partners who offer quality animals for sale.


If you won’t own both the male and female, ask potential breeding partners what percentage of the sales you will get.
Thoroughly check the background of any animal you consider breeding with.
Asking for the animals registration papers; this is especially important if you are breeding a specific, purebred animal.

, Sick animals often vomit or have diarrhea, are lethargic, or have missing fur.Research the animal you are going to breed, and know what illness in that particular animals looks like.


In a search engine, type the animal you want to breed and “symptoms of illness.”
For example, cat breeders should type in “cat symptoms of illness.”
Spend time learning about what illness in the animal looks like. This way, you will know if animals you buy are healthy.

, Most female animals have a estrous cycle, which means they can become pregnant at certain times; breed the animals regularly and often to ensure impregnation.Just like humans can have fertility issues, animals can, too, so if the female is not getting pregnant, ask a vet to make sure both are fertile.


Some species, such as birds, are also known to be picky and may not like a certain male or female.Take the female to a vet regularly to figure out if she is pregnant.
mammals typically get chubby when pregnant but it can be difficult to tell if a bird is.

, Every animal requires different types of care, but in general, you should take the mother to the vet regularly and provide the mother with proper nutrition. Ask a vet what type of food and supplements you should give to the mother.

, This will often not require a trip to the vet because animals give birth with much more ease than humans do.Provide the mother with a comfortable, quiet area, and allow nature to take its course.


Even animals that do not give live birth, such as birds, will need a comfortable nesting area.
Don’t allow visitors and strangers to bother the mother at this time.
Once the newborns are delivered, take them and the mother to the vet.

, Ask your vet if you need to provide any special nutrients or food for mom while she nurses her babies. Animals take different amounts of time to wean: puppies take four weeks, for example.However, horses take one year., Once you have healthy newborn animals that are weaned from their mother, you can now sell them. Newspapers often have classified ads, and many animals are sold online.

, Check that potential buyers know how to, can, and will correctly care for the animal. If you feel uncomfortable with someone for any reason, you can refuse to sell them an animal. Ask that you be able to view where they intend to keep the animal, and that they give you updates. Some questions you can ask are:


Do you have any other pets?
Can you financially afford this animal?
Who will be the animal’s primary caretaker?

, A simple online search will reveal the amount animals are being sold for. Aim to price your animals similarly to others. If your animals are unreasonably expensive, people will not buy them.

It is a popular profession that is not made for everyone. The field is competitive and you will need to distinguish yourself among a sea of applicants.The average salary for dolphin trainers varies from facility to facility. The salaries for entry-level positions can range between $18,000-$20,000. Many trainers have a second source of income to help them stay financially stable.
The more experience you have as a trainer, the higher your salary will be. A trainer with 8-12 years of experience can make $25,000-$40,000 a year. Many trainers stay in the profession out of a love for working with dolphins and the opportunity to form long lasting relationships with them.;
, As a trainer, your typical work day may include preparing the dolphin’s meals, feeding them, and cleaning their tanks. Dolphins need at least three meals a day: morning, midday, and afternoon.Trainers also need to give the animals all necessary vitamins and medications during your dolphin daily assessments (DDA). DDAs are done at the beginning of every work day to assess the dolphin’s entire body and their medical needs.
You will also need to stimulate the marine mammals physically and mentally through hands-on training sessions. As a trainer, you will need to be enthusiastic and energetic as you work with the dolphins to practice existing and new behaviors with the dolphins. You may observe and study the dolphins if you work in a research facility, or you may display the dolphin’s skills and behaviors to a crowd if you work at an entertainment center, like SeaWorld.

, Though every child that has been to a dolphin show may dream about being a dolphin trainer, in reality, it can be a demanding job. You will need to clean and maintain the large tanks where the dolphins live and you will need to work outside during hot summer months. Because you will be working with dynamic and highly intelligent animals, you will need to adapt your schedule to fit the dolphins’ needs, so you may be working irregular work hours. You may also need to work on holidays, as dolphins need to receive constant care.However, there are many pros to being a dolphin trainer, such as the long term relationship you get to build with dolphins and the opportunity to work closely with dolphins on a daily basis. You will also be able to work alongside a team of trainers and support each other as you teach and learn from the dolphins.

, To prepare early for your training career, you should try to do well in your biology classes in high school, as well as your math classes. If your high school offers any classes in animal science, you should enroll in them and try to get high grades in these classes.A strong background in science and math will help you succeed in your undergraduate degree as you pursue a training career.

, Though some entry-level dolphin training positions may accept a high school diploma, receiving more advanced training through an undergraduate degree can only improve your chances of landing a good position as a trainer.Many trainers have undergraduate degrees in biology, marine biology, psychology, or animal behavior/animal science. A four year degree in a life sciences related field will give you a good starting point in terms of the necessary expertise and knowledge to be an effective dolphin trainer.
There is a one-year program through the College of Marine Mammal Professions located in Florida that focuses on classroom and hands-on experience in dolphin training. There is also a two year program through Moorpark College in California that focuses on exotic animal training, including dolphin training. Taking an animal training specific program can lead to a higher success of employment. Keep in mind, however, that some facilities, like SeaWorld, prefer to see the perseverance it takes to get a bachelor's degree. , You should also get more experience with animals by volunteering or interning at your local zoo, aquarium, veterinarian clinic, wildlife rehabilitation center, or animal center. You can start doing this during your high school years or during your undergraduate degree.Getting first hand experience in a work environment can help you get a better sense of duties and responsibilities required when working with animals. This will give you a chance to determine if you have the patience, persistence, and dependability necessary to be a dolphin trainer. As well, volunteering or interning will also allow you to build relationships and contacts with individuals working in the field.
Keep in mind most interns are not allowed to have contact directly with the animals and are often allowed to only observe and assist, but not do any hands on work. If possible, look for volunteer programs that focus specifically on dolphin training, as this will be good practice as you pursue your career goals.

, In many dolphin training positions, you are expected to be a strong swimmer, as you will often be working with dolphins directly in the water. Strong snorkeling and SCUBA skills are also beneficial and can elevate you above other applicants.You can complete a basic scuba diver certification program or take additional courses to become a master scuba diver. Most programs are a combination of classroom learning, testing, and applied training with scuba equipment in a pool or an open water location. Some scuba programs also offer training in CPR and first aid, which can come in handy when you work in a marine mammal facility, with other trainers and with the public.
Many dolphin training facilities will give you a swim test as part of the hiring process and some facilities will only hire trainers that are SCUBA certified.

, As a dolphin trainer, you may be expected to educate the public about these animals and their behaviors. You should have strong public speaking skills and be comfortable talking in front of a crowd every day. Improving your public speaking skills will make you a more well rounded candidate to employers and ensure you are able to communicate well with people, as well as with dolphins.


Many specialized programs in dolphin training will offer public speaking courses as an option. You can also take a public speaking class at your local college or university to brush up on your skills.

, Physical fitness is an important component of being a trainer, as you will need to be fit enough to work in an aquatic environment every day. In addition to being a strong swimmer, you should also maintain an exercise routine that includes cardio and endurance training. As a trainer, you will need to be able to keep up with the daily demands of your role and not get easily tired or overwhelmed by the physical requirements of the role.


You may want to integrate swimming into your weekly workout routine, in addition to cardio and strength training. This will ensure you are at a constant level of fitness suitable for the role of dolphin trainer.

, As a member of an organization like the American Association of Zoo Keepers (AAZK) or the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (IMATA), you will be able to keep up to date with the field and network with your peers. You will also get access to current news and literature about animal training and continuing education workshops to improve your knowledge and expertise.An association is also a great opportunity for networking and connecting with other trainers and potential employers.

, Once you have the necessary education and hands on experience, you may start to apply for entry-level positions. Depending on your interests, you may apply at a research facility so you can interact and observe with dolphins for scientific studies. Or, you may apply at an entertainment facility where you display dolphin behaviors to a crowd and share information on dolphins with the public.Keep in mind entry-level positions can be competitive, so apply to several open positions at once. Make sure your resume and cover letter showcase your strong skill set, including your education, your volunteer and intern experience, and your strong swimming skills.

, Many volunteer programs and internships can lead to a full time position, so do not be afraid to use your existing contacts to your advantage. If you feel confident in your work through an internship or a volunteer program and there is an open position, let your supervisor know that you are strongly interested in working at the facility as a full time trainer., Once you land an entry-level position, you will start by shadowing more experienced trainers and go through an extensive training period before you can perform more in depth training with the dolphins. Watching and learning from a more senior training will allow to become more familiar with the personalities of each dolphin and learn different training procedures according to the needs of the dolphin.Once you have shadowed and done several weeks of training, you will then feed and interact with the dolphin under the supervision of the senior trainers. Over time, you will be taught how to communicate with the dolphins through hand signals.
As you become more senior as a dolphin trainer, you can train the dolphins in new behaviors and facilitate public interaction with the dolphins. The speed of your career as a dolphin trainer depends on your past experience, your level of comfort with dolphins, and your level of confidence in your knowledge and skills as a trainer.

Consider advancing in your career in other ways.",How to Become a Veterinary Technician," Though there is always room for improvement and you can go on to develop the qualities necessary for being a veterinary technician, if you already possess the qualities you need to excel at the job, then you have an advantage. Here are some qualities that you should posses:Communication skills. On the job, you will spend a lot of time communicating with your supervisor, with animal owners (who can sometimes be quite upset), as well as other staff. You may also counsel pet owners on how to train and take care of their pets, so you'll need to be able to communicate clearly while putting people at ease.
Compassion. You may be dealing with some sick pets and their worried owners, and you'll need to have empathy and to understand where they are coming from.
Attention to detail. You have to be extremely precise when you record information, administer medication to pets, and perform diagnostic tests.
Dexterity. You'll have to handle animals of various sizes, medical instruments, and laboratory equipment with great care. You'll also perform a variety of tasks that require you to be extremely dexterous, such as giving anesthesia to animals, taking x-rays, and doing dental work.
Problem-solving skills. You'll need to have enough knowledge and the ability to think outside the box to identify injuries and illnesses and to know how to properly treat your patients.;
, Though it's great if you love cuddling cute kittens, that's not what this job will look like. To be a veterinary technician, you'll have to be able to handle the unpleasant side of the job, which can include getting bitten, scratched, or otherwise injured by pets.Remember that many of these cuddly creatures want to see you just as badly as you wanted to see the dentist when you were a little kid.You should love animals, but not so much that you would not be able to act calm and professional when you have to euthanize seriously ill animals.
You should also be strong enough to not get too upset when you see animals who have been abused, which will happen.

, Some programs may require you to have some college-level course experience in certain relevant classes, such as chemistry, biology, microbiology, or even the humanities, before you can apply. If this is true of the program where you want to enroll, then you should look in to taking these courses at a local community college.Courses involving math or science can be crucial for your training because veterinary technicians frequently determine dosages, measure out medication and alert pet owners to any side effects or drug interactions. If you haven't taken college-level courses in those subjects, the school may require you to complete those first.
You can also take courses in math, biology, and other sciences in high school to get ahead of the game.
Another option to enrolling in a veterinary technician program is to enter a U.S. university that offers a four-year bachelor's degree in veterinary technology. There are fifteen of these programs in the country. This is a great option for those who want to work in research laboratories.
You can also volunteer in a setting that involves animals, such as an animal shelter, if you want to decide whether this profession is right for you.

, Veterinary technician education ranges from short-term certification programs to two-year associates degrees to four-year degrees in veterinary technology. Whatever program you enroll in, make sure that it is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). As of 2013, there are 217 of these programs.There are eight schools that offer distance learning programs accredited by the AVMA. These programs meet the same accreditation standards as traditional programs. If you enroll in a distance learning program, you'll also need to complete hands-on training at a local veterinary facility.
You can also decide to be a veterinary technologist, which is a more advanced degree. You'll typically have to get four years of training and then will primarily work in a lab setting.

, Similar to an internship, hands-on training in a veterinary hospital is a requirement in veterinary technician training programs. It's called the clinical component or preceptorship, and during this time the student acts as an apprentice to the veterinarian, assisting in everything from taking temperatures to drawing blood to participating in procedures such as dental cleanings.This is a crucial component of the program, and it can help you really see what it would be like to work with animals full-time.

, After you've completed your academic studies and the clinical component, you'll need to take a credentialing exam. Every state requires a certification exam that includes written, oral and hands-on components, and many states use the National Veterinary Technical Exam. Look into your state's requirements to see what is necessary for becoming a veterinary technologist in the place where you want to work.Here are some other things to keep in mind as you get certified:


If you are a technologist who wants to work in a research facility, then the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) provides three different levels of certification. You can be certified to be an Assistant Laboratory Animal Technician (ALAT), a Laboratory Animal Technician (LAT), or a Laboratory Animal Technologist (LATG).

Though you don't have to be certified in additional fields, if this is the path you want to take, you can also develop a level of expertise in skills like health and welfare, husbandry, and facility administration and management after working in a laboratory animal facility and pass the additional AALAS exams.



, After you graduate, seek part-time or full-time employment at a veterinary clinic. You can search your local wanted ads, contact veterinary facilities directly or use your college's career placement office. The school may already know of veterinary hospitals who hire recent graduates. Whether you completed a certification or degree program, the school may be willing to recommend you for a position, and can advise you on how to become a veterinary technician at the type of facility you'd like to work.Most veterinary technicians work in private clinical practices, while aiding a licensed veterinarian.
Most veterinary technologists work in research-heavy positions, typically in a lab.

, As you begin the daily grind, you will have to encounter a variety of situations that involve caring for and treating animals. As you become more comfortable in your field, you will become even more skilled at the work you do. Here are some things you will have to do on the job:Observe the condition and behavior of the animals
Performing the first physical exam
Assisting in surgery
Gather and record the animals' case histories
Prepare the animals and medical instruments for surgery
Take and develop x-rays
Perform tests in the lab, such as blood counts and urinalyses
Give anesthesia to animals and monitor their responses
Provide emergency first aid and nursing care to recovering or hurt animals
Euthanize seriously ill animals

, Veterinary technicians often have to work long hours, nights, and an erratic or overwhelming schedule. Some animal clinics operate 24 hours a day, and they need people to be staffed during all hours of the night. Though you may be able to have a more flexible schedule as you gain experience and authority, be prepared to work a lot.


You should also maintain the strength you'll need to lift and restrain heavy animals, as well as the endurance necessary for standing on your feet for long stretches of time.

, If you think you've found your passion within your field, then you can take your knowledge to the next level by specializing in a clinical area of interest such as clinical pathology, surgery, dentistry, anesthetics, emergency and critical care, behavior, zoo keeping, avian medicine, or nutrition. This does take extra effort and training, but it will be worth it.To specialize in critical care and emergency veterinary medicine, for example, you'll need to get certified through the Academy of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Technicians. For this certification, you'll need a general veterinary technician certification, 3 years experience working in emergency and critical care medicine and 25 hours continuing education in veterinary emergency and critical care.

, You don't have to stop at specialization. If you've been excelling as a veterinary technician or technologist for a while, then you can get a promotion and become a supervisor to junior technicians. If you really love your job, you can even become a veterinarian. Vet school is extremely competitive, and having the background and work experience of a veterinary technician will give you a huge edge in the application process.

Search at night or on rainy days.",How to Find Salamanders1," Travel to a geographical region where salamanders generally reside. One-third of all salamander species can be found in North America, specifically in the Appalachian Mountains region. Salamanders also reside throughout Central America, South America, Asia, and Europe., There are over 700 different species of salamanders in the world, and they all come in a variety of sizes and colors. Salamanders have long, smooth bodies and four limbs, and they can be a small as 2 inches long, while others can grow to 4 feet long!Some species of salamanders are brightly colored, which can indicate that they are poisonous.The hellbender is a type of large salamander found in North America, which can grow up to 2.5 feet in length!Northern red salamanders are typically found in Maryland and live in natural springs. They are a bright, beautiful red with black flecks.Some salamanders, such as the axolotl or the Mexican salamander, are pale pink or white. These types of salamanders live underground and are rarely exposed to sunlight., Most salamanders live underground but will move out of dormancy in the spring to breed in vernal pools, which are shallow depressions in the ground that contain water during this time of year. This is the best time of year to search for these critters in the wild.

, Locations near wetlands, streams, rivers, ponds, marshes, and swamps are ideal locations for salamanders to make their home.Most salamanders have a long larval stage and spend most of their early life in the water, much like frogs do.These moist environments are ideal for catching a glimpse of these animals in the wild.

, Edge environments, or eco tones, describe areas where two different habitats meet.Salamanders can often be found in these environments, so be sure to look near the shorelines of streams or near shrubs and bushes near shallow water.Salamanders may also be found around seeps, which are areas where ground water slowly moves toward the surface.Keep an eye out for springs, seeps, and other boggy areas where these amphibians often make their home., Salamanders are carnivorous and eat a variety of insects and worms. In the wild, a salamander will eat crickets, worms, larvae, spiders, slugs—pretty much anything that it can easily swallow! If you know where to find their favorite meals, you may have a greater chance of spotting a salamander scurrying about.Many of the insects in the salamander's diet can be found under logs, rocks, and branches, so you may spot a salamander lurking around these areas.
Larger salamanders will often eat frogs and smaller salamanders, while aquatic salamanders will eat small fish, crayfish, and other small aquatic creatures.If you come across a pool of still moving water with lots of rocks and tree roots, take a closer look! Crayfish are often found there, so your chances of spotting a salamander are greater., Make plans to search for salamanders at night or when the weather is overcast and rainy. Salamanders are nocturnal and can usually be found at night; however, they may also venture out during daytime hours when it is cloudy or raining."

Buy food for the tiger salamander.,
Take your salamander and dangle the insect near your tiger's nose.,
Consider having your salamander ""hunt"" in its habitat.,
Remove leftovers.",How to Feed a Tiger Salamander," Tiger salamanders eat insects only, occasionally pinky mice (recommended for larger salamanders only, and also as a treat. Pinky mice can make your tiger obese and it can get sick). Crickets or mealworms are good staple foods. Tiger salamanders can also eat earth worms, dubia roaches, and wax worms.

Gut-loading crickets a day or two before feeding the salamander(s) will pass down the nutrients.
Dusting the insect with reptile/amphibian calcium will help.;
, You can use your hands or tweezers/tongs. The salamander will either quickly use its tongue to get the food into its mouth or it will lunge forward and bite it. 

If the salamander bites down on your finger/tweezers/tongs do not try to throw/fling it off, or try to pull! You can injure your salamander!!

, If you're letting your salamander hunt its food on its own, don't try to help it. Just make sure your tiger does not eat a rock, moss, or dirt along with its food. Those can mess with its digestive system and could harm it., When your salamander has eaten the food, remove any left over food. If the salamander finds it later and eats it, it could be harmful to the salamander if bacteria has started to grow on the old food."

",How to House a Pet Axolotl,"


Ideal aquarium size is a minimum 20 gallons for one and an additional 10 gallons for each additional Axolotl. Floor space is more important that height.
Lids are a must-have, as axolotl are known to jump out of their tanks.
A light is not needed, as axolotls are nocturnal. Bright lights or heat lamps can stress them out.;
,


Technically, a filter is not required in an axolotl tank. However, as axolotls produce large amounts of waste and ammonia, the water needs to be changed quite frequently (which can be stressful to sensitive axolotls).
As for filter options, owners can choose between under-the-gravel, internal power, external power, and canister types. Canister types are the best, but most expensive. The best option for a new owner is probably the exterior power, or ""fish-tank filter.
Axolotls are sensitive to water flow, and are stressed by excess water-flow. If you can't get a spray bar, block the water flow with plants or other decorations.

,


Though some owners leave the bottom of their axolotl tanks bare to make cleaning easier, axolotls find it difficult to grip the glass bottom. This can stress out the axolotls.
Axolotls have a nasty habit of swallowing gravel. This causes them to choke and die. If you must go with gravel, select rocks larger than their heads.
Another popular option is fine sand. The sand can pass through their digestive tracks safely, and still allows them to grip.

,


Be sure to provide axolotls with hiding spots, such as flower pots or caves. Axolotls can be extremely shy, and stress easily., especially in new environments.
Provide a few soft and smooth plants for the axolotls to rest on.

, Be prepared to spend the time to prepare the ecosystem for your axolotls). It can take one to six weeks (depending on your method), but properly cycling the aquarium is vital in order to ensure your axolotls' health.
For small, one to two axolotl aquariums, simply fill the tank with de-chlorinated water and let it sit for one to two weeks. It's best to acquire ammonia, pH, nitrite, and nitrate test kits to test the levels as you go. This ensure the healthiest environment possible for your axolotl.
For large aquarium with many axolotls and/or other animals, be sure to slowly add in the animals, (a few every 2 or 3 weeks) to allow the tank build up the proper levels for the increasing number of residents.

, As for the arrangement of the decorations, most of it is up to you.


Placing plants under the filter can help to diminish the water-current. However, they will gather algae quicker.
Keep in mind that axolotls spend most of their time resting on the bottom of their tank.
Be sure the set-up provides plenty of easily accessible places for your axolotl to hide from you and any unwanted light.

,,, Take your time with this step, as it gives your axolotl time to adjust to the new temperature and bacteria levels.

,,


Leave the lights off.
Don't try to interact with your axolotl for a bit, however tempting.
Keep an eye on your new pet to make sure they stay healthy.

Use an aquarium or tank to house your salamander.,
Make sure you have a tight-fitting lid.,
Determine if your sal needs an aquatic, semi-aquatic, or terrestrial home.,
Setup your tank.,
Provide your terrestrial salamander with a water bowl.,
Add some hiding places.,
Clean the cage weekly.,
Use a broad-spectrum light for your sal.,
Give your sal the temperature they want.,
Provide your salamander with filtered water.,
Do not handle your salamander.,
Allow your salamander to hibernate.,
Know that salamanders are nocturnal.,
Feed your salamander two to three times a week.,
Provide your salamander with a well-balanced meal.,
Monitor the amount your salamander eats.,
Remove uneaten food from your salamanders home.",How to Care for Salamanders," Aquariums or reptile tanks are the best way to house your dear sal. You should use a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank, as this will provide enough room for your sal to hide, dig, and doze his days away. Aquariums tanks are best used for aquatic and semi-aquatic salamanders. Make sure you clean your tank before you create your salamander’s home.You can also use plastic or acrylic tanks if you do not want to purchase a glass tank.;
, Salamanders are excellent climbers--they will make quick work of the sides of 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank. Because of this, it is important to have a lid that fits tightly on your tank so that your salamander cannot escape. Screen lids are best, as they provide your salamander with excellent ventilation.


If you cannot purchase a screen top, a hood top will also work.

, This will depend on the type of salamander you have or are going to purchase. If you are not sure what your salamander prefers, ask your pet shop or run an online search.Aquatic salamanders, like the Axolotl, spend their whole lives in the water.
Semi-aquatic salamanders should have a tank that is half water, half land.
Terrestrial salamanders should not have a water area in their tank.

, Again this will depend on the kind of salamander you have. Remember, the substeps listed here are just rough guidelines--you can be as creative as you like with your tanks.Aquatic tank: You should use an aquarium to house your sal in. Layer the bottom of the tank with two inches of washed aquarium gravel. Gradually slope the tank so that the layered gravel goes from two inches to three inches deep. Plant some aquatic plants but know that you will have to replace them every so often because salamanders can be rough on aquatic plants.
Semi-aquatic tank: Divide your tank with a half sheet of plexiglass so that one side is aquatic, and one side is terrestrial. Lay two inches of aquarium gravel on the aquatic side, along with some aquatic plants. Create a sloping gradient with the gravel so that the salamander can walk from the water to the land. On the land side, place two inches of aquarium gravel, then top it with substrate (ground covering). This substrate should be mulch-like soil like shredded bark or coconut fiber. Top this with sterile potting soil or garden loam.
Terrestrial tank: Do the same as the land side of the semi-aquatic tank, only throughout the whole tank. Add plants, moss and a log

, You will want to keep this dish relatively small and shallow, as terrestrial salamanders tend to not be very good swimmers, and some could even drown in a deep water bowl.

, No matter what type of salamander you have, you should provide them with some good hiding places. Salamanders can get pretty stressed out, so it is good for them to have some locations to relax in. Rock caves, large shards of pottery, large pieces of bark, and store-bought ‘hiding spots’ will make your sal very happy.], Take out the sal in gloved hands and put him in a secure place while you're cleaning so you don't hurt your sal. Then scrub the tank and furnishings with hot water and dry before putting your sal back in., Do not put your salamander’s tank in direct sunlight, as the sunlight can heat the tank up too much. Use an appliance timer to switch the light on and off according to the natural light found in your salamander’s native environment. This means making the ‘days’ and ‘nights’ longer or shorter based on what season you are in so your sal can live like it would out in the wild., The temperature you set up will depend on the type of sal you have. Salamanders from temperate climates, like the tiger salamander, will not need any form of heating. Sals from tropical and semi-tropical locales will need heat. Ask your pet store or run an internet search on what temperatures your sal should be exposed to. Always provide a temperature gradient--one side of the tank should be warmer than the other side. To give them the heat they like use one of the following:


Aquarium water heater: These are submersible heaters that will warm the temperature of the water and increase the humidity in the tank.
Heating pad: This can be placed under one side of the tank.
Heat lamp: You should monitor these because they may kill the plants in your tank. You will also have to regulate how hot the heat lamp makes the tank.

, You will have to regularly filter your salamander’s water. You can purchase a recirculating water filter, or set up your filter in some other way.Give your terrestrial salamanders filtered water. You can give them tap water that has been treated to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can also use bottled spring water.

, Despite the fact that their cute little faces might inspire you to want to pick them up, you should try to avoid handling your salamander. The oils on human hands can actually make salamanders sick. In turn, salamanders can also carry or make secretions that can make people sick. So, it is best for everyone involved if you simply watch your sal, rather than handle them.If you do have to handle a sal, like when picking one out or if yours is injured, wash your hands with very hot, soapy water. Take care to rinse off all of the soap.

, Sals from cooler climates bury themselves underground for the winter months. While it may be a bummer to have an ‘empty’ tank sitting around, if salamanders don’t hibernate, they generally die at a younger age., Because of this fact, it is best to feed salamanders at night, when they are most active. Set an alarm for yourself when you first bring your salamander home, or else you might forget to feed him at night., Keep in mind that your salamander might not eat during the first few days that he is in his new home. Salamanders get nervously easily and when they are introduced to a new environment, they tend to take a few days to adjust to his new surroundings. Other salamanders, however, will cozy right up to their new home and will eat heartily on day one.


If you bought a juvenile salamander, you should feed them daily until they stop growing and mature into an adult.

, Salamanders are carnivores--they like to hunt their prey. Because of this preference, you will need to feed your salamander live prey. If you have to purchase dead prey, frozen prey is better than dry prey. Salamanders love:


Live earthworms, nightcrawlers (from a bait shop), bloodworms and crickets (which can be purchased at pet stores), live waxworms, live slugs, live white worms and tubifex worms.They will also eat frozen bloodworms, though you may have to move the bloodworm around to catch your salamanders attention.
Give your aquatic salamanders brine shrimp. You can also feed them Daphnia and water fleas.

, In general, salamanders will simply stop eating when they are full. The amount you feed your salamander really depends on him. During the first couple of days that you feed them, provide him with a set amount of prey (you choose the number) and then check back on them in the next couple of hours. If there are any worms or crickets left, you will know that your salamander doesn’t need that much food.Note that fire salamanders and tiger salamanders can become obese if overfed.

, If your salamander has not eaten all of their food in the couple of hours after you feed them, it means that they are full. Remove the live prey that is still in his home--if you do not, the live prey could try to bite or irritate your salamander.


If you have an aquatic species of salamander, always remember to clean out uneaten food from his water or else you run the risk of dirtying the water or causing mold to grow.

Feed land-dwelling salamanders bugs.,
Feed aquatic salamanders water organisms.,
Choose appropriately-sized food.,
Feed the salamander live foods.,
Avoid wild caught food.,
Avoid meat and vegetables.",How to Feed a Salamander1," Salamanders who live on land thrive off of a diet of worms and bugs. You don’t have to go out into your yard and search for these bugs, though. This salamander food can be found at most pet stores.For example, though you might find it gross, your salamander will enjoy eating crickets, earthworms, meal worms, maggots, buffalo worms, and mosquito larvae. This sort of food provides plenty of nutrition for your salamander.;
, Regular bugs just won’t cut it for a water-dwelling salamander. They eat things that swim around in the water, like shrimp. You can also get these foods at a pet store. You may also be able to purchase them at tackle shops.Brine shrimp is the most common food for an aquatic salamander. They also enjoy small fish like minnows, other types of shrimp like ghost shrimp and crayfish, nightcrawlers, and worms like earthworms and blackworms.

, If you have a small species of salamander, you should feed them smaller bugs. Their mouths are too small to eat large bugs. Go for small foods, like fruit flies, small grubs, small crickets, and worms cut into smaller pieces.Avoid feeding small salamanders large bugs. Only feed larger bugs to larger salamanders.

, Most salamanders prefer to hunt for live food instead of eating dead food. This means you should feed your salamander live worms, bugs, and shrimp instead of dead ones.Fire salamanders are a unique species and do like dead food, so you can feed them chopped up bits of worms. They can even be fed from trays., Some people will go outside and get bugs to feed their salamander. However, this can pose risks for your salamander. The bugs you catch may have diseases or have been exposed to chemicals.Get your food from pet stores, bait shops, and dealers who sell live food.

, When in doubt with what to feed your pet salamander, think like a salamander. Any kind of meat, like red meat or poultry, vegetables, or fruit cannot be digested by them.

Only choose foods that you can find in their natural habitats. All bugs and small invertebrates make yummy meals for your salamander.

Look under logs, rocks, and piles of leaves.,
Slowly lift debris.,
Return the debris.",How to Find Salamanders2," Search for debris on the ground near wetlands and pools of water. Rocks, fallen logs, branches, and piles of leaves make ideal hiding places. Salamanders must keep their skin moist in order to breathe and hide under these types of objects to shelter themselves from direct sunlight., Slowly flip over pieces of ground debris to find salamanders. Slow, gentle movements may prevent salamanders from becoming alarmed and scurrying away quickly to find another hiding place. Being careful while lifting the debris will help protect other living organisms that may have made their home there.

, Always return ground debris to its original position. Any major disruption to rocks, logs, and other debris could alter the humidity levels, the safety of a salamander’s habitat, and the safety of other living creatures in the area."
"
Don’t spend too much time in one area.,
Stay away from breeding pools.,
Don’t handle the salamanders.",How to Find Salamanders3," Looking for salamanders in the wild can be a lot of fun, but be sure you don’t stay in one place too long. Disturbing leaves and logs and trampling through the grasses in a concentrated area can cause habitat degeneration and may upset the salamander breeding populations., If you stumble upon a salamander breeding pool, avoid disturbing it. Watch from a distance so that you do not harm the salamanders or their eggs., If it isn’t necessary to handle a salamander, opt not to. The oils on human skin can be toxic to salamanders, and the salt and heat from human hands can be harmful to them."
"
Feed salamanders a few times a week.,
Give enough food for one sitting.,
Sprinkle the food with supplements each week.,
Vary the diet.,
Remove uneaten food.,
Keep salamanders hydrated.",How to Feed a Salamander2," You don’t have to feed salamanders every day. Many adult salamanders can be fed two to three times each week.You can look up your particular species of salamander to determine exactly how many times each week they should be fed.

, Salamanders should have just enough food that they can eat in one sitting. Roughly, they should be able to eat this food in 15 to 20 minutes.Watch your salamander to figure out how much they can eat in that time period. After a few feedings, you will figure out how much to feed them.If your salamander starts to get fat, you can feed them less. If they are leaving food, feed less next time.

, You can help keep your salamander healthy and looking great by giving them supplements in their food. They should have a calcium supplement every time you feed them, and a multi-vitamin once or twice each week.You can buy these supplements at pet stores or online.

, Salamanders don’t need to eat the same thing every time they are fed. In the wild, they would have access to many types of bugs and invertebrates. Keep your salamander healthy by feeding them a varied diet filled with many different kinds of foods., Never leave food that the salamander didn’t eat for later. It won’t have a midnight snack. Instead, remove all live bugs from the vivarium. Bugs left in the tank can bite or cause irritation to your salamander.If your salamander has an aquatic vivarium, you should remove all the leftover food from the water. This can lead to bacteria and contamination of the water.

, Salamanders don’t drink water the way other pets do. They are amphibians, which means they soak water into their bodies through the skin. They get this water from pools in their vivarium.Keep the substrate on the bottom of the tank hydrated. It should have pools of water along the bottom but not be completely drenched.
Use a spray bottle to rehydrate the substrate. Make sure to use water that does not have chlorine in it. Use bottled water or tap water that has been left to air out overnight. You can also buy water conditioner at pet stores.

Feed a reluctant salamander by hand.,
Feed it daily for a while if you bought it at a pet shop.,
Adjust the salamander’s feeding schedule if needed.",How to Feed a Salamander3," If your salamander isn’t eating, you should try feeding it yourself. You can put the live bug on a toothpick or pick it up with tweezers. Hold the bug steady above the salamander and wait for the salamander to eat it.Salamanders may not eat when you first get them. They may also be resistant to new foods. Try hand-feeding them before changing foods or consulting a vet.

, Salamanders that are purchased from a pet shop are usually underfed and skinny. This means that you should feed them daily until your salamander adjusts to living in their new environment and puts on some healthy weight., There may be reasons why your salamander needs to be fed more or less. For example, they usually need more food in the summer and less in the winter. That means that the two to three times a week guideline may need to be adjusted.Juvenile salamanders need to be fed more often. If your salamander is too skinny, you may want to feed it more often.

"
Purchase an aquarium.,
Create a proper water/land split in your tank.,
Line the bottom of your aquarium with large gravel.,
Prepare a burrowing substrate, if you want.,
Ensure that you have enough water.,
Fill your aquarium with plants.,
Recruit your newts.,
Learn about your newt.,
Handle your newt with caution.,
Monitor your water quality.,
Clean your habitat.,
Maintain a proper temperature in your newt’s aquarium.,
Feed your newt properly.,
Avoid housing your newts with other animals.",How to Care for Fire Belly Newts," Your aquarium will house the environment that your newt will live in. There are several things you should consider when getting an aquarium, including the size and the number of newts you will house.


Don’t use anything smaller than a 10-gallon aquarium.
It is highly recommended that you house 2 newts together.
You can safely house 4 newts together in a 20-gallon aquarium.
The larger your aquarium, the happier your newts will be.;
, Fire-bellied newts are semi-aquatic and require both land and water in their habitat. Make sure that you create a proper environment that includes both in order for your newt(s) to thrive.


The area in your tank should consist of 70% water and 30% land.
One option is to divide up your tank and build your habitat by creating a partition so that 70% of the surface is water and 30% is land. If you have a partition, make sure you have a ramp so your newts can climb onto the land.
Another option is to slope your land (gravel or other matter) into the water so that the newts can climb onto the land via the slope.
Another option is to have 100% water but make sure that 30% of the surface is covered by floating islands and other structures that your newts can rest on., Gravel is a great material to line the bottom of your aquarium. Round gravel will help simulate round rocks found in rivers and creeks in the newt’s native environment. But there are also other reasons to use gravel:


It will keep your sediment down and help promote clarity in your water.
Large gravel will be too big for your newt to accidentally eat.
When wet, gravel is slick and your newt won’t be able to cut or injure itself on it.

, Burrowing substrate is ground material that will enable your newt to burrow within the land just as they would do in the wild. Allowing your newt to live like it would in the wild is extremely important in maintaining your newt’s health and happiness. Consider:


Putting your substrate atop large gravel if you are dividing your tank or if you are creating a slope for the newt to crawl from the water to the land portion
Common materials might include peat moss, sphagnum moss, coco husk, orchid bark chips and more. Consult your local pet stores for ideas or for a pre-mixed bag of substrate.
Do not use regular soil.
Make sure any material you do use does not include any chemical additives or fertilizers., Since newts are semi-aquatic, the water portion of your aquarium will be where they spend a lot of their time. You need to make sure that you have enough water for your newts to make sure they stay healthy and fit.


Your water should be at least 10 inches deep (35 centimeters)
Water should be at least 70% of the surface area of your tank.
Your newt should have plenty of room to move around under the water., Your newts need a nice environment that simulates the environment they’d have in the wild. To do this, you need to populate your aquarium with plants. Consider:


Terrestrial plants like ferns, mosses, and bamboo.
Aquatic plants like Egeria and Amazon Sword.
Other plants native to the newt’s native environment.
You can also use fake plants as a substitute for real plants., There are two types of common fire-bellied newts, the Japanese newt, and the Chinese newt. The newts are very similar but differ somewhat.


Pick one species of newt. Try not to mix and match.
The Japanese newt is somewhat larger (3.5 inches to 5 inches in length at maturity), whereas the Chinese newt is a little smaller (3 inches to 4 inches at maturity).
The Japanese newt has a speckled red-orange pattern on its belly, whereas the Chinese newt’s belly is more of an orange color.
The Japanese newt has a rough or bumpy texture to its skin, whereas the Chinese newt has a smooth texture to its skin.
The Chinese newt’s tail is round at the end., Fire Belly newts are really cool animals, but you should get to know a little bit about them before you make a big commitment. The good thing about them is that they’re relatively easy to take care of, as long as you maintain their environment regularly and follow simple directions. Make sure to consider that:


Newts can live up to 30 years.
The typical newt will live up to 10 years. Be prepared for a commitment. You shouldn’t flush your newt or release him in your backyard when you’re done with him. He’ll probably die.
The most common fire belly newts are the Japanese or Chinese varieties. The Chinese newt is much more commonly found in pet stores., There are a number of reasons you need to handle your newt with caution. Improperly handling your newt could harm the newt or potentially cause you problems yourself. Consider:


Newts are relatively fragile, if you handle them improperly, you could hurt them.
Newts have poison glands on the side of their head. If you get some of this poison on your hands, it is likely to irritate your skin.
Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling your newt. You don’t want to contaminate the newt with chemicals or yourself with the poison from its poison glands. , Clean water is essential for your newts’ health and a prolonged life. As a result, changing your water and monitoring your water is perhaps the most time-consuming aspect of owning your newt. Experts highly recommend that newt owners invest in a water filter to make sure the water quality stays consistently high.


Only use dechlorinated or spring water. Avoid chlorinated water or water with other chemicals at all costs.
If you don’t have a filter, you’ll have to change your water every day.
If you do have a filter, you’ll have to change and/or add a third of water every week.
If you can’t tend to the water as prescribed, you should consider a different pet. , Aside from water cleaning and filtration, you need to clean your aquarium regularly to make sure your newt’s habitat is healthy and functioning. A clean and well-maintained habitat is key to your newt’s health and longevity.


Clean every two weeks or so.
Take out your newts and temporarily house them elsewhere while you are cleaning.
Remove all water, plants, rocks, any anything other than the gravel and substrate.
Sterilize fake rocks, fake plants, and other plastic aquarium monuments with reptile friendly sterilizing solution. Consult your local pet store for this solution. Make sure to read the directions carefully.
Refill with clean water and replace everything you’ve taken out.

, Newts need to have a specific set of environmental factors to thrive, the most important being temperature (next to having a moist environment). You need to maintain a relatively stable temperature range for your newt to thrive as it would in the wild. Consider:


The temperature in your aquarium should be no higher than 68 °F (20 °C). Avoid temps cooler than the low-50s. Monitor this often.
Higher temperatures will stress your newt and cause discomfort or death.
Keep your aquarium out of direct sunlight and consider storing it in the basement where it’s usually cooler., You’ll have to feed your newt a proper diet. You can give your newt either live or frozen food. Newts don’t have to eat every day, either. You can feed them every other day. There are a number of readily available food sources:


Earthworms.
Bloodworms.
Crickets.
Chop your newt’s food up to make it easier on them., You might be tempted to cohabitate your newts with other animals. However, before you do this, you need to check with your local pet store. Because your newts secrete a poison, they might harm other animals or poison the water for fish. At the same time, larger reptiles or fish might kill or injure your newt."

Take the animal to help.",How to Save an Animal That's Been Hit by a Car," If you are in the middle of the road looking for the animal, you are in an area that is not safe. This is especially true if it's dark. Other vehicles may not see you and you can run the risk of getting hurt yourself. You should always be alert for other vehicles and assume they can't see you.


Make sure you assess the condition of the road and listen out for oncoming cars. If it is a busy road, be extra careful.
If you hit an animal on a busy highway, expressway, or interstate, you should not stop and try to help. The risk to your personal well being is too great.;
, If it's dark, you need to get a flashlight or other source of light. This will help you see where the animal is as well as help you be seen by others. You should also put on your vehicle's hazard warning lights to alert other drivers to your presence. Even if it happens during the day, put on your hazard warning lights to alert other drivers that you are stopped.It may be helpful to leave the headlights on if they illuminate the injured animal. If they don't, turn them off so as not to drain the battery in your car.

, In most cases, where the animal is will be obvious. The animal is usually still in the road or by the roadside. However, some creatures, especially wild animals, will use the last of their strength to run and hide.


If you cannot see the creature, look for a trail of blood or recently flattened plants to see if you can spot him.
If the animal is a wolf, large deer, or other dangerous animal, you should not approach without assistance., It is possible that you hit a wild animal. Wild animals are likely to react with aggression at the best of times, but when injured they will be even more hostile. Before touching a wild animal, you need to prepare as fully as you can. If you have cell phone signal, call the nearest vet, the ASPCA, or a wildlife rehabilitator. You can find these numbers on the internet or by calling information.


They may be able to send someone to help. If they agree to do this, stay with the animal so that you can guide the rescuer to his exact location.
You should wait for their arrival if possible. The ASPCA or a wildlife rehabilitator will have special equipment for handling wild animals, such as leather gauntlets, special restraining devices, and cages.
If you hit a wild animal that is considered dangerous or is too big, such as a wolf, fox, bear, or large deer, do not approach the animal. You should always wait for help with these animals because you do not want to get yourself hurt. Professionals know how to deal with these types of animals.
Never deal with a hurt animal if emergency services are on the way. Just stay with the animal until they arrive., If the animal you find is overly aggressive, you should no approach it, even if you cannot get help. If the animal looks like he is shaking uncontrollably, a dropped jaw, or excessive or frothy, white saliva, you should not approach the animal either. These are signs that the animal may have rabies.If you have no way to call for help when you hit this type of animal, you should take note of your location and then drive to a place where you can call for help.

, If the animal is wild but there is no animal inspector or veterinarian available, you need to plan how you are going to safely pick the animal up and transport it. If the animal is small, you need to look for a box or suitable container in your car to transport him.


If he is large, you may need to fit him in the trunk. You may also need a large board or blanket so you can transport him.
You should look for gloves or other protective gear as well. Having all of these things together will help you when you get ready to transport the animal. Do not pick him up before you make sure you are ready to handle him., Domestic animals are used to people and you may be able to approach and calm the animal much easier than a wild animal. However, you should be very careful in either case. Animals in pain will snap and react with aggression, so be prepared for this and act accordingly.


You should follow the same size concerns as with a wild animal. Find a box or crate for a small animal. Look for a place to transport a large animal as well as a blanket or board.
You should also find protective gear for domestic animals as well. They can be vicious, especially when injured.If the domestic animal allows you to approach it, fashion an improvised muzzle if possible. This will eliminate the risk of the animal biting.

, Before you touch the animal and try to move him, you should observe him from a distance. Look to see if the animal breathing normally. This means he is taking one breath every three to four seconds. Also notice if he is trying to get up and if so, watch to see if you can tell if his legs are damaged.


If he doesn't try to get up, look for obvious injuries such as broken bones sticking through the skin, any excessive or noticeable bleeding, or the presence of gaping wounds., If you have decided that the animal needs immediate help and there is no emergency services on the way, you can approach the animal. As you approach the animal, you should move slowly and speak reassuringly to the animal. The animal will be scared and in pain, so calming tones will work best. Depending on the kind of animal or his size, you need to approach him in different ways.


For a small, cat-sized animal, use a blanket or a coat to throw over the animal. This should prevent the cat or other small animal from turning and biting or lashing out with claws while you help him.
You have a couple of different options for a dog. You should assume the dog will bite. You can throw the blanket over the dog's head, so his teeth are covered. What might work best, however, is to wrap a tie or a bandage around the dog's muzzle as a makeshift muzzle. Once the mouth is out of action, it is safer to examine the animal's injuries.No matter what method you use, make sure the animal can breath and you don't jostle him around too much. If you have to make a muzzle, make sure he has enough room left to pant and breath., The animal that you hit may go into shock. Animals can die from shock, even if they don't have physical injuries. Watch to see if he is panting, which is a sign of pain and shock. Other signs of shock include collapse, weakness, rapid breathing, pale gums, cold paws, slow capillary refill time, and lack of response to stimulus.


If you see the animal in shock, you may need to help him on site before you take him to get help. Only do this is you feel it is necessary to save the animal's life., By the roadside, the amount of help you can give against shock is limited. In practical terms, the best you can do is keep the animal warm and get to professional help as soon as possible. Animals in shock have cold extremities because their circulation is struggling. If it is safe to touch the animal, you need to feel the temperature of the animal's paws. If they feel cool to the touch, he is suffering from chills and you need to wrap him up.


For a domesticated animal with no obvious external injuries that need attention, cover the animal with a car rug, your coat, or a blanket. If the animal is small, wrap the coat right around the animal to insulate him from the ground.
Never give pain relief medication to the dog. His body, especially in shock, will not absorb the medication and the drug will sit in his gut. This can cause serious gastric ulceration which could be life threatening further down the line.
If the animal is bleeding or has an injury which need stabilizing, cover as much of the animal as you can. You should leave the bleeding area exposed for you to work on., If the wild animal seems dazed but has obvious external injuries, try to keep him warm while you wait for emergency services. Don't try to fix his wounds. If he is not recovering and remains dazed, his best chance of survival is being treated by a wildlife rehabilitation officer. If there is no help on the way, you need to transport the animal to the nearest facility.


If the animal is merely winded, he may try to get up after a few minutes and wander off. Do not try to stop him. His best bet for survival is to stay on his territory in the wild. He has a den out there and knows where the resources are. Removing him unnecessarily could make it difficult for him to slot back in when released., Traumatic injuries cause two types of blood loss, heavy bleeding from severed arteries or veins and slow seepage from scrapes and wounds. The wound pumping blood should be given priority over the slowly seeping injury. If a wound is dripping blood, you need to try to stem the blood flow. First, apply pressure using a pad of cotton material applied directly over the area. Press down with sufficient pressure to prevent blood seeping through the cotton.


If after 5 minutes you remove the pad and the blood starts pumping out again, repeat the pressure for another 5 minutes. Sometimes reapplying pressure is all it takes., If reapplying pressure doesn't work, you need to make a pressure bandage. A pressure bandage is another way of applying pressure and can be enough to stop the bleeding while you transport the animal. For a pressure bandage, make a cotton pad and hold it over the wound. Next, take a bandage or a cotton garment cut into strips and wind it around the area and the pad to hold it firmly in place.


Apply firm tension onto the bandage as you wind it round so that finished dressing feels firm when you squeeze it. You should not be able to worm a finger between the bandage and the skin.
These bandages can run the risk of impairing circulation to a limb if left in place for hours, but are acceptable if the animal may suffer potentially fatal blood loss otherwise. You should go directly to professional help after applying this type of bandage., If there is blood spurting out, the animal may have an arterial bleed. This is very serious and you may need to make a tourniquet. To apply a tourniquet, take a shoelace or tie and tie it around the limb so it lies between the bleed and the heart. Tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops. Be aware this has also cut off the blood supply to the rest of the limb so make haste to professional assistance.


Only do this if it is essential and you suspect the animal may otherwise die from blood loss. Tourniquet use is controversial because there is a risk of the tourniquet cutting off the circulation, which potentially may cause the loss of the limb. You can reduce this risk by loosening the tourniquet every 10 minutes, which allows blood back into the rest of the limb.
If you have someone with you, have her drive while you keep pressure applied to the tourniquet., A slowly seeping wound is an injury that is moist with blood but not actually dripping. In this case, it may not be necessary to do anything because this rate of blood loss is usually not dangerous. If necessary, collect a clean cotton cloth, such as a sterile swab from a first aid kit or a clean item of clothing. Form it into a pad and press it firmly over the area.


Maintain pressure for 3-5 minutes and then remove the pad. The bleeding should have stopped. If it hasn't, either leave the wound and transport the animal to help or apply a pressure bandage over the area. , When you working with the animal's wounds, do not try to clean them while you are still on the side of the road. Grit or contamination needs thorough irrigation with copious amount of sterile saline to be effective. This can only be done at a veterinary clinic or an equipped wildlife rescue area.


You should not waste time after you access the bleeding and just get him to a clinic as soon as you can., If you notice or suspect that the animal is suffering from a broken bone, do not try to straighten broken limbs or push exposed bones back under the skin. You will cause unimaginable pain to the animal, which will worsen his shock and could kill him. If the limb is very floppy, gently support it by placing your hand beneath the limb to take its weight as you lift the animal.


If bones are exposed and you have a first aid kit, lay a sterile swab over the exposed bone to try to decrease contamination. Lift the animal as you support the limb's weight and put the animal into your vehicle.
You should not dress or bandage a limb by the roadside unless it is severely bleeding. The bandage can press on the broken bones and cause more pain. Just get to help as soon as you can., If the small animal is already in a blanket, scoop him up while supporting the back and front end with your arms. If he isn't in a blanket or you need to move him to a cleaner or warmer material, you should lift the animal as gently as possible onto the blanket and then pick him up, supporting his back and head.


You want to jostle him as little as possible because you don't want to cause any more pain.
Never pick him up by the scruff and let the spine dangle perpendicular to the ground, especially if you think he has any bone injuries., A large animal is much harder to move than a small one, especially if you are by yourself. A board or large, study object works best for carrying large animals. If you don't have one, a blanket or a coat will work. Lay the board or blanket behind the animal and lift him onto the board. Cover him with a blanket or towel and have someone help you carry him to your car.


Do not roll the animal unless you absolutely have to. This can be extremely painful and cause more injury to the already wounded animal.
If the animal struggles and kicks, you may need to secure the blanket down so they cannot injure themselves further by struggling.
If you are alone, a blanket may be all that you can carry. Do the best you can in the situation that you are in and try to get to help as quickly as possible., It will be necessary to transport the injured animal to veterinary care, and to do this he has to be moved. Your aim is to do this as gently as possible, so you do not worsen any injuries or cause unnecessary pain. If the animal has a broken bone, make sure the animal lies with the damaged leg on top so his body weight is not resting on the injured limb.


If you suspect a spinal injury, handle the animal gently and try to support the back. You should also not move it too much or bend the back area. This can cause more injury and extreme pain., Once you have the animal safely in your car, you need to take it to the nearest veterinary hospital or wildlife rescue. If you do not have a way to find out this information, you need to drive somewhere that you can find out this information and then find the nearest place for emergency animal care possible.


If you are going to a vet's office, you should call ahead of time so they can expect your arrival.You should also call the wildlife rescue ahead of time and let them know the type of animal you are bringing in.

Set up the tank.,
Install a filter.,
Provide substrate.,
Set up the right lighting.,
Maintain the right heat.,
Feed your axolotl a proper diet.,
Change the water regularly.,
Separate young and old axolotls.,
Do not place other animals in an axolotl tank.,
Refrain from handling axolotls.",How to Care for an Axolotl," A 10-gallon tank can work for a single axolotl. However, bigger is generally better when it comes to an axolotl. Opt for the biggest tank you can fit into your home. A 20-gallon tank is a good size for an axolotl.Fill the aquarium with water completely, the way you would fill it for fish. Tap water is safe to use.
You should keep a lid on the aquarium at all times. Axolotls will sometimes jump out of their tanks.;
, You need a filtration system in place when caring for an axolotl. An external canister filer works best, which you can purchase at a local pet store.Any filter you install should have an spray bar or other outlet to control water flow. While axolotl's need some water flow, too much can cause them to stop eating.

, Substrate is material that lines the bottom of an aquarium. The bottom of an axolotl tank should be lined with large fish tank pebbles (larger than the axolotl's head) or fine sand (fine grain sand being the ideal substrate). Do not use small pellets or rough sand (such as blasting sand). An axolotl may accidentally ingest such substances., You do need to provide lighting for an axolotl the same way you would light a fish tank. Bright lighting may actually cause an axolotl to feel distressed, so opt for a plant lighting if you add a light at all. Axolotls do not need a lot of light to thrive, so lighting is usually so you can see the animal.Minimize how often you keep the light on. Lights can generate excess heat, which can be bad for an axolotl.

, Usually, you do not need a tank heater to keep an axolotl tank sufficiently warm. The proper temperature for an axolotl hovers between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 16 and 21 degrees Celsius). This is generally room temperature, so heating the tank should not be necessary.However, make sure to adjust the temperature of the room that contains the tank if you live in an area prone to extreme heat or cold. You may need to keep an air conditioner or heater in the room during some months.

, You can buy night-crawlers and frozen bloodworms at a local pet store. These should be the staple of your axolotl's diet. You can also provide frozen shrimp and bits of chicken for a treat. In general, avoid live food.Feed your axolotl every other day for half an hour. Provide the axolotl with as much food as it can eat in a half hour time frame., Once a week, remove 50 to 60% of the water from the tank. Then, replace it with fresh water. Tap water is safe to use if you have a filtration system in place., If your axolotls breed, you should remove the babies from the tank using a net and place them in a separate aquarium. Older axolotls may prey on younger ones, so it's not safe to keep axolotls of different ages in a tank together., Axolotl are best kept in their own tank, but occasionally can do well with another axolotl of a similar size and age. However, they will prey on other types of fish or marine life. In general, an axolotl tank should only contain axolotls., Axolotls are not people-friendly pets. They do not need human contact to be happy and, in fact, this may stress them out. Only handle an axolotl when necessary, such as removing babies from a tank. Axolotl also may nip if handled."

Compare prices at multiple shops. You will pay a higher price for newts from a more reputable source, but regardless you probably do not need to spend more than $30 for your newt.
Ask the pet shop, “How do you get your newts?” You want the store to know where your newt is from so that you can look into the supplier’s background and reputation. Newts live 6-10 years. If you find through reviews that your pet store sells newts that have a reputation for shorter lives, look elsewhere.;
, A number of places sell fire bellied newts through online shops. Look for a shop with humane shipping policies and guaranteed arrival.


Check the online provider’s shipping policy. Make sure they use a lined box that is especially made for shipping reptiles, as well as heating or cooling packs to ensure the newt’s safety.
Check to ensure that your provider will overnight or next-day ship the newt. Slower shipping may cause undue stress on the newts, impacting their health. Newts left too long without care may also die.
If shipping policy is not specified on the site, call or email the provider to ask, “How do you ship your newts?” Do not buy from a provider that does not use proper shipping equipment, or that will not ship overnight.

, Consider finding a seller through advertising amphibian magazines or local newspapers. You may also be able to connect with local sellers through community posting sites such as Craigslist.


Consider using local advertising as a means to rescue newts that are no longer wanted by their current owners.
Check with current owners to see if they are willing to include the newt habitat and care equipment for an additional fee. This is often an easy way to get a full habitat at a good price.

, If you are buying a newt online, ask for pictures and written verification of the newt’s condition. Otherwise, inspect the newt for:A bright orange underbelly
No visible cuts or abrasions on the skin
No fungi or films growing on the newt’s skin
No bubbling or bloating under the surface of the skin

, Cloudy eyes can be a sign of a sick newt. A healthy newt should have clear eyes that are black-brown in color.


Clouding and discoloration in the eyes are signs of a sick newt. Do not purchase a newt with clouded eyes, and return any that are shipped with signs of illness.

, You want a newt that is well-fed from the beginning. Avoid small, lethargic newts, as they may be at greater risk of disease and early death.


The average Chinese fire bellied newt is 2-4 inches long as an adult, and should look thick with its belly almost touching the floor.The average Japanese fire bellied newt can reach 4-6 inches as an adult, though young newts may be as small as 2 inches. Japanese newts are more slender but should still be as thick by their hind legs as they are near their head., You may notice signs of illness at the pet store, or during the first few days of having a newt. Talk to the pet store about their return policy to see if it covers animals that show signs of illness soon after purchase.Rapid weight loss, distressed breathing, lethargy, diarrhea, a bloated abdomen, and poor balance are all signs of illness in newts.

, Your newt is going to need a habitat as soon as it arrives. Use a glass or acrylic tank as a terrarium. Ten gallons is the minimum size you need for one newt. For more newts, you will need more space.


1-2 newts: 10 gallon (37.9 L)
3-5 newts: 20 gallon (75.7 L)

, Newts prefer a mostly aquatic habitat, with a small land area. Try smooth slate or gravel for the water area, and a land area with a moss or mulch-type soil.Plant the land area with decorative plants that have large, broad leaves, as well as stacked rocks for basking.
Fire bellied newts often appreciate underwater vegetation, as well.

, Newts need a consistent climate of 58-68°F or 14-20°C. Letting a newt get too hot or too cold could be damaging to its health.


Use heat lamps in cold climates to keep your newts warm.
If your newt habitat is getting too warm, air conditioning is often the best option. If that is not available, some newt owners have successfully cooled their pets using fans above the tank, or ice packs against the outer walls of the habitat.

, Newts need 10-12 hours of full spectrum UVA lighting a day. Purchase lamps and proper bulbs that fit over the edge of your terrarium.


You may be able to provide proper lighting and heating with the same bulb. Check packaging to see if your heat bulbs also offer UV.

, Purchase food at the same time as purchasing your newt. Live and packaged foods both provide good nutrition for your newt if used properly.Frozen mosquito larvae, canned snails, and freeze-dried shrimp are all regular staples in a domestic newt diet.
Adding live food, such as blackworms, bloodworms, earthworms, and crickets helps keep your newt’s diet balanced while hunting them keeps your newt active.

"
Make sure you have your newt's enclosure all set up before you head out to purchase one.,
Buy your newt.,
Take your newt straight home.,
Know how to handle your newt.,
Feeding your newt.,
Vary the amounts at first to see what works best.",How to Care for an Aquatic Newt," A ten gallon tank is a good choice; your newt will fit perfectly in it as an adult. The species usually found in pet stores, Cynops pyrrhogaster, will max out at about 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) so you will not need to upgrade to a larger size enclosure.
,

The ideal ratio of water to land is three to one. Your newt will need enough land area to completely come out onto. You can slope rocks up towards one edge to create an island or place a large rock in. you need to make sure it is not so slippery as newts sometimes have trouble climbing.
You do not need a heater- most newts prefer cooler water (50-70F)but do not keep them close to a window (especially in the winter) or in a drafty place.
You do not need a filter, but you can use one if you like. If you decide to use a filter, try to find one that can be fully submerged and try to get the smallest size you can so the current won't be too strong. Keep it turned on for 24 hours before you introduce the newt so you can make sure it is functioning properly. If you use a filter that pours water out the top and hangs on the side of the aquarium, you'll need to put some sort of water-break underneath it so the water will trickle onto your newt rather than cascade. A plant or tall rock will work well. You don't need to run it 24-7; a few hours a day will suffice to keep the water clear. Even with a filter, you will still need to do water changes. Try somewhere between every 2 to 3 weeks. Keep adjusting it until you find what works best for your situation.
If you do not use a filter, change 25% of the water every week. Siphon out water from the bottom of the tank. If the surface of the water ever looks cloudy or filmy, just the surface, this is nothing at all to worry about. If you have to take your newt out of the aquarium, make sure you place him in a container with a secure lid (so he doesn't escape). Replace the same amount of water that you took out with dechlorinated water.
You will need a lid for your aquarium. Newts are escape artists and will crawl out of any crack they can find.
The most important decoration you can give your newt is a secure place to hide. The neon fish houses that large variety stores sell for two dollars or so work perfectly for a newt to curl up in. The shape that works best kind of looks like a lowercase m. It doesn't really matter what you use, but you'll want to use a small cave or rock or piece of wood that your newt can hide in or underneath to feel safe. Never use anything you found outdoors; always use something that is safe for aquariums. Most newts also enjoy having either fake or live plants to climb on (they are totally carnivorous so if you choose live plants, they will be perfectly safe), rocks or gravel to dig in. Make sure everything you put in the tank is stable enough so if your newt decides to dig, nothing will topple over and crush it to death.
A thermometer also isn't necessary but is always a good idea.;
,


Make sure you are buying from a reputable place and of course do not ever purchase a newt from a cage where one or more lay dead.
Pick one that is alert and exhibits no wounds or obvious signs of disease. When it walks or swims, it should move smoothly and with grace.
Check for two clear eyes, four digits on each foot, and a smooth back and tail with no nips out of it. Watch tanks to ensure getting a healthy animal.
A newt should be eating well and plump. You can ask the person selling the newt if it is eating well.

, Don't add the water from the pet store into your tank. Use a net or your hands (if you use your hands, make sure to wash them well with soap first and rinse them extremely well. Also, never grab a newt by the tail; try to lift it underneath its belly with a cupped hand instead.) to scoop your newt out of the bag and into his new home.

, Most people will tell you that you should never handle a newt with your hands. It is not without risk, but it can be accomplished safely. Newts do produce toxins in their skin that could harm you and the simplest way to avoid this is to wash your hands well with soap before you handle them. Rinse your hands until all traces of soap are gone. Keep your hands slightly wet when your newt is on them and when your friend's skin feels sticky to the touch (normally after 5 minutes or so), return him to his tank and wash your hands again well. Never eat food from your hands or touch your face after handling any salamander/newt without washing your hands and insist on others you allow the privilege of handling your salamander/newt do the same. This will ensure that you do not get sick from your newt and in turn, it will remain healthy. Amphibians have very porous skin and any harmful chemicals on your skin will be transmitted to your pet. Additionally, it is not normally a good idea to handle your newt while standing, unless your hands are over its tank. Sometimes newts will jump or wiggle unexpectedly and a fall to the ground can be disastrous.

, In their natural surroundings, newts are attracted to things that move (other living things). It is usually easy to obtain worms from a pet store, which should form the basis of your newt's diet. You may even be able to raise worms yourself (bloodworms/Tubifex are ideal for this). Several kinds of worm are used as food for newts and salamanders, such as: white worms, black worms, bloodworms/Tubifex worms, bloodworms, phoenix worms, mealworms, crickets, and occasionally wax worms, leaf worms, red wigglers/pan worms, or nightcrawlers. Daphnias, flightless fruit flies, and pinhead crickets, can be purchased online if the newt or salamander is very small. If you choose to use pellets, they can be stuffed in a chopped nightcrawler section. Larger prey may be given if it is a large salamander. Your newt may enjoy the occasional pinch of freeze dried bloodworms. They might even enjoy crickets.

, If this proves problematic, err on the side of keeping it a bit underfed rather than overfed. Sometimes newts will go off food for a week or two. This may occurs if they molt. You probably will not notice your newt molting at first because the shed skin is only as thick as the width of a single skin cell, is rather transparent, and most newts will eat their skin right after it comes off- this is perfectly normal .

Read local and state cruelty laws.,
Find signs of animal cruelty.,
Make contact with your local shelter.",How to Take Action to Stop Animal Abuse1," Laws regarding what constitutes animal cruelty and what can be done about it vary between nations, states or provinces, and local governments. Read your federal, regional, and local laws regarding cruelty.Often, such laws can be found online by searching a central government system. If you cannot find any such laws or regulations, try calling a local legal hotline for information on where to find animal-related policies.;
, Animal cruelty entails more than just violence against an animal. Cruelty can also come in the form of neglect or overwork. Learn everyday signs of animal cruelty, and keep an eye out for them in your community. These may include:Collars that are tight enough to cause wounds
Ongoing injury or illness
Conditions such as fleas, ticks, hair loss, or scaly skin that is not actively being treated
Impeded mobility
Inadequate shelter or being tied up outdoors even in inclement weather
Kept in unclean area littered with feces, garbage, or potentially harmful objects
Animal is housed in a kennel too small for them to stand or turn

, Talk to your local animal shelters and rescue organizations about what sorts of cruelty issues they deal with and how to report them. Different organizations may have different criteria and protocol, so knowing who is willing to handle what in advance is important.Call your shelter and let them know, “I’m trying to educate myself about preventing animal cruelty. What kind of rescue cases do you work with here and how should I report an abused animal if I encounter one?”

If you're planning on getting a rabbit, check the humane societies in your area.,
Before you make the purchase, be absolutely sure you have the time and money to keep a rabbit.,
Before you buy always check over the rabbit, if its fur is falling out in huge tufts (sometimes this is just shedding, but if it's not shedding season this may indicate a problem).,
Get stuff for the rabbit.,
Lastly, have fun with your new pet, make sure if you see any health problems to call a vet immediately.",How to Rescue a Rabbit," The vast majority of the animals in there have no problems themselves, they unfortunately just had bad handling. Getting a rabbit from a humane society is not only cheaper but you'll feel good knowing you saved that animals life.;
, There's nothing worse than becoming devoted to your animal then having to give it away or put it up for adoption.

, Also check to make sure there eyes look bright and clear, breathing is normal sounding(No heaving or wheezing)and run your hand over its body, make sure there are no abnormal bumps or cuts on it's body.

, Now it's time for the fun(but don't go insane) part,buying toys and treats, YAY! Always invest in a quality cage, NO! Bare wire and absolutely no pine wood shavings (the fumes they emit are harmful to rabbits). Buy quality food specially formulated for rabbits, and make sure your rabbit always has clean water. Buying toys and treats is always fun for a new pet, I'd suggest buying a halter and leash(in summer months it's fun to take your rabbit outside(with your supervision, of course)they love to munch on grass.)

, Make sure there is ALWAYS clean water in the bottle and make time for your pet, throughout its whole life! Best wishes with your new family member.

Look at the back of the product's container.,
Read every last bit of text on the entire container.,
Research the product.",How to Tell if a Product Was Tested on Animals," Does it say ""This Product Has Not Been Tested On Animals"" or something similar? If it does, that's a definite sign it hasn't been animal tested. Many animal tested products have failed to be safe for humans, and there are better alternatives than animal testing.;
, If it says something like ""Do Not Put In Eyes"" or ""Do Not Swallow,"" it could be a subtle warning that the product has been animal tested - because these can be hints that they have failed animal safety tests. However, if it says it hasn't been tested on animals it's probably just wanting you to be cautious.

, You'd be surprised how many are tested on animals - so do your research first! Online is the best source to get the information, because while lies are abundant on the Internet, the Internet is also more likely to have information on whether the product is animal tested or not than a magazine or book about the product.

Wait for the verdict.",How to Sue Someone for Injuring or Killing Your Pet," You need evidence of the injury or death in order to bring a successful lawsuit. If your pet is injured, you will also want to get immediate treatment. Although you may be in shock, you should move quickly and do the following:


Call the vet or take your pet to the vet.Your pet’s health should be your first priority, so get her treatment immediately. The vet can treat your pet and also document the extent of the injury. Be sure to leave the vet’s office with a copy of your pet’s record that shows the injury.
Take your pet to the vet even if she is already dead. The vet can perform an examination to determine the cause of death. This report will be helpful later on during a lawsuit.Take photographs. You can also take color photographs that show the injury. If your pet was killed, take photographs of the animal where you found him or her.Someone can take photographs for you if you are too emotional.;
, If someone saw your pet get injured or killed, then you should try to get their name and contact information.You might need to call them later if you go to trial.


The person who injured your pet is also a witness. You should write down whatever they say. A defendant’s statements can be used against him or her at trial.

, You should also call the police and report whoever injured or killed your pet. The police will investigate and then fill out a police report.


You should also call the police if you don’t know who killed or injured your pet. Unfortunately, you need to know this person’s identity before you can sue. In every lawsuit, you need to name a defendant. If you don’t know who harmed your pet, perhaps the police can find out by performing an investigation.
It is a crime if someone intentionally kills your animal, so always call the police if someone intentionally kills your pet. In most states, the prosecutor will charge the defendant with animal cruelty. The judge will also order the defendant to pay you compensation., The amount you will be compensated may depend in part on how much you paid for your pet. Try to find evidence of how much you paid for your pet.


For example, if you adopted the pet and paid an adoption fee, then you will need to find the receipt for that fee. If you purchased your pet from a breeder, then a copy of the check that you wrote or a receipt from the breeder can serve as proof of payment.
Keep in mind that the amount you will be compensated may be more or less depending on the amount that you paid for your pet. For example, an expensive show dog will require more compensation than a dog that you adopted from an animal shelter.

, You can be compensated for money you spent getting your pet medical treatment.Accordingly, you should hold onto your veterinarian bills and any receipts for medicines or supplies that you purchase.


To help you stay organized, you should set aside a folder which can hold your bills. As soon as you get home, you can throw your receipts in the folder. When you get ready to sue, you can sit down and add up the amount you spent on treatments.

, You might be able to get compensated for the “sentimental” value of your pet. This sentimental value includes your loss of companionship with the pet. You can help prove your special relationship by gathering the following:photographs of you and your pet together
witness testimony about how important the pet was to you and your family

, You may also be able to get compensation for the emotional harm of watching your pet be injured. This will depend on your state law.You should document the emotional pain that your pet’s death has caused you.


As soon as possible after you discover your pet’s condition, you should sit down and write down how you are feeling. Be honest. This documentary evidence can come in handy when you sue.
In particular, you should document the shock that you felt at coming upon your dead pet’s body or seeing someone attack your pet.
Also describe any ongoing depression that you feel. You can keep a daily journal, if you want, in which you explain your emotional distress and continued feelings of grief.

, In addition to getting compensated for veterinarian bills and emotional distress, you may be able to get other compensation, depending on your state:The market value of the pet. If your cat is killed, for example, then you can get compensation for how much it would cost to buy another cat. This amount is calculated based on your pet’s breed, age, health, and other factors.
Punitive damages. In some states, a judge can award you “punitive damages” if you win your lawsuit. Punitive damages are meant to punish the defendant for particularly bad conduct such as intentionally killing your pet.

, You should meet with an experienced attorney to discuss your case.You do not have to hire the lawyer, but you need an experienced lawyer to evaluate your case. The lawyer can advise you about whether or not you want to sue.


To find a qualified lawyer, you should contact your local or state bar association, which should offer attorney referrals.
Once you have the name of a lawyer, you can call and schedule a half-hour consultation. Most lawyers offer these for free or for a reduced price.
Be sure to discuss with the lawyer other ways of resolving your dispute. Lawsuits are expensive and your pet’s injury might only have cost $200 to treat. You might pay that much just to file a lawsuit. You should talk with your lawyer about different ways you could settle the dispute outside of court.

, You must sue the defendant in the county where he or she lives or in the county where the death or injury took place. If the person lives in the same county as you, then you will sue in your county court.


You should also think about suing in small claims court. These courts are set up so that you don’t need a lawyer. If you can’t afford a lawyer, then you should sue in small claims court.
Small claims courts only handle disputes below a certain amount. This amount will differ depending on your state. Generally, the maximums are between $5,000 and $10,000.If you want to sue for more than your state’s maximum, you will have to sue in regular civil court.

, You start the lawsuit by drafting and filing a complaint. This legal document identifies you and the defendant and also explains to the judge what happened. In your complaint, you also state how much compensation you want the judge to give you.Your lawyer can draft the complaint. However, if you don’t have a lawyer, then you should stop into the court and ask if they have a “fill in the blank” complaint form for you to use.

, Be sure that your information is legible. You should use a typewriter if you have to. Each complaint form differs slightly. However, they each will generally ask for the same information:Your name and contact information.
The name and contact information for the defendant.
How much money you want the court to give you.
A description of what the defendant did. In particular, explain the defendant’s actions. Also describe the injury your animal suffered.

For example, “The defendant backed up his Ford F-150 down the driveway. My dog ran toward the truck, barking. The defendant did not stop or look over his shoulder. Instead, he accelerated down the driveway, running over my dog, which died instantly.”



, Make multiple copies. You will keep one for your records and send one copy to the defendant. If there is more than one defendant, then each defendant gets a copy. Take all of your copies and the original complaint to the court clerk. Ask to file.


The clerk should stamp all of your copies with the date. This will help show that you filed the original.
You will probably have to pay a filing fee to start the lawsuit. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form and complete it., Before you go to trial, you will also need to serve the complaint against the defendant. The complaint will have to be served to the defendant along with an official ""Summons"" to appear in court. The defendant will then need to respond with an ""Answer.""Generally, the Summons can be served in a few ways. For example, you can pay the sheriff or a private process server to make service on the defendant.Each service will cost around $50.
You could also have someone 18 or older serve notice, provided he or she is not part of the lawsuit.You are not allowed to make service.
Whoever makes service should fill out a “proof of service” form and return it to you. You then need to file it with the court.Keep a copy for your own records.

, After the defendant has entered his plea or pleas, both parties will need to engage in the process of discovery. This phase of the trial includes giving statements under oath, gathering witness testimonies, and collecting other types of evidence to use during the trial.For example, you may need to get a statement from your pet's veterinarian, collect veterinary records, gather receipts, and gather other types of evidence that can help to prove your position in court.

, If you are representing yourself in court, then you will need to gather the evidence you gathered during the discovery phase before the trial. Typically, your evidence will consist of witness testimonies and other documents.


Know what you need to prove. Generally, you will need to prove that the defendant either intentionally harmed your pet or “negligently” did.Negligence means that the defendant didn’t exercise proper care around your pet. For example, if the defendant backed over your dog, then he might not have shown sufficient care if he didn’t look in his rearview mirror.
Line up your witnesses. You will have to give the defendant a list of witnesses you intend to call. These witnesses must have relevant, personal knowledge. This means they can’t testify as to what someone told them or to rumors.
Send subpoenas to witnesses. Tell your witnesses when the trial is being held. If you are afraid they won’t show, then get a subpoena from the court clerk and have it served on each witness. A subpoena is a legal command to attend trial and give testimony.Prepare exhibits. You can introduce helpful documents as exhibits. For example, the vet’s report which shows the cause of death or the extent of injury is a great exhibit. To turn a document into an exhibit, make sure it is free of any handwriting or notes. Then put an “exhibit sticker” on it. You can get exhibit stickers from an office supply store or from the court clerk., If you do not have adequate evidence to go to trial or if your evidence is not substantial enough to indicate that you will be successful, then the case may be subject to summary judgment. This is when all or part of your case is thrown out and will not be considered in court.A summary judgment is not always a bad thing. In fact, it may be to your advantage if your evidence is lacking.

, You don’t want to be late to your trial. If you are, the judge could dismiss it. You should try to arrive with 15-30 minutes to spare. You will need to find parking and go through any security at the courthouse.


You should check in with the court clerk when you arrive. You may need to sign in.
Make sure to turn off all electronic devices (including cell phones) before entering court.
Also throw away all food and drinks, as they are not allowed in court., A trial begins with each side making an opening statement. You should treat the opening statement as a roadmap for the evidence that you will present.Make sure to tell the judge the highlights of what the testimony will be.


In small claims court, the trial might be more informal than in regular civil court. However, you will probably still need to summarize your case in at least a few sentences so that the judge can understand the dispute.
For example, you should tell the judge the injury to your pet and what evidence will show the defendant committed the injury. You could say, “As the evidence will show, the defendant visited my house on July 2, 2016. As he was pulling out of my driveway, my dog ran up to his truck. And as the evidence will further show, the defendant did not slow down or look in the rearview mirror. Instead, he ran over my dog.”

, Because you are bringing the lawsuit, you will go first. Your lawyer should call your witnesses and ask them questions. For example, you will probably want your vet to testify as to the extent and cause of the injury.


If you are handling questions on your own, then remember not to ask “leading questions.” A leading question suggests its own answer and can usually be answered “yes” or “no.”
For example, “The dog was dead when I brought him in to you, isn’t that correct?” is a leading question. Instead, you should ask open-ended questions, like the following:

“What is your profession?”
“How long have you been a vet?”
“Where were you on July 2, 2016?”
“Did someone stop in?”
“What condition was the dog in?”



, You also will probably testify. If you saw the defendant injure your pet, then you can testify to that fact. If you are claiming emotional distress, then you will need to testify as to how the injury affected you emotionally. Your lawyer can ask you questions and then the defendant’s lawyer will cross-examine you. If you have no lawyer, then you will give your testimony in the form of a speech.


You should speak confidently and directly. Don’t drag your feet if the defendant’s lawyer asks you an uncomfortable question. For example, if the defendant asks if you ever tied your dog up, don’t stall. Instead, say, “No” if that’s the answer.
If you find yourself getting emotional, then ask the judge if you can take a short break.
Don’t get rattled on cross-examination and don’t argue with the defendant’s lawyer or the judge.Instead try to stay calm.
Always listen closely to the question and ask for clarification if you need it. Don’t guess if you don’t understand the question., The defendant can present evidence after you. Your lawyer will be able to ask the defendant’s witnesses questions on cross-examination.


If you are representing yourself, then see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for tips on cross-examination.

, Many civil suits settle before the trial is over. The person you are suing may want to work out an arrangement to pay damages and this would be called a settlement.Keep in mind that you do not have to agree to the terms of a settlement until you are happy with them. Settlement conferences may take place early on and later in the trial process., At the end of the trial, you will make a closing argument.The purpose is to tie together all of the evidence and show how it proves that the defendant injured or killed your pet.


Always remind the judge of specific pieces of evidence. If you refer to a document, then have the document or photograph in your hand.
For example, you can argue, “I introduced this veterinarian report earlier. Dr. Miles said it represented his opinion about the dog’s death. “Blunt force trauma” is what the report says. On the stand, Dr. Miles gave his opinion that the force was consistent with being run over by a truck.”

, The judge may deliver the verdict immediately after all evidence has been presented. However, if your case is especially complicated, then the judge might take the case under consideration and issue a ruling later.


If you lose the lawsuit, then you might be able to bring an appeal. You should talk this over with a lawyer.
If you want to appeal, then you do not have a lot of time to file your Notice of Appeal form. Most states give you less than 30 days from the date the judgment becomes final. In some states, like Missouri, you have fewer than 10 days."

Make a note of what actions or symptoms you believe are part of the abuse. If possible, offer to include photo or video in your report.
Be prepared to testify after you call in an abuse investigation.

, If you see an act of violence in progress against an animal, call 911 or the local police station right away. Direct intervention is not recommended, but you can have emergency services dispatched immediately if the animal appears to be in a life-threatening situation.


If the animal is in a truly dangerous situation, such as locked in a car or having an act of violence performed against them, call 911 right away and stay nearby so that you can inform them of the dog's condition. An officer will be dispatched as soon as possible.
If the animal still needs help but is not in an immediately threatening situation, such as being chained up outside or with a skin condition that is not being treated, report the matter to animal control as soon as possible.

, Speakers from humane societies and rescue agencies are generally eager to speak to the public about animal abuse and proper animal care. Call your local humane organization to have a speaker come in and talk about the issues. They often speak and provide literature to::


Church groups
Offices or teams of coworkers
School groups
Social clubs
Campus organizations
Groups of concerned private citizens such as a neighborhood watch organization

, Rescues and shelters are often understaffed and underfunded, and depend heavily on volunteers to ensure that they can provide for the rescue animals. Contact your local shelter or humane organization to ask them about volunteering.Call the organization directly and let them know, “I’m interested in volunteering with you. How can I get more information about getting started?” Be prepared to provide them with your availability when you call.
Be flexible regarding what you are willing to do. Volunteers will do everything from playing with the animals to cleaning up kennels and play yards. This is all necessary work to keep the animals happy and healthy.
Try to keep a consistent volunteer schedule. You don’t have to work too many hours, but show up for the ones you say you will work. This is necessary for the shelter to function smoothly.

, If you have children or if you work with children, work to teach them respect toward living things. Helping to foster a more mindful future is one of the best hopes for stopping animal abuse long-term.Teach children by example. Use kind tones and compassionate words toward your pets and other animals, rather than telling them to “shut up,” or saying other things a child would perceive as hurtful.
Practice non-violence with small animals from insects to rodents when they find their way into the home. Relocate them without killing or seriously hurting them.
Bring your child with you for volunteer shifts at local shelters.
Include books and movies in your child’s entertainment that show kindness and positivity toward animals.

Learn and share information about coral reefs.,
Donate to a charity focused on helping coral reefs.,
Use social media to raise awareness.,
Contact elected officials.,
Hand out flyers.",How to Take Action to Save Coral Reefs1," The more you get to know about coral reefs, the more you will learn how absolutely vital they are to many ocean organisms. Once you've learned more sufficient information, start sharing your knowledge about coral reefs to help many other people to become more aware of the damage being done to reefs and what they can do to help stop this.Coral reefs are home to thousands of different organisms and species of fish, many of which are endangered themselves. Since each of these organisms plays its own important role in the ocean’s ecosystem, the loss of their home—the reefs—can have a seriously detrimental effect on the ocean overall.
Involve others by teaching them to appreciate the beauty and ecological importance of coral reefs.;
, If you have some extra cash, you can donate on the web or through the mail to various charities that fund the conservation and protection of coral reefs. The Coral Reef Alliance, The Reef-World Foundation, Coral Cay Conservation, and even your local aquarium are some reputable suggestions, just to name a few.



Zoos and aquariums may offer useful information, and are often very involved in conservation efforts.
You can support these organizations with time, money, or by simply spreading the word.

, Thanks to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it’s easy to quickly and widely spread the word about causes you’re supporting. Make a post on your social media platforms directing your friends and followers towards coral reef conservation websites and donation pages.Follow social media accounts associated with different coral reef preservation and protection groups and organizations. Try re-posting or reblogging their posts to keep your own followers in the loop and updated on the issue.

, Whether you live near the water or not, you can urge your local or state representatives to take part in saving and conserving coral reefs. From voting on important issues to using their governmental platform to raise awareness of the issue, these elected officials can be especially helpful in the battle to save coral reefs.


If you live in the US, you can easily find out how to contact any elected official via the federal government’s website., Print a pre-made information flyer from an existing coral reef conservation organization or create your own with facts provided by these organizations. Print copies at home, or go to your local print shop. Then, head to an area populated with a good amount of pedestrians, and hand the flyers out. This gets the information into the hands of other people and helps spread awareness of the issue.


You could try setting up an information booth in a public space, as well. You could hand out flyers, and also offer information on how others can become involved themselves. Just make sure you have any permissions needed before setting up.

Think about bringing a class action lawsuit.",How to Take Action Against the Misuse of Police Dogs," To bring a successful excessive force claim, you will need proof of your injuries. You should document them soon after receiving medical treatment.Take color photographs from many different angles. Make sure the lighting is sufficient so that you capture the severity of the bite marks.
Get medical records. These records will be critical in a lawsuit, since they document the extent of your injuries.;
, Many businesses have surveillance video taken of their property. if the dog attacked you near a store (such as a convenience store), then stop in and ask if you can get a copy of the video for the day and time of the incident.The store might resist turning it over. You can subpoena a copy of the video after you start your lawsuit, although it may be too late by then.
In any event, ask who you should talk to if the store won’t turn the video over.

, You can also sue for any financial loss caused by the dog bites. In particular, you can be reimbursed for lost time at work or for money spent treating the dog bites. You should gather the following:


Proof of income. You can get pay stubs, your W-2 form, or proof of self-employed income.
Receipts for money spent on medical treatment, including hospital bills, doctor bills, rehabilitation costs, and medicines or prescription drugs., You can also generally be compensated for the emotional harm of the attack as well. You can prove your emotional harm in the following ways:


Keep a journal. In the journal, you can document how the injuries affect your daily life—how they interfere with your sleep and mobility, as well as your emotions.Have your counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist testify at your trial.
Have your friends and family testify as to how your mood has changed since the injury.

, Because excessive force cases are complicated, you would benefit from meeting with a qualified civil rights attorney, who can analyze your circumstances and tell you whether you have a solid case. You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have the name of an attorney, you should call and schedule a consultation.

, Excessive force administrative actions and lawsuits are very complicated, and it could be difficult for you to learn everything you need to know in order to bring a successful claim. Although you can certainly meet with the lawyer only once for a consultation, you should give considerable thought to hiring him or her to represent you.


At the consultation, ask how much the lawyer charges. Since you are bringing an administrative action and suing for a civil rights violation, the defendant may have to pay your attorney’s fees and reimburse you for the costs of the lawsuit if you win.
Furthermore, the lawyer might be willing to represent you on “contingency.” This means the lawyer will get paid only if you win or settle the lawsuit. Typically, the lawyer gets 33-40% of the amount you win., Some laws require an exhaustion of remedies while others do not. If the law requires you to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a lawsuit, you must file an administrative complaint with the proper authority. In federal cases, this may be the Department of Justice (DOJ). In state cases, it may be the police department or some other state agency. However, some laws do not require an exhaustion of remedies before bringing a lawsuit. If you work within one of those laws, this process might not be necessary.


For example, if you want to bring a lawsuit for excessive force under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Office of Justice Program (OJP), you must first exhaust administrative remedies.
However, if you want to sue under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, there is not exhaustion requirement., Federal administrative complaints will usually be handled by the DOJ. When you file a complaint, you need to access a complaint form or create your own complaint that contains all of the required information. Once you complete your complaint, it needs to be sent to the proper recipient. Check with the DOJ website for up-to-date information. In general, your complaint needs to contain the following information:Your personal information
The name of the law enforcement agency involved
A description of the wrongful conduct (i.e., the police dog misconduct)
The contact information of witnesses that can corroborate your story
An explanation of why you believe you were discriminated against (if you are making this claim)

, If you are filing a state complaint, determine where your complaint needs to be sent. For example, in Riverside, California, a complaint can be lodged with the police force's internal affairs division. They have complaint forms available at multiple police station locations throughout the city. You can also file a complaint online.Complaint forms will usually require you to include the following information:The location of the incident
Your personal information
Contact information for witnesses
A description of the actions that led to you making the complaint

, Once the complaint is received, the state agency will classify it and investigate it. In Riverside, there are multiple classifications including informal, incomplete, frivolous, and formal complaints. If your complaint is designated as formal, they will conduct an investigation. The internal affairs department will follow up with witnesses, interview the officer controlling the dog, and interview you. The department may also visit the site where the alleged misconduct took place.


Once the investigation is complete, the internal affairs department will write up a memorandum of their findings., The memorandum of findings will be forwarded along up the chain and reviewed by someone else. This person will determine what actions need to be taken based on the findings provided. Once a final disposition has been made, you will be notified of the results.At this point, if you do not agree with the findings or disposition of your complaint, you can usually file a lawsuit in court.

, Excessive force lawsuits are hard to win. In order to prevail, the officer must have had the dog intentionally bite you; an accident can’t give rise to a lawsuit. You also have to argue that the use of the police dogs was “objectively unreasonable” based on the circumstances. This analysis focuses on what the officer knew at the time and not on 20-20 hindsight. A court will look at the following factors to determine whether using the dog was objectively reasonable:Were you resisting arrest? If so, then use of the dog is more likely to be reasonable.
How long did the dog bite you? The shorter the duration, then the less likely that excessive force was used. However, if a dog bit you for far longer than it was necessary to subdue you, then you have a stronger argument that the dog bite was objectively unreasonable.
Did you threaten the officers, physically or verbally? If so, then the police use of the dog is more likely to be reasonable.
How serious was your suspected offense? The more serious the crime (such as murder, armed robbery), then the more likely it is that using the dog was reasonable.
Were you armed or suspected of being armed with a weapon? If so, then the use of the dog is more likely to be reasonable.
Did you receive a warning ahead of time? If you did, then it is more likely that the use of force was reasonable.

, You can bring an excessive force lawsuit against the officer who used the dog against you. However, you can also sue the police department, town, or county if you think they are also responsible for your injuries.You should discuss with your attorney whether you should add them as defendants.


For example, the police department might have been negligent in training its officers when to use dogs or in choosing the dogs to add to its K9 unit.
Also, the town could be consciously depriving you of your constitutional rights by not supervising the police or by adopting a K9 policy that is unconstitutional.

, If you want to go ahead with your lawsuit, you should draft a “complaint,” which identifies you and the officer who used excessive force. In the complaint, you should provide the factual background of your lawsuit and also make a demand for monetary compensation (called “compensatory damages”).


Your court may have a printed, “fill in the blank” complaint form you can use. There is also a complaint form the U.S. Courts publish which you can use for suing in federal court., Once you have completed the complaint, you should sign it and make copies. You have to file the original with the court clerk. You can take the complaint to the federal court for your district and file.


You will probably need to fill out other forms at the courthouse. For example, some courts will have you complete a “cover sheet” or a form stating that you are representing yourself in the lawsuit.Ask the court clerk for all of the forms you will need.
It costs $400 to file a lawsuit in federal court.If you can’t afford the fee, then you should ask for a fee waiver form and complete it.

, Notice usually consists of a copy of your complaint along with a “summons.” You can download a summons from the court’s website and complete it.The court clerk must sign the summons.


A U.S. Marshal can hand deliver a copy of the complaint on the defendant. However, the Marshals generally don’t make delivery unless ordered by the court. If you aren’t indigent or a seaman, then you typically will have to hire a private process server to make delivery.You can find process servers in the phone book or on the Internet. They generally charge $45-75 per service.
Whoever makes service must fill out a “Proof of Service” form. It should be on the back of the summons. You need to file it with the court and keep a copy for your records.

, After receiving your complaint and summons, the defendant has a limited amount of time to file a response. Typically, the officer will try to get the case dismissed on the grounds that he or she has “qualified immunity.”


Qualified immunity protects a police officer from being sued unless it was clearly established federal law that using police dogs in your situation was illegal.This doctrine is as drastic as it sounds, and it generally allows most officers to escape being sued.
You will receive a copy of the “motion to dismiss” that the police officer files claiming qualified immunity.

, In order to keep the case from being dismissed, you or your attorney will need to file a response in opposition. In this motion, you will argue that using the police dogs was in violation of a “clearly established federal law” at the time the dog was used.


Generally, you can prove the law was “clearly established” by pointing to either a Supreme Court or appellate court decision that establishes use of a police dog in circumstances similar to yours was illegal.For example, your appellate court might have held that officers must give a warning before using a dog. If they don’t, then they are violating “clearly established” law and cannot get qualified immunity.
The judge will probably hold a hearing to discuss the qualified immunity defense. If the officer loses the qualified immunity argument, then he or she has a right to an immediate appeal on that issue.

, During discovery, you and the defendant will have an opportunity to exchange information in order to prepare for trial. This gives you a chance to determine the strength of the other party's case and find out what they will say at trial. In order to collect information during discovery, you will use the following tools:Depositions, which are in-person interviews with witnesses and parties conducted under oath. The answers given can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are written questions posed to witnesses and parties. The answers must be given under oath and they can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are formal requests for documents that would not otherwise be publicly available to you. Examples of documents you might request include body camera footage, emails, text messages, and phone records.
Requests for admissions, which are written statements the other party must admit or deny. This process helps narrow down what needs to be argued at trial.

, As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant will try to end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. To succeed, the defendant must prove that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge must agree that, even if every factual assumption was made in your favor, you would still lose the case.


You will defend against this motion by filing one of your own. Your responsive motion will include evidence and affidavits showing the court that there are factual discrepancies that need to be settled at trial.In addition, if a cross-complaint was filed against you, you might file your own motion for summary judgment to try and end the litigation.

, If your case is strong and you win on the qualified immunity issue, then the defendant might want to settle the lawsuit. You should certainly consider settlement, since it will save you time and money. In addition, most police forces will want to settle with you in order to avoid bad publicity and exposure. Depending on the severity of your case, you may be able to use this information to extract a good settlement out of the police.


Before entering settlement discussions, determine the absolute minimum you would be willing to settle for. For example, if you sued for $100,000, then you might be willing to settle for half that--$50,000. This is your “walkaway” point.You need a “walkaway” point so that you know when to get up from negotiations. Negotiations are voluntary, and you shouldn’t settle the case unless you feel comfortable with the amount of compensation you have gotten.
You can decide on a walkaway point by talking with your lawyer. The number will generally depend on how strong your evidence is for trial.

, If informal negotiation tactics fail, consider submitting to mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the defendant to discuss the case. He or she will try to find common ground and come up with unique solutions to your dispute. The mediator will never impose their own opinions or take sides.

, Years might pass before you finally get your day in court. Arguing the “qualified immunity” issue could take over a year, especially if an appeal is involved. At trial, you and the defendant will present evidence to a jury, which must be unanimous in its decision. If you were arrested because you actually committed a crime, then you should discuss with your lawyer whether to ask for a bench trial, which will be heard by the judge instead of a jury. A jury might not be sympathetic to you if you were actually guilty of a crime when you were bitten.


After the trial, if you win, you will be awarded damages. However, if you lose at trial, you might consider making an appeal. Appeals can only be filed in limited circumstances when the judge made some legal error (as opposed to a factual error) in your case. For example, if your judge applied the wrong law, you might have a quality appeal. To make an appeal, you and your lawyer will have to file an appellate brief within a certain time period after your trial ends (usually between 30 and 60 days)., Some police departments have been accused of using police dogs too often or in a racially-discriminatory manner that targets African Americans and Latinos.Police should keep statistics on the number of arrests that involve a dog bite, as well as the race of the suspect bitten.


You should try to get these statistics. You can make a request directly to the police department or use your city’s public disclosure request process.Contact your mayor’s office.

, Drum up support from the public by talking about the misuse of police dogs in your city. Be sure to mention statistics and to emphasize that there are safer ways to use dogs. For example, police could have the dog corner a suspect and bark instead of biting and holding. Writing letters to the editor of a newspaper is a good way to increase this issue’s visibility.To write an effective letter, you should get to the point and not use too many words. Generally, a letter should be 300 words or fewer.
Make sure that you praise the police and acknowledge the risks they take every day for your safety. This will give you credibility.
Nevertheless, be sure to use your statistics to argue that the police are currently misusing the police dogs. Suggest how the dogs could be used properly without sacrificing officer safety.
You should probably send the letter by email, since it is the standard way to communicate now.

, Your city council could adopt a law restricting the use of police dogs by the police department. Each city council operates a little differently. However, generally, individual members can introduce bills for the entire council to consider.You should meet with an individual council member who you think might be sympathetic to changing the way the police use dogs.


If the bill comes up for discussion, then you can attend meetings to present your findings and to advocate for change.

, If your city will not change its K9 policy voluntarily, then you could think about bringing a class action lawsuit. In a class action, a group of people who have been injured by police dogs could sue.


You can sue for an “injunction,” which is a court order to stop using police dogs. Injunctions can be an effective way to bring about change when your government officials are resistant.Unlike police officers, cities and counties cannot claim “qualified immunity,” so you might be much more successful getting an injunction to stop the use of the dogs.
You should talk to a civil rights attorney to discuss bringing a class action lawsuit for an injunction.

Call or write your local representatives.,
Schedule a meeting with local legislators.,
Join an advocacy group.,
Go vote.",How to Take Action to Stop Animal Abuse3," New measures are put forward and laws made because people let their representatives know what issues matter to them. Call or write offices for local representatives, such as senators and congresspersons in the US, to let them know you want to see stricter regulations regarding animal abuse.You can find a number of petitions as well as sample letters and phone scripts online to help you organize your thoughts and make a powerful statement.

, Set up a meeting for just you or you and one or two other concerned citizens to talk with a local legislator. Call their office and let them know, “I would like to set up an appointment to talk about an issue I believe is important to our community.”


Keep the group you bring small. This keeps meetings more directed and on-track. Appoint a single person to act as spokesperson for the group.Prepare talking points in advance. Have any facts or statistics you would like to quote written down and make sure you have a central message such as, “There is not proper legislation in this community to protect animals.” Remember, you will only have about 15 minutes to talk.
If you are meeting about a specific measure, have your statement about why you support or oppose it ready, citing text from the measure itself to help prove your points.
Dress professionally and be punctual.

, Many humane organizations, as well as national groups like the ASPCA, have advocacy groups or organizations that work to promote animal rights and welfare within local communities. Search online or call your local humane society to find about about advocacy opportunities.Join local groups to get information that is tailored to your state or local area.
Keep your contact information up to date so that the organization is able to easily get in touch with you.

, When animal rights or animal cruelty measures come up during local and state elections, it is imperative that you go vote in support of animal rights and rehabilitation. Check with your state or county offices to see if you are registered to vote, and if not register immediately.Remember, you do not have to vote for every issue on a ballot. If an election involves an animal welfare measure as well as other measures you don’t want to vote on, don’t skip voting, Instead, go and vote specifically for the measure that do concern you.
Check every election cycle to make sure your voter registration is up to date.

Control trash and chemical runoff from your property.,
Conserve water whenever possible.,
Reduce your carbon footprint.,
Protest against destructive fishing methods.,
Be a smart consumer.",How to Take Action to Save Coral Reefs2," If possible, get your neighborhood involved. Harmful things like herbicides, oil, and garbage can travel hundreds of miles through waterways and end up in reef ecosystems. By limiting the amount of runoff and garbage polluting your own neighborhood, you can help cut down on the runoff and pollution that eventually reaches the ocean and damages coral reefs.A plastic bag you might toss aside in the middle of a city could still find its way to the ocean—via storm drains and waterways, even garbage generated far from the oceans can potentially end up there., Whether this means making your washing loads fuller, your showers shorter, or fixing that leaky faucet you've had for years, make it happen. With less water wasted, the less runoff water there will be to return to and pollute the oceans., Coral reefs are extremely sensitive to global warming. With more fossil fuels being put into the atmosphere, the more global warming occurs. When the sea water temperatures rises, even just one or two degrees, coral bleaching can occur. This is when a reef releases the algae that lives inside of it. This algae is what gives the reef its color, so losing it causes the coral to appear white, hence being called “bleached.” Although reefs can sometimes recover from these episodes, it can take several months to years for it to be restored. More often, though, the coral dies after bleaching.Carpool, walk, bike, or take public transportation as much as you can. Upgrade your home appliances for newer, energy efficient ones. Turn off lights when they aren’t in use, and unplug devices when you aren’t using them. Consider cutting animal products out of your diet—the resources it takes to raise cattle, for example, have had detrimental impacts on the environment., There are many methods of fishing that can cause a huge negative impact on the ocean, including dynamite fishing and poison fishing.These methods can damage coral reefs along with all the life inside it. Find ways to protest against these fishing methods, either through joining an existing protest organization or starting one yourself.You can also sign internet-based petitions to end these kinds of fishing, or support existing local efforts. Do a little research into your local area to see what options there are for joining up., Avoid purchasing products that may have come from coral reefs. For example, avoid buying dry coral, which is often chipped off the live reef, or buying tropical fish that were caught in the wild.These fish were important components of coral reef ecosystems. Removing them from their natural habitats can be detrimental to coral, and to the fish species at large."
