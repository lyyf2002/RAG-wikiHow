Navigate carefully in watercraft.,
Avoid touching corals in the wild.,
Take care when snorkeling and diving.,
Consider staying away completely.",How to Take Action to Save Coral Reefs3," Get charts ahead of your visit that show where the coral reefs are located. Avoid disturbing them with fishing gear, anchors, or high speed motoring. The best time to navigate watercraft in coral-rich areas is when the sun is high in the sky, making the coral easy to see. You can also try wearing polarized sunglasses to help see the coral in the water.Be mindful of where you drop anchor when boating. Coral is easily broken by anchors and boats, and breakage can lead to the coral’s death., Reefs are a wonderful place to dive and explore, but coral polyps, the living animals which make up coral, are very fragile. When scuba diving or snorkeling, make sure not to kick the coral, stand or sit on it, or even hold it in your hand. You could potentially cause great damage, even without intending to.Simply the oil in your skin can be damaging to coral. It might be tempting to reach out and touch the coral to see what it feels like, or just for the experience, but doing so could be detrimental to the coral.

, Aside from just being careful about touching or kicking the coral when diving, you need to be careful about what you bring in the water with you. Even the sunscreen you put on your skin before entering the water could ultimately be harmful to the coral. Try choosing a sunscreen that is eco-friendly, or a sunscreen that reflects the sun rather than absorbing it.Be mindful of any gear you have with you. If you are taking underwater photos, for example, keep your gear close to you and don’t let it knock into the coral. Keep your fins in mind when snorkeling. Make sure you don’t hit the coral with them while kicking and swimming. Stay high above the coral and observe it from near the surface., The one true method of preventing accidental damage to coral reefs is to not dive or swim near them at all. It might not be the most ideal option, especially for tourists or travellers who desire an up close and personal experience, but it might be one of the only ways to keep reefs completely safe from damages caused by tourists and visitors.

Lost and stray pets crowd pounds/shelters, resulting in less room for pets who are up for adoption. It is sometimes more difficult to find homes for stray pets that do not have a known history. Microchip your pets for added security.;
, No exceptions. Even if you keep your pets indoors and under supervision, spay/neuter is the only way to be completely sure your pet will never add to the tragic overpopulation crisis.

, Offer financial aid/or transportation to the vets, where appropriate. Stray cats can be captured in live traps, transported to the vets to be fixed and vaccinated, and then returned to the location where they were trapped, without even touching the stray cat.

, Petfinder.com is an excellent resource. This is a nationwide website of homeless, adoptable pets.

, If someone you know is considering acquiring a pet, research rescue organizations and potential pets for them to adopt, not buy. Offer to make the adoption fee (or part of the fee) a gift from you.

, These gift certificates will act as conversation starters at the event, and again when the gift certificate is redeemed. Teaching the others in attendance will spread the word about the kind solution to pet overpopulation.

, Pets are available from pounds and shelters, from newspaper ads, through contacts with social workers, churches, veterinarians, groomers, etc. Every day many pets need to be rehomed, through no fault of the pet. Pets lose their homes when people lose their homes, when people become unable to provide for the pet, when blended families can no longer keep a pet, when children lose interest in the pet, etc.

, Many pets become homeless when their humans fail to provide training.

, If you are a landlord and the tenant wishes to own a pet, require it to be a “fixed”, adopted pet. If you are aiding a relative or neighbor in some way (loaning a vehicle, or money, for example), require them to “fix” and adopt their pets. Put it in writing, to be certain they realize that you are serious. Your neighbor asks you to baby-sit their dog, require that it be a fixed dog.

, Speak to others you know, your hairdresser-barber, doctor, dentist, coworkers, and relatives. Tell everyone to never buy a pet, nor acquire from a breeding source.

, Pounds and shelters are needed, but the pet overpopulation crisis cannot be solved at the shelter level. It can be essentially solved at the home and neighborhood level through identification, spaying/neutering, and adoption.

Learn about bettas, how they live in the wild, and how to properly care for a betta.
,
Determine if a pet shop mistreats its bettas.,
Check back at the store every few days for a month or so to see if the situation is consistent.,
Voice your concerns.,
Offer reasonable suggestions to improve conditions:


Ask to volunteer to perform water changes and check the fish for disease.,
Obtain evidence of mistreatment.,
Write a letter.,
Inform your community.",How to Help Pet Shop Bettas,", Small cups may seem cruel, but bettas usually stay in a pet store for a few weeks, and are adapted to living in somewhat similar conditions for months in the wild. Because male bettas can't live together, it is difficult for stores to house them ideally, though conditions must be livable. Possible signs of betta mistreatment include:


Consistently dirty water going unchanged.
Containers that are never opened (implying no water changes).
Most bettas are very thin, sick, or dead.
Dead and diseased bettas displayed, or moved to the back and not dealt with.
The same bettas remain in the store for several months (store conditions are rarely acceptable long-term; this usually indicates they order too many fish).
Containers smaller than 3"" in diameter.
Containers with no surface air (bettas are labyrinth fishrequiring surface air to breathe).

, Go as a window-shopper, and shop there if possible to establish yourself as a customer to lend more weight to your concerns. While evaluating the situation, don't confront anyone just yet.

, If evidence consistently suggests a store mistreats bettas, speak to a manager about their policies, share your concerns and explain how they may be harming fish.

,
Suggest better locations to sell bettas so they might find real homes quicker.
Write a betta care fact sheet, so buyers know how to properly care for their new pet.
Bettas can often reside with small schooling fish like Corydoras or Otocinclus catfish, so ask if they can place bettas into real tanks. (Not with any fish the same size or larger, or with flowing fins, as they will attack these perceived ""enemy fish"".)
Ask to bring in a professional, like an aquarium expert, to explain proper betta care and work towards improvements.
See if a store will implement a 2-week health guarantee on all fish where customers can return sick or dead fish, to encourage appropriate animal treatment.
Work with staff to come up with solutions satisfying everyone, and offer to help implement changes.

, If the store insists that all is fine and declines your suggestions, gather evidence of your suspicions. Note the conditions, ask to take photographs, and accurately document your conversations with the manager.

, If the store is a chain-store, write the main office, detailing your observations in a concerned, compassionate manner. Include photos, if any, and a summary of your conversations with the manager. Discuss your concerns and suggestions, without being aggressive or threatening to win sympathy for the animals, not make enemies. Encourage others to do likewise.

, If the store's mistreatment extends to other animals, contact your local news media. A letter to the editor is a good start, and if the story is compelling, a news station may be willing to report it. Send copies of media reports to the company, letting them know the public is concerned.

Observe the cat for a while.,
Get a live trap.,
Avoid unreliable methods for catching a cat.,
Prepare an area in which to keep the cat.,
Set up an appointment to have the cat neutered and medically checked out.",How to Catch a Stray Cat1," Before you catch or even approach a stray cat, you need to observe them for signs of disease and injury. For your own safety and the safety as a cat, it's important to evaluate the health of the animal and come up with a viable plan for determining when and how to help. If a cat has been frequenting a particular area for a few days, spend some time watching it closely. If it's a friendly cat, your job will be a lot easier. If not, you've got some work to do.


If a cat behaves erratically, breathes heavily, drools excessively, or generally acts lethargic and unusual, call animal control. Do not attempt to approach cats exhibiting signs of disease.There are some diseases that cats carry that are zoonotic—or transferred to humans from animals and vice versa. A very frightening, and virtually untreatable disease is rabies transmitted by saliva through bites or cuts in the skin.Another danger is the dangerous infections that can set in from cat bites. Professionals who work at animal control have the necessary equipment and protection to safely capture sick stray cats.
Not every cat needs to be caught. Don't try to catch well-fed looking cats with collars. Call your neighbors and inquire about whether or not anyone’s missing a stray, instead.;
, Live traps are extremely safe and simple mechanisms that catch cats easily and humanely. You bait the trap with food, and then the doors of the cage will close when an animal wanders inside, trapping it safely. After trapping a stray cat, leave it in the live trap and transport it to the vet. Do not remove the animal from the trap.


Local vets and animal shelters will lend you live traps for catching strays. You don’t have to buy one, though it might be a good tool to have on hand if you live in a rural area and commonly encounter strays and other animals in need of relocation.
If you absolutely can't find or use a trap, use a cat carrier or a box to bait with food and trap the cat inside. Check with your vet before using a carrier to catch a cat some vets won't accept cats that are brought to them in anything except a live trap. A live trap is safer and more effective, but this can do in a pinch., Don’t attempt to catch a stray by picking it up or by using a pillowcase or other type of bag. These methods can anger and agitate strays, as well as injure them, and risk injuring yourself. Never, under any circumstances, should you handle a stray cat with your bare hands. Treat stray cats as you would a wild animal, even if you hope to domesticate the cat in the long run. Give it time.

, You'll need to have a suitable place for keeping the cat, even if you just plan on taking it to the vet and then re-releasing it. Ideally, you want to catch the cat as near as possible to the spay or neuter date, so you can take the cat immediately to the vet's office. If you need to house the cat for a little while before, though, you need to prepare a quiet room in the house for the cat to stay.


Strays should be kept in out-of-the-way areas of your house that you can keep quiet so the cat will calm down and feel safe. Basements, spare bedrooms, and other temperature controlled areas that you can keep dark will help to calm cats and keep them feeling safe.
If you're taking the cat to the vet in less than 12 hours, don't worry about feeding the animal. It'll be fine and it'll be much safer to avoid opening the cage and risking having to wrangle the cat again. Provide some clean water and let the cat stay in the live trap.

, The ASPCA now promotes a policy called Trap Neuter Return (TNR). Whatever you intend to do with the animal after you’ve caught it, this needs to be the first step after catching it."
"
Reach out to other responsible owners.,
Post a picture.,
Make your pet attractive, but remember to be honest.,
Be careful how you advertise and wary when evaluating replies to your ad.,
Never advertise your pet for ""free."",
Consider these guidelines for screening responses:


Thank responders for their interest and say that someone is already considering your pet but you are still taking names.,
Consider surrendering your pet to an animal shelter as a last resort.",How to Find a Good Home when You Must Give up Your Pet," The Humane Society of the United States suggests advertising through friends, neighbors, and local veterinarians. If you deal with a groomer or a boarding kennel, advertise there too. People who provide their pets with regular veterinary care, get them groomed, and board them at well-run kennels tend to have friends or family who would also be responsible owners.;
, Your audience is continually being bombarded with information, all competing for attention. Whether you are promoting your pet on printed posters or on your blog, without an attractive color photo, your pet won't get a second look. If you don't have a digital camera, find a friend who does. Got video? Even better. Put it on line and use your printed posters to direct people there. This gets attention!

, Use your pet's name, and describe his best qualities. Be honest about any behavior issues. Be specific about any special requirements, for instance, a home with a fenced yard or without small children. If your pet is not already spayed or neutered, have that surgery done. It will protect your pet from being used for breeding. It will also curb the impulse to roam or to urine-mark his new territory.

, Back in the ""newspaper age,"" some humane organizations warned that newspapers are as likely to attract people who want to use pets for unethical purposes, as they are to reach responsible pet-owners. The same is true of the Web in our ""digital age."" But the potential for reaching a large audience in an economical way cannot be overlooked. Compared to the free access that many Web offers, newspaper advertising is often too costly. Even small classified ads are expensive, and once readers are done with the paper, they throw it away, and your ad goes with it. If you feel that a newspaper ad is a must for promoting your pet to your community, be brief and use the newspaper to direct people to your pet's ad on the Web. Because you are reaching a broad audience, be wary when screening replies so you can avoid anyone who wants your pet for puppy-mill breeding stock, ""bait"" for training dogs to fight, or to sell to a research lab.

, Animal welfare groups warn that ""free pet"" ads attract dog fighters and other unscrupulous people. Charging even a modest fee and not publishing the amount but discussing it privately, instead, with potential adopters is one step in screening out undesirable inquiries.

, This way you won't feel pressured to meet with everyone. Follow up with those who seem to be responsible.
Ask callers about any other pets they have had and what happened to them. Petfinder.com offers a list of other helpful questions. Check with your local humane society or an animal rescue organization to find out what else you should ask of potential adopters. These groups are skilled at interviewing to determine whether a would-be adopter is likely to be a responsible caretaker. Some organizations even provide their adoption applications on line. Look them up and see how asking similar questions can help you identify the best home for your pet.
Check vet references. This is a must. Get the name and address of the person's vet, and then look up the phone number yourself. Explain why you are calling. Ask if the vet would recommend the person as a responsible owner who would provide a good home. If there is any hesitation on the vet's part, trust that judgment and look for someone else as an adopter.
Get the address. Would the adopter permit a home check so you can see where your pet would live? (For your own safety, take another adult with you if you go. Never go alone when meeting a stranger.)

, It is true animal shelters have experience in placing pets, but no shelter can guarantee that it will find your pet a home. Shelters are often filled to capacity, and most must eventually euthanize some animals for lack of space. ""No-kill"" shelters and rescue organizations can accept only limited numbers of animals. They may have waiting lists for accepting pets. But it can still be worthwhile to contact them. The number of foster homes and rescue organizations is increasing. Ask your local humane society for contact information, and also check the Petfinder.com directory of shelters and rescues.

Start feeding the cat a couple of days before you want to trap it.,
Set up the trap and bait it.,
Check on the trap regularly.,
Take the cat indoors.",How to Catch a Stray Cat2," You want to make sure the cat will start having a reason to stay around the area, and then will have a reason to take the food that you've set into the trap.


After making an appointment to have the cat treated at the vet, withhold food for a day or two leading up to the appointment, before you set your trap for the cat.Use regular dry cat food from the store, or canned cat food to feed the cats. In a pinch, a small amount of tuna or other canned fish will also attract cats if you’d rather not buy cat food.Don’t feed cats milk. Contrary to popular belief, cats have difficulty processing dairy, and you can end up with a mess on your hands by feeding cats milk. Feed strays solid cat food.

, Use the same variety of cat food or treats that you’ve been using to feed the cat. Set down paper or a pillowcase to smooth out the wire floor of the cage, and place food at the back of the cage so the cat has to walk all the way in to eat it, put a small amount of food at the entrance of the trap as a teaser, then set the spring on the trap.


Each trap will be operated slightly differently, but all are fairly basic. For the most part, you only need to open the trap door and secure it in place with the wire release bar. When the door closes, the animal will be trapped inside.
Cover the trap with a towel or cloth without obscuring the entrance, to help obscure the trap and make it look less conspicuous. Some hard to catch cats prefer to be able to see through the back of the trap. If you are having trouble catching a cat try removing the cover or leaving the back exposed.
Don't use a bowl to keep the food in. The cat might thrash around once caught and could hurt itself on any objects stuck inside the cage.

, Live traps are very safe, but you don't want to leave a cat outdoors and exposed in an unattended trap for a long period of time. This means it is important to check up on it regularly and see whether or not you've made the catch. If so, bring it indoors to your prepared area, or take it to the vet immediately if it's time.

, Once the cat is trapped, cover the trap with the cloth and promptly move it to the holding area. The cat will be more calm if kept in the dark when you are moving it, so lower the light and keep a cover over the cage.


Leave the cat in the trap. Don't let the cat out of the trap or try to transfer it to a cat carrier, or you're just going to have to start the whole process over again. After being caught and moved around, cats will want to hide in a small, cramped space, anyway, making the cage the ideal location for them at this time. The cat will be fine!

Have the cat neutered and medically treated if necessary.,
Re-release the cat.,
Contact a local cat rescue organization or non-kill animal shelter.,
Try to find the cat a new home, if necessary.,
Consider keeping the cat.",How to Catch a Stray Cat3," Have the cat neutered (male) or spayed (female) and at a minimum the cat should also have a rabies vaccination, treatment for any parasites (fleas or worms), vaccination for distemper, and a test for feline leukemia is also recommended. In many places, these services are offered for free as a general animal control policy.

, Female cats should be kept under observation in a cage with access to a litter box and food and water for 5 days after the spay operations. Males can be released the day after the operation. You can return it back to the habitat from which it came, or take it elsewhere.


If releasing the cat to a new area a caregiver needs to be available to help the cat become acclimated to its new environment, which can take several weeks. In general, this policy is promoted by the ASPCA as a way of helping to control the cat population. If the cat seemed to be getting on well in the environment, release it and put food, water and shelter out regularly. Cats that are released to areas they are not familiar with are unlikely to survive unless they have a caretaker because they do not have a source of food, water, or shelter. Other cats already in the area may also attack them in territory disputes.

, If you live in an urban area, releasing a stray might be irresponsible. Cat rescue and no-kill shelters are a much better option. They will likely be happy to do the work of finding the cat a good home.


Feral cats are almost never adopted from shelters, as they have a high euthanasia rate of more than 90%. If the cat is unadoptable it is better to release to the area where it was caught.
Many rescues will pay the cost of a stray cat's veterinary bills for you. Save your receipts.
If you can, offer to foster the cat until a home is found. Some organizations have more cats than they have foster homes. Just don't take offense if they prefer to foster with someone who has experience with cats.

, If you're sure the cat is not owned and you're uncomfortable or unable to take the cat elsewhere, find a suitable home for the cat yourself. You can advertise, ask around, and find a suitable candidate for keeping the cat for a pet.


Ask around informally to see if any of your friends or relatives might be interested in looking after the cat. Start by asking trusted friends and acquaintances. This way the cat gets a good home, and you can visit it sometimes.
Advertise the cat locally. Put the cat on Petfinder.com. Make sure the profile is honest about the cat's situation. You can also put an ad online or in the local classifieds.

, Some stray cats make great pets once they adjust to life in a human home. Think carefully about whether you have the time, money and a good environment to take on a pet. If you plan on keeping the animal, make sure that it gets looked after thoroughly at the vet and that it's a safe animal to be around before letting it into your home.

In these documents, you name one or more people to take care of your pets and provide detailed instructions for their care.;
, You will need a lawyer’s assistance to draft a pet trust.It could cost you $1,000 or more to have a lawyer draft the trust for you.


You can create a pet protection agreement without a lawyer’s assistance. Although you may see sample trust documents floating around the Internet, you really need a lawyer to draft a trust that will be valid in your state.

, Another key difference is that a pet protection agreement cannot guarantee that a pet will be able to live with you in a long-term care facility.By contrast, you can draft a pet trust so that any nursing home that takes your pet along with you will receive a portion of the trust funds. This can provide a powerful incentive to a nursing home to take your pet.

, If you are leaving a substantial sum of money for your pet’s care, then you should probably use a pet trust instead of a pet protection agreement.With a trust, the trustee will be able to manage the assets so that they last as long as possible.


If you have the money, then a trust makes sense if your pet is very young. A pet that you expect to live for a decade or more could cost a substantial sum of money.

, A pet trust is also ideal if you expect your heirs (for example, your children) to challenge your decision to leave money to your pet. If so, a pet trust is preferable to a pet protection agreement.Think about your relationship with your heirs. Are you on good terms? Do they understand how much you love your pets? If not, then your heirs might challenge your attempt to leave money for the care of your pets.

, It is ultimately your decision whether to choose a pet protection agreement or a pet trust. They are very similar. Both will provide for your pets’ care after you die or if you become disabled. To make a decision, you need to weigh the following:


Whether you can afford an attorney. If you can’t, then you should pick a pet protection agreement.
How badly you want your pets with you in a long-term care facility, should you have to live in one. Using a pet trust over a pet protection agreement increases the likelihood that you can live with your pets.
The amount of money you will leave. A large sum of money could induce a legal challenge from your heirs. A pet trust provides added protection that your wishes will be recognized.
How likely your heirs are to challenge your wishes. If you think they might challenge your pet agreement, then you should probably choose a pet trust.

, If you decide that you want to create a pet trust, then you should find an experienced trust and estates lawyer. You should ask friends or colleagues for a recommendation. You can also visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.


You can also get attorney recommendations from your local animal welfare organization.Always be sure that the trust attorney has actually created a pet trust before. A pet trust has different wrinkles than a regular trust, and you want an attorney who has experience creating pet trusts.

, In order to create the trust, you will need to name a trustee. The trustee is the person who is legally obligated to carry out the trust.He or she will manage the funds in the trust.


You should pick someone who you are confident can handle money prudently. This person may or may not also be the caregiver.
You should also pick a successor trustee in case your original trustee declines to serve or dies., In the trust, you will also name a caregiver. This person will actually care for your pet. Advisors recommend that the trustee and the caregiver not be the same person. This way, the caregiver and the trustee can act as “checks” on each other.If you do not want the trustee and caregiver to be the same person, then you should make sure that these two people work well together. If they don’t, then it could be difficult for the caregiver to get necessary funds out of the trustee.
Remember to select a successor caregiver as well.
If you have more than one pet, you will need to decide whether or not they should go to the same home. Pets who have bonded should probably be kept together., When you meet with your attorney to discuss creating the trust, you should provide detailed instructions. Do not assume that the caregiver knows what you want.You should give some thought to the following:


Whether you want the caregiver to take your pet to a particular vet. You can also designate the number of times the pet must visit the vet in a year.What kind of food the pet likes.
The pet’s routine: does it like a daily walk in the park, afternoon naps, etc.
What kind of medical care you want provided to your pet. For example, you might request that “reasonable medical care” be provided in order to restore your pets to good health.Whether you want the trustee to inspect your pets annually to make sure they are being taken care of.Whether you want any of your pets euthanized if they are not in generally good health. Also, you should state what you want done with the remains.

, You will fund the trust with assets. These assets will then be used to care for your animal. You should talk to your lawyer about how much money you should put into the trust. If you put in too much, then your surviving relatives might challenge the trust as excessive., To encourage a nursing home to let the pet move with you to a facility, you can include in your trust directions that a portion of the trust property will be given to any facility that allows you and your pets to stay together.You should also think about who to leave the assets to when the beneficiary (your pet) dies. Many people choose to leave money to an animal shelter or welfare organization.

, Your lawyer will arrange the execution of the trust so that it complies with all of your state’s legal formalities. He or she should arrange for any witnesses and notary publics to attend the signing.


Be sure to get a copy of your trust agreement from your lawyer. You should give copies to your vet, trustee, and caregiver.

, The guardian will be the person who takes care of your animals in the event of your death or incapacity. You should speak to any potential guardians and ask them if they are willing to serve. You shouldn’t name anyone until you are confident that they will be able to take care of your pets.


Ideally, the guardian should have already met your pets.Some people might agree to serve as a guardian without ever having met your pet. After spending some time together, they might change their mind.
You can also name a successor guardian. For example, you might name your sister as your primary guardian but then name your niece as the successor. In the event that your sister dies or otherwise can’t serve, your niece can take over as the guardian to your pets.
You should also name a shelter or sanctuary as a retirement home in case your guardian and successor guardians die while your pets are still living., Your pets will not live forever, and if any money remains after they die, then that money must be distributed. You should think about who you want to receive these assets, should any remain.

, A sample/fillable pet protection form is available for $39 from legalzoom at http://www.legalzoom.com/personal/estate-planning/pet-protection-agreement-overview.html.

, You can also create your own pet protection agreement by typing up a letter and signing it in front of a notary and two witnesses. The guardian must also sign before the notary and witnesses. Be sure that the letter includes the following:Your name and address.
The name of the guardian (caregiver) and successor guardians.
An organization of last resort to take your pet if none of your designated guardians can serve in the role.
A description of your pets: name, type of animal, gender, and physical description (such as age, coat and eye color, and size).
Detailed instructions for the pet’s care.
Any funds you have left for the pet’s care. Name the source, such as a bank name and account number or life insurance company and policy number.
The name of a distribution representative. This person will be in charge of holding the funds and distributing them to the guardian. Include the representative’s name and contact information. Also name a successor distribution representative.
The name of any successor beneficiaries. Include their names, addresses, and what percent of the money they will get after your pets die.
The amount of compensation for the guardian and the distribution representative. You should discuss compensation with your guardian and distribution representative before drafting your pet protection agreement.

, Once you have completed your pet protection agreement, you should give copies of the agreement to the following people:


The caregiver
Your veterinarian
A close family friend (other than the caregiver)

, Although funds are not required, you are advised to make a one-time payment when the agreement is signed.Make the payment to the caregiver. By making payment, you create a legal contract.

Of these exams, one must be Maths, and one English., In order to qualify for work as an RSPCA inspector you must have a valid UK driver’s license. You must also be able to operate a vehicle with a fully manual transmission., Some of your work as an RSPCA inspector can involve water. As such, strong swimming ability is important. In order to qualify for the role of RSPCA inspector, you must be able to swim 50 meters (164.0 ft) fully clothed within 2.5 minutes., In order to work with the RSPCA, it is required for you to have experience working with animals. You can gain experience by volunteering with an animal welfare charity, animal refuge, or ideally for an RSPCA animal care center., This job can be physically demanding, requiring you to lift heavy objects or animals, run, and/or swim. As such, your physical health and ability will be taken into consideration. Be sure that you are in very strong physical health, and perhaps even begin training, before you apply.Begin swimming daily.
You may want to run and/or lift weights.
Consider your diet. Focus on consuming veggies, fruit, lean meats, and whole grains.

, If you find yourself suitably qualified, the next step is to locate a trainee opening with a local RSPCA chapter. You can visit the RSPCA website to search job openings. When you find an opening near you, submit your application online.To apply you will send a curriculum vitae (or resume) and cover letter, along with a brief application.
In these materials, you will outline the ways in which you meet various minimum qualifications, as well why you are a good fit for the position.

, If you are chosen to move on to the next level, you will be invited to a Selection Board Interview, where you will be asked about your background and criminal history. If you pass this phase (called Preliminary Declaration), you will then be asked to participate in a series of psychometric assessments, as well as a physical examination and fitness assessment. Based on the results of these tests, the selection board will determine whether or not you are suitable for this role., If you are selected to move on as an RSPCA trainee, you will head into your first of 26 training modules. (You must pass all 26 to qualify). Each module will take between one and eight weeks, and you must pass all 26 within one year of registering for your first. Lodging and board is provided during training modules.Training modules will cover subject areas including: investigation skills and interview techniques, court work, media and public speaking, boat rescue techniques, and basic veterinary and animal-handling skills.Typically, training modules must be completed in a consecutive order.

, Near the beginning of your training, you will be asked to undergo a swimming assessment. Some of your time working the RSPCA may be on, in, or around water, so being able to swim well is a crucial component of the job. For this assessment, you will be expected to swim 50 meters (164.0 ft) fully clothed in 2.5 minutes or less., After you have completed your training, you will be given an official job offer by the RSPCA. Be aware that this job may require you to relocate to a new area. Congratulations! You have succeeded in becoming an RSPCA inspector., These hours and dates will not be negotiable, so it is important to consider if you will be happy with the schedule before pursuing this career., A major component of this career is time spent on the road. If you become an RSPCA inspector, understand that you may travel over 25,000 miles (40,234 kilometers) each year. You must operate a manual transmission vehicle, traveling across both urban and rural landscapes., Working as an RSPCA inspector involves periods of very high physical activity. You may need to run and swim. You may need to work at heights, or in confined spaces. You will also be required to lift heavy cages, and carry, haul, and otherwise handle animals., Perhaps even more taxing than the physical demands of working for the RSPCA are the psychological demands. You will experience a great deal of confrontation with other humans, and you must be able to stand your ground. You will encounter animals in poor situations. You may need to restrain or even euthanize an animal. All of this can be hard on the average person., In order to succeed as an RSPCA inspector, you must have exemplary communication skills. You must be able to defuse situations and confrontations. You must be able to talk yourself out of difficult situations. Most of all, you must be able to communicate clearly, concisely and assertively."
"
Be an example.,
Observe whether this is the time and place to talk about it.,
Be sensitive.,
Get clarification.,
Listen to their feelings.,
Challenge ideas with questions, not comments.,
Know what you're talking about.,
Remember that many people buy from pet stores and breeders on a whim, because something is cute.,
If they have already gotten a pet from a ""problem"" source (pet store or breeder) instead of ""solution"" source (shelter or rescue), skip the lecture about it.,
Remember, if your conversation didn't convert them to your full idea set, you have still succeeded in planting the seed.",How to Educate People About Pet Adoption," If you purchase exotic pets or haven't spayed your cat, take a look at yourself first.;
, If you're in the middle of eating dinner with a friend, talking about sports, now is not the time to chime in that they should never buy a dog from a puppy mill. If, on the other hand, your friend tells you they're thinking of buying a cat from a breeder, this might be the perfect time to have this talk.

, If you want to have a conversation that might help animals and people, be prepared to start with the assumption that who ever you are talking to has valid thoughts and feelings. If they fear that an adopted animal might be unteachable, attack, or be sickly and die, do not laugh and call them paranoid, listen to their concerns and reassure them if appropriate without discounting their fears.

, If you believe that the person you're talking to has just said that mixed breed pets aren't as loving, check with them to see if that's what they really meant.

, They have emotional reasons for doing things, just like all of us. Having a baby purebred agouti dumbo rat may feel like a luxury they've earned, or getting an Amazon parrot from the wild may feel exciting to them. Pinpoint the feeling they want, and see if you can't fulfill that feeling through adoption.

, Asking questions also allows people to explore what their personal answer might be if they haven't thought of it before. It is more productive to say ""Do you think that supporting the hamster breeder is as good for hamsters in general as helping fund a shelter by adopting one of their orphans?"" is going to get you a lot further than saying ""When you buy a hamster, that evil breeder just makes more to turn a profit. They make the problem worse by creating more hamsters. If you get one from a breeder or pet store you are evil.""

, You lose credibility if you claim that there are hermit crab breeders (there are not) or that all dog shelters euthanize (they do not). If you don't know something, it's okay to admit that and look it up later.

, One important step for helping animals is choosing forethought over instant gratification. If your someone is discussing how they might acquire a pet with you, they've already resisted impulse buying. Give them credit and appreciation for this.

, Making them defensive won't help. Now is the time to talk about proper animal husbandry, spaying and neutering, proper veterinary care, planning for the animals entire lifespan, and perhaps encourage them to volunteer at a shelter as a way of learning more about their new pet.

, They may be thinking about this conversation for days and months. Feels good that you did what you could to educate.

Use an appropriate fawn replacement formula or goat's milk.,
Add suitable supplements along with the goat's milk or fawn replacement formula, depending on the fawn's size:


Newborn fawns: They are about the same size as two chihuahuas (more or less) and are unable to process solid foods as of yet.,
Make sure that the nipple hole size is appropriate.,
Heat up the formula so that it is slightly over lukewarm before feeding it to the deer.,
Use a funnel to fill two bottles (per deer per feeding) with the formula or milk.,
Hold the bottles up high when feeding.",How to Bottle Feed an Orphaned Fawn," Do not use cow's milk as this can cause complications for a fawn (see Warnings below).


A baby deer should preferably be fed a substitute that can be found at Tractor Supply stores (animal feed/farm supplies stores) or from some farms. If that is unavailable or too expensive, the next best thing is goat's milk (as they are in a similar family), which can usually be purchased at Walmart (large box stores) or other supply stores.;
, For fawns this size, add seven drops of lactate to the formula/milk being used.
Baby fawns: If the deer is about the size you would see in a movie (like, say Bambi), add some baby rice or baby cereal (or a substitute along those lines) with water until the consistency is about that of pudding. You will know the deer is ready to begin solid food when it begins to consume some of its own accord (like eating flowers or grass).
Older fawns: For older deer you may add a mashed up banana for the extra protein and potassium, but be sure the seeds do not clog up the nipple of the bottle.

, The hole in the nipple should be about a centimeter and a half at most for very young deer, going up to possibly two centimeters for a large deer. If the hole is too large, the milk may be consumed too quickly and upset the fawn's stomach. Of course, if it is too small, the fawn will have a difficult time getting the milk out. It is usually best to start with a centimeter and a half and see how the deer reacts.

, Cold formula can be unappealing to the point where the fawn may refuse it and it can also cause colic. Still, be sure it's not too hot either. If it feels uncomfortable to your hand when holding, this will hurt the deer when it goes down its throat, so wait until it cools some more.

, The fawn should be fed twice a day.

, It may seem uncomfortable to us but it allows easier access to the milk and also adds a sense of familiarity, as this is how the fawn would feed from a standing mother.

Read books and magazines to find out all about an animals life, also there are lots of helpful things on the internet and you could ask your local bookstore if they have any animal encyclopedias.,
Go to the zoo.,
Help animals that are abused or going extinct.,
Save Wolves because many people believe these animals are bloodthirsty; the folklore traveled for generations, and now wolves are almost extinct for too much hunting.,
Adopt or sponsor an animal.

,
Start a club in school, at work, or with friends and neighbors you think will help.

,
Volunteer time at your local animal shelter even if you can't donate food or supplies.,
Get in touch with nature.,
Start an organization.,
Dress in clothing that has an animal theme.,
If you find anyone around you harassing or annoying an animal, Stop them at once.,
Consider going vegan/vegetarian.",How to Show Your Love for Animals," Spend a bit of time reading them, if you are a bookworm, you could read for the minimum of half an hour. If you are not, just look through the book and read the things that look interesting.;
, Sometimes you can learn things about animals too. Learn as much as you can about the plight of endangered species. Some endangered species include tigers, lions, polar bears, panda bears, many birds and even insects too.

, Consider donating to any animal welfare causes, some of them are listed below.



Help dolphins because they are very endangered but very easy to help if you put your mind to it. They have many dangers including: Hunters, pollution, accidental deaths in fishing nets and many more. There are adopt a dolphin programs that let you give in money for the WDCS (Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society) and sometimes you can get a free dolphin fun pack. If you are young, your parents might not like the price, especially if they are not real animal lovers.







Help dogs because they too are in trouble. You can sponsor a dog. Like the adopt a dolphin program, it gives you a free dog fun pack. The Dogs Trust program needs only 1 pound a month to care for dogs who have been neglected, abandoned, etc.







, While these animals are peaceful creatures and help the deer and elk population (by eating out the old and sick ones), people unfortunately don't believe. Luckily, Defenders of Wildlife has an 'Adopt a Wolf' where it will give you a 'Fun Pack'.

,,, It's a great way to show you love animals and are willing to spend time with them to help. Even to make them feel confident that most people are just there to help them. They love all the attention they can get.

, For example; feed birds, squirrels, observe animals, and more.

, You could have something simple like a garage sale and give the money to your local animal welfare center. Or, you could dance, sing, or do practically anything for people and earn money for it. Your animal shelter will appreciate it, even if it's just a couple dollars. It will someday make a difference in the lives of many animals who have to spend part -if not all- of their life in the pound. Also, you can adopt pets from the animal shelter instead of from a place where they bread them on purpose. There are so many strays that need homes and to be fixed. There's just not enough homes for them all.

, Show your love for animals by wearing clothes with cats, dolphins, or any animal on it. If you don't have any clothing like that, and if you can sew, make a shape of an animal onto your jeans. Just a simple little picture, believe or not, can make a huge difference to someone who is looking for people who care about animals.

, Animal abuse is a crime, so always learn to respect the animals around you.

, It's a great way to show your love for all animals.

Send a letter to your local representatives or members of parliament to say how you feel about the imminent extinction of animals.,
Draw pictures and make a sign or poster.,
Study wildlife and animals and make sure that you know every fact about them.,
Make a book of facts of your favorite animal.,
Make a puppet show and try to make it funny.,
Try to form a club or build a website.,
Avoid buying products that come from endangered species.,
Watch your diet.",How to Take Action to Help Save Animals," Use facts to back up what you are writing. A good place to start is looking for reputable sites on the internet, such as government, United Nations and international conservation organizations' sites.;
, Place this sign somewhere at school or where people will see it, and use bright colors to attract attention. Add text that makes it clear why you are concerned about the loss of a species or animal. If you make it local (i.e., select an animal from your area), this will carry greater resonance with the people who read it and may motivate them to do something.

, This will enable you to talk with authority about the subject, which always convinces people more than just saying general comments without anything to back up your concerns.

, This will help and you may even think about getting it published. Use your own words and don't copy anything. Acknowledge other people's ideas if you have relied on them. Distribute your book at libraries, community centers and other places where people like to pick up materials.

, Use the puppet show to send a message about the plight of species and animals that are facing extinction. Write a script so that you are not left searching for words.

, You could even combine a club on a website. Add text about your concerns on extinction, load up photos of your letters, your signs on display and even videos of your puppet show. Make the site interactive - have a place where people can leave comments. If you make it into a club, have a place where people can join. It can also be a great idea to give them volunteer activities to do so that they can join in and help the animals also.

, When you travel, be careful about what you buy. Some souvenirs are made from endangered animals or from endangered tree species from forests that the animals rely on to survive. Prefer handcrafted items made from sustainable resources that benefit both the community making these items and also protect the local wildlife., Many of our fish species are being over-fished and are being pushed to extinction.It is important to only eat fish that are derived from a sustainable source. Even meat and some grains and beans result in habitat loss that endanger local native animals. Always do your homework first and if you discover a food chain that is resulting in destruction of wildlife habitat, return to step 1 and write to your representatives or members of parliament and ask that action be taken immediately to stop this and to foster sustainable agriculture.

Don't litter.,
If you see other people mindlessly trample animal homes, nicely remind them of the damage they're causing.,
Cut up those plastic eight pack rings you get from soda cans before you throw them away.,
Go green, and turn off the lights when you leave the room, turn off the water when you don't need it, walk instead of drive, and get cloth bags instead of the plastic bags at the grocery stores.,
Spread the word!!,
Create a website devoted to saving them if you have time, it works wonders.

,
Write a letter to the government and try to convince them that whatever you want them to do will work.

,
Create a group on Facebook or something, or create a weekly, monthly group who's goal is to help animals.

,
Donate to the ASPCA or the Audubon society.

",How to Protect Animals with Your Actions," This is the single most easy way to harm the environment. Littering increases damage of habitats, and is a possible choking hazard, especially to animals foraging for food. It also ruins the view... so stop littering and start doing the 5R's;
, Do the same if you see people chasing birds, throwing rocks at animals,nests, anything that is harmful, or could be harmful in the future. Old bird nests can be homes for birds that return year after year to the same place. Try not to get too frustrated if they just don't ""get"" it.

, They are very real choking items for seabirds that get their head stuck in them while foraging for food.(Often in Trash Cans...)

, These will help animals in the long run. It will also help the environment. Need help, search Google or Yahoo!

, The more people helping animals, the better the chance of saving them! One person can make a difference, but many will make a much more benefiting change to animals.

Pressure politicians to support reefs.",How to Protect Coral Reefs," Running your boat into a coral reef can cause it serious damage. Protecting coral reefs depends on what experts call proper ""vessel management."" Understand where coral reefs are so your boat doesn't strike them, even incidentally. People can also damage coral reefs simply by touching them.Corals on reefs are actually small animals. This living ecosystem is thus very fragile and susceptible to damage. The coral animals are not mobile. They live in colonies, and possess skeletons of hard calcium carbonate, which is what gives the coral reef its structure.
Remember the feet. Control your flippers when diving or snorkeling so you don't accidentally touch a coral reef.;
, Contact with things like anchors and fishing nets is a key way that coral reefs die or suffer damage. Don't anchor your boat on a coral reef. Instead, anchor your boat in an area with a sandy bottom or use a mooring. You could also use an installed buoy instead of an anchor. Fishing lines, nets, and fishing hooks all cause damage to coral reefs. This is just another reason why it's best to take your fishing elsewhere. Figure out where coral reefs are located before you venture into the ocean.
Don't discharge wastewater from your boat into the ocean. Find an acceptable wastewater discharge facility in the area instead. , Leaving behind things like fishing nets or general garbage on a beach can harm coral reefs. Throwing litter into the ocean itself can eventually cause the trash to come into contact with the coral reef.


When trash ends up on a coral reef, it can actually smother the corals. Remember, they are living organisms. Sometimes people see corals as they see shells. However, corals are alive and, thus, they are very susceptible to harm.Littering can also cause harm or even kill the fish that populate coral reefs. The technical term for this kind of litter is ""marine debris."" Marine debris also damages other organisms on coral reefs that are necessary for their survival.
Some organizations sponsor beach cleanups. If you help pick up other people's litter on beaches, in addition to not littering yourself, you will help coral reefs. , Many people enjoy snorkeling near coral reefs because of their unique beauty. Snorkelers and divers can cause serious damage to coral reefs, especially in areas with heavy tourism.


Don't ever pull a piece of coral reef off to take with you. They say you should leave only bubbles and take only pictures when you are in the ocean. Remember that you are destroying a living organism if you do take a piece of the reef.
Practice snorkeling before you venture anywhere near a coral reef, so you don't come into accidental contact with it.Stay horizontal in the water and avoid kicking sand or flailing around with your fins. Don't swim too fast or use your arms when swimming. If you touch a coral reef, it can cause you harm, too. People have been cut and stung by coral reefs. Don't get too close to a coral reef while wearing a lot of sunscreen. The oils from the lotion causes coral reefs damage. , You shouldn't take anything out of the ocean that's alive, or buy it in a store, either. In some countries, you will find jewelry and other souvenirs made out of coral. Don't buy them. It is illegal to sell coral in some countries. Coral can take a long time to grow, so taking it for your aquarium or jewelry box can have a lasting effect that will take years to undo. Red and pink coral is especially prized as jewelry because of its coloring. It comes from deeper waters. Don't purchase coral reef fish, either. Inquire about marine fish before you buy them in pet stores. You want fish that were bred in captivity. , Hotels can make a big impact on the environment. They are often close to shores, and a lot of people pass through them. Support hotels with policies designed to reduce pollution.


Hotels that have programs to treat sewage and offer recycling and other sustainability measures can help protect coral reefs by improving the overall environment around them. Tourism associated with coral reefs is one of the fastest growing segments of the tourism industry, so it could make a big difference if more hotels are pressured by consumers to adopt sustainable practices. , Coral reefs are damaged when the general environment around them declines. So, you can help protect coral reefs simply by leading a more sustainable lifestyle.


Plant trees. Trees reduce runoff into oceans, and runoff can damage coral reefs.
Reduce your carbon footprint. This really matters. Increasing carbon dioxide in the air can lead to global warming, which can harm coral reefs. It's all interconnected. Ways to reduce your carbon footprint include biking to work and using a clothes line.Use less water. This will help decrease runoff, which is a key way that coral reefs are harmed. Use organic fertilizer to avoid chemicals running into the ecosystem. Don't assume that chemicals in your garden or on your farm won't find their way back into the ocean just because you don't live near it. , Some coral reefs are located near shores. They can be damaged by various aspects of land development and construction, including the building of marinas, docks, and plowing of fields. When sediment and silt loosen because of development and construction and end up in the ocean, this can block sunlight and cause corals to die because they need sunlight to thrive.
Sediment can actually bury the corals, killing them or stopping them from growing completely.
Metals, pesticide, herbicide and other chemicals associated with mining, and runoff from landfills, agricultural, and urban development projects can damage corals as well as the fish around them.

, General worsening of the environment is an indirect way that people are causing harm to coral reefs. They are very sensitive to rising water temperatures, which cause them harm. Reducing your carbon footprint also helps stop global warming.


As little as a one-degree rise in water temperature causes coral reef damage. Coral bleaching is a key indicator that coral reefs are unhealthy, and it's been increasing since the 1980s. Algae inside the reef provide its color, and bleaching of the coral occurs when algae are either missing or die.Warmer ocean temperatures can also spur the growth of algae that is harmful to coral reefs because it blocks the sun that they need to thrive.
When oceans heat up, they have more carbon dioxide in them. This slows the growth of coral reefs by making it harder for corals to create calcium carbonate skeletons.

, If you consume fish caught in a way that damages coral reefs, you are part of the problem. Not using products obtained through damaging the environment is a way to help protect the reefs. Understand which fish are caught in a way that damages reefs, and spread the word.


In some countries, people actually blow up coral reefs with explosives so they can more easily catch the fish that cluster around them. Then, they sell the fish to restaurants and stores.
Another devastating fishing method involves putting cyanide into the water to stun fish. This kills the coral reefs around them.Overfishing is another way that damage is caused to coral reefs. There is economic pressure in some countries to fish in this manner because coral reefs can provide as much as one-quarter of the fish eaten in some developing countries. Don't eat fish caught with bottom trawling methods. Bottom trawling is so damaging that it can destroy reefs that could live for thousands more years and exist deep in the ocean. An example of a fish sometimes caught through bottom trawling is orange roughy. , Since 1998, the U.S. government has extensively mapped coral reefs to track their decline. The governmental efforts often link with private groups that accept donations and volunteers, as well as state and local efforts to protect reefs. Global efforts also exist to protect reefs.


In Australia, the government has created ways for people to get involved to help protect the Great Barrier Reef. The government has created a monitoring program that allows average people to contribute to reef protection by reporting their own observations and data. Scientists study detailed maps that alert them to bleaching of coral reefs, which can be caused by rising sea temperatures and algal blooms. The data is so sophisticated that scientists receive updates every hour, focusing on coral reefs in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They monitor barometric pressure, tide levels, air and water temperature, and other factors important to coral reefs.
Scientists are breeding coral reefs and then testing different varieties in environments with greater acidity and other conditions. They have also found ways to plant corals in the ocean and to spur their growth by using electrical currents.

, There are many organizations that work hard to stop destruction of coral reefs. Some even build artificial reefs to replace destroyed or damaged coral reefs.


The Coral Reef Alliance, Reef Relief, and Planetary Coral Reef Foundation are examples of private organizations trying to save coral reefs. The organizations, and others like them, offer numerous ways for people to get involved. You can sign up as a volunteer for a coral reef organization and become involved in events and education. Join a reef cleanup.Many of the organizations rely on donations.
Some reef protection organizations have educational programs for children. Reef Relief offers a coral camp in Key West, Florida to educate children about the value of coral reefs.

, Many people touch or otherwise harm coral reefs without intending to do so. They may simply not understand that reefs are full of fragile living creatures or realize that the smallest contact can cause them harm. Helping educate as many people as possible about coral reefs can make a difference.


Many non-profit organizations devoted to reef protection offer extensive information about reefs on their websites. You can sign a pledge refusing to use coral jewelry. Governmental websites, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, offer detailed information about coral reefs, their importance, and protection. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which was created by U.S. Congress, also works extensively on the issue. The Coral Reef Alliance urges people to educate others about the importance of reefs, and has free social media badges available that people can share to alert others to their support for protecting coral. They also offer e-cards., Legal mechanisms that protect coral reefs can be critical. Let your politicians know that you want them to support measures that will ensure coral reefs suffer less damage.


Creating marine protected areas is a measure that can make a difference. Read up on local action strategies so you understand what is already being done in your area and others. The U.S. Coral Reef Task Force develops federal and state strategies to protect coral reefs.

Boycott puppy stores.,
Adopt from a shelter or rescue.,
Visit the breeder.,
Verify the puppy’s age.",How to Help Shut Down Puppy Mills1," Almost every pet and puppy store that sells puppies receives their dogs from a puppy mill. Buying these dogs, even to rescue them from the store, will encourage mills to keep breeding dogs in abusive conditions.


Some pet stores may advertise their puppies as coming from USDA breeders, but this does not mean that the puppies came from humane conditions. Stores that sell puppies from USDA breeders are actually more likely to buy from puppy mills.Some pet stores will hold adoption events by bringing in dogs from local shelters. Verify with your local shelter that these dogs do indeed come from them before adopting at one of these events.
Puppies sold online also often come from puppy mills.;
, Animal shelters and rescues are the best place to adopt dogs in need of a home. Many will even adopt out puppies or younger abandoned dogs. By adopting dogs from shelters, you make room for more dogs to have homes.Check out your local Humane Society or Society for the Protection of Animals (SPCA) for adoptions.
Your county or municipality may run an animal shelter where you can adopt animals. These will often post adoptable dogs or puppies on their website. They may even have special events where they waive the adoption fees.
If you’re looking for a specific breed, research a rescue that works with that particular breed. For example, if you want a greyhound, look for a greyhound rescue.

, If you want to purchase a purebred puppy, find a local breeder yourself, and visit their kennel. This is the only way to guarantee that they are a humane breeder and not a puppy mill.When adopting from a breeder, check out the living situation of the puppies. Make sure that they have clean bedding and that they are free to roam during the day.
Examine both the puppies and their mother carefully for any signs of disease or malnutrition.
Just because a puppy has papers from a kennel club does not mean that they were bred responsibly. Always check the kennel for yourself.

, Many puppy mills will sell a puppy as young as six weeks.A reputable breeder will never remove the puppy from its litter before eight weeks of age, and some will wait until up to twelve weeks. To make sure your puppy is old enough to leave the litter, you should try to check its age.


Ask for documentation that the dog has received their eight week vaccinations.This should be signed by a veterinarian, who you can call to authenticate the records. This will prove both that the puppy is healthy and that they are the right age.
Eight week old puppies will be running around, and their eyes will be fully open. They should be fully weaned off their mother’s milk and capable of eating solid foods. They will sleep about 18 to 20 hours a day, but when they are awake, they will be active.

Research your local laws.,
Find evidence of neglect.,
Contact the authorities.,
Inform an animal defense organization.,
Rehome the rescued dogs.",How to Help Shut Down Puppy Mills2," In the US, puppy mills are regulated by the USDA. As long as the mills provide dogs with basic care, such as food, shelter, and water, they are allowed to operate under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). This means that the puppy mill may not be illegal, and you cannot take direct action. That said, some states and counties have specific animal welfare laws that might restrict or outlaw these mills.In the US and Canada, there are about 70 municipalities that require pet stores to get their animals from shelters and not breeders or mills. If you live in one of these municipalities, you can find stores that buy from mills and report them.

, Because puppy mills are permitted under the AWA, you may have to prove that there is extreme neglect in the mill to force it to close. This can be extremely difficult to do. As long as puppy mills provide the dogs with basic food, water, and shelter, they can keep as many dogs as they like, even in dismal conditions. That said, you can start to slowly build a case.


If the dogs are sheltered outside in kennels with no protection from the elements, you may be able to make a case for animal neglect.
If you know of sick puppies that came from the mill, you may be able to demonstrate that the mill is not providing sanitary care.
Never trespass on property or break into a facility that you suspect might be a puppy mill. You can be arrested, and this will not help close the puppy mill. Instead, gather what information you can legally, and file a report with the authorities.

, If you have evidence that a puppy mill is neglecting their dogs, you can contact the appropriate authorities to shut them down. There are many different legal venues you can reach to open an investigation.The USDA is responsible for overseeing puppy mills and breeders in the US. In most cases, they will be the first and only place to file a complaint.In the UK, your local authority is responsible for licensing breeders or puppy farms. Visit your council for more information about reporting a puppy farm.If puppy mills are illegal in your area, you can contact law enforcement to report your suspicion of a local puppy mill. They will handle the investigation and collect evidence.

, It can be extremely difficult to shut down a puppy mill on your own, and it is not advised that you contact the mill yourself directly. Instead, reach out to a local or national organization with experience in animal defense. They will be prepared to handle the legal aspects of the closure. Some places you might call include:


Animal Legal Defense Fund
Humane Society of the United States
The Puppy Mill Project
National Mill Dog Rescue

, If you do manage to shut down the puppy mill, you should make sure that all of the dogs find new homes. Otherwise, the dogs will likely end up at a shelter, and many might be euthanized.


You should petition friends on your social media sites to encourage them to adopt or to share the news that these dogs need homes.
Upload notices on websites like Petfinder and Adopt-a-Pet to reach out to potential homes.
You can hold an adoption event where you pair the dogs with new owners.
You may want to organize temporary shelter for these dogs at a local no-kill shelter.

You should have everyone involved. It's not all about you. If you are in a family or group living situation, you have others to consider.
What preferences do you have for a rescue, if any? Do some research. Some 'specialties' are: Senior, chronically ill, disabled, black, breed, etc.;
, Most rescues will greatly appreciate any help with fostering animals. This will give you an idea of the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds that you may encounter with a rescued dog.

, You can get to know the type of dog without the commitment that taking one home with you takes.

, Print it out in black or white (or write it down).

,, Be advised that some rescues will require you to take training classes.

, This isn't just doing a feel good project and forgetting it. The ideal is a permanent home for your pet.

, That can help you a bit with understanding behaviors, such as your spotted dog that wants to herd everyone, including yourself!

, The rescue, if large enough, might help you with the costs, or it may not.

Avoid products that are tested on animals.,
Do not buy products made from animals.,
Look for the Leaping Bunny.",How to Help Stop Cruelty Towards Animals1," A variety of products, from cosmetics to pharmaceutical drugs, are tested on animals. Animal rights advocates disagree with the use of such products for a variety of reasons. Testing causes painful physical side effects for animals, lab conditions are often cramped and unpleasant, and animals are often killed or die unintentionally during the process.Know what products are likely to be tested on animals and avoid such products.


Olay, one of the world's largest skin care companies, carries out 400,000 skin care safety tests each year, many of which are likely conducted on animals.Avon, a cosmetics company, does not conduct tests on animals as a company but many of their ingredients come from outside facilities known for animal testing.Garnier, known for shampoo and make-up, is one of the most well-known users of animal testing for their products.Neutrogena, a skin care company, claims they do not test their products on animals. However, their parent company Johnson and Johnson claims to minimize animal testing but acknowledges that they do sometimes engage in the practice.M.A.C cosmetics resumed animal testing in 2012 after previously having sworn off the practice.;
, Many products we buy at the local supermarket or department store contain ingredients that come from animals. It's not just the obvious culprits, like leather and fur, that you must avoid to end cruelty. Look for the following ingredients, which are frequently found in every day products like toothpaste, nail polish, perfume, shampoo, and conditioner.If you see one of the following listed on a label, you might want to reconsider your purchase.


Albumin, the protein component of egg whites, is found in many processed foods.Carmine, the red coloring made from a ground up insect, is found in packaged cookies and crackers, refried beans, tortillas, and ready made pie crusts.Casein, a milk protein, is found in many soy cheeses.Wood glue is the specific glue made from horses, and found in musical instruments and furniture.Keratin is protein from hooves, horns, and animal hairs and often found in shampoos.Plywood, used in a variety of wood-based products, uses a glue made from animal blood., The Leaping Bunny Program is an initiative lead by the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC). It provides the best possible assurance that a product is free of animal testing.The Leaping Bunny does extensive investigation of cosmetic, skin care, household products, and hair care companies to assure no animal testing is used. The often find companies that claim to be ""testing free"" use ingredients from facilities that test on animals.The CCIC's website provides an ethical shopping guide, with listings of companies that do not animal test.The Leaping Bunny symbol is a black line drawing of a rabbit enveloped with two blue steaks and a couple of stars. Look for it on products to assure yourself they're animal safe.

Donate to a tiger research fund.,
Adopt a tiger.,
Visit zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.,
Volunteer at a tiger sanctuary.,
Travel to a tiger reserve.",How to Help Save Tigers1," The easiest way to join the effort to save tigers is to donate your money to the various organizations dedicated to saving wildlife. There are many organizations out there, so it is really important to do your homework before you choose one to donate to. Some organizations that have their own tiger programs include:


(United with the Save the Tigers Fund)
Wildlife Fund
Tiger Conservation Fund
Fund for Animal Welfare
Cat Rescue
Tiger Sanctuary
Sadly, there are plenty of scams out there that take advantage of the plight of the tigers. You can choose a one time donation or a monthly donation.;
, The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) offers an adopt a tiger program. You can symbolically adopt a tiger and help fund the work the WWF is doing with your adoption donation. There are different adoption packages available, ranging from $55 to $250.Your money will go towards creating reserves for tigers, protection from poachers, and other WWF conservation work.
In addition to knowing that you are helping this special creature, you also receive a photo and information card of the tiger you are helping to save, along with a plush version of your tiger.

, Some zoos participate in Species Survival Plans, which are sanctioned breeding plans to help save tigers. Only visit zoos that are accredited by the AZA. There are currently 223 zoos and aquariums around the world that meet the AZA’s strict requirements.


For a list of accredited zoos and aquariums that you can visit or donate to, visit the Association of Zoos and Aquariums website.These zoos keep their animals, including their tigers, in excellent living conditions, and are doing what they can to support the healthy breeding of animals on the endangered list.
You can also visit wildlife sanctuaries that do not let visitors handle their animals and do not participate in breeding. There are also wildlife rehabilitators, universities working on establishing wild animals, and some traveling circuses that meet all of the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.
If you are not sure of the status of a zoo or wildlife area you are hoping to visit, run an internet search on the institution., There are many sanctuaries and reserves that accept volunteers and interns around the world. These volunteers help maintain the grounds, observe the animals, and perform other various chores and tasks. In some places, volunteers can lead tours of the grounds and talk about the tigers with visitors.You can run an internet search to explore options near you.
Some of the most prominent sanctuaries that accept volunteers include the National Tiger Sanctuary and Big Cat Rescue. You can also try a GoEco program.

, Tiger reserves are large plots of the tigers’ native land that has been specifically designated for the tigers. Of course, visiting a tiger reserve means flying to places like India or Nepal. If you have the ability to do so, then while you are there you should join a tour operated by the park service of the country.They rely on the income from tourism to help pay for part of their expenses. Tourism also brings money to the area where the reserve is located, which in turn inspires support for the reserve from the local community.
Do some research on the tour company before you fly off to visit the tiger reserve or national park.

Talk to your local representatives.,
Circulate a petition.,
Volunteer to work at a local animal shelter.,
Raise money for a local rescue.",How to Help Shut Down Puppy Mills3," If you want to make puppy mills illegal, you should reach out to your local municipal, state, province, or council leaders. Let them know that you want new regulatory laws to be introduced to outlaw puppy mills.Calling or writing letters to your representatives will let them know that you are serious about this issue. You might even want to organize a campaign where you get others to all call about the same issue at the same time.

, Petitions are a good way of encouraging your local representatives to take action. Write up a petition for stricter regulations for breeders. You can stand out in front of grocery stores, universities, and shopping centers to encourage people to sign, or you can start an online petition that you share through email and social media.


Websites like Change.Org or The Petition Site are good places to start petitions.
If there is an existing petition with many signatures, you might sign that instead of making your own. Share it with your friends so that they can help it gain momentum.

, Animal shelters are often in dire need of volunteers to help walk, feed, clean, and socialize their dogs. By volunteering, you’re helping them reduce costs, and enabling more dogs to find homes.Many animal shelters will post forms on their websites for volunteers.
Volunteering is a great way for younger advocates to get involved in caring for animals.

, By raising money for animal shelters, you can help stray dogs find homes. This will reduce the business that puppy mills do, thus helping them close forever.


You can sell homemade cookies, cakes, lemonade, or jam. You can donate the money to a local shelter, or use the money to buy pet food and supplies for your local shelter.
You might set up a fundraising page on a crowdfunding website to encourage people to donate to your cause.
Research carefully to make sure that the shelter or rescue you are donating to will use the money on animals and not on their own administration costs. Ask them to show you where their money is going before making the donation.

Tell your friends to adopt.,
Explain what problems a mill puppy may have.,
Share articles on social media.",How to Help Shut Down Puppy Mills4," To reduce the amount of business that puppy mills receive, encourage friends and families to adopt their dogs from shelters or rescues instead of buying them from stores.If someone you know mentions that they want to adopt a puppy, you can say, “That’s sounds great. Are you going to rescue one from the shelter? That’s the best way to find a healthy puppy that wasn’t born in a mill.”
If they want a purebred, you can offer to go check out the breeder with them. You can say, “Make sure you visit the breeder so you know that the puppy didn’t come from a mill. I’d love to come check it out with you if you’re worried about that.”
Always try to maintain a positive tone, and don’t criticize your friends. You’re much likelier to convince them if you remain non-judgmental and pleasant.

, If your friend seems insistent on going to a puppy mill, you might try to warn them that mill dogs are more likely to have genetic or behavioral problems. These puppies may also be infected with a disease like mange, kennel cough, or parvovirus.You might say, “You know that puppies that come from pet stores may not be as healthy, right? In fact, they’re more likely to be sick when you adopt them.”
You should also remind them, “Puppies from mills are taken from their mothers too soon. The dog may develop bad habits or behavior problems. It’s safer just to adopt.”

, When you find news stories about puppy mills, share them on social media so that your entire social network can learn about the abuses and problems caused by puppy mills. This will help prevent others from buying from mills.


You can also share links to petitions or donation drives to help shut mills down.

Buy from local farmer's markets.,
Shop from ethical grocery stores.,
Go vegetarian or vegan.,
Make your meals at home.",How to Help Stop Cruelty Towards Animals2," Buying local can help curb animal cruelty. Animals raised on local farms were likely subjected to more ethical conditions than animals on factory farms. If you can find a local farmer's market or grocery store, make that your first option when it comes to grocery shopping.


Locally raised meat is usually free from the antibiotics and growth hormones animals are force fed at factories. Animals raised on an organic diet are significantly healthier than factory raised animals.In factory farms, animals are kept in tight pens and cannot move more than a few feet. Local farms usually allow animals to be free range, meaning they can spend more time outside and are not confined to pens.When you buy meat, eggs, or cheese from a local farm, your money goes straight to supporting that farm. At a grocery store, you are more likely to be supporting a multinational food conglomerate than individual farmers. Allowing these farms the money they need to sustain themselves gives happy homes to a variety of animals., If farmer's markets aren't available in your area, try to find a grocery store that supports local markets and adheres to ethical guidelines when it comes to the buying and selling of meat.


Whole Foods, one of the biggest grocery shopping chains, buys from local markets and only stock meat products purchased from farmers that meat strict standards for animal welfare.Earth Fare, similar to Whole Foods, follows strict ethical standards when it comes to the animal products bought and sold.If you look around, you might find a local grocery store in your area that buys local.

, Many people believe the best way to curb animals cruelty is by not eating meat or by not eating animals products at all. This is called vegetarianism/veganism and if you are dedicated to the cause it's something you can consider.


Vegetarians do not eat meat, fish, and poultry. It's possible to meet all nutritional needs while maintaining a vegetarian diet.
Vegetarians find alternative sources of protein in beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, tempeh, and peas.
Vegans, in addition to not eating meat, do not eat anything with animal byproducts. This includes dairy and honey. Vegans can easily meet protein requirements as almost all foods have some protein. Chickpeas, tofu, peas, peanut butter, almonds, and other nuts are great sources of protein on a vegan diet.The vitamin B12, often found in meats and other animal-based products, is very important to maintain a healthy diet. Vegetarians and vegans can find B12 in soy meats, some cereals, soy milk, and nutritional yeast. You can also talk to your doctor about B12 supplements., You don't always know what you're getting eating out, and by cooking your own meals at home you can assure yourself you're eating ethically.


Use food you bought locally, or food that contains no hidden animals products.
If you eat meat, buy locally raised grass-fed meat from local markets.
By making meals at home, you can make sure the products you're using are cruelty free. Even when eating vegetarian options at restaurants, you never know what hidden animals products could be used in the food.
In addition to reducing animal cruelty, eating at home is also better for your health as your food is generally lower in calories and less stocked with hidden sugars and fats.

Join or donate to anti-animal cruelty organizations.,
Start a neighborhood watch.,
Report animal cruelty.,
Be a model for others.",How to Help Stop Cruelty Towards Animals3," There are a litany of organizations available you can join or donate to that are dedicated to reducing cruelty towards animals worldwide. Do some research and find which organization appeals to your views.


The Humane Society of America is one of the world's largest animal advocacy organizations. They target puppy mills, animal fighting, factory farming, seal slaughter, horse cruelty, and the slaughterhouse trade. The organization works through both large-scale political initiatives and hands-on efforts to rescue and care for unwanted animals.The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is another one of the better known animal advocacy organizations. Much like the Humane Society of America, they oppose most forms of cruelty like slaughterhouses and puppy mills and also help curb animal population by encouraging spaying and neutering of house pets. They also encourage the development of no-kill shelters and provide practical assistance such as transporting adopted animals to new homes.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a well-known but somewhat controversial animal rights organization. PETA focuses primarily on factory farms, the clothing trade, laboratory testing of animals, and use of animals in the entertainment industry. PETA often conducts investigations of companies and labs and encourages direct political action in the form of protests, petitioning, and boycotts.PETA, however, has met criticism for being more dedicated to publicity stunts than actually reducing cruelty to animals. In 2013, allegations surfaced that PETA had euthanized many of the rescued animals at their Virginia headquarters.You can also find a local animal shelter in your area and volunteer there.

, If no existing organization appeals to you personally, you can always start a neighborhood watch in your area. Invite your friends and neighbors to get to know the animals in your area and keep an eye out for suspicious behavior.


Be aware of the animals in your area. By being vigilant, and encouraging others to do the same, you'll be likely to notice potential problems, such as a formerly friendly dog suddenly becoming aggressive or skittish around people.There are many signs of animal abuse. Physical signs include collars that are too tight, open wounds or signs of recently healed wounds, fur infested with fleas or ticks, patches of missing skin or rashes, and extreme thinness.
Pay attention to the animal's environment. Are they tied up alone frequently? Are they kept outside despite poor weather conditions, like intense heat or cold? Is an animal kept in a small kennel, or one crowded with many other animals, for extended periods?
Encourage all members of your watch to stay vigilant, and if you notice any of the above signs of cruelty report it to your group and decide as a group how to proceed.

, Animal cruelty is a crime, and if you see abuse happening do not hesitate to report it to the proper authorities.


Where to report cruelty depends on your state. Contacting the local humane society is a good first step, as the workers there usually know what law agency to contact. You can also visit a local police station and ask for help.When you know who to contact, provide concise written statements that includes the dates of the incident or incidents, and any other witnesses besides yourself.
If possible, get photographic evidence of the abuse., One of the most important things you can do to endorse animal welfare is being a model for friends, family members, and co-workers.


Share your views. Do not be shy about explaining your opinions on animal cruelty and welfare. Many people are not informed about the conditions of slaughterhouses, animal testing facilities, and puppy mills. If animals come up in conversation, take this as an opportunity to keep others informed.
Use social media to your advantage. Post lists of animal-based ingredients hidden in many products, links to petitions to end animal testing, and local listings from your animal shelter of dogs at-risk for euthanasia.
If you have kids, talk to them about treating animals with kindness and respect. Young children often do not differentiate between a living dog and a plush dog. Explain to them animals have feelings and thoughts similar to our own, and need to be treated with compassion and care.

Volunteer at a shelter in your area.,
Donate to a local shelter.,
Foster a pet.,
Adopt an animal.",How to Help Stop Cruelty Towards Animals4," Whether you live in a small town or a major metropolitan area, there is probably an animal shelter near you. Directories of animal shelters are available online. Find a shelter close to you, whose values you agree with, and look into volunteering.


Most shelters have some form of training or certification program you must undergo before beginning to volunteer. Make sure you know what you need to do before you can start, and work time for training into your schedule.
Not all shelters share the same values. For example, some shelters are no-kill while some euthanize animals if they're not adopted within specific time frames. Make sure you agree with the values of the shelter you choose.
A lot of shelters have restrictions, often regarding age, for volunteers. Look into such restrictions when looking for volunteer programs.

, When you give money to a local shelter, the money goes to getting animals veterinary care, toys, blankets, beds, food, treats, and a variety of new supplies.


You do not necessarily have to donate to a shelter in your area. If, for example, your local shelter does not have a no-kill policy and you disagree with this, you can send your money elsewhere. Many shelters take donations online.
A monetary donation is not the only way to give back to a shelter. You can donate any amount of pet supplies. Just ask about any restrictions beforehand. Some shelters have bans on particular brands of food, litter, and toys.
If you're getting married or throwing a big party, you can donate part of your gift registry. You can request that guests donate to a particular shelter rather than buying you a present., If you're unable adopt an animal of your own, many shelters have programs where you can foster an animal until they find a permanent home.


There are a variety of reasons animal shelters seek fosters. The shelter is sometimes not big enough to house all the animals. An animal may be recovering from surgery or sickness and cannot be around other animals. Some animals do not do well in shelters and show signs of stress and need extra socialization.Many people worry about getting attached to their foster pet. This is a risk. Most shelters allow foster homes to adopt their pets if they meet all the requirements. However, if you cannot adopt your foster pet the experience is still rewarding. Fostering frees up space for other animals and allows the shelter to learn more about the foster pet's personality, upping that pet's chances at finding a permanent home. Reminding yourself of these benefits can help with some of the emotional difficulty., If you have the time and space, consider adopting a pet from the shelter. This is a direct way to improve the life of animal that's suffering.


Adopting can save a life, as 2.7 million shelter pets are euthanized each year. Because of limited space, pets are sometimes euthanized if they cannot find homes.Adoption takes business away from puppy mills. Puppy mills are factory style breeding facilities where house dogs in poor conditions, keeping them in very small cages and breeding them over and over again. When dogs are no longer able to breed, they are often abandon or killed."

You can participate, or even help run, these events in your area.Run an internet search to find out if there are any events happening in your area.

, In the United States, write to your U.S. Representative, asking them to support the Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act (H.R. 1998/S. 1381). Organizations dedicated to the preservation and rightful treatment of big cats have called on Congress to pass the Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act (H.R. 1998/S. 1381).The Act calls for:


An amendment to the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, effectively ending the private breeding of big cats like tigers, as well as lions, leopards, and cheetahs. It is estimated that over 10,000 big cats are kept in bad conditions throughout the United States.Penalties for violators of the Act. If someone is abusing or badly mistreating their animals, the Act calls for up to $20,000 in fines and a jail sentence of up to five years, during which time the animals would be confiscated and rehabilitated.
There is an online letter that you can send to your representative. You will find this drafted letter here.

, Another way you can get involved is to sign petitions covering various aspects of tiger conservation. Petitions cover stopping the tiger trade, preventing deforestation, and ending the sale of tiger products.You can find petitions through petition websites like change.org and tiger conservation websites.

, The best way to keep on top of the news regarding the work being done to help save tigers is by signing up for newsletters through various wildlife, and specifically tiger, protection organizations.These emails will update you on the new challenges being faced, the steps being taken to help, and the victories being won.

, Encourage others to support the efforts being made to save the tigers. Social media is a very handy tool for this. Post links to interesting articles about the plight of the tigers and spread word about petitions that your friends and family can sign.You can also follow your favorite tiger organizations on Facebook, Twitter, or any of the other various platforms out there.

Buy products from sustainable companies.,
Buy sustainable palm oil.,
Buy sustainable coffee.,
Avoid purchasing tiger products.",How to Help Save Tigers3," One of the major reasons tigers are endangered is because their home is being destroyed. Illegal logging and forest clearing are destroying the habitat that tigers live in, causing them to become displaced without enough food or land to sustain themselves.One way that you can help is by purchasing your goods from companies that only implement sustainable practices. You can also purchase 100% post-consumer recycled paper.
Look for paper and wood products that are approved by the international Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The goal of the FSC is to improve forest practices, and therefore end deforestation, around the world., Palm oil is a popular vegetable oil used in food and cosmetics. The palm oil industry has led to deforestation and the destruction of the tiger habitats. Only buy products that use palm oil from a sustainable source.Look for products with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) trademark.

, One major source of deforestation comes from the coffee industry. The next time you are purchasing some java, look for a brand that is sustainable. This means that they do not condone the practice of deforestation.Sustainable brands will have a certification on the box from an independent certifier, like Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, or UTZ Certified.

, Poaching is the number one threat to tigers. Never buy tiger products, either in your own country or while traveling abroad. This includes products made with tiger parts or tiger derivatives.Do not buy any traditional medicine that is made from tiger parts, such as tiger bone. Today some chemists still use tiger bone, even though it is illegal and a main part of the reason tigers are endangered.Poachers hunt these beautiful creatures illegally, so much so that there are now only an estimated 3,200 tigers left in the wild.

If you cannot be there in person, offer your help by sharing information with friends and family about the event.;
, Animal shelters and rescues provide services for many pets, some of which have faced abusive pasts. Volunteering will go a long way toward helping these institutions sustain their work. There are also organizations dedicated to rehabilitating abused farm animals that welcome the help of volunteers.Get in touch with a shelter or sanctuary to see where they need help and how you might be most impactful.
If you are unable to donate your time, spread the word to others or make a monetary donation.

, Pets at animal shelters were often abandoned or unwanted, and have potentially faced abuse. Adopting one of these pets will help give them a loving family and become a great addition to the family.


Many shelters often have euthanasia policies due to receiving abandoned and unwanted pets at a high volume. Not only is adopting a pet giving it a happy and loving home, but it is also saving a life., If you are unable or not yet ready to adopt a pet, consider fostering animals. Many shelters and rescues are in need of foster parents willing to provide a temporary home to unwanted or abandoned animals. Being a foster parent to an animal provides the animal with more time to find a permanent home.Every adoption agency or animal shelter has different requirements for potential fosters. Get in touch with a local adoption agency or shelter to discuss the application process and requirements for being a foster parent.
Most agencies and shelters will have a foster care coordinator work with you throughout the process to help you determine which type of pet (puppies, dogs, kittens, cats, etc.) might be best for you., Most adoption agencies and animal shelters will have extensive histories available about the pet you are considering adopting or fostering. Ask the shelter or agency questions about the animal’s temperament, whether it has been fostered before, and what kinds of abuse it has suffered. The more information you have about your pet the better home you will be able to make for them.If your pet has been fostered before, reach out to the previous foster parents to find out about the animal’s comfort zone and what actions, behaviors, or environments should be avoided.
Many agencies and shelters also offer rehabilitation for abused animals. Reach out to your shelter or agency to see if your pet has been enrolled in rehabilitation or if there is a program you can enroll in together."

After taking digital pictures or video, be sure to download and save them to your hard drive. You don’t want to accidentally erase the evidence.

, You might be a veterinarian who was called in to treat an animal. You could suspect that the injury was caused by abuse. If so, hold onto copies of all reports that verify the animal’s injuries."
"
Familiarize yourself with the types of animal abuse.,
Look for signs of animal abuse.,
Report all abuse you witness to local law enforcement, animal control, or humane society.",How to Help Save Animals from Abuse2," There are three types of animal abuse, unintentional, intentional, and cruel intent. Knowing the difference between the three will keep you informed of what appropriate action might need to be taken.


Not all animal abuse is intentional and many pet owners may be unintentionally abusing their animals due to a lack of education or general misinformation. If you suspect a someone is unintentionally abusing their animal, kindly check in with them to see if the animal is healthy or if they need any help.Intentional and cruel intent are forms of animal abuse where the abuser knows the animal is being harmed, and occasionally feels a sense of power from it. Abusers of cruel intent can often be aggressive. If you suspect an animal is being abused intentionally or cruelly, contact your local humane society and report it., There are many signs of animal abuse, some intentional, others not. Most signs of animal abuse can be categorized as either physical or environmental.


Signs of physical abuse are generally visual lacerations, scars, emaciation, loss of fur, and other signs of inadequate grooming and care.Signs of environmental abuse relate to how the animals are kept, such as being chained up outside for extended periods of time, in overcrowded areas, areas without shelter or water, or areas that are visibly filthy and can cause health hazards., If you are witnessing the abuse of an animal in your home, neighborhood, or town, report the abuse to the police. Animal abuse is most often illegal and the police are well suited and trained to engage animal abuse and abusers.If the abuse cannot be directly observed, such as withholding medical treatment, call your local humane society to report it. Your humane society will send out a trained officer to investigate and take appropriate action, such as providing additional care or relocating the animal."

Become vegan.,
Buy ethical meat and animal products.,
Buy cruelty-free products.,
Make a donation to an organization fighting animal cruelty.,
Educate others.",How to Help Save Animals from Abuse3," Becoming vegan means that you abstain from wearing, eating, or using any product that contains meat or animal by-products. By becoming vegan, you can save around 100 animal lives per year.Purchase a book on veganism to learn about transitioning into that lifestyle.
Acquire PETA’s vegan starter kit.

, There are many organizations dedicated to making the lives of animals in the meat and food industry as humane as possible. Try browsing local supermarkets, butchers, and retailers through databases to see if their products are certified humane. Keep in mind that combating animal abuse does not necessarily mean abstaining altogether.Most organizations have objective standards set for their certifications, which can be found on their websites, but occasionally those standards vary. Be sure to check with ethical and humane organizations in order to decide if their standards meet yours.Ask your butcher at your local grocery store if they stock any animal products or meat that is certified humane.

, There are many cruelty-free household and cosmetic options available, but if you’re looking for a place to start, try browsing a cruelty-free database to get a few ideas. With enough dedication you can make many of your household and cosmetic products cruelty-free and reduce the effects of animal abuse.


Be willing to make adjustments, because you may have to change to a completely different brand or product altogether.

, There are hundreds of organizations fighting animal abuse and cruelty. Making a donation to the cause is a great way to show your support and enact change.


Donate to your local animal shelter, the ASPCA, The Humane Society, or RMCA., Spreading knowledge to others will help provide them with the opportunity to make the most informed decision possible. Many people are unaware of how common and widespread animal abuse can be.Try canvassing for a large organization, like PETA, or sharing an anti-abuse video on social media.
Print leaflets detailing the abuses that you want people to learn more about. Go around handing out these papers to people, asking them to help the animals.

Testify at the hearing.",How to Make an Animal Waste Complaint," Most cities have animal control offices to deal with complaints about animals.In some cities, animal shelters handle these complaints. To find the appropriate office, you can look for “animal control” in your phone book.


You can also search the Internet. Type “animal waste complaint” and “your city.” The appropriate office should show in your search results.
Once you find the appropriate office, write down the phone number that you call.;
, Before calling, pull together the relevant information to give to animal control. For example, you should have the following:a description of the animal
the animal’s address
the time of the incident
any other relevant details

, Some cities give you the ability to make an anonymous report. You might want to report anonymously if you are afraid of the animal owner or if you otherwise don’t want to get involved in any dispute.


However, if you report anonymously, then animal control might not do anything. In order to properly punish the animal owner, animal control may have to request a hearing where evidence is presented against the dog owner. Animal control might not be able to bring this hearing if you are not willing to testify.

, Some cities have online forms you can complete in order to make an animal waste complaint. For example, you can file an online complaint in New York City., After you complain, animal control should reach out to the animal’s owner. An inspector may even stop to meet with the animal owner.You should offer to help animal control in any way that you can.


For example, you should share with the inspector any documentation you have of the waste.

, After being contacted by animal control, the owner may still refuse to pick up after their animal. In this situation, you need to make a second complaint to animal control. In some cities, such as Fort Worth, you will have to fill out an affidavit. The affidavit should include:the name of the animal’s owner (or a description if you don’t know the name)
the animal owner’s address
a description of the animals
the date and time of the incident
any other details
the names and contact information for other witnesses
your signature before a notary public

, Unless animal control observes the animal depositing waste, they are usually unable to issue a citation. However, animal control can issue citations if you have:a color photograph of the animal depositing waste
the animal is visible in the photograph
you document the date, location, and time of the incident

, It might be easier to make a video instead of taking photographs. Most smart phones have the capability to film short videos. Be sure that the animal and the owner are both visible, which will make it easier to identify both.

, In some cities, animal control might need more than one person to make a complaint before they do anything, especially if you didn’t get a picture of the incident.You should check if you can get at least two witnesses.


Speak to people around the neighborhood who might see the animal owner not pick up after the animal.
Document the witness’s name and contact information, such as phone number and email address. Ask the witness if they would be willing to testify.

, When the animal’s owner is uncooperative, animal control may issue a citation. However, the animal owner can challenge the citation at a hearing. If so, then you could be asked to testify.Make note of the date and location of the hearing. If you have never been to the courthouse before, then give yourself plenty of time on the day of the hearing to arrive on time.

, You want the judge hearing the case to take you seriously as a witness. Accordingly, you should try to look as professional as possible. Courts are conservative places, so you should dress conservatively.


You probably don’t need to wear a suit to an animal waste hearing. However, you should dress “business casual” in dress pants and a dress shirt. Wear dress shoes, not sneakers, and remove any noisy or flashy jewelry.
Make sure that you cut your hair and are clean and neat.

, You might be nervous if you have never testified before. Nevertheless, you should come across as a credible witness if you follow these tips:Listen closely to the question. If you don’t understand it, then ask that the question be rephrased.
Always think before answering. Take a couple seconds to make sure you understand the question and know what you want to say.
Be as brief as possible. You are there to give evidence and not to pass judgment on the animal owner.
Avoid humor. A courtroom is a serious place, and you should take the hearing seriously.

Additionally, attorneys know other attorneys, and may be able to recommend someone who would be good for your case.
Be careful about relying too much on word of mouth. Even though you may trust the person offering the recommendation, you should keep in mind that he or she has a different personality, different interests, and likely had different legal needs than you do.;
, Animal shelters near you may know attorneys in your area who practice animal law.Many animal shelters or animal rights organizations have attorneys they use, and may recommend those services to you.
It's also possible that an animal shelter or other nonprofit organization has attorneys within its group of volunteers. Even if that attorney doesn't specifically practice animal law, he or she cares a great deal about animal welfare to volunteer.
People at the nearest branch of the Humane Society or the ASPCA also may be able to recommend an animal law attorney to you., State and local bar associations often have attorney referral directories on their websites.You can start at the American Bar Association's Legal Services locator, available at http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/home.cfm. Enter your state to get information about the bar association and other referral services available in your area.
Many bar associations allow you to search their directories by practice area. If animal law isn't listed, start with personal injury, property damage, or tort.
Some state bar associations have animal law sections. Check on your state bar association's website for resources on animal law and information about attorneys in the state who practice animal law., Many legal websites have attorney directories as well as information about various areas of law including animal law.Some of these websites include attorney profiles, ratings, and client reviews as well.
Keep in mind that not all of these services are vetted or regularly updated, so if you find an attorney on a national website, you'll want to look further into him or her to make sure you have the most up-to-date information with which to make your decision.

, Through an attorney's website you typically can learn about his or her background, education, and experience in law.If an attorney specializes in animal law, he or she may have a list of the types of cases he or she takes. Look at the list and figure out if your case falls within one of those types.Look for an attorney who is passionate about animals. For example, an attorney who practices animal law may have pictures of her pets on her website.In addition to practicing law, attorneys may be certified trainers or breeders, and may have partnerships or relationships with local animal welfare agencies or nonprofit animal organizations., Statements from prior clients can give you a good idea of what it's like to work with the attorney.You can search the lawyer's name on the internet to find out if anything is being said about him or her. Look at any local news articles or blog posts that mention the lawyer to get a sense of his or her reputation in the community.
Keep in mind that if you're reading testimonials on the attorney's website, these probably have been vetted and will skew towards more positive experiences. Most people in any profession wouldn't want to advertise negative feedback on their own website.

, Before you talk to an attorney, you should make sure that he or she is licensed to practice law in your area.


Your local bar association typically will have information about an attorney's license, including disciplinary reports or records. In some states this information also is available at the website for your state's highest court.
Avoid meeting with an attorney who has previously been disciplined for a violation of professional ethics rules.

, Although not required to practice law, malpractice insurance protects you if an attorney makes a mistake while working for you.Keep in mind that if an attorney doesn't have malpractice insurance, you may have no recourse if the attorney makes a mistake or mishandles your case.
In many states, attorneys are required to disclose whether they have malpractice insurance.If disclosure isn't required, you should put it on your list of questions to ask the attorney when you go for an initial consultation.

, If possible, you should try to interview at least two or three attorneys.Many attorneys will offer a free initial consultation so they can assess your case and determine if they can help you, while others will charge a small fee – typically less than their hourly rate – for the first meeting.Keep in mind that some attorneys view a free initial consultation as little more than a sales pitch, and will spend the entire time trying to sell their services to you rather than getting an understanding of you and your situation.
When you call to schedule a meeting, pay attention to how quickly the attorney is available. If the attorney doesn't have an opening for several weeks or even months, it could be an indication that he or she is too busy to give your case the time and attention it deserves.

, Gather the documents or information you will need to explain your case to the attorney.If you were told to bring any particular documents, or fill out a form, prior to your meeting, make sure you get that information to the attorney well in advance so he or she has the opportunity to prepare for the consultation as well.
You also may want to write a list of questions you want to ask, so you don't forget something important during the interview.

, Telling the prospective attorney your story and the nature of the dispute will help him or her understand how to help you.Take note of the attorney's behavior and body language while you are speaking. Ideally, you want an attorney who is engaged and attentive – not one who is distracted, constantly interrupts you, or appears to be reading or working on something else.
The most effective attorneys will listen to what you have to say and be responsive, asking questions or raising issues that come to them as you relate your issue.

, During the interview, you need to find out as much as you can about each attorney and his or her practice.


Ask the attorney background information, even if you already know from looking at his or her website. It can be important to see how the attorney answers the question and what points he or she chooses to emphasize. It may even be the case that his or her answer in person differs from the one on the website – whether because the attorney is trying to mislead you or simply hasn't updated his or her site in awhile.
Find out how long the attorney has been practicing animal law, and how many animal law cases he or she has had. If the attorney practices in other areas, find out what percentage of his or her practice is devoted to animal law.An attorney who focuses solely on animal law will have the most experience, and be the most up-to-date on this area of law and how it applies to your case. However, attorneys who dedicate their practice exclusively to animal law may be difficult to find, especially in more rural areas.
Ask the attorney the best way to communicate with him or her, and how quickly you can expect a response. Most attorneys have a preferred method of communication and using it typically will get you the fastest response time.Don't be afraid to bring up finances, particularly if you are worried about your ability to pay any substantial attorney's fees. Many attorneys will be willing to work with you if you are honest about your situation, and a lot of personal injury or plaintiff's attorneys will work on a contingency arrangement, meaning you pay them a percentage of your settlement or award if you win.

, If you're going to hire an attorney, you need to make sure that you get along with him or her personally and feel comfortable in the office.Pay attention to the actions of other employees in the office, as well as how the attorney treats his or her assistants, receptionists, or other employees.
Assess the attorney's personality, and think about whether you feel at ease or find him or her easy to talk to. No matter how great an attorney is on paper, he or she won't be able to represent you effectively if you find him or her abrasive or intimidating.

, After you've completed your interviews, evaluate your prospects to choose the one that is right for you.One exercise you may find helpful is to create a list of pros and cons for each attorney you interviewed. Although the factors you list will be objective assessments, the weight you give each factor will be based on your personal needs and opinions.
For example, suppose one attorney is the most experienced, most successful, and is willing to work with you to keep his fees within your budget, but his office is located all the way across town. If it would be too difficult for you to meet with him on a regular basis, you may decide to go with another attorney whose office is more conveniently located.
While cost may be an important factor, don't let it be the only factor in your decision. Keep in mind what's at stake in the upcoming lawsuit and consider how much that means to you.
Don't be afraid to go with your gut if there's one attorney that you really liked and enjoyed talking to, even if he or she doesn't have as much experience as another.

File an appeal.",How to Defend Yourself in a Veterinary Malpractice Lawsuit," The client who sues you will start the lawsuit by filing a complaint. In the lawsuit, this person will be called the “plaintiff.” In the complaint, the plaintiff will explain to the judge what facts have led to the dispute. The plaintiff will also allege that you committed malpractice and that the plaintiff is entitled to money as compensation.


You will receive a copy of the complaint along with the summons. The summons will tell you how much time you have to formally respond.Read each document closely and highlight the deadline for responding.;
, To sue you for malpractice, the plaintiff needs to allege specific facts. You should check the complaint to see that the plaintiff alleged the following:you accepted the responsibility to treat the animal
your actions or inactions fell short of how a reasonably careful veterinarian would act
your failure to act in a reasonably careful manner caused the animal’s injury
the plaintiff suffered harm because of the injury

, As soon as you receive notice of the complaint, you should contact your malpractice insurer. Take out your policy and find the phone number. You should have the following information available to share with the insurer:


the name of the animal owner
information about the animal (age, size, weight)
a summary of the treatment you gave the animal

, You should meet with an attorney as soon as possible. If you don’t already have a lawyer, then call other vets in your area and ask them if they would recommend their attorney. You can then call and set up a consultation.


If you have no referrals, then you can get one from your local or state bar association.

, With your lawyer, you should discuss in detail the treatment you gave to the animal. Also discuss what information you knew when you prescribed the treatment. To help reconstruct the treatment, bring the following information to your consultation with the attorney:


All records related to the animal.
Your memories of the day you treated the animal. In particular, write down what the owner said when describing what was wrong with the animal.
A list of medications you prescribed the animal.

, You should discuss possible defenses with your lawyer. The precise defenses you raise will depend on the facts of your lawsuit. Nevertheless, there are some standard defenses:


You were sufficiently careful when treating the animal. The fact that the animal died is not proof that you committed malpractice. You might have prescribed the generally accepted treatment, as any careful veterinarian would. If you acted in a competent manner, then you did not commit malpractice.
Your actions didn’t cause the animal’s injury. The plaintiff must show that your actions also caused the animal’s injuries. For example, an animal may die. However, if the animal was already sick when you treated it, then the illness (and not your treatment) might have been the cause of death.
You acted as a “good Samaritan.” If you gave emergency care to an animal at the scene of an accident, then your state law might not require that you have followed the normal standard of care.The plaintiff waited too long to sue. Generally, an animal’s owner has only one to three years to file a lawsuit, depending on your state’s statute of limitations.If the plaintiff waited too long, then you can have the case dismissed.

, You will respond to the lawsuit by filing an answer in court. In this document, you respond to each allegation made in the complaint. You must agree, disagree, or claim insufficient knowledge to agree or disagree with each allegation.Have your lawyer draft the answer for you. However, also ask to see a copy before the lawyer files it. If you admit to any allegation in your answer, you cannot take it back at a later date. For this reason, you should always check the answer for accuracy.

, Your lawyer will take the answer to court and file it. A copy must be served on the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney., After you file your answer, you and the plaintiff can request information from each other. This is called “discovery.” In a veterinarian malpractice case, you will have to sit for a “deposition.” In the deposition, the plaintiff’s lawyer will ask you questions about the treatment you gave the animal. Remember the following tips when giving your deposition:Don’t volunteer information. You should only answer any question asked. Also only bring any documents requested. There is no reason to be extra helpful and bring anything not requested. Make the other side request the information.
Listen closely to each question. If you don’t understand it, then ask the lawyer to phrase it another way.
If you don’t know the answer, say, “I don’t know.” You should never guess or speculate.
Stay polite and don’t make jokes. Depositions can be very tense and you don’t know how the other side will respond.
Consult with your lawyer whenever you want. Say, “I think I need to consult with my attorney right now.”

, The animal owner has an incentive to settle. The cost of the lawsuit will probably exceed the amount of compensation the owner can get.For this reason, the plaintiff might propose settling. If not, then your insurance carrier might propose it.


In settlement negotiations, you and the plaintiff meet with your lawyers. The purpose of settlement is for each side to give up something in order to reach an agreement you both can live with.
For example, you may have to pay the plaintiff some money. In return, you can have the lawsuit dismissed.

, If you have an insurer, then the claims adjuster will take the lead on settlement negotiations. Your insurer already knows how much the animal’s injury is worth and the strength of the plaintiff’s case. You should certainly attend negotiations and offer your input.


If you are negotiating without an insurance company, then you and your lawyer should come up with your “walkaway” number (also called a “walkaway point”). This is the maximum amount of money you are willing to pay to settle the lawsuit. If the plaintiff won’t come down to your number, then you can break off settlement negotiations.To come up with the number, analyze how strong the plaintiff’s case is. Based on your experience, you should know whether or not you made an obvious mistake when treating the animal. If you did, then you might want to try and settle for close to the plaintiff’s asking price.
However, if the plaintiff has a weak case, then you might not want to settle unless the plaintiff agrees to take only 50% of what she is asking.

, Alternately, you might want to participate in mediation, which is a form of “assisted negotiation.”In mediation, you and the plaintiff meet with a neutral third party, the mediator, to discuss the dispute. The mediator is skilled at listening to your complaints and then trying to nudge both of you to a solution you can both live with.


Mediation is entirely voluntary, and the mediator does not act like a judge. You can walk away at any time.
If you are interested in mediation, then contact your local courthouse, which might run a mediation program. You can also call your local bar association, which should have a list of mediators.

, You should write down any agreement that you reach with the plaintiff. The settlement agreement becomes an enforceable contract between you and the plaintiff. Be sure to sign it.


Your lawyer should draft the settlement agreement. If you participated in mediation, then the mediator can help.
Make sure that your attorney puts a “release” in the settlement agreement. The release will prevent the plaintiff from re-filing the lawsuit at a later date based on the same allegations.
The release should say something like the following: “Upon payment of the Settlement Payment in full, the Settling Plaintiff, for itself and its assigns and successors, hereby discharges and releases the Settling Defendant and its officers, directors, partners, employees, shareholders, insurers, heirs, executors, representatives, successors and assigns, from all claims, obligations, damages, demands, actions, and causes of action, whether indirect or direct, belonging to the Settling Plaintiff, which relate to or arise from the allegations included in the complaint.”, Once you reach an agreement, the plaintiff will need to request that the lawsuit be dismissed. You can then submit the settlement agreement as an attachment.


Make sure to keep a copy of the settlement agreement with you.

, At a trial for malpractice, most of the evidence will turn on whether you acted in a reasonably careful manner. The only way to prove this is to have another veterinarian testify as an expert.The expert then offers an opinion about whether your treatment was sufficiently careful.


The plaintiff will also need an expert to prove that the treatment caused the animal’s injury.
Experts can be expensive. You will have to pay them hourly for their services, which will include preparation time (to review documents) and time spent giving a deposition and testifying at trial.

, The case will begin with jury selection. If you are sued in small claims court, then there might not be a jury. However, you probably will have one in regular civil court. Jury selection begins with the judge calling a panel of prospective jurors up to the jury box where he will ask them questions.


If you think a juror cannot be fair, then you can ask the judge to excuse the prospective juror “for cause.” For example, if the juror knows either you or the plaintiff or admits that she can’t be fair, then you will want to remove the juror.
You also should have a limited number of “peremptory challenges.” You can use a peremptory challenge to excuse a juror without having to give a reason.For example, you might want to use a peremptory challenge to remove anyone who admits to having pets.

, At trial, both parties present evidence. The plaintiff will go first, and you will go second. The evidence will consist mostly of witnesses and documents. The animal’s owner will probably testify, as will an expert witness.


Your lawyer can cross-examine all of the plaintiff’s witnesses, including any expert witness.

, You will probably have to testify, since your actions are the focal point of the trial. Your lawyer should have prepared you for testifying, perhaps by doing a trial run. Remember the following tips for delivering effective testimony:


Speak slowly and make eye contact with the jury when answering. Always look at the lawyer asking you questions.
Be brief and to the point. Don’t waffle or evade the lawyer’s question.
Give your lawyer time to object. Pause briefly after each question. If an attorney does object, then wait for the judge to rule on the objection before answering.
Correct all mistakes immediately. If you misspoke, then say, “I’m sorry, I misspoke. I need to clarify that.”

, After each side makes a closing argument, the judge will read the jury its instructions. The jury then retires to the deliberation room to consider the evidence.


The plaintiff will not win unless the jury believes that a “preponderance” of the evidence shows that you committed malpractice. “Preponderance” means “more likely than not.”In state court, the jury might not have to be unanimous. Instead, you could lose if three-fourths or more of the jurors decide for the plaintiff.If the judge heard the case without a jury in small claims court, then the judge should deliver the verdict from the bench after closing arguments have been made.

, You might want to appeal if you lose at trial. To do so, you need to file a Notice of Appeal form, typically within 10-30 days of the entry of final judgment.However, you should discuss the costs and benefits of filing an appeal with your lawyer. They can take a long time (over a year) and are expensive. Your lawyer will have to draft a detailed legal brief, and you will also have to pay for fees and for court transcripts. You might not want to appeal unless your case is very strong.
Talk with your lawyer about whether bringing an appeal would be worthwhile.

Determine the going rate for pet sitters in your area.,
Consider any extenuating circumstances regarding your pets.,
Talk to your pet sitter about the pay rate.,
Pay in cash.,
Pay by check.,
Transfer funds electronically.",How to Pay a Pet Sitter," Before you decide what to pay a pet sitter, you should determine the pay rates in your area. You do not want to mistakenly offer your sitter too much or too little for the job.


Browse the Yelp pages in your area for pet sitting companies and individual pet sitters. Find a link to their website from there and see what rates they typically charge.Make a running list of pay rates and then scan your list. You can calculate an average by adding all the rates and dividing them by the number of pet sitters. However, if rates are generally around, say, $20/hour or $60/day you might not need to do the math to get a sense of average pay rates.
Pay attention to things that affect pay rates. In some areas, pet sitters may charge more for overnight stays, animals who need medications, and other issues.;
, A pet sitter might want to charge more under certain circumstances. Keep in mind you might need to pay a bit more given some of the following:


A pet that has specific medical needs, like certain medications or issues with bladder or bowel control
If you live in a rural area and a lot of travel is involved to get to your place
Dogs that require long walks
Multiple pets
Overnight stays
Other circumstances that require increased time and care, Once you've done some research, talk to your pet sitter about the pay rate. The two of you can work out an arrangement that feels fair.


Be respectful during negotiations. Your pet sitter might have a higher payment rate in mind than you. Try to be understanding of your pet sitter and willing to make compromises.
Settle on a payment plan. Determine whether you're paying by hour or day. Make sure to include any situations where you might need to pay more or less. For example, if your pet makes a mess that needs to be cleaned up you might have to pay $10. If your pet sitter forgets to change the litter box, you could withhold $5 from the paycheck. Just make sure you're transparent about pay rate ahead of time to avoid any disagreements later on., The easiest way to pay a pet sitter is to simply pay in cash. Pet sitters might even prefer cash and request it. Simply calculate how much you owe and get that cash amount from a bank or ATM., If you had a pet sitter stay for a long time, you might owe them a large amount. In this case, you and the pet sitter might feel more comfortable paying with a check. Simply make the check out to the pet sitter for the amount owed. He or she can simply deposit the check into their account or cash it at a bank.

, A lot of people do not carry checks as banking is becoming increasingly electronic. There are ways to electronically transfer money if you owe a large amount and do not want to pay in cash.


Some banks allow you to wire transfer money between accounts. However, this can be a complicated as you might need certain aspects of your pet sitter's banking information. He or she may be uncomfortable giving this information out. You can try talking to your bank to see if there's any way to get pas this rule. There is also usually a fee with wire transfers.
PayPal is an online money transfer system that allows you to send money to other users. If you have a PayPal account and your pet sitter does as well this might be an easy means of payment.

, Every locality has different laws or agencies that deal with animal abuse. Do some research online or simply in the telephone book to find some of your options. You may also contact your own veterinarian to find out what agencies are available in your area. Some examples to look for:Local police. Either call the main non-emergency desk number, or find out if there is a separate animal control officer. Do not call the emergency 9-1-1 number unless you are aware of particular abuse that is actually in progress that you need to report.
Your county District Attorney’s office. You will often find there is a special department assigned to crimes against animals.Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). This is a national organization, but there are state branches that include the name (and initial) of the state:

MSPCA – Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to AnimalsNJSPCA – New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to AnimalsCheck the Internet for your state or local branch of the SPCA.


Humane Society
Other online sources – just do a general search online for “Animal abuse in .” This should give you plenty of options.

, If possible, try to get photographic, video, or other recorded evidence of the abuse happening. If you can, try getting written/factual statements from other witnesses. If not, write down everything you know, witnessed, or even think you know about the abuse.Concise/factual details/dates will be valuable.


Be careful not to put yourself in danger or break any laws. You are not allowed to trespass or enter another person’s property. Assume that the owner who is committing the abuse could be just as dangerous toward you as he or she is to the animals, and don’t put yourself at risk., Now that you know who to contact in the event of abuse, do so! Provide them with factual statements (preferably written.) of what was seen, what happened, where it happened, when it happened, how it happened, etc. If you have any videos, pictures, recordings, etc., offer them to whomever you speak to.

, Many agencies have computerized reporting systems that will take your report online. You may have the opportunity to upload any video or photos you have taken. You will be encouraged to provide as much detail as you can about the incident you are reporting.If you don't wish to meet an agent or be involved in the case you can do anonymously, but the case would best be pursued if there was a credible witness. If your report leads to an arrest and prosecution, you may be asked to testify., After you have filed your report, keep written precise record of who you spoke to, when you spoke to them, and what the outcome of that discussion was. If nothing came of it or if you were brushed off try contacting someone else, ask to speak to a supervisor, or, if not already there, contact the local police., If you don't receive a reply in a reasonable amount of time (a week or so), call back, or contact another agency., If you see evidence over the Internet of animal abuse, either in video or photographs, you should treat it just as seriously as if you witness abuse in person. There are several ways to report such abuse.


Use Whois.net to track the web site. If the animal abuse is seen on a particular web site, you can go to Whois.net to enter information about that site and find out background information about it. This may be useful information to report to authorities.Contact the site's Internet Service Provider (ISP) about the offensive material. The ISP may be able to take action to close or shut down the site.
Contact the police or other law enforcement in the area where the abuse is occurring (if you know).
Contact the Humane Society or SPCA, either in the area where the abuse is occurring or in your own area.

, Even though, very often, these may not be actual instances of abuse using real animals, you can report scenes that you find offensive or suggestive of animal abuse.Contact the network that aired the program you saw.
Contact the publisher of any print media depicting animal abuse.
Contact the American Humane Association Movie and Television Unit online or at (818) 501-0123.

, This may include overcrowding conditions or poor animal care at a pet store or breeder. In addition to all the other resources (police, SPCA, Humane Society), you can contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture. You will be referred to a regional department to submit a written complaint. The telephone number to call is (301) 851-3751, or you may send a direct email to ace@aphis.usda.gov."

Gather information.,
Locate the appropriate law enforcement agency.,
File your report.,
Cooperate with any investigation.",How to Report Farm Animal Abuse1," Before you file your report, make sure you have sufficient information or evidence for the police to go on. It also may be a good idea to find out if the abuse you've observed violates a state law or local ordinance.If you find a law that you believe relates directly to the abuse you've observed, print it out so you can show it to law enforcement.
Keep in mind that law enforcement officers don't necessarily know every law related to animal cruelty, and they may be more inclined to investigate the situation if they know specifically which law is being violated.
If you can do so safely, you may want to take photos of the animals or the condition in which they are being kept. However, make sure you don't trespass on private property to obtain your evidence.
Understand how the animals you've observed being abused are classified. Cities, states, and counties have different laws regarding the treatment of companion animals as opposed to animals classified as farmed animals or livestock.
Regardless of the animal's classification, certain acts generally are forbidden, including kicking or punching an animal or neglecting the animal by failing to provide adequate food, water, or veterinary care.
Generally, livestock includes any animals that are being kept for consumption of byproducts, such as dairy cattle. In contrast, farmed animals are animals raised for slaughter.;
, The law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction to investigate the situation typically will be the one located in the city or county where the abuse is taking place.Within city limits, you typically must use the municipal police department. Out in the county, you probably should use the sheriff's department.
Keep in mind that farm animal conditions also may violate health and safety ordinances, in which case you would need to file your report with the local department of health.
The USDA has a map on its website of the appropriate law enforcement agency to contact about farm animal abuse in each locality.

, Typically you'll want to go down to the police station so you can file your report in person and speak with an officer face to face about the farm animal abuse you've observed. Bring along any evidence you have.Provide as many facts about the situation as you can. Include your name and contact information in the report so investigators know how to reach you.
If you made copies of laws you believe are being violated, take those along as well. Be prepared for the officer who takes your report to say there's nothing that can be done about it.
Make sure you get a written copy of the report before you leave. You can use the reference number on the report to call and check the status of your report or provide additional information.

, If police officers choose to investigate the situation based on your report, they may have additional questions or need assistance from you. Make sure you've provided contact information so they can get in touch with you if necessary.Law enforcement generally have discretion over whether to investigate reports, and the extent to which they investigate them. You may have to be persistent to get results.
Keep in mind that regardless of the outcome of the investigation, prosecutors also have broad discretion regarding whether to file charges in any given case. Filing a report is no guarantee that the abusers will be brought to justice.
However, in the event the prosecutor does elect to file charges, they typically will need to get in touch with you and discuss the possibility of using you as a witness in the case.

Wait for the verdict.",How to Sue for Veterinary Malpractice," If the animal died, then preserve it. Take it to a second vet, which can perform an animal autopsy (called a “necropsy”).The purpose of the necropsy is to find out what killed the animal.


If you are too emotional, then call a friend and have him or her help you. However, you should not delay.
Ask the vet who performs the necropsy if he or she is willing to testify in court. Also get a copy of the necropsy report.
The report, and the vet’s testimony, will be helpful in a malpractice lawsuit.;
, You will probably also testify at trial. In order to be an effective witness, you should sit down as soon as possible and write down what you remember. This may be very difficult, especially if you have lost a pet. However, you need to document your memories while they are still fresh in your mind.


Write down what the vet did and said. Did the vet ask you questions about the animal? Did the vet tell you what treatment to give the animal?
Write down what you said. Did you tell the vet about a pre-existing condition the animal suffered from?

, To win a lawsuit, you need evidence. You should contact the vet who you think committed malpractice and request copies of everything in the file. You can use these records in a later lawsuit as proof of the treatment the vet gave your animal.


If the vet doesn’t want to turn over the records, then tell your lawyer. After the lawsuit is filed, you can request that the vet turn over these documents. If the vet still refuses, then a judge can punish the vet.

, Depending on your state, you might be able to get compensated for any treatment needed to make your animal well.For example, if the vet broke the animal’s leg, then you can be compensated for treatment provided by a second vet. Hold onto:


veterinarian bills
receipts for medicines you had to buy
receipts for supplies (such as bandages, tape, etc.) that you needed to treat the animal’s injuries

, Veterinary malpractice lawsuits are complicated. You will need to prove that the actions your vet took were not what actions a reasonably skilled and diligent veterinarian would take. You also need to show that the vet’s carelessness caused your animal’s injury.To help assess the strength of your case, you should meet with an attorney.


You can get a referral by calling your state or local bar association. After you have the name of a lawyer, you should call and schedule a 15-30 minute consultation.
At the consultation, you should talk about what evidence you will need to gather. Also talk about the lawyer’s fee structure. Some lawyers might be willing to do only the tasks that you give her. This is called “limited scope representation” and is a good way to keep legal costs low.

, Each state has a government agency responsible for protecting consumers and animals by regulating the veterinary industry. These agencies are usually part of your state's consumer affairs department, which will usually have a veterinary medical board within it. Most states will allow you to file a complaint against anyone they can regulate. This will usually include veterinarians, technicians, and the businesses that employ them.Your complaint will be investigated by the appropriate state agency and action will be taken if warranted.


In California, for example, you can file a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs. When you visit the Veterinary Medical Board website, there will be a link to file a complaint. When you fill out your complaint, you will need to include your contact information, the type of complaint you are filing, a description of the incident, and who you are complaining against. You will then be given the opportunity to attach any evidence you have to the complaint. When you are done, you can file it and wait for a complaint., Before bringing a lawsuit, you need to understand what you can get compensated for if you win your veterinary malpractice lawsuit. In the United States, compensation is determined by state law, and the states differ widely in what they will allow you to be paid for. You should discuss the availability of these different damages with your lawyer:The market value of the animal. This means the amount of money it would take to replace the animal. In some states, this is the only compensation you can get. The market value is based primarily on the animal’s age, breed, and health. If your old horse was killed, then the market value will be less than if a younger horse had been killed.
The cost of treating the animal to fix the harm caused by the malpractice.
The special value of the animal. These damages are meant to compensate you for your loss of companionship with the animal. If a beloved pet dies, then the special value would be higher than if a work horse died. This type of compensation is available in only some states.
Emotional distress. Under some circumstances, states will allow you to get compensated for your emotional distress.
Punitive damages. If the vet’s conduct was intentional or outrageous, then you can get punitive damages. These are meant to punish the defendant.

, You will not win a veterinary malpractice lawsuit simply because your animal died. Not every sick animal can be saved, and your animal might have died regardless of what the vet did.


Instead, you need to show that the vet’s treatment fell below the professional standard of care expected of veterinarians. You also need to show that the vet’s treatment caused the injury or death.These topics are beyond most people’s everyday experience. A judge will not know what the professional standard of care is. Nor will the judge know whether the vet’s actions caused the animal’s injury. Accordingly, you will need to hire expert witnesses who can offer an opinion on these topics. Your lawyer should know experts who can testify for you. Generally, the expert is another vet.
If you are in small claims court, then you might not have to hire an expert. Instead, you can have the expert vet write a letter that contains his or her expert opinion. For example, the vet who performed the necropsy could write an affidavit for you, explaining whether the vet’s treatment satisfied the professional standard of care and whether the vet caused the animal’s death.

, You need to sue in the county where the vet lives or practices. This may not be the county you live in.


You should also think about suing in small claims court. Small claims court is designed so that you don’t need a lawyer. Nevertheless, small claims courts have maximum amounts you can sue for. Typically, the maximum is between $5,000 and $10,000, though the amount differs by state., You start the lawsuit by drafting a complaint. If you have a lawyer, then he or she can draft the complaint (as well as handle all other aspects of the lawsuit). However, if you are representing yourself, then you will be responsible for drafting the complaint.


The complaint tells the judge who the parties are (you and the vet). It also explains the facts that gave rise to the lawsuit and how much money you are suing for.Small claims courts should have printed “fill in the blank” forms for you to use. Stop into court and ask the court clerk.
In your description of the facts, be sure to mention that the vet “committed veterinary malpractice.” Also state that the actions he or she took “fell below the required standard of care owed to you.”

, Once you have completed the complaint, you need to make several copies. Take the copies and the original to the court clerk. Ask the clerk if you can file the original.


The clerk should stamp your copies with the date.
You will also have to pay a filing fee. Ask the clerk for the amount (it will vary by court) and also ask about acceptable methods of payment.
If you can’t afford the filing fee, then ask for a fee waiver form.

, You must give the vet notice that you have filed the malpractice lawsuit. You can do this by serving the vet with a copy of your complaint. You might also have to send some other documents, such as a summons, which you can get from the court clerk.


There are generally several ways to serve notice on the vet. For example, you could have someone 18 or older hand-deliver the notice to the vet. You could also hire a private process server or pay the sheriff to make delivery for a small fee.In small claims court, you can often have the court clerk mail a copy of the complaint to the vet using certified mail., If you arranged service with a private process server or some other person, then you must have the server fill out a “proof of service” form. This is also called an “affidavit of service.” You can get the form from the court clerk.


The server needs to fill out this form after making service. He or she will then either file the form with the court or return it to you to file.Be sure to keep a copy for your records.

, After the other party receives your complaint, they will be required to respond (usually within 30 days). The defendant's response is usually called an answer. Within the answer, the other party will address each of your allegations and either deny or accept them. Their answer will also contain any defenses and counterclaims they wish to make. Analyze the other party's answer to determine your course of action.


If their answer contains counterclaims, you will be required to file an answer to those counterclaims. Your response will contain admissions or denials of the claims they make., A period of discovery usually starts the litigation process. During discovery, you and the other party will have an opportunity to collect documents from each other in order to get an idea of how the case will proceed. During discovery you will be able to interview witnesses, gather facts, and figure out what the other side is going to say at trial. You will be able to use the following tools in order to help you:


Informal discovery, which might include interviewing witnesses, collecting documents available to the public, and taking photographs.
Interrogatories, which are written questions submitted to a party or witness. These questions must be answered on the record and can be used in court.
Depositions, which are oral interviews given under oath. The person's answers can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which allow you to ask the other side for documents that are not publicly available (e.g., emails, texts, or internal memos).
Subpoenas, which are court orders requiring a person to speak or hand over documents., When discovery concludes, the defendant will usually file a motion for summary judgment. In order to be successful, they will have to show there are no genuine issues of fact in the case and that they are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant will be arguing that there is no way you can win, even if every assumption is made in your favor.


To defend against this motion, you will need to submit affidavits and evidence showing the court that there are disputed issues in the case or that the law is not clear. If you can do this, the defendant's motion will be denied and the case will continue., You will have various pre-trial hearings taking place from the time you file your suit until the time a trial starts. These hearings can cover any number of issues. Usually, you will at least take place in a scheduling hearing and a stipulations hearing.


During a scheduling hearing, you and the other party will work out a timeline of the case. This will include how long discovery will be and when the trial will likely start.
During a stipulation hearing, you and the other party will inform the court of all the issues you agree on. This will help the judge decide the issues that need to be settled during a trial.

, As a last ditch effort before your trial begins, you should meet with the other party and attempt to settle your dispute. If you can come to a settlement, you will avoid the large time and financial commitment required to go to trial. Generally, settlements can be reached informally or through a formal process (arbitration or mediation).


During informal settlement talks, both sides will sit in a room and figure out the issues. If a deal can be reached, you will avoid trial.
During mediation, a neutral third-party will work with both sides to figure out where there is common ground. The third-party will then try to work out an agreement that both parties are happy with.
During arbitration, a neutral third-party plays a judge-like role. They will hear both sides of the story and make determinations about who has the stronger case. They may then file a written decision telling each party what they think the settlement should be.

, Your opening statement will start the trial. As the person bringing the veterinary malpractice lawsuit, you will go first. If you have a lawyer, then he or she should handle the entire trial. You would then only possibly testify.


The purpose of the opening statement is to provide a roadmap of the evidence so that the judge has some idea of what evidence you will present.If you are representing yourself, then you should remember not to argue during your opening statement. Instead, stick to the facts. Begin statements with “as the evidence will show.”
For example, you could say, “As the evidence will show, I took my dog, Munchkin, to the defendant’s office on April 22, 2015. I will present evidence that Munchkin had a bloated stomach and hadn’t eaten for three days. And as the evidence will further show, Dr. Lange, the defendant, examined her and then gave her a shot.”

, You will present your evidence first. You need witnesses and documents that prove the vet’s care fell below the relevant professional standard of care for vets, and that this shortfall caused the animal’s injuries.


Expert witnesses. You might need another vet to testify that the vet committed malpractice. If you are in small claims court, then you can often introduce an affidavit from the vet instead of having him or her come into court and testify.Your own observations. You can also tell the judge what you observed. If your state allows you to sue for emotional distress or loss of companionship with the animal, then you can testify about the grief you have felt since your pet died.

, The defendant presents his or her case after you. The defendant will probably use witnesses and documents as well. You should listen quietly to the defendant’s evidence and not interrupt.


In a regular civil trial, you or your lawyer could ask the witnesses questions. In small claims court, however, the judge might be the one who primarily asks the defense witness questions.

, You might get the chance to make a closing argument, though this will depend whether you are in regular civil court or in small claims court. Your goal is to explain all of the evidence presented to the judge and show how it commands a result in your favor.


Often, a trial for veterinary malpractice will come down to dueling expert opinions. Your expert will say that the vet’s malpractice injured the animal. However, the vet’s expert will state that the treatment was acceptable and the injury had other causes.
In order to win the lawsuit, your lawyer will have to argue that your expert is more credible. This could be difficult. However, you could point out that your expert has been practicing longer or that your expert actually observed the animal’s body.

, The judge might immediately make a ruling after all evidence has been submitted. The judge might also take some time to think over the case, especially if the evidence has been particularly complicated.


If you lose, you might want to appeal. However, small claims courts sometimes only allow you to appeal in certain circumstances, and some small claims courts allow no appeals.You should talk about the possibility of an appeal with a lawyer.

Locate the appropriate Humane Society office.,
Collect information for your report.,
File your report.,
Follow up on your report.",How to Report Farm Animal Abuse2," Some states delegate investigation of animal cruelty cases to the state Humane Society or SPCA. However, in more rural areas there may only be one office covering several counties.You can use the map on the USDA's website to find the appropriate office. Look for the map at the website's Animal Welfare Information Center, and click on ""I want to report suspected animal cruelty or neglect.""
Go to the Humane Society's office or visit their website to confirm the classes of animals over which they have jurisdiction. Some humane societies only handle animal cruelty cases involving companion animals, not farmed animals or livestock.

, You need to gather as much information as you safely can about the perpetrators of the farm animal abuse and what is taking place. The more evidence you have, the more likely the Humane Society will be to investigate the matter.Take photos of the animals and the conditions in which they are being kept if you can do so safely and without trespassing on private property.
If photos aren't practical, write descriptions of what you've seen. You might consider asking others to serve as witnesses and confirm your observations.
While laws differ among states, certain acts are typically illegal, including overt acts of violence such as kicking or punching an animal. Denying adequate food, water, or veterinary care also can lead to criminal prosecution.

, It may be better for you to go to the Humane Society office in person to speak to someone about the farm animal abuse you've observed. However, if the office is far away you may be able to file your report online or over the phone.The state humane society typically will take suspected cruelty complaints through a toll-free hotline or email.
Keep in mind if you file your report outside of the office's normal business hours, it may take a day or two for them to receive your report.
Include as many factual details in your report as possible, including the dates and times that you made your observations. If you observed the abuse on multiple occasions, provide the same information for each time.
Be as accurate as possible, and don't guess. For example, if you observed farm animal abuse at some point in the morning, but don't remember the exact time, don't just make up a time – give a range of hours or say ""before noon.""

, After you've filed your report, make yourself available to investigators who look into the situation. Try to get a name of the person in charge of the investigation so you can contact them directly if you get additional information.If you filed your report outside of business hours, call the office on the next business day to confirm that your report was received.
Ask for a written copy of your report if you filed it over the phone.

Contact nonprofit animal rights organizations.,
Get the local media involved.,
Write letters to your elected officials.,
Organize protests or rallies.",How to Report Farm Animal Abuse3," Even if you can't get help from law enforcement, there are many nonprofit organizations dedicated to animal rights and taking action to stop animal cruelty.You can search online for animal rights organizations and find out if they have a hotline or online form through which you can report farm animal abuse.
The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has a national hotline you can use to report farm animal abuse and cruelty. The Society offers a reward of $5,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone who commits farm animal abuse.
To report farm animal abuse to the HSUS, call 1-888-209-7177.

, Most local news stations have an investigative reporter who looks into situations in the area based on tips from viewers like you. Watch a broadcast or visit your local broadcast news affiliate's website to find out how to submit information.Typically you can call the station's hotline, or send a story through email. If you submit your tip online, you may be able to upload any documents or photos that support your statements. #*Keep in mind that the station has absolute discretion over which stories it pursues, and you typically won't receive any response if the station decides to pass on your story.
You may be able to send an email or call to follow up on your tip and ask if the station intends to investigate the situation, but don't be a pest. If the station tells you it has declined to investigate the tip you sent, try again with a different station or news outlet.

, If you were unable to do anything about the farm animal abuse you've observed because there's no law that prohibits it, you can advocate for a change in the law to end farm animal cruelty.You can find contact information for local or state representatives on the government's website.
Keep your letter short and to the point. Describe the situation you've observed, and tell the elected official exactly what he or she can do to help the animals.
You may be able to find a form letter on the website of a nonprofit animal rights organization to use as a guide, but make sure you personalize your letter and tailor it to the specific situation you've observed – don't just parrot the language in the form letter.
If there's legislation currently pending that would result in stiffer penalties for the abuse you've observed, mention it specifically and ask the elected official to vote for it.

, Coordinating a public event requires significant time and effort, but if you're up to the task you can stage your own protest or rally to speak out against farm animal abuse and raise community awareness about the issue.Plan ahead and choose your location carefully. Find out the rules for public demonstrations and whether you need to get a permit.
You may want to meet with others before the event is scheduled to take place. Make sure everyone participating has an understanding of the goals of the protest.
When choosing a location, you might do some research to find out if there are local restaurants or grocery stores that sell or use products from the farm engaging in animal abuse.
Staging a protest at one of these locations can be very effective in raising awareness of farm animal abuse, and if you get the restaurant or grocery store to stop using or selling those products, you cut into the abusive owner's profits.

Be aware of behavioral cues.,
Notice hoarding behavior.,
Recognize signs of starvation.,
Keep track of tethered or chained dogs.,
Look for matted fur, parasite infestation, or dental diseases.",How to Identify Animal Abuse and Neglect1," While behavior alone cannot confirm animal abuse or neglect, it can be a strong indicator. An abused or neglected animal might be aggressive, timid, or fearful. It might lash out at humans and other animals, or might cower away from its owner or passersby.Since these behaviors can’t prove that an animal has been neglected or abused, it’s important to look for physical signs of cruelty or, if possible, observe its living conditions.;
, Be on the lookout for signs that a neighbor or someone you know owns too many animals. Consider the size of their living space, and how adequate that space is for the number of animals you’ve seen. Note if stray animals gather in a yard or close by the residence.If you see any of the animals in residence, try to distinguish how many live at the suspicious location. Try to identify their physical condition, and look for signs of malnutrition or lack of veterinary care.

, Look for breed- and species-specific signs of malnutrition. Compare the animal in question to what’s considered normal for its species, breed, or mix of breeds.For example, a Greyhound and a Rottweiler each have particular body types and builds. Seeing rib bones might not be as alarming a sight in a Greyhound.  
Look for behavior cues like dizziness, confusion, trouble standing or walking, and excessive scavenging.

, Chaining dogs outside for long periods of time can be life threatening, especially in periods of extreme weather. If you see a dog chained in a neighbor’s yard, try to keep track of how long it’s unattended and that day’s weather conditions.If you’re concerned about a chained dog, you can call your local humane society or animal shelter anonymously to have an animal control officer visit the pet owner and discuss safety issues.

, Preventive care is a must for any pet for its own well being and for disease control. Obvious signs that an animal lacks veterinary care are key indicators of neglect.Notice the condition of its fur, such as matting or consistent dirtiness. Look for patches of missing fur, skin flakes, or patches of redness or irritation. Keep track of how long you observe these conditions without any indication of veterinary care.
Look for signs of fleas, ticks, and other parasite infestations, like excessive scratching and self-biting. Examine the fur for parasites if you can do so safely, such as if the animal belongs to a friend or family member. Avoid physical contact with animals that are unfamiliar with you.

"
"
Identify wounds associated with animal fighting.,
Look for wounds at various stages of healing.,
Be aware of broader violent behavior.",How to Identify Animal Abuse and Neglect2," Bite and claw marks at various stages of healing indicate animal fighting. Notice if scars or wounds do not match the teeth and claws of the animal you suspect has suffered cruelty.For example, if you suspect a dog has been subjected to dog fighting, look for bite marks that might be consistent with another dog’s jaw size, particularly at the face, neck, and front portions of its body. While spotting wounds once might not be suspicious, be aware if the animal consistently shows signs of fighting injuries.

, In addition to wounds obviously inflicted by another animal, notice any series of wounds that indicate prolonged violence. Be suspicious if one skin abrasion, scratch, or burn shows signs of healing while another is fresh.For example, abrasions around the neck from a tight collar might appear to be healing one day then appear to be fresh the next time you see the animal. Other examples of suspicious injuries include possible cigarette burns or sudden bleeding from orifices.

, Note if the pet owner you suspect of animal cruelty has ever exhibited violent behavior. If you interact with that person consistently, be aware of any shouting or yelling, frequent intoxication, or throwing or destroying objects.Research has shown that behaviors like animal abuse, property damage, and domestic violence are all interrelated. For this reason and for your own safety, avoid confronting the person you suspect on your own.

"
"
Avoid putting yourself in danger.,
Prepare a written statement.,
Photograph signs of cruelty if possible.,
Contact local authorities or make an online complaint.,
Report a puppy mill or an inhumane breeder.,
Talk to a friend or family member about their animal care.",How to Identify Animal Abuse and Neglect3," In addition to putting yourself at risk of physical harm, you should avoid confronting the person you suspect of animal cruelty for legal reasons. In most jurisdictions, it’s unlawful to enter someone else’s property without their permission, even if an animal’s safety is at risk.In some areas, it is lawful to break into a locked car if an animal is kept inside in extreme heat. Contact a local animal shelter, vet, or search online for more information about your local regulations.
Keep in the mind any animals that you suspect suffer abuse or neglect are unpredictable and could attack you if you approach them, their territory, or owner.

, When you see evidence of abuse or neglect, write down all relevant details. Note the date, time, location, and a thorough description of the suspicious behavior or physical signs of cruelty. Keep a written record and if you believe that you’ve documented enough evidence, prepare a written report to present to authorities.Timing is relative to the type of behavior you witness. For example, if you see a person beating an animal, you’ll want to note the date, time, and location and either call your local animal control agency or emergency services. If you observe lack of cleanliness or an obvious lack of preventive care, you might decide it’s best to compile a written record over a period of days or weeks.
Keep in mind it’s important to report direct violence to animal control or emergency services quickly. If you see an animal being abused, not only is its well being at risk, but that violent act could indicate that the perpetrator is also abusing other animals or people.

, If it’s safe and feasible, photographic evidence can be helpful in reporting animal cruelty, especially if there is little physical evidence of violence. Cell phone footage has become an effective way of proving animal cruelty, so record direct violence if you see it.Record inhumane living conditions only if you can do so without violating someone’s personal property.

, There are plenty of ways to anonymously report any signs of animal cruelty that you’ve identified. The easiest is to call emergency services or animal control, but you should be aware that you might be asked to testify against the perpetrator.While you can report animal cruelty to law enforcement or animal control anonymously, providing your information and being willing to testify will help ensure the case will be pursued.
If you live in the United States and see evidence of abuse in farm animals or undomesticated animals, you can contact the US Department of Agriculture directly by calling (301) 851-3751 or filing a complaint using their online form: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/complaint-form.

, If you are concerned about a puppy mill, pet store, or inhumane breeder, you can contact the USDA using their phone number or complaint form. You can also contact them for help finding the right regional department to report inhumane breeding practices. You should be prepared to make a written statement in the same way you would if you witnessed other forms of abuse and neglect., It can be difficult to approach a friend or family member about animal abuse or neglect, whether they are a child or your elderly relative. Try to take a delicate and tactful approach: get support from other family members, talk to them about the situation, and consider anonymously contacting animal control.If your elderly relative owns more animals than they can properly care for, try to intervene with the help of other family members. Be gentle and understanding when you approach them. Say, ""We know you really love your pets, and that they give you a lot of comfort. But we're concerned that there could be difficulty in offering them the best care. We need to find new homes for some of them so that they can be happier.""
If your child has abused an animal, have a serious discussion with them about it. Let them know they should never intentionally harm an animal. Animal cruelty is not recognized as a natural stage of child development. Inform their teachers and guidance counselors so that they can also look for signs of displaced hostility at school. Consider taking your child to a therapist or other mental healthcare professional.
If your friend or family member disregards your concern, remember that animal abuse and neglect can often point to more significant problems, including child neglect and domestic violence. It might not be a comfortable thought, but if you don't believe you or another relative can make a significant intervention, consider notifying animal control or other authorities. Remember you can do so anonymously.

Post an online ad (such as on Craigslist)
Place an ad in a local newspaper
Perform an internet search for dog walkers and/or pet sitters in your area
Talk to friends;
, Although dog walking and pet sitting is a largely unregulated field, some companies, groups, and individual dog walkers will have credentials that you can verify. Inquire about these at each interview.Your pet sitter should have first aid training, both for humans and your pet.
Ask if they have a membership with either National Association of Professional Pet Sitters or Pet Sitters International. These are established groups that offer training and licensing programs to their members.
They should be able to provide references to you.

, In order to hire the right person, you must make sure that the dog walker/pet sitter can consistently work the schedule you need, as well as take care of any special needs you or your dog may have. Take some time to create a list of your specific needs. You might write down:


The times and days you will need this service
The length of time you'd like your dog walked
Any dates that you'll be away
Everything you'd like this dog walker/pet sitter to handle (feeding, playing, cleaning, etc.)

, Your dog walker or pet sitter may offer other services, in addition to basic pet care. Asking about these services and how much they might cost can help you decide if a pet sitter or dog walker is the right one for you.Some dog walkers and pet sitters will offer bathing services for your pet.
Your pet sitter may offer to water your plants or bring your mail into your house for you.

, Some dog walkers and pet sitters will have a working relationship with a local veterinarian. Having this relationship can help your pet get medical attention should an emergency occur. Ask your potential dog walker or pet sitter if they are in contact with a local veterinarian.You can also provide contact information for your own veterinarian.

, A good pet sitter or dog walker will take notes of any specific care needs that you indicate. Someone who doesn't seem to be paying attention or making an effort to take these details down should be passed over. Always make sure your potential pet sitter or dog walker pays careful attention and makes some kind of note about your instructions., Ask your potential dog walker or pet sitter about any backup plans they have, should they be unable to care for your pet during the time you schedule. Problems and emergencies can arise, and a good pet sitter or dog walker should have a plan in place to ensure that your pet still receives proper care., Your dog walker or pet sitter should have either liability insurance or be bonded to an agency or company. Liability insurance will help cover both parties (both you and the dog walker) in the event of loss or accidents. Bonding can repay the value of any items that were proven to be stolen by a pet sitter or dog walker., Knowing what to expect when it comes to the cost of a pet sitting or dog walking service can help you decide if the service is right for you. Costs will vary, depending on the level of qualification and amount of services offered by your dog walker or pet sitter.

, Many dog walkers or pet sitters will offer a contract that explains what services are offered and detail the responsibilities of both parties. These contracts are also legally binding and can help resolve any issues should they arise. If your dog walker/pet sitter does not have a contract prepared, consider creating one yourself. Carefully read over any contract that is offered and make sure the terms are agreeable., Before you consider seeking out the services of a pet sitter or dog walker, you will have to make sure that your pet is comfortable around other people.

If your pet has special dietary requirements or medical needs, you should leave them with your pet sitter.

, Chances are your pet sitter or dog walker will bring only minimal supplies. If you are requiring their services over a period of time, you will need to leave enough supplies to properly care for your pet while you are away.Make sure your pet will have enough important items such as food or any medicines they need.
Leave extra supplies in case you are delayed upon your return.

, If you are having a pet sitter stay in your home for a period of time you will need to let them know about important aspects of your home.

Execute a conservation easement.,
Report illegal hunting and fishing.,
Avoid taking federally listed species.,
Be aware of the chemicals you use on your land.",How to Legally Protect Wildlife1," A conservation easement is a legally binding document restricting the use of private land in order to protect a particular resource. In your instance, you may be considering placing a conservation easement on your land to protect the wildlife. If you choose to enter into a conservation easement, you will in essence be selling or donating certain property rights to a nonprofit organization (called a land trust). The land trust will in turn have the right to enforce your promise and ensure the land is forever protected for the conservation purposes stated in the agreement.


You should investigate different land trusts so you understand who will be enforcing the promises in the easement and how they will be doing it. For example, the Wildlife Land Trust, Ducks Unlimited, and the Conservation Fund are all land trusts that advertise their ability to manage conservation easements focused on wildlife.Investigate your options prior to entering into an agreement with one.
While the land will remain in your possession and you will own it, you will be restricted in what you can do with the land. For example, you may not be able to build permanent structures on the land or divert water away from a natural stream.
A conservation easement is intended to last in perpetuity (i.e., forever) and therefore it may affect your ability to sell it in the future.Due to the complex tax and contract implications of executing a conservation easement, you should always contact a lawyer prior to signing an agreement. A lawyer will be able to talk with you about the benefits and drawbacks of participating in a conservation easement.
Once the easement has been executed, it should be recorded at the county recorder's office in the county where the property is located.;
, While hunting and fishing are regulated by each individual state, the actual acts often happen on private land. If you do not want to allow hunting or fishing on your land, you should make that clear. Purchase ""No Trespassing"" signs and place them around your land. Ideally you would also have your land fenced in, although this is not always feasible. Be careful to only post signs on your land and not anywhere else. It is illegal to place a sign on land that is not yours.If you do allow hunting and fishing on your land, you can help regulate how and when it happens. By doing so, you will ensure animals are hunted and fished sustainably and humanely. First, find out when official hunting and fishing seasons are and only allow activity when it is in season. For example, in Maine, deer season runs from October 31 through November 26.Contact your state department of fish and wildlife if you have any questions.
In addition only allowing activity in-season, you can also set rules for people hunting and fishing on your land. For example, you might only allow each hunter to kill one deer per visit. You might also limit the number of fish they are allowed to catch when they are on your land.
If you see illegal hunting or fishing on your land, you should contact your local police or sheriff's department immediately. Illegal hunting and fishing is a crime and individuals can be criminally prosecuted. Some states even have hotlines you can contact.This is one of the strongest deterrents available to help protect wildlife.

, The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the ""taking"" of a listed species from the wild without an exemption or permit. The ESA remains in effect on private land when a listed species happens to be present there. ""Taking"" includes harassing, harming, hunting, shooting, killing, or capturing. Listed species include endangered and threatened species, which are determined by the federal government.If you are unsure whether listed species are present on your private land, you can hire resource professionals to come out and examine your property. If listed species are found, you can make arrangements with your state fish and wildlife service or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in order to get guidance on how to manage and protect your land.Even if you are not taking listed species on private land, you should report anyone you believe is. Listed species need to be protected and your help will undoubtedly achieve that goal. If you need to report a violation, contact your local or federal fish and wildlife service.

, Whether you have a big lawn, a small garden, or hundreds of acres of farmland, you should always know what types of chemicals you are putting on your land. While a lot of chemicals are advertised to make your lawn greener, your flowers bigger, and your vegetables bulkier, you do not always hear about how these chemicals can harm the wildlife. Always be aware of what you are buying and how it will affect the animals on your land.


For example, while insecticides will help kill or control insect populations, they can have unintended consequences on an entire ecosystem. Wildlife can be exposed to the chemicals directly by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Some animals can breathe the chemicals in or absorb them through their skin. Predators (e.g., hawks and owls) can be contaminated by eating other animals that have been affected by the chemicals. Some chemicals will have direct affects on wildlife and can lead to death. Other chemicals can affect a population indirectly by interfering with their ability to reproduce."

, See how long the company has been in business. The longer someone has been pet sitting, the more experience they have. Be sure to read their testimonials, do their clients live in your town?

, Along with experience, they have other credentials like Pet First Aid or Obedience Training. Also, make sure they have insurance and a bond. Insurance will cover any possible damage to your home, pet or the pet sitter, while they are on your property. The bond protects from any possible theft or loss from an employee.

, Watching them interact with your pets will help you to know if this is the right person for you and your babies.

, Be sure to check the reference you are given to ensure of the trust and dependability of your new pet sitter. After all, these are your babies and your home that we are dealing with!

, Because it is important for your animal to stay on his or her regular schedule and normal routine, your pet sitter should be flexible and accommodating. They should be able to get to your pets for their regularly scheduled potty breaks and feeding times. This ensures less stress and makes them feel that the only thing missing is you!

, In addition to feeding, playing, walking making sure your pet has fresh water and your cats boxes are scooped, many companies provide other services which are very useful and provide care to your home. They can pick up your mail, water your plants inside and out and take your garbage and recycle out for you. Having them alter your blinds and lights also serves as home security and makes your home look “lived-in”, while you are away. Most visits are typically 25 to 35 minutes, depending on the needs of the animal.

, Make sure you know who is going to be entering your home. There could be times when your regular pet sitter is not available, so be sure you know when that might happen and who the replacement would be.

, You can also schedule as many visits per day as you want. Typically for dogs, people will have no less than two per day and often times 3 per day. If you have a doggy door and only need two, you may want to consider a third visit, perhaps every other day, to provide a little extra company for your pet. These tips should ensure that your pet(s) are healthy, happy and safe when you are away from home.

Take part in land acquisition programs.,
Urge the federal executive branch to vigorously enforce conservation laws.,
Encourage Congress to create more national parks.,
Report illegal hunting or fishing.",How to Legally Protect Wildlife2," One way to protect wildlife is to transfer ownership (or possession) of private property to the government. In certain situations these transfers can be made for the purpose of wildlife conservation. One example of this is the Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) easement programs. If you utilize these programs, the NRCS will provide financial assistance as well as easement oversight when you enter into a conservation easement with them. While you will maintain possession of your land, NRCS will hold certain property rights.Some states also offer programs to help transfer private lands into public hands. For example, in Massachusetts, there is a Land Protection Program meant to protect biologically diverse lands in the state. If your land is eligible (i.e, biologically diverse and accessible), the government will pay you to transfer certain property rights to the government. At a minimum, you will usually need to allow for wildlife protection and public access for certain activities., The federal executive branch (i.e., the President and executive agencies) is responsible for executing the laws of the United States. A number of these agencies are responsible for enforcing conservation laws. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is responsible for implementing the ESA. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers are responsible for implementing the Clean Water Act (CWA). These agencies can enforce federal laws on public lands, which include Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands, national parks, and federal wildlife preserves.


If you want to advocate for wildlife protection on public lands, contact one or more federal agencies and let them know you would like to see better enforcement. If you see a potential violation, contact the agency and ask them to look into it.
In addition to contacting the agencies, you may also want to write a letter the President of the United States. The President is ultimately responsible for executing the laws of the U.S. and if they want to be reelected, they will listen carefully to your concerns.

, National parks are created by acts of Congress. When a national park is created, that land is protected by the National Park Service. Employees work to recover and protect all the species located on national park land.Because Congress is responsible for creating national parks, you should talk to your representatives about public lands you believe would be good candidates for national parks. You can write them a letter and explain your stance. Members of Congress will usually respond to your letter and discuss your stance with you. Your representatives depend on you to get elected so every one of them is likely to take your concerns seriously.

, Hunting and fishing on some public lands are permitted so long as you obtain the correct permits. Permits to hunt on public lands allow you to hunt at certain times and at certain locations. In addition, permits regulate what animals you can hunt and how many you can take. So long as everyone in your group follows the rules, hunting on public lands can actually be positive for the ecosystem.However, if the rules are broken, the person or people hunting or fishing can be punished. For example, if a game warden sees suspicious activity and they catch you doing something you shouldn't be doing, you can be fined or even charged with a misdemeanor.If you see someone breaking fishing or hunting rules on public lands, you should call your state fish and wildlife service or other law enforcement agency responsible for patrolling the area you saw the activity.

Tasks.,
Length.,
Materials.",How to Decide on a Pay for Pet Sitter," How many pets is the person looking after? Naturally, two dogs will cost more than one. Usually, people don't double the costs for two animals however they raise them. For example if you would charge $10 for one dog, charge $15 for two.;
, Caged animals such as hamsters and rats are much smaller and easier to care for than dogs. If caged animals are $10, charge $25 for non-caged such as dogs.

, The amount of work and time will affect the pay. Dogs need to be walked, fed, given water, washed and interacted with, therefore you should pay the sitter more than a sedentary animal such as a hamster or fish.

, How long are they looking after your pets for? Usually charge per day and an equal amount per day.

, Are you giving them materials or will they buy food, cleaning products etc. If they are buying it, you need to pay them for those too.

, If you know other pet owners in your area, this can also be a good option. A referral from a trusted friend may be more reliable than an online listing. Try asking friends and family members who have used pet sitting services for the names of sitters they've used in the past.

, When finding names of sitters, there are some things you should look for. You do not want to waste your time contacting a sitter who does not have the right credentials.You should make sure any pet sitter you hire has liability insurance. A pet sitter should also have had some formal training.
Check to see if the pet sitter works with a veterinarian. You want to make sure emergency services are available if necessary.
Make sure a pet sitter provides references. You do not want to hire anyone without contacting past clients first. A pet sitter will have access to your home. You want a list of people who can confirm the legitimacy of a potential sitter.

, Start compiling a list. In addition to looking for general indicators of quality, take your specific needs into account.Does your pet have any specific medical problems? If so, only list sitters with experience working with animals with health issues.
Is the sitter available during the time you will be gone? Do you need an overnight sitter? If so, will the sitter be able to stay overnight?
What kind of animal do you have? You do not want to book a sitter who only has experience with dogs if you have a cat.

, You want to find someone in your price range. Some sitters are willing to negotiate prices, so you do not necessarily need a perfect match. However, look for sitters that are within a reasonable range of what you can afford.Have an idea of how much you can spend per night or per day. Check sitters rates online, or ask them when calling them.
Give yourself a general range and only list sitters who fall in that range. For example, say you can afford about $60 to $100 a night. Look for sitters in this range.

, This can allow you to learn a lot about a pet sitter. You want a sitter who genuinely loves animals and enjoys his or her job.An open-ended question allows you to judge a sitter's excitement about the job. A good sitter should not hesitate to answer. He or she should immediately have an answer ready.
Look for someone who is animated and enthusiastic. They will probably be more dedicated to your pets during the job.

, Your pet may have special needs. You should make sure your pet sitter is able to provide these services. Some pet sitters just do the bare minimum. Others throw in extra services.For example, say you have a longhaired dog. He or she may need grooming on a weekly basis. You should make sure your pet sitter is willing to groom your dog.
You may also want someone who is going to spend time with your animals. If your cat gets nervous when you're gone, for example, you will want a pet sitter willing to play with and pet your cat during your vacation.

, You want a sitter with experience that matches your needs. Professional training is also a huge plus. Training can help a sitter spot health problems and deal with emergencies.Make sure a sitter has experience with your specific type of pet. If you have a very large dog, you do not want a sitter who primarily worked with toy poodles. If you have a rescue dog with behavioral issues, you want a sitter who has worked with difficult animals previously.
There are many pet sitting training programs, and a pet sitter may also have had professional training elsewhere. For example, a pet sitter who works part time as a veterinary technician may be a good option. He or she would be able to handle any health issues that arise.

, Ideally, you should hire an insured sitter. If a sitter works through an agency, he or she may be insured through that agency. Independent sitters occasionally have their own private insurance. You want insurance in the event an accident occurs while you are away., Does your pet need any special care while you are away? If so, bring this up during an interview. You want to make sure a potential sitter can meet all your pet's needs.The sitter should not be intimidated or nervous when you bring up special needs. Say a potential sitter seems nervous when he or she finds out your cat needs a daily insulin shot. This sitter may not be qualified to watch your pet.
Look for a sitter that seems confident and also has experience. For example, go for a sitter who has given animals shots before and is not squeamish about it.

, You want a sitter who can handle anything. Accidents can happen, so make sure your sitter has a game plan in the event of an emergency.If your sitter has worked as a vet or vet technician, this can be a major bonus. He or she may be able to act fast in the event of an emergency.
However, even a sitter without veterinary training should be able to handle emergencies. A sitter should know how to handle an injured animal. A qualified sitter should know the signs an animal is injured or in pain. He or she should also have the number of your veterinarian on hand.

, This is a good way to make a final decision. References can answer any questions you have about a pet sitter. If you have your list narrowed down to a few sitters, try calling up a sitter's references.This is an opportunity to ask about any reservations you have. If there's any reason you're unsure of whether to hire a sitter, bring this up when speaking to the reference.
Try to contact references who have pets that are similar to your pets. This will be the best way to assess whether a sitter works for you.
Ask references if the sitter was respectful of their homes. A pet sitter will have access to your home while you are away. You want someone you can trust to handle your things and not make a mess or cause any damage.

, You should always do this before making a final decision. You want to make sure your pets are comfortable with a potential sitter before you leave.Make sure your pets seem comfortable with the sitter. They should not appear nervous or upset in the sitter's presence.
If your pets do not seem to warm up to the sitter, you should probably go with someone else. Pets get stressed being left alone. Being left with a sitter they dislike can make stress worse.

, If you're having trouble deciding, look at price again. Find the sitter whose rates best match your pay range. If you have two quality sitters to choose from, going with the cheaper sitter can help you make a final decision., Once you have chosen the sitter, this is necessary. You want to make sure the two of you have a firm understanding of the expectations for care.A contract should list any services that will be provided. It should include things like feeding, playing, grooming, and walking. It should also be clear how often the sitter will check on the pets.
Make sure you figure out a price range. A sitter may be willing to negotiate price. Find a range that feels fair to both of you.

, Sitters do sometimes cancel at the last minute. Also, there's always a chance your sitter will have an emergency while you are away. Make sure to leave a set of keys with a friend or family member. In the event the sitter can't make it, someone else can check in on your pets for the day.


You should also have a list of second choice sitters. In the event your sitter cancels, you call up one of the other candidates.

A love of animals is perhaps the most important qualification a pet sitter can have. As you'll be spending the bulk of your time with your client's animals, make sure you genuinely enjoy animal company.Low stress is another desirable quality in a pet sitter. Your schedule will likely be subject to change as it depends heavily on the schedules of your clients. You need to be the type that's flexible and calm regarding sudden changes.Self motivation and organization are also desirable qualities for pet sitters. You'll need to manage your schedule around multiple clients and track the needs of a variety of cats, dogs, and other pets.;
, Professional pet sitters usually have commercial liability insurance to cover any accidents or incidents while they pet sit. If you're looking into longterm pet sitting, liability insurance might be a good investment.


Pet sitting insurance will cover you in the event of any damage caused to the client’s home, such as accidentally knocking over an expensive vase or breaking a window. It will also cover you if you lose grip of the dog’s lead and he attacks another dog or person.In the United States, membership fees vary from company to company. Websites like petsitters.org and petsittersinsurance.com will help you compare rates and find the coverage that's right for you.If you're working through a pet sitting company, it's doubtful you'll need to take out insurance on your own. Most companies have policies in place that protect their employees. Check with the company you work for and ask questions about insurance and your personal coverage.

, While a certification is not a requirement to be a pet sitter, having some professional training on your resume can impress present and future clients. It can also open up additional opportunities for you down the road.


A certification of training lets clients know you're serious about your job and dedicated to providing the best care possible. If you ever want to work with a pet sitting agency, having some form of professional training is a great resume booster.A variety of organizations provide training programs for pet sitters. The National Assembly of Professional Pet Sitters and Pet Sitters International provide general training for pet sitting.The International Boarding and Pet Services Association provides training if you're looking into boarding dogs at your own kennel facility for extended periods. This can get pricey, however, as you're required to pass master exam to get certified. The exam can cost upwards of $125., Provide phone numbers and contact information for owners you have pet sit for in the past. This will show the owner you have experience as a pet sitter and are confident in your ability to take care of someone else’s pet.


Always ask permission before sharing someone's contact information. Make sure past clients agree to sever as your reference and get their preferred phone number and email.
If possible, choose people you have worked with for a long time. For most jobs, a reference should ideally be someone you've known for a year to a year and a half.
If you're new to the field and have never pet sat before, you can use past employers or friends whose animals you watched while they were on vacation.

, The pet's owner will have a variety of expectations of you, the pet sitter, based around their pet's specific needs. Make sure all expectations are clearly stated and understood.


Knowing the basics is important. Know where the pet's food is kept, how much they need each day, when and where to feed them, and any medications they're taking.Time commitment is another expectation that should be understood right away. For some jobs, you'll be required to stay in the owner's home. For others, you might only need to check in daily or every other day.Ask questions. It's your job as a good pet sitter to make sure all bases are covered, so have a running list of questions to ask pet owners. How old is the pet? What is their medical history? Do they do well with children? Other animals? How often should the dog be taken out? How often should a cat's litter box be changed? These are questions that should be addressed before the pet sitting job begins.Check with the owner about how often they give the pet treats or rewards, based on the pet’s behavior. The owner may have certain discipline methods for the pet that they will expect you to follow, like withholding treats for bad behavior or acknowledging good behavior with a special treat.
Ask the owner about the pet’s likes and dislikes. These details will prepare you for any possible triggers for the pet and prevent any issues from happening to the pet while she is in your care., Certain information is important in the event of an emergency or medical issue.


Most owners will readily provide contact information for their veterinarian. Make sure you know where this information is written down. It might be a safe bet to enter contact information into your phone or have an electronic copy in your email in the event paper copies gets lost.In addition to the owner's contact information, ask for the phone number of a friend or family member close by. This way, in the event you can't contact the owner, you have a second person to contact in case of emergency., If you're pet sitting for a friend or family member, pay may not be an issue. However, if this is a more professional endeavor you can expect to be paid and should determine the amount before the job begins.


Research fees to see what is reasonable. Care.com is a great resource to research rates and fees associated with pet sitting in your area.The national average wage for pet sitters is $16/hour. So if you are working eight hours a day, at $16/hour, you can make $128/day.The owner may pay you a weekly wage. The average is around $600/week.You may also receive extra money for extra services, like house cleaning and maintenance, or payment in the form of free food and lodgings.
Rates also go up depending on the number of pets you're caring for and your level of experience. The owner might want to negotiate fees. Make sure you are courteous during this process. You don't want to lose a client by being argumentative.

, If possible, schedule a practice visit. This way, the pet is familiar with you beforehand and you'll know where to find food, water, treats, and toys.


Even if you already know the pet, a practice visit isn't a bad idea. There may be information about the pet that's never come up in casual conversation that you need to know as a pet sitter.The owner will also want to make sure the pet is comfortable with you. If there are any issues with aggression or timidness in your presence, they may want to select an alternative pet sitter. Do not take this personally. Sometimes a pet and person simply clash. Rescue pets often have negative associations that the owners do not fully understand, and you may inadvertently trigger a bad reaction., The owner likely left you both written and verbal instructions for pet care and upkeep.


Feed the pet at the right time and give them the right amount of food. Cat owners sometimes let their cats have open access to dry food throughout the day. If this is the case, make sure to fill food bowls when they're running low and make sure clean water is provided.
Give the pet any medications she needs. Pets who are on medications usually need to stick to a regular schedule and dosage. Follow the owner’s instructions on how to give the pet her medication and don’t forget or neglect the pet’s medication.
Clean litter boxes regularly and let dog's out as many times a day as the owner recommends.

, If you want to stand out from other pet sitters, doing some extra tasks for the owner can be a great way to show your added dedication.


Do some basic upkeep for the pet owner’s home, if you are pet sitting at their home. Water the plants. Collect the mail. Keep the home clean.
While doing dishes might seem like a great way to earn favor, be careful. People often have specific organizational structures for their kitchens and might feel peeved if you mess with their system. If you do dishes, wash them, leave them out to dry, but refrain from putting them away.

, A big part of your role as a pet sitter is to keep the pet safe and comfortable while her owner is away. The pet is likely nervous without their owner present so show them affection and attention on a daily basis.

If the pet has a favorite toy, play with them often. It's best to play with the pet until the appear to run out of energy and lose interest in the game. This way, they'll be tired when you leave and more likely to sleep and relax until you return.
After you fulfill duties like cleaning and feeding, sit with the pet and show them affection via stroking, cuddling, and talking. Pets, cats and dogs especially, are very social and crave human interaction when their owners are missing.
Be careful about bringing in outside food and treats. The owner might have the pet on a specific diet and you don't want to disrupt that while away. Never give a pet table scraps without the owner's consent.

Contact NOAA if you think you see violations.,
Reach out to nonprofit organizations.,
Fish responsibly and sustainably.",How to Legally Protect Wildlife3," NOAA is a federal agency responsible for executing laws pertaining to the ocean. Some of those laws help protect oceanic mammals, marine fisheries, and habitat from destruction. One piece of NOAA's mission is to support fisheries in order to maximize the productivity of sustainable fisheries. In addition, NOAA helps protect, recover, and conserve protected species.


While NOAA patrols, inspects, and monitors fisheries, they cannot do it all by themselves.If you see a fishery being overfished, or if you see a restricted fishing area being fished, contact NOAA immediately. When you contact NOAA, give them your information, a description of the activity you are seeing, and in depth instructions about where you are at.

, Government agencies are not the only organizations trying to protect marine wildlife. There are countless nonprofit organizations around the U.S. with the mission of protecting and conserving these animals. If you have any question about laws or regulations, or if you need help bringing a lawsuit against someone you think has broken the law, contact a local nonprofit.


For example, the Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN) is a nonprofit organization working to protect marine wildlife around the globe. They have multiple offices staffed with attorneys, scientists, and outreach specialists ready to help you., Ocean fishing is a huge industry around the world and accounts for a large supply of our annual seafood. Unfortunately, if fishing is not conducted in a sustainable manner, it can lead to overfishing and population depletion. When a fish population becomes depleted, it can be hard for individuals to reproduce. If fish can't reproduce, you can't continue to eat them. Therefore, it is important to understand the laws and regulations regarding what can be fished, when it can be fished, and the manner in which it can be fished.


Some species can only be fished at certain times during the year and in certain areas. For example, salmon fishing in the ocean of the coast of Washington state can only take place at certain times and in certain locations.
In addition to having fishing seasons, some species can only be fished using certain methods. For example, some fishing can only be done with a hook and line, while in other situations you may be able to use a trawl netting.

Avoid buying wild animals.,
Support wildlife conservation groups.,
Think twice about visiting zoos and aquariums.,
Be conscious of where products come from and how they are tested.",How to Legally Protect Wildlife4," Wildlife is often sold around the world to collectors, tourists, and other individuals with an exotic eye. This is particularly true overseas, where national laws may not outlaw the sale of wildlife like the U.S. does. Even if the sale of certain species is outlawed, law enforcement is often corrupt and will look the other way.


While you should personally avid purchasing wildlife, especially if it is endangered, you can also help prevent the whole process. If you think you see an illegal animal being sold, you should contact the local law enforcement agency in your area. If you are on a tour or at a hotel, tell an employee., Countless nonprofits around the world fight for the conservation of wildlife every day. However, nonprofits cannot run without funds. If you have the ability to donate to this cause you feel strongly about, you should do so. Donating money will allow scientists to continue to protect habitat, lawyers to continue to fight on wildlife's behalf, and legislative teams to lobby legislatures.

, While some zoos and aquariums are in existence to help conserve wildlife, there are others that simply exploit it. Before you visit a zoo or aquarium, do some research about it. For example, the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium is run by the nonprofit Heal the Bay. Heal the Bay runs the aquarium to raise money in order to protect the species you are going to see. The aquarium is also meant to give people an idea of the type of wildlife living right of the coast of Southern California.On the other hand, some people might claim an organization like SeaWorld exists to exploit wildlife. Instead of trying to conserve and safe marine mammals, SeaWorld takes them from their natural habitats and trains them to do things they would not do in the wild.

, A lot of tourist products, especially those in biodiversity locations, come from parts of wildlife. For example, when you go to Africa you might see little trinkets made from ivory (elephant tusks). If you go to a coastal community, you might see shells for sale. When you see these products, you should avoid purchasing them. When you purchase these things you are promoting the killing of the animals that use them. This tourist trade is driven by demand and if you don't buy the products, people will not make themIn addition, a lot of products are tested on animals in labs. For example, some makeup and other beauty products are tested on monkeys before they are sold to humans. Before you buy these products, make sure you know if they were tested on animals. if they were, do not buy them.

Dispose of trash properly.,
Recycle.,
Use pesticides sparingly.,
Eat responsibly and sustainably.,
Purchase green products.,
Conserve water.",How to Legally Protect Wildlife5," Trash can harm wildlife in a variety of ways. For example, birds can get their heads caught in plastic rings. Other wildlife can consume trash, like plastic bags. To avoid poisoning wildlife, you should properly dispose of your trash.You can also pick up other people’s trash. Once a month, you could go out for a walk with a giant trash bag. Pick up as much garbage as you can.

, Try to reuse as much as you can.By reusing products, you reduce the stress put on the environment. Most cities have recycling programs even if they are not mandatory. Call your town or city manager’s office for more information.


You should be especially careful to recycle electronic devices. The Environmental Protection Agency publishes a list of places where you can recycle mobile phones, personal computers, and televisions., Pesticides can run off your plants and into rivers and streams, where they can kill off fish. Try to follow these rules for using pesticides so that they do not harm wildlife:Choose the least toxic products on the market. If possible, don’t use pesticides unless you absolutely must.
Avoid applying pesticides when it is raining.
Clean up all spills immediately.
Always leave a buffer between the plants you treat and any body of water.
Don’t spray flowers directly when bees are visiting the flowers. Only apply pesticides at night, when bees aren’t visiting.
Avoid disposing of pesticides in storm drains, sewer systems, or waterways. Instead, follow disposal methods recommended on the label.

, Think about what is on your plate before you eat it. You should try to eat plants (e.g., fruit and vegetables) whenever possible. Not only will this result in less animals being killed for food, it also helps reduce freshwater withdrawals and deforestation. If more freshwater and forests are available and healthy, more wildlife will have habitats to live in. You should also reduce your meat intake if possible. Meat production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn perpetuate climate change. When the earth's climate changes, wildlife lose habitat and die off. When you eat seafood, try to choose sustainably fished and local seafood only. A lot of species are at risk of being over-fished and should therefore be avoided., The materials that make up the products you buy come from the environment and some are harvested more sustainably than others. If you consciously choose what to buy and where to buy it from (e.g., coffee, chocolate, furniture), you will be able to help reduce the harmful impacts certain products have on wildlife.


For example, when you buy wood furniture, ask where the wood was harvested from and if it was harvested sustainably. If the company cannot give you a direct answer, do not buy their products.When you buy chocolate, one of the ingredients in it is cacao. If cacao is not harvested sustainably, it can lead to deforestation and destruction of bird habitat., All animals need water to live, humans included. While water is a necessity of life, it is not infinitely available. Therefore, you should take special care of the water near you and only use what you need. By doing so, you will help ensure the water needed to sustain life is left in the streams and rivers where it can be utilized by other species.


For example, do not leave the water running while you are brushing your teeth or washing the dishes. Also, try taking shorter showers.

Get a pair of quality leather or canvas gloves.,
Find a canvas tarp or a large towel.,
Wear old clothing.,
Check the door of the trap.,
Move slowly and quietly.,
Drape the towel or tarp over the trap.,
Choose a good spot to release the skunk.,
Flip over a gravity door trap.,
Open a spring loaded door trap.,
Walk away from the trap quickly.,
Check the trap the following morning.,
Clean your clothing if you do get sprayed.",How to Approach and Release a Skunk from a Live Trap," You should always wear quality leather or canvas gloves when you are handling any animal traps. The gloves will protect your hands from getting scratched by the skunk and reduce your risk of infection due to exposure to feces or urine.You can use a pair of gardening gloves or work gloves as long as they are thick leather or canvas. Do not use gloves that have holes or cuts in them as you do not want your skin exposed.;
, You will use the towel or the tarp to cover the live trap. This will temporarily blind the skunk and make it easier for you to release the skunk from the trap. Find a towel or a tarp that you do not plan to use again, as it may be at risk of getting sprayed by the skunk.Make sure the tarp or towel is made of durable materials that cannot be cut or chewed by the skunk. Canvas, denim, and towel like material is best. You can also use a thick trash bag in a pinch.
Look for a towel or a tarp that is long and wide enough to cover the entire trap. Most live traps for skunks are 24 inches x 7 inches x 8 inches (61 cm x 18 cm x 20 cm).

, You should also put on some old clothing, such as an old long sleeve t-shirt and long pants. If you follow the approach and removal steps properly, you should not be sprayed by the skunk. But there is always a chance it could happen so you should opt for an outfit that you do not mind throwing out if it does get sprayed.Opt for clothing that covers your legs and arms, as you do not want to be at risk of getting scratched by the skunk. You can wear a scarf around your neck if you want to cover up further, but you will likely not come too close to the skunk to get scratched.

, There are two types of live traps: a trap with a gravity door and a trap with a spring-loaded door. You will need to use different techniques to open each one so you should stand several feet away from the trap and confirm the type by looking at the door.Gravity door traps use gravity to open and close. A locking mechanism on the door prevents the skunk from getting out of the trap. You will need to push on the trap and flip it over to open the door.
Spring loaded door traps use a spring latch on the door to open and close it. They can be more difficult to open and will require you to get close to the trap door.

, You do not want to appear threatening or large to the skunk. Crouch low to the ground and talk quietly to the skunk as you approach the trap. This way, the skunk will not view you as a threat.You should also avoid making any sudden or jerky movements. Walk low and slow to toward the trap with the tarp or towel in your hand.
Skunks will pound their front feet, making a steady thumping sound, when they feel agitated or stressed. If you hear thumping in the cage, take it as a warning that the skunk may spray you. You may need to back off and wait until the noise goes away to approach the skunk again.

, Once you have gotten close enough to the trap, carefully lay the towel or tarp over the trap. You want to cover the trap completely, save the door of the trap.Covering the trap will temporarily blind the skunk and make them less likely to spray what they cannot see. Once you lay down the towel or tarp you should wait a moment and listen for any thumping in the trap. Sometimes, the towel or tarp can startle the skunk and make them agitated.

, You should release the skunk in an area that is at the edge of your property, close to trees or a spot near a forest. Keep all outdoor areas and doors closed, such as your garage door or your barn door, so the skunk cannot run into these areas once you release it from the trap.If you are setting the trap yourself, you should try to set the trap in an area where you have seen skunks before, at the far end of your property. It will then make it easier to release the skunk into the wild, rather than risk it running somewhere on your property.

, If you have a gravity door trap, you will need to flip over the trap so the door opens and allows the skunk to leave. You can use a painters pole or a pole that is 10 feet (3 m) long at least to gently push the trap onto its roof. Once the trap flips over, the gravity door should pop open.You can also approach the trap from the side and use your hand or foot to gently flip over the trap. Make sure the trap is covered completely with the towel or tarp before you approach it.

, Spring loaded trap doors are a little trickier to open. You will need to approach the door and open it manually by pressing the spring loaded latch or button on the door. Make sure the trap is covered at the end opposite to the door so you can access the door easily.If you set the trap yourself, you may want to practice opening and closing it beforehand so you can do it quickly when it comes time to release a skunk. Opening the door quickly will reduce your risk of getting sprayed.

, Once you have opened the door, you should walk away from the trap quickly and quietly. You may hold another towel or tarp over your body and back away facing the trap so you are protected if the skunk does spray.Do not jump or run away from the trap as this can startle the skunk. Instead, walk away slowly and quietly so the skunk has time to come out of the trap on their own.

, Though the trap is now open, it may take the skunk some time to actually leave the trap. Noises around the trap may deter from the skunk from leaving. Skunks are also nocturnal animals so they may not exit the trap until nightfall. You should wait and check the trap the following morning, as the skunk will likely be gone by then.If you are in a rush to get the skunk out of the trap, you can use a garden hose to lightly wet the skunk. Do not spray the skunk with the force of the water. Instead, you should make the skunk wet with a light spray of water so it is encouraged to exit the trap. Make sure any enclosures nearby are closed and sealed so the skunk does not run out of the trap and hide in these areas.

, If you do end up getting sprayed by the skunk in the process of approaching and releasing it from the trap, you should make sure you clean your clothing and your body well to remove the smell. You will need to combine hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and liquid dish soap to get rid of the skunk spray.Wash your clothing and your body with the hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and liquid dish soap mixture. You should also flush your eyes with water if you get sprayed in the eyes.

Consider asking for extra services.,
Make sure the sitter will keep your home safe.,
Make sure the pet sitter has references.,
Check to see that the pet sitter is insured and/or bonded.,
Discuss appropriate payment and billing.",How to Interview a Pet Sitter," When you are out of town, you do not want to let everyone, especially anyone with criminal intentions, to know that no one is home most of the day. Ideally, there should be no advertisement on the car or truck the sitter drives. That would be a sure sign that you would be out of town. The security of your home should be a concern of the pet sitter as well as your animals.


They should not wear advertisement on their clothing for the same reasons.;
, Set up a time to meet the pet sitter at your home, and if possible, introduce a neighbor that knows you will be out of town. This neighbor could be the holder of an emergency key or be a contact if the sitter needs help or has questions. If not a neighbor, a family member or friend.

, When you do this, notice how the pet sitter and animal react to each other. This would be the time to tell the sitter what you expect of him or her; after all, you are paying them for a service. Other than dogs and cats, what other animals can they care for? If you have fish, exotic pets, or even livestock, then you should notify the sitter.

, Do your animals require fresh water daily, and to be fed daily? Cats and dogs will usually need a daily feed and must have access to clean, fresh water at all times, obviously. Other pets can be fed according to your feeding schedules and diets.


The sitter must know about any medications given to your pets. Can he or she administer medications? That should be a must. If at this time you find that they can care for only part of your animals, or they can not give daily medications, then you need to look for someone else who is more qualified.
Most importantly, the sitter must give your pets a clean and safe environment to eat, sleep and play in. This means cleaning litter boxes, crates and cages, poop scooping the yard if you do that on a scheduled day.
The sitter should also be able to transport your pet to a Vet Clinic if needed. If this should involve transporting livestock, then you should have the trailer and truck to pull it. Be sure that the sitter has pulled a trailer before—and decide if you want someone else driving your truck and trailer. 

, Here are the things your sitter will need to know about your pet:


Names, breed, color
Spayed or neutered
Ages
Temperaments
Diets
Medications
Likes and dislikes
Medical issues
Vaccinations
If they chase other animals or cars, or dig out of the yard
If they are crated at night

, You should provide the name, phone number, and address of the vet (and be sure the Vet knows that you will have a sitter and that the vet bill be charged to your account). Your phone numbers where you can be reached, and the number of a family member, friend and/or neighbor will also be helpful.

, Some pet sitters do provide extra services but they usually charge for them. They include:


Bathing
Basic grooming (brushing out)
Toenail trims
Ear cleaning
Express anal glands
Providing some play time

, Your sitter should help make it look like someone is home all the time to avoid break-ins, theft, or injury to any of the animals. You should ask the sitter if he or she charges for these services. This is what they should do to help the home look occupied:


Pick up the newspaper daily
Take in mail daily
Put out trash on their trash days
Alternate lights on and off inside the house each night
Water plants
Fill bird feeders

, The sitter should have a list of references on hand if requested; if they don't, you should wonder why. Do call on the references they give you. These people can fill you in on the kind of person that will be caring for your animals and will perhaps put your mind at ease.

, Pet sitters that are insured and/or bonded should have the paperwork with them along with the references. That just goes without saying; you either have it or you don't. You should be able to call and verify their coverage with no problem.

, Every pet sitter bills differently; they go by miles plus services, and then extra fees for extra services. Listen to all that they do provide, and determine what you want for your animals, and then find out the fees and see if it sounds reasonable. Talk with at least three pet sitting services, tell them what you need, and ask how much they would charge. That should give you some idea of the cost to expect.

This might include eyes that look larger than normal, lips moved to show teeth, ears positioned up and forward, a stiff tail possibly with a slow wag, hair standing along the back, and more.Pay attention for any signs of aggression and do not approach a dog that you think may be aggressive.;
, Look to one side of the dog rather than staring it down. Dogs consider this to be a sign of domination. They interpret it as a kind of challenge, and it can cause the dog to think you want to fight.Just as you should avoid eye contact with the dog in general—as above—prolonged eye contact might also anger or scare the dog.

, Rabies can affect all mammals—dogs included. A rabid dog might be restless, apprehensive, and aggressive. Dogs with rabies may bite or snap at anything with which it comes into contact, including people, other animals, or even inanimate objects. Rabies is spread by bites from infected animals, and an infected dog may lick or chew the bite where they were infected. The dog may also have a fever and be sensitive to light, sound, and touch—all the more reason to steer clear of an infected animal and call a professional to remove it.Because a rabid dog may have a paralyzed jaw and/or mouth, they may foam at the mouth—a familiar sign of rabies.
Rabid dogs may also appear disoriented and experience seizures.

, Often, making a soft clicking noise with your tongue, or talking to a stray quietly will be effective in getting a stray dog's attention. It is imperative that you do not startle or scare a stray dog, as they can become defensive and potentially attack you.Move slowly, remain calm, and use a soothing voice—doing so should keep you from scaring the dog, and thus help keep you safe too.

, If you have gotten the dog's attention, approach very slowly, ideally from a crouching position so as to appear smaller than you are. This technique can help to make you appear less intimidating to the animal. Again, the less you scare the animal the more successful you'll be in approaching safely and effectively.


Do not get down on your hands and knees, as this will make it harder for you to get away if the animal decides to attack. Only come within 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m) of the animal.

, Once you have gotten close, allow the dog to come to you. You might be able to get the dog to come to you by calling to it in a soothing voiceand putting out your hand if it shows interest, such as by wagging its tail. Gently pat the ground in front of you—you can also offer the dog strong-smelling food such as tuna or canned dog food to lure it into coming closer.Hold out your hand palm down. This is less threatening to most animals, and also lessens the chances of your fingers being bitten.
Observe the dog's body language if it does not approach. You may slowly—very slowly—start to take a few small steps toward the animal if it seems friendly but shy. Use utmost caution here, as the dog may be frightened by you moving toward it too closely. He or she may simply run away, but they might also interpret the movement a different way and attack, so be careful.

, Do not run. The dog could interpret such an action as an invitation to chase, or, worse yet, a challenge or act of aggression.If you use caution as you back away you should be able to move away without an incident.


Do not make eye contact.
Move slowly.

, This allows them to identify your scent, and acts in much the same way as the sensation of touch does for humans. In a sense, the dog smelling your hand is something like a handshake—it is getting introduced to you. Remain motionless while the dog smells your hand.

, Allow the animal to finish its examination of your hand, then slowly move your hand to its shoulder. Do not pet its head, as it may scare them or cause them to bite. Remember that many animals have areas that they do not like having touched, so go slowly and allow the animal to tell you whether what you are doing is okay with its reactions, etc.

, Wait until the animal is comfortable and secure or try to contain the dog with a leash or in a fenced-in yard, then check for an identification tag. Speak softly and move slowly to avoid frightening or startling the dog. If the animal has no ID tag, call your local rescue center, vet, or somewhere the animal will be able to stay. You may even consider bringing the dog to your home if it is agreeable enough to come with you peacefully or if it is friendly.

, Many dogs now routinely have microchip implants installed that contain identification numbers used to find owners. Find a veterinarian or rescue center that has a microchip implant scanner, and they will be able to tell you if the animal has a microchip implant. If they do, the owner should be able to be contacted.If they do not, you can hang found dog signs, place an ad online or in a newspaper, or consider adopting the animal for yourself.

Watch the cat's interactions with other animals.,
Analyze the body language.,
Observe the environment during the day and night.",How to Identify and Help Feral and Stray Cats1," Lost or abandoned cats who still hold any domesticated characteristics will most likely be a stray. Depending on the degree range, a cat will quickly approach a human who offers food or be afraid, but will show a small interest over time.;
, Feral cats have lived a huge part of their lives in the outdoor world and have no domesticated habits. These cats will shun humans however they can.

, Feral cats tend to create groups of their own, also known as colonies, while stray cats will roam and live by themselves.

, Feral cats will stray away from body communication, especially the eyes. Stray cats will be more apt to look directly at humans. Hissing, striking, and growling are common defense tactics used by feral cats, while strays tend to be more quiet in defending themselves, from small meows to low hissing., Both stray and feral cats tend to hang out where food can easily be found: near dumpsters, restaurants, abandoned structures, or under porches. Because strays retain some domesticated behavior, they can been seen more often during the day. Feral cats, on the other hand, are nocturnal and tend to come out of their hiding places for food runs during the night."

Make sure you remove the posters once your pet is found.",How to Make an Effective Missing Pet Poster," An electronic poster is easier to copy and distribute on the internet. On the other hand, a simple paper poster may be easier to make, especially if you don't have access to a computer.


Using a computer to help make and print out your initial copy will also help you check your spelling and grammar easily. There are even websites that specialize in allowing you to make missing pet posters quickly and easily.;
, Make sure both the font and format are simple and clear. Resist the urge to make a couple different styles of posters, as you want one style that is distinctive and will stay in people's minds.Stick to bold lettering and clear fonts. Don't use a font that has lots of flourishes, as this can be hard to read from a distance.
If you can't figure out how to format your poster, you can use a template to make it. There are many websites online that supply templates for lost pet posters., While colored paper may attract more attention, it can also make your information harder to read or distort the colors on the photo of your pet.


Consider printing a colored border around the poster instead of printing on colored paper. This will make your poster easier to read.
If you must print on colored paper, avoid using dark colored paper that will make black text hard to see and will make your pet's picture unclear.

, This will allow someone without a piece of paper or a phone on them to get your number easily. If you want to add these tabs you will need to take them into consideration when you are working on the layout of space on your poster.


Once you've made copies, you will need to cut in between the numbers, so that people can just rip one off easily. This will add just a little bit of time to the time it takes you to make the posters.

, A color photo is best, but black and white will work just fine. Be sure that the photo is clear and that it shows any defining physical characteristics of your pet, for instance distinctive patterning on its fur.

, It should be at least a couple inches high and state clearly what it lost. For example, if you lost your cat it should say ""Lost Cat."" The goal should be to have a clear and readable header that can easily be seen from a distance.Remember that presentation is important. People can walk right past a boring sign. Make sure you have a bold heading to catch their attention.

, It should be the size of a normal photo, around 5 x 7. If you are making a handmade sign, you can simply paste the photo in place. If you are making a poster on your computer, you will need to scan your photo or use one that you already have in electronic form.

, Go straight to the details. People usually don't feel like reading a long paragraph, so making bullet points can work effectively. Include your pet's sex, age, coat length, color, and any collar or tags.


If it is microchipped, mention that as well, but don't put down the microchip number on your poster.
If you know the area (with cross streets) that your pet was last seen in, mention that. Any information can help!

, Include your first name and your phone number on the poster.Place it centered near the bottom of your poster in a larger font than the description of your pet. This will allow the average reader to scan the poster quickly and find it.


If you are afraid to put your phone number on a public poster, you can get a prepaid phone for about $40 and use that number. That way, you can dispose of the number once you are done.

, If you want to offer a reward, do so, but do NOT mention the dollar amount. Many times thieves will take a purebred dog or cat and hope for a large reward to be offered.


Don't tip your hand, if you get proof someone has your pet, then it's time to negotiate.

, This is a personal touch that might encourage someone to take action. It doesn't have to be long. It can just simply say ""please help us find our beloved dog,"" or something like that.

, Otherwise, you can probably make copies on a home printer. You will want to distribute your poster widely, so make sure to get enough copies made.

, Make sure they know your pet's name and what it looks like. Some missing pets have a tendency to stay close to home, so your neighbors may be your best help if finding your missing loved one., Make sure to put some up at local stores, which usually have spots where you can do that. However, be sure to ask before you post your poster. Consider placing your posters at coffee shops, libraries, grocery stores, and high traffic streets., Use social media and email to get the word out that your pet is missing.You can either scan your handmade poster so that it can be posted electronically or you can simply use the electronic file if you made your poster on a computer.


To get the word out online about a missing pet you may not even need to use your poster. Try posting your pet's image on social media, such as on websites such as Facebook, and write a caption about when and where your pet disappeared, what is looks like exactly, and your contact info. Make sure that your post is made public, so even strangers can see it, and ask your friends to share it, so members of their social network see your pet's picture., When you put your phone number out in public, you are bound to get some funny calls. Just be polite and gracious with people calling in tips. If the caller doesn't have any pertinent info on your pet but doesn't want to end the call, just graciously say goodbye and hang up. While you will get some worthless calls, the next call could always be about your lost pet!


Don't let your kids answer the phone for awhile but don't avoid answering the phone yourself. Kids may not understand the difference between a call that could lead to finding your pet and a call that is just a waste of time.

, You can, if you like, leave one or two up, and put the word 'FOUND' on them in big letters. This will let neighbors know that your pet has been found. After all, everyone likes a happy ending! However, take the posters down after a week or so, before they get destroyed by weather and become litter.

Make your logo.,
Hire a graphic designer.",How to Name Your Pet Sitting Business2," Before you get started creating your own logo it can be a good idea to look at what others are doing. Study some logos of other successful pet sitting businesses to see what their logos might look like. By studying these logos you can get a better idea of what you want your own to look like.Looking at other pet sitting companies and their logos can tell you what to do and what to avoid.
Think like a customer. Ask yourself “what do these other logos make me think and feel?”

, The phrase “a picture is worth a thousand words” applies to your logo. A logo is a symbol that will instantly connect the customer to all the ideas and qualities of your business. Decide what you want to say with your logo in order to quickly convey the qualities of your business to a customer.Think of the qualities you want to represent. These might include things like “dependable”, “safe”, “affordable”, or “caring”.

, When designing a logo it can be tempting to add too much. Logos work best when they are clear, simple, and clean images that convey exactly what you want them too without extra elements. Think about some of the following key design tips for your logo to keep it simple and direct:It should be easily reproducible.
You should be able to easily describe the logo with words.
The logo should be memorable, being easily recalled by those who see it.
A logo should work with or without color.
Your logo should be intelligible at any size, large or small.

, People tend to have associations that are connected to certain symbols. For example, a shield indicates defense and might be appropriate for a security company. You will need to think of symbols that represent pet sitting and any other qualities that you want to convey in your logo.A paw print can be a good symbol for a pet sitting business. However, it may not make your business stand out next to other similar logos and businesses.
You might want to include a symbol that suggests “safety” or “home” such as a dog house.
Consider the tone of your symbols and avoid anything too playful, serious, or ambiguous.

, After you have your ideas collected and ready it's time to start building your logo. Make some rough sketches of your logo first and then work to refine them. Don't be afraid of making multiple variations on the same logo as one may look more appealing than your original arrangement.Try sketching out some rough ideas using a pencil and paper.
There are also websites and software that are designed to help you make a simple logo.
You may want to learn some simple graphic design programs and make the logo yourself.
If you are unable to create your own logo, take your ideas and work with a graphic artist.

, Creating a logo from scratch can be difficult. Time, skill, software and equipment can all be serious obstacles that stand in the way of self creating a great logo. If you are unable to do so you might consider working together with a graphic artist to get a high quality and professional logo.Bring in any rough sketches you might have.
Come prepared with the ideas you want to convey.

Avoid hesitating to help a cat.,
Seek experienced help if trapping a feral cat.,
Research and call a local cat organization that performs ""TNR"".,
Consider making a homemade shelter for feral cats.",How to Identify and Help Feral and Stray Cats2," Whether a cat is found to be stray or feral, both need the support of humans in their own way., Because of how wild and untamed feral cats are and their reactions to humans, it's best not to trap them yourself., TNR stands for ""Trap-Neuter-Return"", which is simply trapping the cats, neutering them, and returning the cats to their original ""home area"". Most vets also give the cat a rabies vaccination during the procedure.

, If you know a colony resides in the vicinity, get friends or neighbors to help you construct one or several ""homes"". Leftover lumber or small dog houses are most convenient and may be the easiest resources to find. Remember the bigger the house is, the less body heat is retained in the house. Straw is the recommended bedding material and don't forget to lay out food and water nearby."

Use a trap to most effectively catch stray cats.,
Keep the timing in mind when planning your catch.,
Request that the veterinarian check for a possible microchip.,
Think of creating lost and found notices.,
Consider putting the stray cat up for adoption.,
Consider adopting the cat yourself.,
Help your cat adapt to the new home environment.,
Provide lots of encouragement for the cat.",How to Identify and Help Feral and Stray Cats3," To avoid injuries to both yourself and the cat, you should never handle them with your bare hands, even if you have been nurturing it for a while. Choose to use bait, such as cat food or white chicken meat to lure the cat into the trap., If you are planning to visit a veterinarian within 12 hours, you may keep the cat in the cage or trap during that time. Using this method will eliminate the need to release the cat and then have to re-trap it. If the veterinarian visit is planned for a time that is further in the future, designate a closed, warm space in your house and provide food and water for the time being. Suitable areas might be the basement or a quiet, unused room., At the size of a grain of rice, microchips sit just underneath the skin between the shoulder blades. Scanning a microchip provides contact information about the animal owner., Craigslist, weekly newspapers, or social media sites are great ways to reach out to the community. Add a picture of the cat, a specific description, and include the area where you found the cat., Many animal shelters are typically loaded with animals, and non-adopted ones are usually put to sleep after some time to avoid overpopulation. Many people will put up a re-homing fee; this is to help ensure the cat will be going to a safe and loving home., Taking stray cats off the street is a great alternative for pet adoption rather than using pet stores or shelters., Your home environment may have a lot of obstacles and conditions the cat either may adapt after several months or years, or not at all. Some obstacles that are typically more difficult to overcome are young children and existing pets, especially dogs. High levels of patience are required and it helps if you are able to provide a dedicated room for the cat the first few months., This helps the cat adjust to new territory and will likely pay off in the end by establishing a warm relationship.

Prevent your pet from escaping.",How to Find a Missing Pet," Often times a pet will hide somewhere in the house if he becomes startled or upset. Before you panic and start canvassing the neighborhood, do a thorough inspection of your home to see if your pet is hiding somewhere nearby.There's a good chance your pet might just be hiding. Many pets do this when something frightens them or if they feel threatened in any way.
Check inside cabinets, closets, and spare rooms in case your pet tried to hide or accidentally got locked into a room/storage space.
Look behind, under, and inside every piece of furniture and every appliance.;
, Once you've searched everywhere inside your home, you'll want to move the search outdoors. Look around your property before you comb the neighborhood, though, as there's a chance your pet might still be on your property.Search through your home's crawl space, on your roof (for cats), in your home's gutters, and in any nearby trees.
Check your garage, under your car, in your yard, and in or behind your shed (if you have one).
Walk around the edge of your property once you've searched everywhere inside. Keep an eye out in your neighbors' yards and in the street or sidewalk out front.

, Whether you're searching indoors or outside, using food and toys is a great way to catch your pet's attention. If he's still on your property, there's a good chance your pet will come running (or at least make noise) when he hears his favorite things.Shake a food dish or treat jar full of treats that your pet loves, or shake/rattle/squeeze your pet's favorite toy.
If your pet is hiding within your home, he'll hear the treats or his toy and come out of hiding.

, Once you've ruled out the possibility that your pet is still inside or on your property, you'll need to move your search to the surrounding community. Before you leave, though, set up an outdoor feeding and play area in your yard, on your porch, or in the garage. That way, if your pet does return (and there's a good chance he will), he'll know that his food and toys are there and recognize it as his home.If your pet is in the neighborhood, he probably won't stray too far from home.
Your pet most likely recognizes the familiar sights and smells of your home, and will probably come back when he gets hungry or tired.
Leaving some food out might entice your pet back into your yard or onto your porch.
Try to have someone stay out in case your pet comes back. If you absolutely can't keep anyone outside in the yard or on the porch, try leaving your garage door open so that your pet can come inside.

, Don't give up hope once it gets dark out. Many animals are found at night, and in fact your pet may be waiting for nightfall to return home or look for you.Though dogs may be out at any time, cats tend to hide from people and activity that may be frightening or overstimulating.
There's a good chance that a lost cat will come out of hiding at night and walk around in the street or sidewalks after dark, once things are calmer in your neighborhood.

, A flashlight is one of your best tools for finding a lost pet. This invaluable object will come in handy, both night and day, as you search for your lost friend.Carrying a flashlight can be helpful, even during the day time. It can help you check in dark places.
Make sure you look in typical animal hiding places, such as underneath porches and shrubs, under cars, and in alleys.Your cat's or dog's eyes should ""glow"" in the dark when you shine a flashlight beam at him.

, In addition to a flashlight, you should always bring at least one recent photo of your pet with you as you search. Descriptions can only go so far, but seeing an actual photograph might trigger someone's memory or make them realize that the pet they saw was yours.As you search your neighborhood, you can show the photo to neighbors and ask if they've seen your pet.
Ask anyone you pass, but especially press for details from people walking their dogs, your mail carrier, and any nearby business owners., While you comb the streets, it's a good idea to let yourself be heard. Your pet will recognize your voice, and he may come out of hiding when he realizes you've come looking for him.Call your pet's name in an affectionate tone. Don't yell or use an angry tone, or he might not come out of hiding.
Bring your pet's favorite treats and/or his favorite toy. Use these items to make a lot of noise and let your pet know that you have these things for him.
Even as you make noise, be sure to take regular pauses to be quiet and listen. Your pet might bark, meow, or whimper in response, so you'll want to be sure you can hear him if he does.

, If you can't find your pet on your own by searching the neighborhood, you may need to enlist the help of your neighbors. Don't ask them to come search with you (unless you're very close with one or two of your neighbors), as this would be a huge imposition. However, you absolutely can and should let your neighbors know about the situation and ask them to keep an eye out for your pet.Hand out posters or photographs to your neighbors, your mail carrier, and your local pizza delivery driver. Someone might see your pet in the community, and will need to know what your pet looks like and how to contact you.
Include a full description of your pet. Specify the color, size, breed, age, sex, and any identifying characteristics, as well as the last time and place your pet was seen.

, Posters are a great way to let your neighbors and anyone passing through your community know about your missing pet. Be sure to include a colored photograph on the poster and a detailed description of your pet, including your pet's name, age, breed, and identifying characteristics.Hang your posters in the following locations:


grocery stores
community centers
veterinary clinics/offices
traffic intersections
pet supply stores
give copies to your mail carrier in case he sees your pet on his route, If someone has found your pet, there's a good chance that individual has or will report it to the proper agency. Depending on where you live, that agency may include law enforcement, animal care, and/or local animal control/animal pound.Reach out to every shelter, veterinary office/clinic, police station, and sheriff's office in your county.
Consider contacting the authorities, vet's offices, and shelters in your neighboring county/counties. Some animals run hard without realizing how far from home they've gotten, so your pet may turn up farther than you'd expected.
Hand out posters with identifying details about your pet, a recent color photograph, and your contact information to the authorities at every agency you visit.
Visit nearby animal shelters and animal control agencies on a daily basis (if possible) to see if anyone has found your pet. They should have posters and photographs, but sometimes a pet may not be recognized by anyone but his owner., Some people who find a pet with no ID will try to put up a notice on the internet. There are a number of websites that help facilitate this process, including (but not limited to):


Center for Lost Pets
Craigslist
Fido Finder
Lost Dogs of America
Lost Pet USA
Missing Pet Partnership
NextDoor
Pet Harboryour local veterinarian's website

, While you would hope that anyone who responds to your posters would have real information, the sad fact is there are some greedy/malicious individuals who may try to scam you. These people may be trying to get money from you up front, or they may try to lure you to an unsafe location. Don't fall for their tricks, and if you suspect foul play call the police immediately.If you put up posters or online notifications, leave out one identifying characteristic (a minor one, but one that anyone with your pet would notice).
If someone contacts you claiming to have your pet, ask that individual to describe the identifying characteristic you left out. If they can't, they might be trying to scam you.
Be wary of anyone who demands that you wire them money or deliver a reward for returning your pet. If someone makes such a demand, ask them to meet you somewhere and alert the police about the incident and the meeting time/place.
Never invite someone to your home if they claim to have your pet. Likewise, don't go to an individual's home, even if he claims to have found your pet.
Ask the individual to meet you in front of the local police station or in an otherwise crowded place.Don't go to meet the caller alone if he says he's found your pet. Always bring a friend or relative with you, and let a third party know where you're going and the phone number of the individual you're meeting.

, Every pet should wear a collar with an ID tag at all times. Whether you have a cat or dog, indoor or outdoor, make sure your pet can be properly identified and that you can be contacted in case anyone finds your furry friend.Even indoor pets should wear ID tags on their collars at all times.
Your pet's ID tag should include your name, address, and phone number.
If your pet does manage to get away from you, there's a much better chance of him being returned if he's wearing an ID tag.

, Microchipping your pet is a safe, easy, and relatively pain-free way to help protect your pet from being lost. The chip itself is smaller than a grain of rice and is injected into your pet just below the skin, typically around the shoulders.Your pet's microchip will include a registration number that is unique to your animal. It will also include a phone number to contact the registry where your pet's chip is listed.
An animal shelter or vet's office will be able to use a handheld scanning device to get this information off the chip by simply scanning your pet's shoulders. It won't hurt, and the chip stays inside your pet at all times.
While microchips are safe and effective, they should never be the only line of defense in protecting your pet. Always keep a collar and ID tag on your pet, even if he has the chip.

, There are many reasons why a pet may run away, and unless you are actively abusing your pet, it has absolutely nothing to do with you personally. Some pets try to escape due to social isolation/frustration (being left alone for too long, having a boring environment without any toys or anyone to play with). Other animals try to escape in order to find a mate and try to reproduce. Still other pets escape due to separation anxiety or other fears/phobias (like thunderstorms, fireworks, or even construction sounds).The first step to preventing your dog from escaping again is to determine why he ran away in the first place. Think about what may have been going on, both inside your home and in your community, when your pet ran away the last time.
Have your pet neutered/spayed to prevent sexual roaming.
Give your dog plenty of attention everyday, including play time. Make sure your pet has toys, and try to teach him new tricks (for dogs) or take an obedience class together.
Make sure your dog gets long walks everyday. The exercise can help tire out a restless dog and may make him less likely to roam the neighborhood.
If your dog has significant fears/phobias, keep him indoors except during walks (for dogs). Always keep a fearful dog on a leash at all times.
Let your pet adjust gradually to any new changes to his environment. Moving to a new home, adding or losing a family member, or sudden schedule changes can all affect a dog's sense of security and comfort.

Locate a rescue organization near you.,
Check for a cat you’re interested in.,
Fill out an application.,
Meet a representative of the rescue organization.,
Meet the cat you want to adopt.",How to Adopt a Cat Through a Rescue Organization1," There are several ways to locate a rescue organization in your area. If you have a cat or another pet already, you could ask your vet for a recommendation. You might also ask friends or family members who have successfully adopted a cat via a rescue organization. Finally, you could search for a rescue organization online by typing a word string like “rescue organization ” into your preferred search engine., There are a few ways to identify whether a given rescue organization has a cat you might be interested in adopting. You could check the organization’s website for profiles of the animals up for adoption. Alternately, you could schedule a visit with the rescue organization.Finally, you could visit the rescue organization during an adoption event – a sort of open-house where all the cats up for adoption are on display.To schedule a private visit with the rescue organization you’re thinking of adopting a cat from, call or send them an email.
Some adoption events are designed for particular target audiences – for instance, families with young children. Check with the rescue organization in question before deciding to attend an adoption event.
During some adoption events, you might be able to both see and interact with cats you wish to adopt.

, Most rescue organizations will have an application you need to fill out before you can obtain a cat. The application will ask basic information like your name, date of birth, and contact information. It will also ask lifestyle and personality questions such as, “Why do you want to adopt a cat?” and “How long would you leave your cat alone during the day?”, If the staff of the rescue organization believes you’d be a good cat parent, they will contact you regarding the possibility of adopting. At this interview, they will ask you more questions about your background and motivations for adopting a cat. For instance, you might be asked:Have you had pets before?
What is your average annual income?
Under what circumstances would you return or give up your adopted cat?

, Once you’ve been approved to adopt, you’ll have the opportunity to meet and interact with the cat. Depending on the rescue organization you’re working with, you might travel to a central facility, or you might travel to a foster home hosting the cat. In either case, you’ll receive more information about how to meet the cat or cats you might wish to adopt after talking with a representative of the rescue organization.It’s possible that you’ve already met the cat during an adoption event. If so, that’s okay. There’s no right or wrong time to meet the cat you want to adopt. The opportunity to meet a cat varies based on the adoption route you choose.

Face: The cat should have bright, clear eyes and a cool, damp nose. Neither the nose or eyes should have any discharge, and there should be no third eyelid visible.

Ears: Should be clean and smell nice. If there is a dark brown waxy discharge, the cat has ear mites, which are curable, but still a bit of a hassle.

Stomach: The stomach should not be swollen, and there should be no bump around the navel.

Genitals: The anus and vulva area should be clean, without any redness, discharge, or hair loss. Note the difference between hair loss and shaved hair in this area, because where hair loss is an indicator of infection, shaved hair is the indicator that the cat has gone through a recent surgery (likely being spayed/neutered).

Fur: Should be fluffy, shiny, and healthy-looking. There should be no mats or bare areas.

, The cat should have straight legs, and if it's young it should easily jump and pounce (older cats will be more hesitant to do so, which is natural). It shouldn't limp, stumble, or sway while walking.

, You don't want a stick-thin cat, but you don't want an overweight one either, as overweight cats often require a special diet to help them get back to a healthy weight. Find a cat with a nice healthy weight.

, This is very important, as this determines whether the cat will fit in well with your family. If the cat is well-socialized, it will enjoy being petted and will purr. Confidant cats will appear eager for attention, will enjoy being picked up, want to sit on your lap, are eager to play, and will follow you around. Less social cats will shy away from you, will not enjoy being picked up, will not go sit on your lap, and enjoy being independent. Decide whether the cat you like will fit in well at your house; for example, if your house is full of people and is loud and crazy, a timid cat will not fit in well here, but a more confidant cat would. If your house only has a couple people in it who are away at work or school during most of the day, a quiet independent cat would fit in nicely, whereas a playful cat wouldn't get the attention it craves.

, Before adopting the cat, ask the shelter staff questions about its health. They should be able to answer you confidently. Ask if the cat has been examined by a veterinarian, if it has been vaccinated against feline leukemia, treated for worms and fleas, etc. and if it has any health/medical problems. Even if some cats appear healthy on the outside, they might have health issues inside their bodies, meaning they might require a special type of food, which is a good thing to know before you adopt the cat.

Foster your rescue.",How to Deal With a Stray Dog," Seeing an unattended dog outside may instinctively move you to help, but you want to make sure that you are not making the situation worse. For instance, if you see a dog weaving through traffic, chasing after the dog could put you, other pedestrians, and motorists in danger. Wait until the dog is in a safe place before providing assistance.


If the dog is already in a safe place do not scare the dog. In this situation it is best to not approach the dog. Stray animals can act unpredictably, so be cautious.;
, Before you whisk a dog a way to safety, make sure that the dog is actually alone and not simply separated momentarily from his owner. You can save yourself a lot of time, hassle and potential criminal charges by making sure the dog is actually lost. Simply wait to see if the owner comes to claim the dog.If the dog has a leash and collar on, you can try to safely grab the leash. This will keep the dog in one place while you wait for an owner to hopefully appear.

, Dogs on the street will fall into one of two categories: a dog that has been separated from its owner or a stray dog without a home or loving family. There are some safety concerns with both types of dogs. Owned dog’s separated from their owners may be fearful or aggressive when approached by unknown people, including you. The dog may not be used to “street life” and may bite, scratch or run away in fear when you approach it.


Or, you may be dealing with an aggressive dog that broke loose from his owner’s home or yard looking for a fight.

, Since you're unsure what diseases the dog may be carrying, look for aggression, snapping, and biting at everyone and everything. This could indicate that the dog is rabid. If so, he'll also refuse water and salivate a lot. Or, another type of rabies will make the dog look very sick, prevent it from walking, but it will still salivate a lot. If you see any signs like this in a stray dog, call the police and animal control.The dog may also be carrying any of the following diseases:Rabies
Distemper
Ticks, fleas, mange
Ringworm and other fungal diseases
Heartworms
Kennel cough
Intestinal parasites: roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, whipworms

, Before finding a home for a stray dog, you'll need to catch and restrain him. This can be a little dangerous since dogs can sometimes be defensive or even hostile because of prior abuse, neglect, sickness, or his general temperament. You can approach the dog with a barrier, like a tennis racket or skateboard. This can keep the dog from biting you while you get closer to it. If you fear the dog at any time or think the situation is beyond your capabilities, retreat to a safe place and call animal control or the non-emergency police line for help.Remember that a barrier object is not meant to be a weapon for you to swing at the dog in an attempt to strike them. It is just a barrier for your own protection.

, If the dog seems open to being approached (he sits or stands without raised fur or bared teeth, and doesn't growl or snap at you), start to gain his trust. Offer something like a treat that builds trust and lets the dog know you have good intentions. Slowly approach him and offer the back of your hand with your palm down for the dog to sniff. Take your time and pause if he becomes frightened or hostile.


Pay attention to what triggers an emotional response from the dog and be sensitive. Pause and allow the dog to get more comfortable before starting to approach the dog again.
Never reach over the dog's head or body. The dog will see this as a threat and either run away or may bite you before retreating.

, Once you've gained the dog's trust and you can get close to him, restrain him. Quickly and quietly slip a leash or rope around his neck. This is important to control the dog and prevent him from running away.


If the dog twists and tries to get away after you've gotten a leash on him, try to verbally reassure him. For example, say, ""Calm down, boy,"" in a gentle, but firm voice., If you take the dog to any veterinary clinic or the Humane Society, they can check for a microchip that locates the owners. If the dog has an owner, the owner will be notified and your job is done. If there's no microchip, you could still try to find the owners by doing any of the following:Post “found dog” flyers around the neighborhood where you found the dog. If the dog has a home, it is likely that he didn’t wander off too far from it.
Notify local veterinary clinics, animal shelters and animal control/police departments that you found a dog. Give a thorough description of the dog—color, gender, breed, weight, and any other distinguishing characteristics.
Call the local radio station to see if a lost dog has been reported or to see if they will mention it on the air. This is a good option in small communities.
Post found dog ads on-line and with local community newspapers.

, If you decide to bring the dog to your home, have him checked out at the veterinary clinic first. The dog will be examined for fleas and internal parasites. This will keep you from bringing these pests into your home or exposing them to your other pets.Talk with your family before bringing home a stray dog to make sure everyone agrees with the decision. You should also make sure your landlord is fine with another dog, if you rent.

, If a home has yet to be located for the dog, you might want to consider adopting it temporarily or perhaps permanently. If you take the dog to the Humane Society, they may not be able to take the dog in right away. But, if you are able to hold on to the dog for a quarantine period of up to two weeks, they may then take the dog and give it all of the necessary tests and vaccines.


Be prepared to pay for medical expenses and other costs. Some shelters may offer discounts for caring for strays."

Find a good view of the animal.,
Identify the problem.,
Grab a first aid kit.",How to Approach a Sick or Injured Dog or Cat1," Sick and injured animals may try to hide to protect themselves. You should try to find a way to get close enough to the dog or cat so that you can properly evaluate the situation. If you are outside or if the animal is a stray, you may have to follow them to their den. If you are inside your own home, your pet may likely be in a favorite hiding spot or in their bed.


If you notice an injured animal while in the car, you should be careful not to start an accident. Pull over your car safely, and be sure to check for other cars and pedestrians. Put on your hazards. Do not park your car in middle of the street, and do not run out in middle of a highway.If the injured or sick animal has hidden somewhere, such as under a bed or in a pipe, you should not just stick your hand in. You may be attacked. Lure them out, or try to remove the obstacles between you.;
, You should try to make a note of what you think is wrong with the animal. While you may not be a vet, you can quickly try to figure out what the problem might be.


If the animal is limping or if they have a crooked tail, a broken bone or fracture may be to blame.
Bleeding and torn fur are obvious signs of injury. They could have been attacked by another animal, or a human may have hurt them.
Shaking, stumbling, and vomiting are often signs of serious illness.
If the animal has patchy and scaly fur, they may have mange. Mange is caused by parasites and can cause pain or discomfort to animals. That said, it is harmless to humans.Be extremely careful with animals who appear to be drooling excessively, biting or self-mutilating themselves, or acting extremely aggressive towards you. These are all signs of rabies., If you can, gather a few essential medical supplies that will help you take care of the animal until they are able to be seen by a vet. You can keep an animal first aid kit in your car or home. You can also substitute some supplies with things that you have lying around. These include:


A dog leash
A muzzle. You also use gauze or nylon strips to muzzle a dog
Bandages and bandage tape
Rectal thermometer
A pillowcase, towel, or blanket to wrap a cat in
A flashlight"
"
Fill out an adoption contract.,
Pay a fee.,
Provide proof that your landlord allows cats.",How to Adopt a Cat Through a Rescue Organization2," If you had a successful meeting with the representative of the rescue organization, you’ll need to finalize the deal by signing a contract. This makes you the legal owner of the cat, and delineates certain protocols you’ll need to adhere to once you adopt. These protocols vary from one rescue organization to another.For instance, you might need to contact the rescue organization before putting the cat up for adoption
You might be required to acknowledge that you understand that cat ownership is a 15-20 year commitment of both time and money.
Many rescue shelters will demand that you not declaw your cat.

, Along with signing the contract, you’ll need to pay a fee to obtain the cat from a rescue organization. The fee to obtain the cat will depend on its age and the number of cats you adopt. Older cats are typically less expensive to obtain than kittens. And if you adopt two cats at the same time, you might qualify for a per-cat discount.The fee varies depending on the rescue organization you select. Prepare to pay $50- $200 for a single cat.

, If you rent your home or apartment, you’ll typically have to demonstrate that your landlord permits you to own a cat. This might be a copy of your rental contract and your landlord’s phone number, or it might be a letter from your landlord explicitly stating that cats are allowed."
"
Choose an adult cat if you have kids younger than seven.,
Think about how much time and energy you’ll have to invest in your cat.,
Decide how long you want to be a cat parent.,
Factor in the reaction of other pets.",How to Adopt a Cat Through a Rescue Organization3," Kittens – like little kids – can scare easily and often don’t know the difference between a threat and an opportunity to play. For this reason, if you have young children at home, adopt an adult cat., All cats need some attention and affection. But kittens tend to need a lot of attention and stimulation. As cats age, they tend to require less care and become more independent. Therefore, if you are out working or otherwise predisposed for much of the day, avoid getting a kitten., Cats can live up to 20 years or more. If you’re unsure whether you want to be responsible for a cat that long, adopt an older cat. That way, when you’re ready to take that round-the-world trip, you won’t be tethered to caring for your cat at home., If you already have a cat or dog at home, adopt a cat that is known to get along with the sort of pet you already own. To identify which cats will get along with other pets, ask rescue organization personnel for advice regarding which cats have interacted successfully with other pets.Additionally, don’t adopt two cats of the same gender. The urge to be dominant will cause conflicts.
For the same reason, if you already have a cat at home, adopt a cat that is younger than it.

"
Go slowly.,
Talk to the animal in a soothing tone.,
Watch their body language.,
Communicate with the animal.,
Lure them to you.,
Take the animal to a shelter or vet.,
Call an animal control agency and stay where you are.",How to Approach a Sick or Injured Dog or Cat2," Sudden movements can startle a sick or injured animal, especially a stray one. As you approach the animal, walk slowly. If you notice the animal tensing up or shrinking away, pause until the animal relaxes. Keep moving forward until you are close to the animal., As you move, you should speak to the animal in a gentle, calm tone. Do not raise your voice, shout, or call to the animal, as this might frighten them. Instead, speak just loud enough for them to hear you. Say your words slowly.


You might say something like, “Come now, I’m not going to harm you. I just want to help.”
Soft clicks and shushing noises can also help calm the animal.

, As you go towards the animal, observe their movements and expressions. If the animal seems hostile to you, you should stop until the animal relaxes. If you keep going, you risk being attacked.


Growling, hissing, snarling, or barking can be the cat or dog’s way of warning you not to come near.
A dog that is stiff and still is in a defensive position. The dog may express fear by tucking their tail between their legs, peeling their lips back from their teeth, or pacing. In this situation, the dog may bite. You want to wait until the dog appears relaxed or loose.If the cat’s ears have turned backwards or flattened, they are angry or fearful. An arched back or raised fur is another sign that you should not go near. A relaxed cat will be lying on the ground or exposing their stomach., If you have gotten close enough to the animal without any snarling or hissing, you can start to use your own body language to speak to the animal. Cats and dogs have different forms of body language than humans.


Avoid making eye contact with dogs. Feral dogs may take direct eye contact as a sign of aggression. Instead, try crouching down. Hold out your arm to them to let them sniff it.With a cat, you can try slow blinking at them. Slow blinking is a sign of affection for cats. If the cat returns the gesture with a sleepy, slow blink, it means that they feel safe around you.Sometimes, just sitting near the injured animal will let it feel safe around you. Do not attempt to pet or lift the animal. Just sit near it and talk to it. The animal may come to you if they feel comfortable.

, If the animal starts to back off or if the animal appears frightened or aggressive, stop moving towards them. Instead, you might try bringing the animal to you. Food works well in luring an animal to you.


Strong smelling foods, such as canned tuna or dried liver, are effective at luring animals out.Feral cats and dogs may be hesitant to approach you.Leave the food on the ground and step away, giving the dog or cat plenty of space. If the animal takes the food, you might create a trail of food until the animal is ready to come near you.
You can also lure the animal into your car and close the door, keeping them there until a vet or animal control can come pick it up. Do not sit in or drive a car with an unfamiliar animal inside of it.If you have a trap, such as a drop trap, you can leave a bait trail to bring the animal into the trap., Once you have successfully captured the stray, you should find somewhere to take them for treatment. Some shelters will accept injured animals and help rehabilitate them, although you should be careful as others will simply euthanize the animal. You can also take the animal to a private vet or animal hospital. You may be responsible for the cost of their treatment, however., If it is apparent to you that it is too dangerous to approach a stray animal or if the animal refuses to come near you, you can still help by calling animal control. They are trained to safely capture injured and sick animals. Give them your precise location. If they can come right away, you might wait for them to let them know where the animal is.If you live in a rural area, you might have to call the police instead.

Restrain your pet.,
Examine the animal.,
Call the vet.",How to Approach a Sick or Injured Dog or Cat3," If your pet is sick or injured, they may not be acting normally. They may be disoriented, anxious, fearful, or upset. This means that even a friendly pet can snap, bite, or scratch their owner. It is important to restrain your pet properly to make sure that they do not cause harm to you or themselves.Dogs should be muzzled to prevent biting. If you do not have a muzzle, you can use medical gauze or nylon stockings instead. Do not muzzle the dog if they are vomiting or if they are struggling to breathe.
Cats should be wrapped in a towel and securely but gently held. Do not tie the towel too tightly or squeeze the cat. Make sure their face is not covered.Try to comfort the cat as you hold them.
While your pet cat or dog may be calm normally, sick animals can act unpredictably. Just because you know an animal does not mean that you can’t be bitten or scratched.

, You can do a quick examination if your pet is restrained. Mark what symptoms they are suffering from. If you know the cause of their sickness or injury, you should make note of that as well. This information will help the vet make a proper diagnosis.


Count how many breaths they take per minute. Typically animals have between 18 and 24 breaths per minute. If they are breathing more than 40 or 50 breaths per minute, they may have a respiratory issue.
Check their gums. If the gums are white, lavender, grey or blue instead of pink, there may be a problem.
You can check their pulse by putting your hand in their inner thigh. Count how many heartbeats there are per minute. Dogs typically have between 80 and 120 beats per minute while cats have between 180 and 200.
You can take their temperature with a rectal thermometer. A normal temperature should be between 100.5 °F (38.1 °C) and 102 °F (39 °C). Anything above or below that is a sign of sickness.
Note any twitching, shaking, stumbling, or any other signs of disorientation.
Check their eyes. Your pet’s pupils should be the same size. If the whites of their eyes have turned yellow, red, or any other color, call the vet.

, Once your pet has been restrained, call your vet. If it is off hours, find the number of an emergency vet. Describe the symptoms over the phone, and follow their instructions for care. In some cases, you may have to transport the animal to an animal hospital immediately while in others, you may be able to treat the animal on your own.

"
"
Tell your vet.,
Contact Animal Control.,
Call all nearby shelters.",How to Advertise a Lost Dog1," Your vet is invested in the health and well-being of your pet, and letting them know will likely get you some space on their office bulletin board to place a flyer. More importantly, though, vets know other vets, and it is possible that your missing dog could end up at another vet’s office. Letting your vet know your dog is missing allows them reach out into their community to see if anything comes up.Make sure your vet has up-to-date contact information for you, and a recent description or photo of your dog if they have not been into the office for awhile.;
, Contact the animal control department in your city or town, as well as any nearby towns. Let them know that you have a missing dog, and provide them with a comprehensive description of your pet. This way, if Animal Control picks up your pet, they will know to contact you first.Leave your full name and contact number with the Animal Control offices, along with contact information for a friend or family member in case they cannot reach you immediately.
Contact al Animal Control departments within a roughly 60 mile radius of your residence.

, In addition to Animal Control, contact all shelters within a 60 mile radius of where your pet went missing. Provide them with a description of your pet, and ask if anyone has brought in a dog matching that description recently. If not, leave your contact information with the shelter so they can notify you if your pet does come in.Also notify breed rescues, even if the rescue is for a different breed than your dog. Breed rescues often take different breeds if they think a pet is lost or abandoned.
If any local dog daycare or boarding facilities also help house rescues, call those facilities and ask them if anyone has brought in a dog like yours.

If you can see that the dog is injured, consider contacting a local shelter or animal control to help you deal with the situation properly.It may not be immediately obvious that the dog is injured if you can’t see blood or a broken limb. However, there are less obvious signs of injury. For example; the dog may lick an area that is hurting intensely, he might pant even though he is sitting still and it isn’t hot, or he may squint his eyes.If you have a relationship with a local veterinary office, you might also be able to contact them for help with the situation.;
, Even the friendliest dog might react aggressively if they are frightened or injured. Be cautious when approaching a stray dog. Don’t just walk up casually and grab them by the collar. Since the dog doesn’t know you, they may bite to try and defend themselves.Instead, try to see if the dog will come to you. If you need to approach the dog, do so very slowly. Let the dog smell your hand before trying to touch the animal.
Look for signs of aggression. These signs may include: growling, snarling, showing teeth, lunging towards people, or standing very still and rigidly., If you have a small morsel of food (like a small piece of meat or a dog treat), hold it in your hand way out in front of you, and very slowly move towards the dog. Stop immediately if the dog reacts aggressively. While you approach the dog, use a calm and reassuring voice.You can say things like, “It’s OK,” “good boy,” and “come here.” These may be phrases that the dog’s owner uses and will be reassuring to the dog.

, If you are able to catch the dog, you should use a leash with a collar or a harness to keep control of the dog. In an emergency, you can use a belt as a slip lead, but this should not be considered a long-term solution.Try not to be rough with the dog. When you catch the dog, keep talking to the dog calmly, pet them gently, and help them understand that you are just trying to help. Avoid making quick aggressive movements that might frighten the dog.

, If you don’t feel comfortable catching the dog on your own, if you can’t tell whether the dog is injured or potentially aggressive, or if you can see that the dog is behaving aggressively, it is best to contact animal control. Don’t try to approach a stray dog unless you are absolutely sure that they are not going to react defensively.If you aren’t sure of how to contact animal control, you can find information about local animal control and other local shelters on this website: http://theshelterpetproject.org.
You can also try calling your area’s non-emergency police number. This is usually a local number that will connect you to the police without having to use the emergency number unnecessarily.
If you can’t catch the dog on your own, don’t just give up and leave the animal to figure it out on their own. Animal control can help you with the situation.

, Look to see if the dog has a tag on their collar that contains the owner’s contact information. If they do, then all you need to do is contact them, and have them come get the dog. If they don’t, look for a tattoo that will usually be located inside the dog’s ear or inside of one of the legs.If you don’t find tags or a tattoo, then you can have the dog checked for a microchip at the vets or at the shelter. This microchip will contain the owner’s contact information.

, Before you turn the animal over, try seeing if you can get the dog to lead you to their home. Make sure that you put a long leash on them so you can grab hold of them if necessary (for example, to stop them crossing a busy street).Put the leash on and then in a firm (but not threatening) voice, tell the dog to “Go home!” This is a command that some owners teach their dogs. If the dog seems to respond, and begins walking in a certain direction, follow them. Ask anyone you pass on the way if they have seen the dog before.
If the dog doesn’t seem to understand the command, then move on to the next step.

, In some places, you may be required by law to turn strays over to animal control; in other places, you might choose to foster the animal at your home while trying to find its rightful owner. Check with your local animal control office to find out what the law in your state or country says.The reason for this is that owners typically look first at animal shelters, but people who find dogs often feel reluctant to take dogs to shelters for fear that they will be euthanized.
If the shelter does mention the possibility of euthanization, consider offering to foster the dog until the owner can be found. If you can’t foster the animal, ask friends and family if they might be able to do it.

, If you can’t or don’t want to take the animal to a shelter, and it is legal to do so in your state/country, then make sure you have a safe place for the animal to stay. Don’t just bring the animal home and lock them away in a room alone. They will probably be very frightened, so if they are not aggressive, do your best to make them feel that they are safe. You should still contact all the shelters in the area to provide a description of the pet in case the owner calls.Swing by a veterinarian’s office on the way home and ask them to check for a microchip. If the animal is microchipped, then you can return them to the owner right away.
You can make them feel a little less frightened by talking in a soothing voice and petting them gently. Offer the animal water and a bit of food, preferably pet food.
If you have one, you can keep the animal secured in a crate. If it is a large dog, and you have a secure yard, this may be a good place to keep them. However, don’t expect to leave them in a crate or in the backyard alone for days. This is not fair to the animal.
If you have other pets, it’s best to keep your pets and the stray separated. You can do this by keeping them in separate rooms or crates. This is because you don’t know how the stray might behave around other animals, and you also don’t know their medical history. Some diseases are very contagious among animals and you don’t want to spread anything around.
If you have found an animal with lots of fleas and/or ticks, it is best to take the animal to the vet or the shelter for treatment, especially if you don’t have experience with bathing animals.

, Whenever you try to find the dog’s owner using social media, signs, or classified ads, it is important that you leave out one small bit of identifying information. This is because some dishonest people try to claim a pet that is not theirs as their own.For example, don’t post a picture of the dog anywhere. Instead, describe the dog so that the owner would suspect it was their dog, but would have to describe the breed of the dog or offer more specific information about the dog.
If you find a small white pomeranian, don’t write “Found Pomeranian,” instead write, “Small, fluffy, white dog.”
If you want to post a picture, try to find something unique about the dog that only the owner would know. For example, if they are wearing a collar, take it off for the photo and then ask anyone who comes forward to tell you what kind of collar they were wearing.

, It is a sad truth that many people take advantage of kind hearted people who try to find the true owners of lost pets. These people may take the animal from you and then try to sell it, may harm the animal, or may even harm you. Thus, it is wise to be very cautious with people who come forward.If someone calls claiming to be the owner, don’t answer any questions about the dog. Instead, make them tell you about the dog. Ask the caller the questions. For example, you can say, “What color is the dog?” “What gender is the dog?” “Approximately how big is the dog?” “Was the dog wearing a collar, and if so, what color was it?” “Does the dog have any unusual markings?” “Is the dog microchipped or tattooed?”
If you believe it is the owner, ask them to meet you at a specific vet office, and ask them to bring photos and any other information they have that proves they are the rightful owner. Doing it this way will protect both you and the dog.
If you aren’t going to meet them at a vet’s office, then ask a friend to come with you to take the dog, and let a different person know where you are going and when you expect to be back.

, Buy a few pieces of neon colored poster board and write “FOUND DOG” in huge letters on the board. Include your contact information and a bit of information about where you found the dog.Post one poster board in the exact spot where you found the dog, and post a few others at major street intersections. Make sure that the writing is large enough so that drivers can easily read it.

, You can take a black and white picture of the animal so that the owner will have to describe the color, include your contact information (or the shelter’s information), as well as information about when and where the dog was found.Distribute these flyers all around town. Be sure to take one or two to each local shelter, hang them on telephone poles, and on community boards. Also take copies to vet offices and pet supply stores as these places almost always offer to post these flyers in their offices and stores.
Consider laminating these pages before hanging them. If you will post signs outdoors and live in an area where it rains a lot, a piece of paper with an ink picture may not last after the first rain. The ink will run all over the page and no one will be able to read it. If you can’t laminate the pages, consider sticking each sign in a sheet protector and then hanging them so that the opening is towards the bottom. This will keep rain from getting inside the sheet protector.

, One of the most common ways to share information about a lost dog these days is to post on social media. Leave off the photo, and simply post that you’ve found a dog. Include the area, date, and time that you found the dog. You can also include a vague description of the dog (e.g. large, small, long-fur, short-fur, etc.), but don’t describe the dog in detail.


Ask friends to share your post on their own accounts to help spread the word.
Try searching social media sites such as Facebook for lost and found pet groups. Type “lost dogs” plus the name of your city or town, and you’ll find a list of groups related to the keywords.
There are also social media sites dedicated specifically to helping people living in the same area connect. One of these sites is https://nextdoor.com/, which may be another useful place to post about the animal.

, You can also take out a lost and found ad in the newspaper, and contact local TV and radio stations. They will often make short announcements that a dog has been found along with a number the owner can contact., Check all around town for signs that report a lost dog. Match the information you find on these signs with the dog. If you believe you have found the owners of the lost dog, contact them immediately to let them know.Recognize that the dog might have travelled quite far, so don’t just look for signs around your neighborhood. Try to look all around town, and if you can, go for a drive or ride your bike as far and wide as you can looking for signs.
Even if you don’t find signs, you shouldn’t assume that there is no owner looking for the dog. If the owner is elderly or disabled, they may not be able to post signs. If the dog has only been missing for a few hours, they may not have had time to post signs yet.

, Some owners will take out an ad to help find their pooch, while others might try online classified sites such as Craigslist.If you find someone you believe is the owner, follow the same protocol that you would had the owner contacted you. Ask them to describe their dog in detail. If you believe they are the owner, ask them to meet you at a vet’s office and to bring any proof of ownership they might have.

, This can be temporary or, potentially, a long-term home. For most shelters, it is very difficult to keep a stray dog over the long-term. Though many shelters will do their best, you can ease this burden by offering to find a foster home (if you cannot foster the dog yourself) in the interim.


If you have tried for weeks to find the owners with no luck, then try finding a more permanent home for the dog. Ask friends and families if they are interested in adopting the pet. If they are not, ask them to think about whether or not they know of anyone that might be interested.
If you can afford to do so, you could also offer to cover the adoption fees and any immediate vet bills to help take care of the dog.

Make flyers.,
Go door-to-door.,
Call the police.",How to Advertise a Lost Dog2," Flyers are a common practice when it comes to lost pets. Make sure to include a photo, the gender, and the breed of the dog. Also remember to include your name and contact information.Post flyers all around your neighborhood along heavily-trafficked areas where pedestrians are likely to see them.
Post flyers to community bulletin boards, such as those in nearby apartment communities, in local grocery stores, in local rec centers or community centers, in your local coffee shop, and wherever else flyers are allowed in your area.
It is recommended to not put your dog’s name on the flyer as this may give an unscrupulous person a tool to control your pet.

, Knock on doors and ask ""Have you seen this dog""? While it's a tedious method, this will make more people aware of your missing dog, and might let you in on some information that some people might have.Bring a photo of your pet or one of your flyers for reference as you knock. Also have your phone, a pen, and a piece of paper ready to take down information or make calls as necessary.
You may also want to consider handing out flyers door-to-door, especially if you live in a gated community or a community that would be difficult for your dog to get out from.

, If all else fails, and it's been longer than a 72-hour-period, call the police. Police can be very helpful in lost pet situations, and may be able to work with other departments in your town or city to see if any corresponding information has been passed along.Do not call 911 regarding your missing dog. Instead, call the general line for your local police department and let them know that you would like to report a missing dog.

Create a newspaper ad.,
Call into the radio.,
Post on social media.,
Post to a lost pet website.",How to Advertise a Lost Dog3," Many people read the newspaper so, you'll increase the chance of finding your dog. It comes with a small fee, but it will get your pet some extra exposure. Additionally, many newspapers post lost pet advertisements to their websites, as well.Include a description of your dog such as size, gender, age, breed, and any distinct characteristic of your dog in the add.
Include a picture if the paper allows.
Remember to include your phone number for someone to contact you if your dog is found.

, Many radio programs will let you call in to announce that you have lost a pet. Call and let them know, “I’ve lost my pet and I would like to make an announcement to see if someone has found them.”The radio show might let you speak directly, or they might take down your information and have the host make the announcement. Be prepared for either eventuality with a description of your dog and your phone number.

, Let everyone in all of your social media networks know that your dog has gone missing. Post not only to your own profile, but also look for local groups or networks dedicated to lost dogs or simply dogs in your area.Include a description of your pet and multiple photos to your social media post.
Let people know the best way to get in contact with you if they have any information regarding your pet, whether that is via phone or through the social media application.
Ask people in your own network to share your posting, as well, to get your information out to more people in your area.

, There are a number of websites, such as Fido Finder, that are dedicated to reuniting lost pets and their owners. Other websites, like Craigslistalso have areas of the site specifically designated for pet postings.


Posting to these sites is often free, so it helps to get your ad up on as many of them as possible.
You may create a new ad including a description of your dog, or you may be able to upload your existing flyer.
Send the link from your posting out to everyone you know in your area, and request they pass it along to anyone else they know in the area.

Notice their character traits.,

Maintain consistency.,
Set the rules and limits.,
Be calm and assertive.,
Avoid being scared.,
Give discipline and be the leader.,
Observe their bodily signals.,
Observe where an animal feels safer.",How to Have Healthy Relationships with Animals," This is especially important with multiple animals. Most of the time, they have very different ways, likes, dislikes, and styles. They also respond differently to requests and affections.;
, Put aside any silly supernatural notions and realize that you genuinely and actively wish to hear from them. You won't actually start to hear them speak. But they are more mentally present and responsive than sometimes assumed.

, Stay calm and level with the animals, as though they can really hear what you're saying (in some way they can) when it's time to go to the vet or administer medication. They know something is up and feel nervous. Aloof energy increases the chances of mayhem. Contrary to common belief, cats can be trained.It is easier when the relationship begins when the animal is still young. A combination of positive reinforcement and non-physical messages of disappointment and/or urgency when the act is not carried out will work best.

, Be consistent with the signals you use to identify and reward a request. That includes key words and phrases as well as visual cues. Most of the time, this practice brings the owner and animal into a closer, more mutually respectful relationship and eliminates some of the minuses of having an animal. Keep this in mind when considering giving a pet to an elder or family with small children.

, Give every pet rules, boundary limits, similar to their natural habitat where the mother rewards them with food for doing the right thing like waiting and being calm.

, You can control and claim the area. In addition, give your pet exercise (e.g. dog gets a walk). If kept at home all the time, they will have a bad behavior.

, Don't be scared of any animal in front of you, even though you're in their territory. Just don't give eye contact. Don't touch them, let them smell you.

, Accordingly reward them for the way your pet is treating you. When he's calm, give affection. Let them be part of the family. Cats get the ""midnight crazies"" running around the house and jumping all over. They love to include you at this time. Get out the cat toys and play with it. These crazies may happen at 7 am or any time. Don't punish this activity, as it is the way they burn off excess energy.

, You can tell what a cat, dog, etc, wants by its ears, tail, or the body. If a bird is hungry, it will peck you, or may it is just trying to get your attention. Maybe your dog wants to play. He/she will do the playing.

, Many animals feel safer and calmer in cozy spaces like a carrier or even a laundry basket with some blankets (for an inexpensive quick-fix) when traveling or dealing with a crowded house. No matter what it looks like when you leave your pet, they really have a good time at the vet. After it leaves its owner a dog perks up and is fine.


They seem extra excited when you get them back and it seems like they had a horrible time, but they probably didn't. Sometimes, it is better to forget the baby talk and reconsider the character of the animal. When used as a tool of persuasion, it works to the contrary and deters the animal from following your request.
Of course, these practices may not work with all animals and it is prudent not to attempt such close-proximity activity with wild animals. cats and rabbits should go to the litter box when they need to do their business. Dogs will go do their business when ask for and understand your emotions.

Keep your cats in separate rooms if necessary.,
Provide separate resources.,
Use pheromones.,
Make a gradual reintroduction.,
Separate the cats again if necessary.",How to Get Two Animals to Start Liking Each Other1," If you have two cats that do not like each other, you may need to provide each one with his or her own room. If the two cats act aggressively towards each other (growling, hissing, fighting, etc.), then keep them in separate rooms while you work on easing the tension and prepare for a reintroduction.Take turns letting them have access to the rest of the house. Keep one cat in its room while allowing the other cat access to the house. Leave that cat’s room door open so that he may come and go from his room. Switch every 12 hours or so each cat can have plenty of time to roam the house.;
, Cats can and will fight over resources such as a litter box or even a prime space, such as a sunny spot near a window or a good hiding spot. Cats will also fight over food and water dishes if they want to eat or drink at the same time.Instead of forcing the cats to share space and resources, provide separate resources while you work towards reintroducing them and after the reintroduction as well.


Provide each cat with his or her own food and water dishes. Place one cat’s food/water in one room and the other cat’s food/water in another room and keep them there for life.
Provide separate cat towers or hammocks near windows in different rooms so each cat can have his or her own space to lounge.
Whenever there is more than one cat in the house, provide one more litter box than the total number of cats to prevent litter box guarding. For example, if you have three cats, then you should have four litter boxes. Place each litter box in a different area of the house and allow the cats open access to all the boxes.Keep all the boxes clean by scooping out used litter daily and washing all of the litter boxes once a week and replacing the old litter with new litter.

, Animals produce chemicals that they use to communicate with one another. Cats produce a specific chemical that has a calming effect on other cats.Scientists have managed to reproduce these calming pheromones into a product called Feliway, which can be used to calm cats.The pheromones come in sprays, wipes, collars and diffusers. Try a pheromone diffuser to help ease tensions between your cats.

, After a week or so of being in separate rooms, you can gradually reintroduce the cats to each other. Keep the reintroduction sessions short (about 1-2 hours) and have them in a “neutral” room, like the family living room.Bring both cats into the room and allow them to roam the room while you monitor and play with them.
Spritz some Feliway throughout the room before they come in, provide some toys, and try to maintain a quiet environment. Keep the TV volume low, speak in low voices, and turn off your phones to avoid startling the cats.

, If your cats get along well during this initial getting reacquainted phase, you can keep the kitties together. If one or both of them act aggressively, separate them and put them back into their rooms. Try another reintroduction in a week or two."

Observe how your pet uses his eyes, ears, and face.,
Look at how your pet uses his legs and tail (if he has one).,
Observe your pet’s posture.",How to Communicate with Animals1," Animals will use many parts of their bodies to convey various feelings. Being observant to how your pet uses his body can let you know if he’s feeling playful, sick, or maybe even angry. For example, your horse’s eyes can indicate that he is alert (fully open), drowsy (half open), or having problems with one eye (problem eye stays shut).Your dog may narrow his eyes and stare at you to indicate that is feeling aggressive.He may also avoid eye contact with you to show that he is submissive or showing deference to you.
Your cat’s ears may go back if he is feeling particularly anxious about something.
Dogs and horses will prick their ears up and slightly forward to indicate concentration.Your dog may hold his mouth slightly open, without showing his teeth, to indicate that he is feeling relaxed yet alert.;
, Just like the eyes, ears, and face, your pet’s legs and tail can provide helpful insight about how he’s feeling. For example, your horse may slowly his flick his tail to swish away flies, but may flick it more quickly to convey anger or annoyance.Similar to horses, cats will flick their tails quickly to indicate anger.When your dog is holding his tail at a position that is either level to, or slightly lower than, his body, he is showing that he is feeling friendly.Your horse can use his legs to buck and show that he is feeling playful. However, bucking could also convey uncertainty., Your pet can also communicate with you through the ways in which he positions and moves his body. For example, if your dog suddenly freezes and tenses his body, he could be conveying that he is uncertain about something or possibly preparing to attack.If your horse is walking very stiffly, he may be stressed, nervous, or in pain.If you have a small pocket pet, such as a guinea pig, you may notice that he is particularly fidgety if he is feeling irritable or agitated.
If your cat is lying on his back, he may be conveying two different things: relaxation (usually accompanied by a purr) or anger (usually accompanied by a growl)."

Make a good first impression, no matter what your pet.,
Feed your pet properly.,
Allow your pet time to adjust to its new home.,
Provide a suitable space for sleeping.,
Give your pet rewards.,
Groom your pet.,
Keep the pet's home clean.,
Exercise the pet as appropriate.,
Give your pet plenty of attention.,
Train your pet.",How to Make a Pet Love You," Treat it well and treat it with respect. Your pet has feelings and responds to the tone of your voice, your body language and your emotional states.

Talk to your pet in a sweet, genuinely interested voice.
Talk calmly. The calmness of your voice helps the animal to feel comfortable.;
, Know which foods are best for it and will ensure its overall health and well-being. What diet would it normally consume? What good quality food can you source within the budget you have? Make sure you do your very best to obtain quality food for your pet.

Feed your pet regularly, when it is appropriate for the species. If you cannot be there on time, ask a family member, friend or neighbor to feed the pet as needed.
Do not overfeed your pet.

, Realize how strange and scary it can be to be removed from a familiar place to an unknown one. Speak reassuringly and kindly, and slowly introduce the pet to its new area, whether it be different parts of a cage, the house or even outdoors. Always remain present whenever a pet explores a new area, in case it needs help, gets scared or looks to bolt., Most animals like to sleep somewhere secure, where they can be reassured that nothing will jump on them from behind and where they won't be trodden on or in the way of anything. Make it comfortable for the pet, according to the pet's particular needs. Ensure that bedtime routines are established and kept to.

If it is a crate, make sure you associate the crate with positive rewards, like treats, or kind words. Don't associate their spot with anything bad, like a time out.

, Determine what treats are appropriate for your pet and use these sparingly but appropriately, to reward and sometimes to calm, the pet. If it is appropriate, help your pet to associate the treat with a word, so it knows when it is about to be rewarded. Your tone of voice can often help too.

Try stroking your pet while feeding it treats. This helps your pet to associate you with treats and enjoyment.

, Do humans want fleas? Why would animals want them either? Make sure your animal gets bathed every once in a while, like every week or so. Make sure the knots in the pets fur are sorted out, and they are feeling fresh and clean., As with grooming, pets want a clean and comfortable environment and this will help them to feel secure., Provide the right exercise gear for your pet and let it have the opportunity to exercise regularly. Whether it's a fish or a dog, your pet needs to move to stay healthy., Spend time with your pet and interact with it. If it's a pet that can be touched, pat it or hug it. Play with the pet and groom it. Talk to your pet, whenever you are near the pet. You can even talk to your pet as you do chores around the house.

If you have a dog, walk it often and take it to the park regularly.
Try talking to your pet while it eats or plays.

, Many pets can be trained and, in some cases, training is essential for good behavior. You could teach your dog to roll over, your cat to come when called or your rabbit to shake paws."
"
Crate train your dogs to give each of them their own private space.,
Teach your dog that the crate is a good place to be.,
Provide separate feeding and water places.,
Use dog appeasing pheromones.,
Pay equal attention to both dogs.",How to Get Two Animals to Start Liking Each Other2," Crate training your dogs is a great way to help them learn to get along and to keep them from hurting each other at the same time.Keep in mind that a crate should never be used to punish your dog. Your dog should go into the crate voluntarily and view the crate as a safe, secure place.


Each dog will have his own crate, preferably in a separate room or at least out of sight of each other.
The crates should be large enough for your dogs to stand up and turn around without hunching over.
When you first get the crates, place a thick towel or blanket or a crate pad into each crate to give your dogs something comfortable to lay on.
Never leave a dog in a crate longer than 8 hours or for puppies never more than 3-4 hours.

, Keep the crate door open and call the dogs to their crates. Let them see you throw in a few tasty treats and allow them to go inside to eat them and explore. Then, at feeding time place your dogs’ food bowls in their crates and say “kennel.” Then let your dogs eat while leaving the crate door open.Repeat this process every day, but after a few days, begin shutting the door while your dogs are eating. When they are done eating, let them out to go potty.
After a few more days, do the same thing but after your dogs are done eating, leave the door closed for a few minutes. Only let your dogs out if they are calmly sitting or standing. If they are scratching or making noise, then wait for your dog to calm down first before opening the door.
Make sure before you put the food in the crate you are saying “kennel” so your dogs associate that command with going inside the crate.
Over the course of a week keep your dogs in the crates for longer periods of time. Eventually you will be able to skip the treats and feeding inside the crate after they have learned the “kennel” command.

, Just like cats, dogs may go to war with each other over food and water resources. Feed and water your dogs in separate rooms with either closed doors or a barrier like a baby gate separating the two animals so each one can eat and drink in peace.

, There are also special dog appeasing pheromones which can create a chemically enhanced calm environment for your dogs. These come in the form of sprays, collars, wipes or diffusers. Try placing a dog appeasing pheromone collar on each of your dogs to help relieve some of the anxiety that your dogs may be experiencing.

, Dogs sometimes get jealous if they feel like they are not getting enough attention from their owners. In a recent study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, it was found that dogs experience jealousy when their owners showed attention to a stuffed animatronic dog while ignoring their pet.Consider whether you might be giving preferential treatment to one of your dogs. Does one of your dogs get more attention, treats, or talks than the other? If so, you may be contributing to the “not getting along” problem.
Work on paying equal amounts of attention to your dogs. If one gets a treat, give the other one a treat as well. If you pet and praise one dog, make sure that you pet and praise the other dog as well.

Provide a separate room for your cat.,
Pay attention to body language in casual interactions.,
Introduce your cat and dog to each other.,
Use pheromones for the dog and the cat.",How to Get Two Animals to Start Liking Each Other3," In situations where you have a dog and cat that aren’t getting along, you will need to give the cat a separate room to get away from the dog. An easy way to provide a separate space for your cat is to use a baby gate to block your dog from entering into the room (or rooms) where the litter box, cat furniture, and cat food and water dishes are located. This will allow your cat to use the bathroom, eat and drink, and rest without being bothered by the dog.Make sure that your cat can get over the gate. If your cat is a senior, then it may be difficult for him or her to hop over the gate. You may need to place the gate high enough so that the cat can get under it, but so that the dog cannot get over it.

, It is important to pay attention to how your cat and dog act towards each other during casual day-to-day interactions. If your dog looks relaxed and playful and your cat seems relaxed as well, then this is a good sign. However, if either pet seems aggressive, then you should separate your pets right away.


Never put your hands in between two animals that are fighting or acting aggressively towards each other. Try clapping your hands loudly or throwing a pillow in between them to startle and stop them from fighting.
Some dogs may try to play with cats the same way that they play with other dogs, which can be dangerous for your cat, especially if your dog is large or if you have a senior cat. Do not allow your dog to pounce on your cat or engage in biting play because he may seriously injure your cat. If you dog tries to play with your cat, hold onto his collar and allow your cat to exit the room., You can use a similar strategy for introducing a cat and a dog as you would to introduce two cats. Use a neutral space, such as a living room and keep the introduction short (1-2 hours).


Keep your dog on a leash during the session so that you can control his movement, but allow your cat to roam freely in and out of the room. Your cat will feel more threatened if you confine her to a crate or hold her while introducing her to your dog.If either animal acts aggressively, end the introduction and put the animals into separate rooms. Wait a week or two before trying to introduce the animals to each other again

, Get the appropriate pheromones to help calm each of your pets. For example, you could get a cat pheromone diffuser for your cat and a dog appeasing pheromone collar for your dog. Having the right pheromones for each species should help to reduce anxiety for both animals and should contribute to a more peaceful environment.

Listen to your horse’s vocalizations.,
Listen to the sounds that your cat makes.,
Listen to your dog’s vocalizations.,
Identify your guinea pig’s vocalizations.",How to Communicate with Animals2," Your horse is capable of making a number of different sounds. Learning how to differentiate these sounds will help you determine how your horse is feeling. He will neigh for several reasons, including acknowledging his presence and expressing anxiety.Other than neighing, he may squeal when he is meeting another horse for the first time.Your horse can also sigh, which can indicate feelings of relief or relaxation.Younger horses (foals, weanlings) may clack their teeth in the presence of older horses so that the older horses do not hurt them.

, The meow is a very common sound that your cat makes. He will meow for a variety of reasons. For example, he may meow to greet you, indicate that he’s hungry or thirsty, or let you know that he objects to something that you are doing.If your cat starts growling or hissing, it would be in your best interest to leave him alone.His growls and hisses indicate that he is very upset about something.


You will also hear your cat purr, which usually means that he’s feeling relaxed and contented. However, a purr may also be your cat’s way to comfort himself.Your cat may howl or yowl if he is in distress, such as if he is stuck somewhere. If he is an older cat and has dementia, he may make these noises when he is disoriented., The common vocalizations of a dog are the bark, growl, and howl. If your dog is feeling aggressive or territorial, his bark will likely be rapid, loud, and high-pitched.On the other hand, a high-pitched bark may also indicate friendliness or playfulness and can be accompanied by yapping or whimpering.Growls are often your dog’s way of letting you know to keep your distance. However, they can also be signs of contentment—similar to a cat’s purring. Read your dog’s overall body language to determine what your dog is trying to say with his growl.
Your dog may give a long and sustained howl if he’s feeling lonely or suffering from separation anxiety. In addition, he may howl more than usual if he is injured or feeling unwell., Guinea pigs tend to be very vocal animals. Your guinea pig will make high-pitched noises, such as squeals or whistles, to indicate that he is excited or anticipating an exciting event (e.g., feeding time, playtime). Such a high-pitched sound is called a ‘wheek.’Purrs from your guinea pig can convey several different emotions: contentment (deep, relaxed purr), agitation (high-pitched purr), or fear (short, anxious-sounding purr).


Your guinea pig may start chirping to indicate aggression or anger. Give him some space if he chirps when you are playing with him.

"
"
Talk with your pet.,
Use non-verbal communication with your pet.,
Avoid punishing your pet.",How to Communicate with Animals3," Although your pet may not exactly understand the words that you are saying, he can at least pick up on the tone of your words and your body language when you talk to him. For example, if you speak with him in a stern voice, he might pick up on the fact that you are unhappy with his behavior. Talking to him in an authoritative tone when giving him a command will likely signal to him that he should follow your instruction.Talking with your pet can also help soothe him if he is feeling anxious or fearful.
Giving your pet verbal praise when you are training him is also very helpful.

, Your non-verbal communication is just as important as verbal communication. Non-verbal communication is often used in training to teach your pet to do a certain activity. For example, if you are sitting on your horse, you would use your legs and hands to command your horse to turn on the forehand. When you teach your dog to sit, you would actually combine verbal and non-verbal communication (hand signals) to give him the ‘sit’ command.


Getting up and walking away from your cat without saying anything is a way to let him know that you do not approve of his behavior.Be mindful of non-verbal communication that your pet may not like. For instance, your dog may not want you to rub his tummy. If he growls or tries to move away from you, give him some space.

, Verbally or physically punishing your pet is never a good idea. Punishment can make your pet fearful of you and possibly lessen the trust and respect that he has for you. In addition, some species, like cats, do not necessarily make the connection between your punishment and the behavior you are punishing them for.Making the unwanted behavior less desirable and making the correct behavior more desirable often works to dissuade your pet from misbehaving. For example, if your cat is scratching up your furniture, putting double-stick tape on the furniture will make it less desirable for him to scratch on.Sprinkling catnip leaves on the scratching post will make it more desirable for him to scratch on."

Do some research.,

Present the benefits for both the animals and you.,

Be responsible in other things.,

Ask them why they do not want you to volunteer at an animal shelter.,

Offer to do chores.,

Point out that it's a good substitute for asking for a pet.,

Never insist/beg.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Volunteer at an Animal Shelter," This is important; some shelters do not allow children volunteers. Make sure that kids your age can volunteer without an adult watching them. If you have to have a chaperone or adult monitoring you, find out if the shelter employees themselves are willing to supervise, or whether you need to go with an adult.

Make a plan for your participation; find out how often you'd be volunteering, how you'd get there, what you'd be doing, and how you'd balance this responsibility with your other tasks. The more information you can prepare about your plan, the more seriously your parents will take your wish.;
, Write a list, if it helps to organize your thoughts. List why it might be good for you, your family, and the shelter for you to volunteer. There's no doubt that time with people is good for the animals, and the experience can be good for your resume and college applications, too. Write it all down to present your case., If you are responsible in other tasks, it'll show that you're ready to take on this responsibility, too. Show your maturity. Try to do your chores. If you have younger siblings, take care of them. If you have older siblings, offer to help with something. If you have pets, make sure they have food and water. Complete school work, and offer to help around the house., Be mature when you do this; rather then demanding an answer through tears, kindly ask them their reasons. See if you can fix it. Ask them what they'd need you to do in order to consider your volunteering, and then go out and do it. Are they concerned that your grades will slip if you start volunteering? Then work hard and get your grades up. Are they worried that you won't get around to your chores? Then be extra productive in getting all your responsibilities handled, with time to spare, to show them you have the extra time to devote to this activity., If you do chores for money, you might also want to offer to do chores without money. If you do things like cleaning your room or walking your dog for money, offer to do the same chores for less, or no, money. If they ask why, tell them that you're trying to show them that you're ready to volunteer at the shelter; don't hide your intentions., If you're animal crazy and your parents won't let you have one, you may be driving them crazy by asking for a pet. Point out that if you volunteer at a shelter you will be around animals a lot of the day, and won't necessarily want one at home anymore. This might make your parents more likely to agree, or at least consider letting you volunteer., If you scream, cry, or demand that they let you volunteer, they will be way less likely to let you, as this shows a lack of maturity. Feeling upset is perfectly fine, but making a big deal and screaming directly is not a good thing."

Pay attention to the products you use.,
Do not buy products made from endangered species.,
Buy local food.,
Make small energy saving changes.,
Eat less meat.,
Recycle and buy sustainable products.",How to Do Your Part to Prevent Animal Extinction1," If you want to do your part to curb the animal extinction rate, you should avoid using products that are harmful to the environment. Many corporations harvest food and other resources in a way that negatively impacts the habitats of endangered species.


Look for products made from recycled materials. They are often marked by a series of green arrows forming a circle. You may also find information on a product's label indicating how much of it is made from recycled materials.If you wear make-up, be conscious of which products you purchase. Many cosmetics companies are notorious for animal testing and other environmentally harmful practices. A lot of big companies, like Olay and Garnier, routinely practice animal testing. Read the labels on cosmetics, shampoos, and conditioners to make sure there is no animal testing involved.Many products make use of palm tree oil. It's used in foods, cosmetics, and soaps. Many tropical forests are being stripped to make room for palm tree farms. If you see palm tree oil on the label of a product you're buying, make sure that company harvests the oil in a sustainable manner. You can find a list of companies that support ethical palm oil harvesting on the Union of Concerned Scientists website.;
, You should never purchase products made from threatened or endangered species. Many people enjoy bringing home memorable souvenirs after overseas trips. However, many of these trinkets are made from animals in danger of extinction. Avoid products made form things like ivory, tortoise shell, and coral. You should also stay away from anything made from tiger fur or the fur of another endangered animal., Many of the agricultural practices used by big food companies are harmful to the environment and endangered species. If you want to do your part to help, strive to buy local food. Be on the lookout for grocery stores who buy from local farmers as well as farmer's markets in your town. Smaller farms generally do less environmental damage and are often more committed to sustainable, ethical farming practices., Reducing your overall carbon footprint can help the environment. This can protect the habitat and welfare of a variety of endangered species. Sometimes, tiny tweaks can have a big impact on how much energy and fossil fuel your household uses.


Replace your lightbulbs. Switch to compact fluorescent bulbs, which you can buy at most supermarkets. These types of lightbulbs use significantly less fossil fuel than conventional lightbulbs.Unplug electronic gadgets when you're not using them. Even if a product is not in use, it saps electricity from an outlet just by being plugged in. Make sure to unplug kitchen appliances, like the coffee maker and the toaster, when they're not in use. You should also unplug laptop cords and phone chargers when you don't need them.Turn your thermostat two degrees colder. Chances are, you won't notice the minor tweak in temperature. However, you'll be using significantly less energy if you do so. You may also save a lot on your next electricity bill., The meat industry has a huge impact on the environment, harming the welfare of endangered species. Rainforests, home to many endangered species, are often clear-cut to make room for factory farms. You can help by transiting into a more plant-based diet.A vegetarian diet means you refrain from eating products made from animal flesh. Products like eggs, butter, and cheese are still acceptable in a vegetarian diet but you would exclude anything like chicken or beef. Protein in a vegetarian diet can come from nuts, legumes, eggs, and cheese.A vegan diet excludes any products made from animals, including cheese and eggs. Many people choose to go vegan because farming practices that harvest meatless animal-based products still greatly harm the environment. As a vegan, you would get your protein solely from plant-based options like beans, nuts, and seeds.You should talk to your doctor before switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Vegans especially may have to take certain vitamins to make sure they get the necessary nutrients when not ingesting animal-based products.
If going vegetarian or vegan seems like a massive commitment, consider simply lessening the overall amount of meat you eat. In addition to helping the environment, eating less meat is good for your overall health.You can have one or two nights a week when you try to make a vegan or vegetarian based dinner. You could also try something like only eating meat for one meal per day.

, You should make an effort recycle products like cans, cardboards, and plastics. You should also try to switch over to reusable products. Go for cloth napkins over paper ones, for example, and do not buy products made from materials that are not biodegradable.

Be proud of yourself!",How to Help a Neglected Animal," Is the animal really suffering, or is it just in a less-than-perfect environment? Do your research, and make sure that the animal is actually denied it's needs. Make sure you research the size of cage it should be in, food it should be getting, and any additional information. Make sure you assess the condition based on the breed or species of animals. Some animals, for instance, are agoraphobic, and need a smaller space. Be prepared with an argument for the animal should you confront its owner. It often helps to rate the distress from 1-10 to better understand it's need. Does it need immediate help, or can it wait a few weeks?
, Pictures, detailed descriptions, and videos can be extremely valuable when seeking help from authorities or other people., You have three options: call the animal control, help the animal yourself, or ignore the animal. Above anything, try helping it yourself since a shelter environment could potentially be deadly.  However, if you do call the animal control you need not continue. The rest of the article will show you how to confront the issue yourself., This doesn't mean you have to go out and buy all the things, but make sure that you know this may result in you keeping the animal: even for a short time. The owner may just be glad to be rid of the animal, and thrust it onto you. Finding a home for an animal can be easy though, so do not be intimidated., First priority is safety, but if you believe the person is safe, confront them. Explain to them that you are looking for the type of animal they own, and that you would like to buy it off of them. Offer the amount of money that you are willing to give. If you are not financially prepared, don't worry about it., If you are not financially prepared, don't worry about it. This is simply an extra step to boost you in the right direction., Chances are, the owner was neglecting it because they didn't want it anymore. They will often offer it up willingly. In another case, they may realize their fault by themselves and change the animal's environment. Thirdly, they may get angry with you. If they do, respect their space and leave them alone. Your safety is worth more than an animal., Educate them and show them how the quality of life for the animal is not ideal. Maybe offer to buy bigger housing or supplies if you are financially able, to improve for the animal. They may see what they're doing wrong and give you the animal or improve it's housing and feed., Immediately do all you can to make it more comfortable. If it is a carnivorous mammal, make sure it is friendly and not aggressive. If the animal is malnourished and underweight, do not let it eat as much as it wishes. This can overstretch its stomach and cause serious problems. Feed it in small increments compared to what an animal of it's type generally eats. If possible, try to feed the animal the same type of food it was previously eating, and gradually add in the type it would ideally be fed with, to prevent the animal from getting ill. Keep it hydrated. If it is a bird, do not let it out. Transfer it gently into a bigger cage. Make sure the animal is safe, and not overly stressed. The animal will be thankful for the relief., Make sure the animal is in good health, and has its need cared for. Do this by researching the health of the specific animal, and making sure it is up to standards. If anything is amiss, do not hesitate to contact a veterinarian. However, if it passes away, rest peacefully knowing that it felt comfort and love in its final moments., If you're finding a new home for the animal, make sure that it goes to someone who will care for it properly. Don't let it go back into a life of abuse. Don't give puppies and kittens away to someone you don't trust for free. Make sure you trust the person., Give it the best life possible. Involve it in fun activities, give it enrichment, and keep it healthy. Allow the animal to live the life it deserved. Remember, this is a big commitment, especially if the animal does not know how to function in better living conditions. Also remember that the animal may not be ""normal"". The animal, depending on the situation, may be scared of certain people, activities, or objects. Try to make the animal as comfortable as possible to ensure it does not undergo any further trauma., You just saved an animal!"

Adopt a pet.,
Help stray and feral cats.,
Practice trap-neuter-return strategies.,
Create a backyard sanctuary.",How to Help Animals1," If you're looking for a new pet, there are plenty of ways you can help animals. Rather than buying from a breeder, consider adopting a pet from your local shelter or rescue group. These adoption agencies house many pets that are given away when people move, as well as animals who come from neglectful or abusive homes.When you adopt a pet from a shelter or rescue group, not only are you giving an animal a second chance in life, you'll also save money. Adoption costs are typically lower than what you'd pay for a pet from a breeder, and adopted pets often come with all of their vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery, and microchip procedure already complete.Many shelters and rescue groups have purebred dogs and puppies available for adoption.Shelters and rescues house all kinds of animals. You can adopt a dog or cat, birds, smaller animals like rodents and reptiles, as well as larger animals like horses and livestock.To find a shelter near you, you can browse online or use The Shelter Project's online search engine.;
, Most cities and suburbs are home to numerous stray and feral cats. While stray cats are typically domestic pets that escaped or were abandoned, feral cats tend to live their lives entirely as wild animals.There are a number of ways you can help these outdoor cats, from reuniting them with their owners to simply providing them with food and water.


Consider leaving some cat food and a bowl of water out for stray and feral cats in your neighborhood. Be aware, though, that leaving out food may lure more cats to your yard, as well as other wild animals looking for food.
If you see a collar, it probably has an ID tag on it, which means it is a stray or runaway cat. If you can safely approach the cat, check the ID tag and contact the cat's owner.If you have a carrier and can safely get the cat into the crate, take it to a veterinarian or local shelter. Someone at either facility will be able to scan the cat for a microchip to determine if the cat has a registered owner and find a way to contact the owner.If you cannot safely approach or ""catch"" the cat, write down a detailed description and contact your local veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and rescue groups. Many people who have lost a pet will leave descriptions of the cat with these facilities in hopes that someone might call in a matching description. Let the facility attendants know where and when you saw the cat, and leave an address or phone number so that they can get back to you if an owner turns up., Trap-neuter-return (TNR) is a common and beneficial strategy that can help control the stray/feral cat population and ensure some quality of life among the existing population. TNR involves humanely trapping stray/feral cats, having them spayed or neutered by a vet, vaccinating them against rabies, and returning the cats to their outdoor community.Neutered cats are less likely to roam far from their immediate neighborhood, reducing the likelihood of being hit by cars or killed by other wild animals.Spayed/neutered cats will not reproduce, meaning that each TNR cat will not give birth to a whole new litter of feral cats. Spaying/neutering feral cats also reduces the chances of fighting among the cats in your neighborhood.You can identify cats in your neighborhood that have already been spayed/neutered by looking at their ears. Veterinarians and spay/neuter professionals typically use a surgical tool to ""tip"" or ""notch"" one of the cat's ears to let other concerned neighbors know that the cat has already been through the TNR process.Use a humane box trap to trap a stray/feral cat that visits your yard. You can then take the captured cat to a vet to be spayed/neutered and vaccinated.
Many animal services, such as the ASPCA, offer free spay/neuter services for feral cats. These agencies will also offer vaccinations and/or ear-tipping for a low cost.

, If you cannot adopt an animal or perform TNR services, there are still ways you can care for animals in your community. Whether you have a yard surrounding your house, a small balcony/porch on your apartment, or a community park nearby, there are many little things you can do that make a big difference to the wildlife in your area.Provide clean drinking water. You can set up a birdbath for birds that visit your yard, or put out a small bowl of drinking water at ground level. Be sure to change the water on a regular basis to ensure that it stays clean and fresh.Hang bird feeders. Bird feeders are a wonderful resource for birds, especially during the winter when food is scarce. Fill the feeder with a healthy seed mix from your local pet or grocery store.Avoid using harmful lawn chemicals, like fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides. These chemicals are dangerous to wild animals and also pose a threat to pets and children who play in your yard."

Give your time to nature.,
Create a wildlife friendly home.,
Vote for political candidates who support the environment.,
Join an organization.",How to Do Your Part to Prevent Animal Extinction2," The best way to help endangered species is to protect the environments where they live. Give your time to nature by visiting or volunteering at a local wildlife refuge. Such organizations always need donations and volunteers as they often lack adequate funding.


Simply visiting a wildlife foundation can help. You can leave a donation at the entrance. You may also learn something about endangered species and the importance of protecting the environment which will allow you to better educate those around you. The more people involved with protecting endangered species, the better.You can also volunteer. Wildlife refuges often do not have a large budget at their disposal. They may rely heavily on volunteers to keep running smoothly. The next time you're at a wildlife refuge, ask a worker about volunteering., Work to cultivate an environmentally friendly home. This can help save endangered species native to your area.


If you have pets, supervise them when they're outdoors. Do not leave cats or dogs outside overnight as they may fight and even kill birds, rodents, and other animals in your neighborhood.Keep your garbage in secured cans or shelters that can lock. You do not want a wild animal to accidentally ingest something poisonous.If your garden, be environmentally conscious. Avoid the overuse of herbicides or pesticides. Go for organic pesticides over products made from synthetic chemicals., The biggest issue in protecting endangered species is keeping their habitats safe. When voting in the next election, vote wisely. You should support candidates who run on a platform dedicated to environmental protection.


You should look for candidates that want to lessen dependence on fossil fuels and support more efficient farming practices. Pay attention to a potential candidate's voting record when it comes to environmental issues. You should give your vote to a candidate that has consistently supported bettering your country's environmental practices.Overpopulation of humans is a major cause of environmental decay. Therefore, look for candidates who support education and healthcare for women throughout the world. Women who have access to things like birth control are less likely to have unexpected or unwanted pregnancy. Providing education and healthcare to women worldwide can curb overpopulation and help the environment., You can also become politically involved by joining an organization dedicated to animal rights and welfare. Greenpeace, PETA, and the National Wildlife Foundation are a few organization that strive to mobilize politically to protect endangered species. You can help an organization by simply becoming a member, donating a small fee once a year. However, you can also volunteer your time and services. If you want to help endangered species, look into helping through direct action. Look up local branches of organizations dedicated to animal rights and welfare. See what opportunities there are to get involved.

Use social media to your advantage.,
Talk to your friends and family members.,
Volunteer for organizations that help raise public awareness.",How to Do Your Part to Prevent Animal Extinction3," Knowledge can be an incredibly powerful tool when it comes to helping endangered species. Use social media to educate your friends and family members. If people understand the necessity of immediate action, they may be more likely to help.


Post relevant articles on social media websites. You should both news stories that talk about abstract facts and lists that give people specific instructions on how to help. For example, you could post a list of small changes you can take to reduce your carbon footprint. You could also post recipes and articles and how to makes your favorite foods vegetarian or vegan.
Encourage people to sign petitions. Online petitions do not often result in direct action right away, but they can help raise awareness of an issue. If politicians, other leaders, and corporations see many people care about something, they may give it more attention.
Encourage people to call their congressperson when a vote is coming up regarding laws about animal welfare and sustainable environmental practices. If enough people call in expressing concern, you could have a real impact on how your representative votes.

, Express your concerns to others. Education can be a powerful tool when it comes to social change. You do not need to be preachy or get insulting with people. However, you can kindly suggest small changes when the opportunity comes up. For example, propose you and co-workers car pool to work. Mention what a positive impact this might have on the environment., Volunteering your time to organizations in need is one of the best ways to help educate the public. Some of the organizations listed above often do public awareness campaigns. You can see if you can donate your time to running a booth at an event, for example, or handing out flyers on the street.


If you're looking for a new job, consider seeing if you can work for an organization like National Wildlife Federation. If you have editing experience, for example, you could help write press releases and news stories informing people on issues related to animal welfare and the environment. You would be able to make money while fighting for a cause you're passionate about.

Stop eating meat.,
Commit to cruelty-free cosmetics.,
Reject fur products.",How to Help Animals2," Over 99 percent of commercial animal products come from factory farms. At these large industrial operations, animals are often neglected, abused, or left to live in cramped and/or unsanitary cages.One of the best ways to help reduce animal suffering is to give up meat by becoming a vegetarian or give up all animal products by becoming a vegan.Even dairy and egg production can cause suffering for animals. Chickens and cattle are forced to produce more eggs and dairy (respectively) than they naturally would, all while being housed in cramped, uncomfortable living quarters. Additionally, many chickens have their beaks cut off or burned off to reduce the chances of ""nervous pecking"" in the tightly-packed cages.If you're not sure you want to commit to a meat-free diet, try participating in meatless Mondays. It's a great way to try out a meatless diet one day each week and experiment with different meal options that you may not otherwise have tried.There are a plethora of vegetarian and vegan recipes available online and in printed cookbooks. Learn how to make delicious vegan meals at home, or find restaurants that offer vegetarian/vegan versions of your favorite dishes.

, It's a sad fact that often goes unmentioned, but many cosmetic products are still tested on rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, and rats. These animals are often blinded, poisoned, or killed while testing cosmetic products and the ingredients used in these products.Animal testing is currently legal in approximately 80 percent of all countries worldwide.Look for cruelty-free products online and in stores. Buying cruelty-free cosmetic products helps reduce profits that would otherwise support animal-testing industries., Cutting out fur products from your wardrobe is one of the easiest ways to help animals by reducing their needless suffering. Over 50 million animals are mistreated and killed each year for their fur coats, even though many non-fur alternatives keep you warmer and look even more stylish.The Humane Society compiles a running list of brands, designers, and retailers that have halted or are actively phasing out the use of fur in clothing products."

Help a stranded animal.,
Report neglected/abused animals.,
Petition politicians and legislators.,
Support a shelter or animal rights agency.,
Take courses in humane education.",How to Help Animals3," If you are ever at the beach and see a marine animal stranded on-shore, there are ways you can help. For safety reasons it's best to stay far away from the animal (at least 150 feet), but you can call your local marine animal hotline to report your sighting.Find your local marine animal hotline online by searching for emergency animal assistance in your area. For example, the New England Aquarium (based out of Boston) has a 24-hour Marine Animal Hotline at (617) 973-5247.Do not be alarmed if you see a seal on the beach. Seals will often swim onto shore to sleep, nurse, or warm up in the sun. If you see a seal, simply leave it be.Sea turtles, whales, dolphins, and porpoises do not belong on shore, and will only be out of the water if they are seriously injured or become beached after the tide washes out. If you see any of these animals, call to report the sighting immediately., Whether it's a neighbor whose yard you see everyday or a coworker who talks about the way he treats his animals, at some point you may encounter a case of animal abuse or neglect. It's best to proceed with caution in these cases to ensure your safety as well as the animal's safety. Do not try to confront someone who abuses animals yourself, as the individual may be dangerous.


If you encounter or know of an emergency situation in which an animal's life or health is in serious jeopardy, call 911 immediately.If you suspect neglect but there are no signs of abuse or violent tendencies, some experts recommend having a polite conversation with the individual. You can offer assistance, like asking if the individual needs help walking his dog, for example. Or you can mention that perhaps the animal would be better off in a more appropriate home where the animal could receive adequate care and attention. However, you should only approach the individual if you're certain that he will not react aggressively/violently or engage in any kind of harassment against you.If the individual is not approachable, or if you believe the animal is being abused, call your local law enforcement or your local Humane Society or SPCA to report the situation., If you're interested in making a real difference for animals, you may want to consider writing to your elected local, state, and federal officials in charge of policy making. You can sign petitions, or create your own petitions to be delivered to your chosen elected official(s)., There are many ways you can help your local shelter or animal rights agency. You can give monetary donations to help cover the costs of operation, or you can volunteer your time and energy to the agency. Many animal shelters are in need of dog walkers, feeders, and other volunteers to help around the shelter.


Look up your local shelter or animal rights agency online and call or email them to ask about volunteer opportunities.

, If you're interested in teaching others about humane practices and lifestyles, you may want to consider taking courses in humane education. For example, the Humane Society offers a number of courses leading to both the Certified Humane Education Specialist (CHES) and Certified Animal Welfare Administrator (CAWA) credentials.Humane Education Specialists work with teachers, school administrators, and outreach personnel, as well as shelter directors and community advocates and law enforcement officers, to teach community members about how to be humane citizens helping animals at home and in the community."

Support animal conservation efforts.",How to Be Kind to Animals," No matter how old your pet is, make sure you are ready to take care of it for the rest of its life—or yours. Animals have feelings and bond with their “pet parents” and not taking this commitment seriously can harm your animal.Avoid getting your pet at a pet store or other type of animal factory such as a “puppy mill” by relying on reputable breeders or humane societies. Ask yourself some of the following questions before adopting a pet to make sure it’s the right decision for you:


Why do I want a pet?
Do I have enough time and money to care for my pet?
How well would an animal fit in my home? Am I allowed to have pets in my rental property?
Who will care for my pet if I am away, ill, or pass away?;
, A healthy pet is a happy pet. Taking care of your pet or animal’s health with regular vet visits and watching for signs of illness can promote their health, well-being, and demonstrate your kindness towards them.Make sure your animals receive yearly vaccinations against rabies and other diseases. Schedule vaccinations as a part of your pet’s annual visit to the vet.
Groom your animals as necessary for their species. For example, brush your horses, dogs, and cats regularly.Watch for fleas and other pests like ear mites and treat them accordingly.

, Just like people, pets and other domesticated animals like horses enjoy sleeping, having alone time, playing, and cleanliness. Making your pet a personal space that is comfortable and clean shows your kindness and can help create a strong bond between the two of you.Prepare a cozy sleeping space with items like a pet bed, box with a blanket, or a nice pile of clean hay. Put a personal item in the space to remind her of your scent.
Create other spaces where your animals can eat, play, and go to the bathroom. Keep eating and bathroom spaces as far apart as possible because many animals won’t eat near where they defecate.Allow smaller animals like cats and dogs to live inside with you.Make sure smaller pets and domesticated animals that stay outside have proper shelter. For example, any animal needs a roof to protect it from rain, snow, or other bad weather.This is especially important for smaller animals because they are not able to regulate their body temperatures in extreme hot or cold.Keep your pets’ and animals’ spaces as clean as possible. For example, if you have turtles or fish, clean the tank once a week. Likewise, clean a kitty litter box every day., Part of an animal’s health is getting daily food and water.Mealtimes also show your kindness and help establish a bond you’re your animal.Give your animals food at the same times every day to establish a routine.Ask your vet or conduct online research to figure out how often you should feed your pet for optimal health.
Feed your animals food that is appropriate for their species. For example, give cats and dogs a mixture of moist and dry foods and pigs vegetables and fruits.You can ask your vet or local pet store or conduct online research to figure out what brands and types of food are best for your best. Aim to get the highest quality food you can afford to promote your pet’s health.
Make sure pets and other animals always have bowl of fresh and clean water in addition to their food.Change the water at least once daily and more often if your pet drinks it or something like food falls in the bowl.
Avoid giving your pet or domesticated animal table scraps or other human foods like chocolate because these can harm their health and even be fatal.Talk to your vet about what types of foods to absolutely keep away from your pets.
Reward your pet with treats when they are being good. Be careful not to feed your animals too many treats, which are often filled with sugar and can contribute to unhealthy weight gain.

, Just like people, animals often enjoy having some space to themselves. Allow your pet or animal to sleep in peace, which can build trust and shows kindness.Avoid moving or playing with your animal when she is sleeping, eating or drinking, and cleaning herself. Doing so may scare, stress, or annoy animals, which could result in an unpleasant reaction.
Avoid chasing pets because this can scare them. Although you might be tempted to show your animal love by following her and picking her up or interacting with her, this often goes against animal behavior. Allow pets and other animals approach you whenever they want.Position yourself at your animal’s height to appear less threatening. This can relax them and ensure they are comfortable getting your attention., Always show your animal how much you love her by being gentle and affectionate. This helps build trust and can make her more likely to approach and seek out quality time with you.Pet or stroke and pick up your animals gently.Avoid squeezing your animal or pull her tail while you pet or stroke her.Reciprocate any affection your animal shows you. This helps form a bond of trust and love between you and your animal. Part of this includes talking to your pet and referring to her by name.
Play with your animal. Most pets and animals are naturally energetic and require play to stay happy and healthy.Give them toys, take them for walks, and do any other type of activity your animal enjoys.Be patient with your animal if she makes a mistake. Don’t yell, hit, or do anything else retaliatory towards her.Pets learn best from positive responses and may learn to fear you if you yell at or hit them., Unfortunately, not every person is kind to animals. If you suspect that someone is abusing an animal, report it to authorities immediately. This is one way to show your kindness to animals. Some signs of abuse you might see are:


animals that are chained in yards without proper food, water, or shelter
hitting or kicking animals, or even screaming at them.

, Chasing after or forcing an animal to approach you if it barks, whinnies, or hisses at you can cause you harm and traumatize the animal. The same goes for attempts to claw, kick, or bite you.Remove yourself from the situation to let the animal calm down.


Consider putting yourself at the level of the animal to help calm it.Kneel down to smaller animals such as dogs, cats, rabbits, or turtles. Avoid putting your face directly in front of an animal’s face, which may stress it and cause you harm.Keep in mind that animals respond to you the way you treat them.

, Animals are much more sensitive to behaviors and smells than humans. No matter what type of animal—horses, cats, dogs, turtles, or birds—approach them slowly and quietly to avoid scaring them or causing them undue stress.Avoid approaching an animal from its blind spots, which can startle it. This may traumatize the animal or could wind up in an injury for you.
Let dogs, cats, and other animals sniff you before you handle it. Extend your hand and let the animal smell you. It will decide if you can approach it more closely from here.Consider washing your hands if you are touching multiple animals as some pets may not like the smell of another species.Give the animal a few seconds or minutes to approach you. Some animals may be naturally timid and need a little while to get used to your presence. Approaching them before an animal shows it wants your attention can cause it stress., If your pet approaches you for attention or you want give her some love by picking her up, move calmly and slowly towards her. If her body seems relaxed, pick her up using correct methods to support her body and prevent harm.


Place your hands under the animal’s legs or on the legs and belly. This provides a stable base so she feels safe. You can also gently move your arms underneath your animal if she is larger. Remember to stay calm and be patient so that you don’t startle your animal. If the animal shows any signs of not wanting to be picked up, allow it to go free and try again another time.
Use proper methods for larger animals. For example, if you need to pick up a horse, cow, or a pig, make sure you have the proper equipment such as a crane that supports the legs, head, and belly.
Stand up slowly once you have a good handle of your pet. This can minimize the risk of startling the animal and traumatizing it.
Avoid picking up an animal by its head, individual legs, or tail. No exceptions, otherwise you can seriously harm and traumatize the animal.

, Once you’ve calmly picked up your animal, make sure to assure her and help her relax by keeping a stable hold on her. This can ensure that both of you have a relaxing and enjoying bonding experience.


Keep your animal in a balanced position so that she feels safe. Avoid flipping animals, which can not only traumatize, but also harm them.Consider sitting down with your pet to help both of you relax. This may allow the animal to snuggle into you and further establish your bond of trust. Make sure you talk to your pet and stroke her while you are holding her.

, Anyone who spends time in or near nature likely enjoys seeing the critters that inhabit unpopulated areas. Although animals like raccoons, foxes, and alligators are cute and may appear cuddly, they live in the wild and exhibit behaviors of animals that aren’t domesticated such as killing prey or things they perceive as threats.Be aware that many species of animals, such as alligators, cannot be tamed and you shouldn’t make an attempt to tame them or their offspring.Be aware that it is often against the law to keep wild animals without a special permit., Disturbing wildlife is one way to get hurt—or hurt the animal.Observe and enjoy wildlife from afar to show your kindness to it and avoid startling the animal.Avoid chasing, touching, or picking up wild animals.Remain quiet and still when watching wildlife.Use binoculars and cameras to get close to wildlife with your eyes.Keep your pets away from wild animals to prevent disease transmission or any unpleasant interactions.Stay away from habitats or wild animal areas at mating times or when they are protecting their young., Although it may seem harmless, feeding wildlife can have serious consequences such as altering natural behaviors, exposing them to predators, and damaging their health.Don’t give wild animals any of your food or leave food out for them.Keep any food, including pet food, you have outside securely stored in containers with lids.Place trash in secured bins or sealed bags. If you are camping, hiking, or taking a nature walk, look for areas designated for trash.Never throw garbage on the ground or leave it sitting in your yard or elsewhere.Be aware that the salt from sweat on shoes or boots and scented toiletries can also attract wild animals.Never use food to bait a wild animal to come closer to you.

, At your home, set the conditions so that animals can safely thrive without bothering you. Planting a garden to invite birds or small creatures and avoiding pesticides can show wild animals kindness while continuing to respect their boundaries.Use organic lawn and garden treatments. Not only can this protect wildlife, but also your pets., Human development is increasingly encroaching on the habitats of wild animals. Housing area and roads interrupt the natural area of animals such as deer and foxes. Taking care when driving through areas populated by wild animals can show them kindness and consideration.


Avoid swerving to not hit an animal on major roads. This can lead to major accidents and even human fatalities. Do your best to not hit the animal.
Never go out of your way to hit an animal with your car. It’s cruel and could get you in legal trouble if someone sees you.

, If you accidentally hit an animal or see an injured or sick animal in the wild, let proper authorities know.They can find the best solution to aiding the animal.


Contact park rangers if you are in a natural park.
Call your local wildlife rehabilitator, conservation commission, or police department if you are not in a park.Your local humane society will also have information about who you can contact., Animals are threatened and endangered all over the world, possibly including your local area. Making donations to animal charities or even volunteering at a local animal rescue facility can go a long way keeping animals safe and healthy.Consider making an annual donation to conservation groups such as the World Wildlife Foundation.Groups like this can use the money to protect threatened and endangered species around the world. However, if you want to help animals in your local area, make a donation to a local nature reserve or park.
Offer your time to a local part or animal facility. This can help them save administrative funds and divert them to important efforts such as vaccinations or rebuilding natural habitats.

Ask the vet to check if her physical injuries are fully healed and if there are any areas that are still tender or painful for the cat.
This allows you to judge her medical needs and ensure any courses of treatment are complete. It also helps you to understand if there are any parts of her body that you should avoid touching.;
, Bring the cat home and set her up in a quiet room that has everything she needs in it. This includes: food, water, a bed, and a litter tray. Do provide toys but don't feel hurt if she ignores them for several weeks.

, At this early stage it is about getting the cat to feel safe in her new environment, even if that space is relatively small to start with.


It is fine to leave the door open, as long as there aren't boisterous pets around who will intrude in her space and upset her. If this is the case, close the door.
As her confidence builds then she can freely investigate the rest of the house in her own time.

, Cats feel safe if they are protected on all sides but can see out, which is why cats love cardboard boxes so much. Provide a variety of dens, perhaps boxes in different sizes lying on their sides, and make them comfy with the addition of a blanket or fleece.

, It may take days, weeks, or months for her to come out of hiding, but remember that you are following her timetable and not yours.


However, once she realizes that this environment is very different to the abusive household, you should start to see a change in her.
The first step is for her to realize that there is definitely one place where she is safe (her hide-out), and once she has confidence in that she may start to explore more widely.

, Resources such as food and water are high value assets to a cat. It is likely that in the abusive household these were either withheld or it was too dangerous to seek them out.Therefore, the cat's stress is greatly reduced if she has these resources easily available.


If she hides beneath a bed, put a saucer of biscuits near the edge so that she can snack without having to cross an unfamiliar, scary room to get to them.

, If the does creep out from her hiding place, take care not to stand between her and the safe place. If it appears to her that her escape route is cut off she may panic.

, If you figure out that the cat is wary of people, never force her to socialize. Either put her in her safe room when friends come round, or make absolutely sure they know not to look at or approach the cat. This at least will minimize the threat as she perceives it.

, For the first 2 to 3 days under-play contact with the cat. Make sure she has everything she needs and the tray is clean, refresh her water, and top up food, but leave it at that.


Let her get used to the new sights, sounds, and smells around her. If she wants to come out of her own accord and investigate fine, but if not, leave her be.
Always speak in a quiet, gentle voice, even if she lashes out and is violent towards you.

, Never confront the cat by staring at her in her hiding place. Direct eye contact makes a cat feel threatened because in cat language a direct stare is a challenge of authority.


To them, staring is a signal that the staring-cat wants to be boss, and this is the last thing an abused cat needs in a new home, where you want her to feel confident and safe.

, After 2 to 3 days have passed, spend some time in the same room as the cat. Take a good book and a bag of cat treats, settle yourself down to read and have some treats in your hand.


The idea is to let her get used to your company, and to see that you are not doing anything other than sitting quietly.
Eventually, if she feels bold enough she may take a tentative step out from her hiding place.

, Let the watch you for a few minutes and then gently toss a treat in her direction. If she eats it great, but if she scurries back under cover do not fret, it is to be expected.


This is where bucket loads of patience comes in because you need to be prepared to sit in this way every day for an hour or more if necessary.
Even then it can take weeks for some cats to build the confidence to start taking the treats.

, Once the cat takes a treat at a distance, start leaving the treat a little bit closer each time, setting a trail for her to follow that draws her closer to you.


Ultimately, the goal is to get her approaching close enough to take a treat from your hand, and eventually allow you to gently pet her.
In this way get the cat patterned onto treats, which will help her to associate you with pleasant things.

, A tip for winning the cat's confidence when she ventures out of hiding is to lie on the floor.


When standing up, a human is an imposing sight to a cat. Lying on the floor you look less intimidating, making it feel safer for the cat to approach.
Don't forget to keep those treats handy so you can scatter them on the floor as she draws closer.
Again, as the cat explores never cut off her escape route in case she need to retrace her steps in a hurry.

, Remember that behind the fear and shyness there is a lovely cat needing to relearn confidence and trust. It takes time, but if you are patient and kind these animals can repay that kindness a thousandfold. There is so much pleasure to be had, months down the line, in recognizing the immense turnaround possible in these animals., The rescue agency may give you some idea of the type of abuse the cat suffered. If not, watch how she reacts and what she seems to fear most. Once you have identified what she fears, you can take steps to avoid exposing her to these things.


When frightened, her eyes will dilate and the pupils become huge and dark. Her fur may stand on head, and she holds her tail straight and the fur is erect so it looks like a bottle brush. Her ears will go back and flatten against her skull.
If she can run away she will likely scuttle away close to the ground, moving quickly. If she feels trapped she will arch her back, hiss and spit.

, ""No go"" areas are not uncommon in abused cats. For instance, if a cat previously had her pelvis kicked and broken, she won't know being stroked over her hips is a pleasurable thing, but associate it with pain. Thus she is more likely to hiss when you go to touch her there, or try to flee.


If you are aware of where she least likes to be touched, respect this and do not attempt to stroke her there. Do not persist in forcing physical contact with that area in the mistaken belief that she will get used to it.
Perhaps in years to come she may let you, but until then you need to win her trust and that means doing exactly what she wants!

, Some rescued cats become clingy around their new owner. The owner represents safety, and the cat is fearful of being abandoned by you.


If this is the case put some of your clothing in her cat bed so that she has your scent to comfort her.
Sometimes it even helps to have another pet to keep her company. This also helps the abused cat because seeing you interacting gently with another animal reassures her.

, Some cats have been so badly abused they become aggressive. These cats can be dangerous as they may break regular cat rules of not lashing out unless provoked, and strike out just because you have approached. In her eyes, getting close to her may be provocation enough.


Part of the difficulty with aggression of this sort is its unpredictability. These cats may not give you the typical warning signals of growling, hissing, swishing the tail, flattening the ears, and dilated pupils. Instead they may strike without warning.
However, many of these cats can be won over with patience and time. Their aggression is based on fear and attacking is their best form of defense. It takes a combination of knowing there is no pressure for resources, and relearning to trust people in order for them to become less aggressive.

, You cannot force a cat not to be aggressive - again, it is a matter of teaching her that you are not a threat.


If in doubt, back away from the cat, do not challenge her in order to prove you are not intimidated. That will end with you getting scratched or bitten, and one very angry cat.
Instead, back off and let her calm down.

, There are no miracle short cuts, but feline facial pheromones can at least help to lower the cat's stress levels.


Pheromones are chemicals given off by the cat when she feels relaxed and happy. Cats naturally produce these pheromones to communicate with one another, but there are synthetic versions available (such as Feliway for purchase).
Spray Feliway on her bedding, or use a Feliway diffuser in the room she spends the most time, as this helps to reassure her. The pheromones label the area as somewhere chilled and relaxed, a bit like playing relaxing music and infusing the air with lavender at a spa.

Learn animal body language.,
Introduce new animals slowly.,
Learn everything you can about the animal.,
Have patience.,
Spend as much time as possible with your animal.,
Train the animal.,
Play with the animal.,
Discipline with care.,
Let things happen at their own pace.",How to Connect With an Animal," If you want to connect to an animal, you need to know how that animal communicates. As animals cannot use language to converse, they relay heavily on movement and expression to show how they feel.


The ASPCA website and the Humane Society website have extensive overviews of animal body language. If you have a domestic pet, like a dog or a cat, you can read up on how your pet communicates here. Dogs and cats often show anger, fear, contentment, and happiness through motions of the tail, back, eyes, and ears. Familiarize yourself with the various ways you can expect you pet to communicate.If you're working with livestock, like a horse or pig, websites for organizations like 4-H and PETA may explain some of how these animals convey emotion with their bodies. You can also talk to a farmer or breeder directly if you're wondering how to interpret barnyard animal's body language.
Reptiles, like snakes and chameleons, are popular pets for many. Communication in reptiles in captivity is somewhat poorly understood as such animals are not fully domesticated. Talking to other reptile owners, however, as well as reading up on how reptiles communicate in nature may help you understand to a degree.;
, If you're bringing in a new pet, introductions should be slow if you have animals already. It can be hard to connect with an animal if it feels isolated or scared.


For dogs and cats, you should usually introduce them on a neutral ground. Take dogs to the park rather than directly bringing an animal into another animal's territory. For cats, separate them for the first week, allowing interactions between doors. When you do introduce cats, supervise the pair for the first few hours to make sure there will be minimal fighting. If a fight does occur, separate the animals and allow them an hour to cool down before reintroducing them.With less domestic animals, introductions may have different rules. If you buy from a reputable pet store, you should get some advice on how to introduce, say, two guinea pigs or two rats. You can also find information online. Petco's website has many articles on how to introduce non-traditional pets like rodents, birds, and reptiles.
When it comes to livestock, talk to a professional in the field. Livestock are less domesticated and larger than pets so it's best to have professional advice to avoid accident or injury.

, You need to understand an animal's history in order to connect with it. Learn as much as you can about an animal while trying to make introductions.


Learn broad facts about the type of animal and breed. How high energy is this type of dog? What sort of play activities to cats enjoy? What kind of treats do horses crave? All these things will allow you to learn what an animal enjoys so you can better enjoy your time together.Learn specific facts as well. Where did this animal come from? What were its previous owners like? Does it come from a background of abuse or neglect? Is there anything that might scare this animal or make it uncomfortable?, It can take awhile to connect to animal. If an animal was abused by a former owner or is simply a type of animal that is not super people-friendly it may be a few weeks before you begin to connect. Be patient and understanding during this process. If an animal does not seem to like you right away, this does not mean it will not eventually come around., Animals may take awhile to get used to a new person. Spending as much time as you can with an animal while it warms up to you can help you connect.


Spend time in the same room as an animal. You do not have to engage with the animal, but simply sit in the room and do something else. Read. Go on your computer. Watch television. Allow the animal to get used to your presence.
If the animal is comfortable going out, take the animal on walks or with you on errands. Some animals, like cats, are not huge fans of outings. Dogs, however, will be happy to go for the occasional walk. They will become attached and eventually affectionate to the person who walks them.

, Training can be a fun way for you to bond with an animal. Animals do not just get close to people who are affectionate towards them. Animals crave stimulation and enjoy being around people who push them to work.


If you have a horse, try to practice new riding techniques. Take the horse a professional instructor and work on jumping, dressage, barrel racing, and other fun activities.
Dogs and cats can be trained to do a variety of tricks. You can take a dog to obedience classes or simply practice training in your living room. Many online tutorials, which can be found on sites like YouTube, provide advice on how to work with dogs.
Birds are somewhat trainable. You can learn how to train a bird by reading tutorials online or talking to an exotic animal specialist.

, Spend time playing with your animal. Animals can easily bond with people through play.


Stock up on pet toys at a local pet store or order toys online from a pet store. Depending on your animal's age, it may play more or less. Animals less than a year old tend to play less than older animals.Dogs enjoy being taken for walks. Try to walk your canine for 15 or 30 minutes each day.Sometimes, animals accidentally become aggressive during play. Make sure you're prepared to discipline an animal in this event. Young animals or animals from abusive homes are more likely to get aggressive during playtime.

, A relationship with an animal should not all be about play and fun. Animals thrive on boundaries and discipline. Make sure you're prepared to discipline an animal for acting out or behaving in a dangerous manner.


Make sure you review the proper means to discipline a given species. Some animals, like cats, do not respond well to scolding or punishment and must be trained by other means.
Make sure you avoid losing your temper and yelling at an animal. Most animals do not respond well to harsh discipline. Never yell and never strike an animal. This can damage your relationship with an animal.

, You cannot force interactions with pets prematurely. You have to let things happen at their own pace. Wait for an animal to come to you. Never pet or pick an animal up if they seem uninterested in interacting with you.

Set up the shelter.",How to Build an Animal Shelter," You don't want to build a shelter in an area that is difficult to find or get to. You may also need planning permission from the local council, if it is not already there. Bear in mind the costs of building and sustaining your center.;
, Decipher the size of the area. If there are a lot of pets, build a medium-sized shelter to accommodate the pets, and vice versa. Keep in mind how many shelters there are in your area.

, If you know some people that could help build the shelter, ask them! It could turn into a community project with the help of, well, the community. You could ask someone who specializes in design and architecture to help you build the shelter, but do expect some involvement in cash. Or you can stick to your friends and family, who can give you tips and help improve your design. Don't forget to thank the people who helped.

, Let vets and local officials know and ask if they could donate some time to treat the animals or lend their support. Eventually, try to find a vet that would work with you at least part time. Hand out flyers, make a website, put an advertisement in the Sunday news! You will need lots of donations to make it work!

, Bring the animals in individually and allow them to get used to their new surroundings. Have family assist with the paperwork and friends that will help care for the animals."

Or, you could even get a job that has to do with animals. This isn't a must, but it could help you meet others like you.;
, It's really a matter of choice, but it's hard to both truly love animals and pay for them to be killed. Becoming vegan/vegetarian is also a very good way to fight climate change and to get yourself healthier. Becoming a vegetarian can also help, or you could try to cut down on meat and dairy products. You could even try (should you be especially addicted to one thing) to cut out everything but, say cheese.

, You don't always have to be kind to people, but if you extend your loving of all creatures to people, your goodness will be outstanding.

, Perhaps you could take in a nice cat, dog, bird, or small animal from your local rescue! Be sure to always take an animal from a shelter. Many baby animals end up in shelters and are even put down because they have no room in the shelters to take any more in., These animals aren't meant to live in cages and suffer terribly by coming to you and many don't live nearly as long in captivity as they do in the wild.

, Make sure they have water available at all times and are fed well. Dogs should have at least one reasonable length walk a day, preferably with some time off the lead. If you work all day, think about asking a relative/friend/neighbor to walk your dog or consider getting a dog walker. If you have a cat, they should be let out at least once a day.

, Dress to avoid clothes that contain animal products such as leather, fur, or snake-skin. Most animal lovers buy T-shirts that they think are cute, but how about having your purchase spread the word of honoring the life of all animals. Your purchase could even benefit local or global animal relief efforts.

, Encourage those who have hurt animals in any way to realize the harm they have caused and to nudge them toward understanding better ways to honor the spirit of their animals. If you just let individuals abuse their pets, you are, basically, an accomplice to their cruelty.

The complaint lists the allegations, while the summons tells you when and where to respond to the lawsuit.These documents should be served on you using an official method prescribed by the federal rules of civil procedure. Typically this means they will be hand-delivered to you by a U.S. Marshal.
If you are a police officer who is being sued in your individual capacity, you should be named in the lawsuit as a defendant. Keep in mind there may be other defendants.
You also should pay attention to the date of the alleged incident giving rise to the claim. There is a statute of limitations that governs the amount of time plaintiffs have to file a lawsuit after the incident occurs – if it happened long ago, this is something to bring to your attorney's attention.;
, In an excessive force case based on a claim of police dog misuse, it's likely the plaintiff has an attorney. Hiring an attorney to represent you and assist in your defense is critical to maintaining your reputation as a law enforcement officer.Before you hire a private attorney yourself, speak with someone at your police department or police union about obtaining counsel. Law enforcement departments and unions typically have attorneys and other legal resources available at no cost to officers who are sued for incidents that took place while they were on the job.
However, keep in mind that depending on the incidents alleged in the complaint, your job could be on the line and you may want to hire private counsel to represent you as well.
Even though attorneys hired by the department or union may be representing you, they are paid by and often also consider the best interests of the department and city administration.

, Before he or she responds to the lawsuit, your attorney likely will need to know some basic information regarding the incident that gave rise to the lawsuit, as well as information about you and your training as an officer and police dog handler.Be prepared to work with your police precinct to pull police reports and dispatch recordings of the incident that led to the police dog misuse claim.
Your attorney also likely will want information on the training provided to police dogs and their handlers, as well as basic information about you and your police dog and how long you've been working together.

, Depending on the contents of the complaint and the information you've provided to your attorney regarding the plaintiff's allegations, your attorney may file a motion to dismiss, an answer to the complaint, or both.Generally, which responses your attorney decides to file and when is a matter of litigation strategy. #*A standard motion to dismiss in police dog misuse cases asserts that you cannot be sued because you have qualified immunity from suit. However, there may be other reasons to have the suit dismissed.
Since some of the reasons to dismiss a lawsuit may not preclude the plaintiff filing another lawsuit correcting the error, your attorney may waive those issues rather than attempting to litigate them.
For example, the complaint may have named the wrong officers, or may not have named the officers involved. Since you cannot be held liable unless you were personally involved in the plaintiff's arrest, you can have a lawsuit dismissed for failure to specifically name the appropriate officers.
However, such a dismissal would not prevent the plaintiff from determining which officers to name and filing the lawsuit again with the correct defendants.

, Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the federal rules of civil procedure, you can file a motion to dismiss, or motion for summary judgment, if there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury to decide. In excessive force cases, you can file a motion for summary judgment because you have qualified immunity from suit.In a motion for summary judgment, all facts alleged by the plaintiff are taken to be true for the purposes of arguing the motion.
If the plaintiff has no legal entitlement to damages even if he or she proves every fact alleged, the lawsuit will be dismissed.
Because qualified immunity is a legal theory that prevents you from being sued, it is an appropriate theory on which a summary judgment motion can be based, in addition to being a defense to the claim at trial.

, The core of an excessive force claim is that the force you used to arrest or detain the plaintiff violated his or her Fourth Amendment rights. If you acted in accordance with established rules and procedures, you generally will be immune from suit.The standard includes an evaluation of whether you violated rights you knew or reasonably should have known about. Standard police rules and procedures are one way you would know about a suspect's constitutional rights.
Each police department has standard procedures used when apprehending a suspect that take the suspect's constitutional rights into account. Your attorney likely will use those procedures – assuming you followed them – to argue that your actions did not violate the suspect's constitutional rights.
This argument becomes harder if you deviated from standard police procedures to apprehend the suspect – for example, by calling on your dog to give chase and take down the suspect when that wouldn't have been recommended under standard protocol.
However, you still may be entitled to qualified immunity if there were circumstances that warranted a break with standard protocol, and you can demonstrate that you still took care to avoid the use of excessive force.

, Even if there were no established rules or procedures upon which your conduct was based, you can still claim qualified immunity if your use of the police dog was objectively reasonable.This inquiry is different from the defensive argument of reasonableness, because it relates to your choice to use the police dog in the first place and whether that choice was reasonable – not whether the subsequent force was reasonable.
The law makes a distinction between your choice to use the dog, and how you used the dog after you'd made that choice.
In applying qualified immunity, your choice to use the dog for whatever reason must have been reasonable under all of the facts and circumstances available to you at the time you made the decision.
Courts generally recognize that police officers often have to make split-second decisions with very little information at hand.
However, information that you only knew after the fact cannot be used to justify your conduct at the time of the incident. By the same token, information that later proved to be inaccurate still may justify your decisions in the moment if you had no reason to doubt its accuracy.
For example, suppose you were in pursuit of a suspect who had fled when you pulled over his car. You sent a police dog to track him through the woods where he fled and hold him, because at the time you had reason to believe the man was wanted for a violent robbery and considered to be armed and dangerous.
When that man sues for the injuries he sustained when the police dog bit his leg, your choice to use the dog typically will be considered reasonable under the circumstances – even if you later found out the man was unarmed and not involved in the crime.

, If the judge has ruled you do not have qualified immunity from suit, you can nevertheless escape liability if you can prove that your application of force or use of the police dog was reasonable under all of the circumstances surrounding the incident.In other words, even though you may have been mistaken to use the police dog to assist in apprehending or detaining the suspect, you can still defend yourself by arguing that once employed, the police dog was used appropriately.
Your choice to use the dog is evaluated under the context of qualified immunity. Your actual use of the dog, however, is reviewed separately using a similar reasonableness standard.
To defeat a police dog misuse claim, your use must have been reasonable under all the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident, including any information known to you before the incident took place. #*Other factors such as the time of day, the location, and the number of people around also can be considered in determining whether the police dog use was reasonable.

, Anyone who was present at the scene when the incident took place may be able to provide an account of what happened and whether your use of the police dog seemed reasonable in light of what they saw.Eyewitnesses often can offer compelling testimony regarding whether they felt your actions were reasonable or justified under the circumstances. This is especially true if it was a tense, public situation with frightened onlookers.
You may want to talk not just to eyewitnesses but to other police officers who can speak to your usual training and handling of the dog, as well as your reputation and performance on the force.

, Understanding the true extent of the plaintiff's injuries can go a long way toward demonstrating the reasonableness of your police dog use – especially if the plaintiff sustained relatively minor injuries as a result of the incident.Keep in mind that plaintiffs may attempt to exaggerate their injuries, or include damages that occurred not directly because of the dog bite, but because of the length of time the injury was left untreated.
The plaintiff also may attempt to include psychological damages, such as for emotional distress or post-traumatic stress. These types of injuries can result in significant awards, but also can be difficult for plaintiffs to prove because they're not easy to quantify.

, Other police dog handlers or trainers may be able to provide some insight into whether your handling of the police dog was objectively reasonable under the circumstances of the incident.Expert witnesses don't know you personally, and weren't present for the incident that gave rise to the plaintiff's police dog misuse claim, but can speak to situations in which using a police dog is warranted.
Experts also establish the training police dogs and their handlers undergo, and how this training takes a suspect's constitutional rights into consideration.
Given the objectively reasonable standard for evaluating your actions, an expert can help establish what is considered objectively reasonable and how the constitutional rights of suspects are respected in standard police procedures.

Typically your citation also will include a deadline by which you must respond if you intend to appeal the citation. Mark this deadline on your calendar and make sure you don't miss it or you may lose your ability to appeal.;
, Some agencies have a paper review before you can request a hearing on your citation. If you have documents that prove the citation was issued in error, you must send these to the agency.For example, if you were cited for not having your dog vaccinated against rabies, you can send proof of your dog's vaccination to the animal control agency.
Keep in mind that typically your documents must have a date before the date on the citation. Some jurisdictions may provide a grace period after the issuance of the citation that allows you to fulfill the requirement of the ordinance within a few days or the week after the citation and pay a lower fine.
You also may send documentation showing that you shouldn't have been cited because you aren't the lawful owner of the animal that is the subject of the violation.

, Citation appeals typically are heard by a hearings officer at a live hearing. In most jurisdictions, a request for a hearing must be made in writing by the deadline listed on the citation.Your city or county's agency may have a form you can fill out to request a hearing, or you may have to send in a letter.
Make sure the identification number of your citation is included on your request, as well as the name or number of the ordinance you're cited with violating.
In some cities or counties you may be required to pay a portion of the fines assessed before a hearing will be granted.

, Within a few days after you've submitted your request, you'll get a notice from the agency telling you the date, time, and location of your hearing. If you can't make it, call the agency to reschedule it as soon as possible.Your notice also may include information about what to expect at the hearing and the types of evidence you can bring.
If you're allowed to bring witnesses to the hearing, you may be required to provide their names and contact information in advance of the hearing.

, At your appeals hearing, you must present evidence to prove that you shouldn't have been issued the citation. Typically you're allowed to present documents or photos, as well as call witnesses.Read the ordinance you've been cited with violating carefully. It may provide information you can use to defeat the citation.
For example, you may have received a citation for failing to provide your dog with adequate food and water. The ordinance defines what is considered to be adequate.
If you can prove you provided your dog with the amounts of food and water required by the ordinance, you should be able to defeat the citation.
Try to provide as much objective evidence as possible, rather than simply relying on your word against the word of the agent or officer who issued the citation.

, Most jurisdictions allow you to be represented by an attorney at the appeals hearing. You must pay attorney's fees out of your own pocket – you don't have the right to an appointed attorney if you can't afford one.Even if you don't feel the need to hire an attorney to represent you in the hearing itself, you may want to discuss your case with someone who has experience with the animal law in your area.
In some situations, such as if your dog has been impounded and may be put down, hiring an attorney to represent you can give you peace of mind that you did all you could to save your pet.
If you want to talk to an attorney, look for someone with experience in animal law cases that practices in the same city or county where you live.
Your local bar association's website typically will have a searchable directory of licensed attorneys.

, Typically you can bring witnesses with you to testify on your behalf that the citation was issued in error. If you have witnesses you want to bring, meet with them before the hearing to go over what they will say.Witnesses will be much more valuable if the citation is for violation of a behavioral ordinance rather than a status ordinance.
For example, if you were issued a citation because your dog was barking excessively, testimony from neighbors that your dog's barking hasn't bothered them and that they never viewed it as excessive may be helpful.
If a witness agrees to testify, discuss the questions you plan to ask them before the hearing, as well as some of the questions you anticipate they may be asked on cross-examination.

, Your appeal will be dismissed if you don't show up for your hearing. Likewise, you may be eligible to win your appeal if no one shows up to represent the agency that issued the citation.If the citation was issued as the result of a complaint from a private individual, typically that individual also must show up on the hearing date or the entire citation will be dismissed.
Keep in mind that the hearings officer may have multiple hearings scheduled for the same day, so there may be other people waiting. Listening to other hearings before yours can give you an idea of what to expect and how the hearings are handled.
Typically someone will be there representing the agency that issued the citation. That person will speak first and explain how, when, where, and why the citation was issued to you.

, After the agency explains its reasons for issuing the citation, you will have the opportunity to tell the hearings officer why you shouldn't have been issued the citation and introduce evidence or witnesses on your behalf.Stick to the facts, and make your statements clear and concise. It can be instinctive to try to appeal to the emotions of the hearings officer, for example by describing how the animal cited is a beloved pet to your young children.
However, these hearings officers typically have heard it all before and must apply the law – they can't make an exception just because they feel sorry for you.
Keep in mind that if the hearings officer finds the citation to be valid, you may be assessed additional fines or have to pay for the costs of the administrative hearing.

, After you've presented your case, the hearings officer typically will issue his or her ruling on the matter. At that time, you'll find out what the next steps will be.If the hearings officer rules in your favor, you don't have to pay any fines associated with the citation. If your pet was impounded, you can make arrangements to retrieve it.
If the hearings officer rules against you, he or she will let you know what the process is to contest the decision.
In some jurisdictions, if the citation was issued as the result of a complaint from a private individual, that individual has the right to file an appeal if the hearings officer rules in your favor.

, If an animal has been taken from you as the result of an animal law violation and you have lost your administrative appeal, you typically must make arrangements to pay for the continued holding of the animal.Some jurisdictions may require you to pay holding fees for each day your pet is held by the city or county.
You also may be required to pay a portion of the fine charged on your citation before you are allowed to appeal the hearings officer's decision.
In some situations, an impounded animal may qualify for a conditional release. If your pet is being held, the hearings officer will let you know if this option is available to you.

, Administrative decisions may be reviewed by a county civil court or a state appeals court. You must request an appeal in writing before a certain deadline, typically only a few days after the hearing.Some jurisdictions may have a form you can fill out to appeal the hearings officer's decision. If not, ask an administrative clerk if you can look at an example of another appeal filed.
You also may be able to find out information about the format and information required in your appeal request by contacting the clerk of the court that would hear the appeal.

, While you may not have felt you needed an attorney for your administrative hearing, a court appeals before a judge involves more complex rules of procedure and evidence.Search for an attorney in your area with experience defending pet owners against animal law citations. You may want to interview more than one attorney before you make your final decision.
Particularly if you're facing an order that your pet be euthanized, it is advisable to hire an attorney to represent your interests and the interests of your pet.
Keep in mind that in most cases this is your last chance to fight the citation.

, You will receive a notice of the date, time, and location of your court hearing. If you need to reschedule this hearing, make sure you do so as soon as possible after receiving the notice.Typically at this level of appeal you must be able to demonstrate that the hearings officer's decision was an incorrect application of the law.
If you've hired an attorney, he or she will work with you regarding the evidence you presented at the administrative hearing and how that evidence should have been interpreted.
If you're representing yourself, talk to the court clerk about what to expect at the hearing. Keep in mind the clerk can answer procedural questions but cannot give you legal advice about your case.
You may want to observe similar cases before your case is scheduled, if there are any on the docket. It will help you get a good idea of what to expect and the procedures followed in the courtroom.

, On the day of your hearing, you will have the opportunity to explain to a county court or appeals court judge why the decision of the hearings officer was wrong and the citation against you should be dismissed.If you're representing yourself, remember you shouldn't speak until the judge gives you permission.
Speak in a loud, clear voice, and make your case in short, concise statements of the facts. Focus on the reasons the hearings officer's decision was incorrect, not the reasons you were hurt or upset by it.
Typically this is your last chance to appeal. If the judge upholds the decision of the hearings officer, that decision stands.

Attend lectures and meetings.",How to Advocate for Stronger Animal Protection Laws," Your biggest supporters most likely will be people who know and care about you. If you're passionate about animal rights, let those closest to you know about the issues and encourage them to help you.Pay attention to the context of your conversations. You may be working tirelessly to advocate for stronger protection laws for cows, pigs, and other farm animals – but describing the conditions of slaughterhouses in gory detail may not be the best topic of conversation over dinner.
Sometimes the best way to gain support from friends and family is to draw their attention to specific issues. They may not agree with you on everything, but be willing to assist in your efforts on a particular case.
Remember that these people are your friends. It can be easy to get overheated when you're passionate about something, but try to keep your tone civil and don't attack people just because they disagree with you.;
, Having a blog provides you with a platform to educate and spread awareness of the need for stronger animal protection laws throughout the country and even globally.Many websites enable you to start a blog for free. Once you set up your blog and write a few posts, search for and follow other blogs with an emphasis on animal rights or animal protection laws – many of those bloggers may follow you back.
Keep your posts short and use active voice. Internet readers are more likely to finish – and share – a briefer article that gets straight to the point.
Don't be afraid to let your own passion and personality shine through in your posts.
Provide links where necessary to provide sources for factual information you present or point your readers to other websites or articles of interest.

, Having a letter to the editor published in a local, or even national, publication is a way to get your message out to a much larger audience than you may be able to build yourself.Most publications have guidelines regarding the length of letters. Read and follow those guidelines, but generally keep your letter short – between 150 and 200 words.
Many organizations have form letters or lists of talking points you can use to draft your letter, but don't just copy these letters word for word – make your letter personal.
Keep the audience of the publication in mind. For example, if you're writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper, give your words a local angle and stress your connections to the area.
Read and research if necessary before you write your letter. Check your facts and make sure you know the law and are stating your case accurately.

, If there is legislation pending that would provide stronger protection and recognition for animal rights, you can write a letter or even meet with your elected representatives to encourage them to vote for the bill.You can find contact information for your representatives in Congress by visiting usa.gov. For state representatives, check your state government website.
Write a letter to your elected representative when there's pending legislation for stronger animal protection.
Many organizations such as The Humane Society and the ASPCA create form letters that you can use to guide your writing and ensure you include the most important information, but be sure to make your letter your own.
If you voted for the representative to whom you're writing, or live in his or her district, say so. You also may want to do a little research and talk about the representative's prior record on animal protection or animal rights.
Contact your representative's home office, located in the district, to see if you can schedule a meeting to speak with the representative or with a staffer.

, There are a number of websites that enable you to create your own petition online. Whenever there's a current event that impacts animal rights, a petition can draw people's attention to the issue and encourage them to express support for your position.Use talking points from a nonprofit organization, if you have those available, to focus your petition. You also may want to read other petitions to get a sense for the best, most persuasive language to use.
Make sure you proofread your petition before it goes live on the website. You might also read it out loud to check how the language flows. If you find yourself stumbling at any point, reword the language so it reads more clearly.
Once you've created your petition, share it across your network, including on your blog and any social media accounts, and encourage your friends and followers not only to sign it but also to share it and help spread the word.
The signatures you gain on your petition help show support for stronger animal protection laws.

, While coordinating a public event requires a lot of time, skill, and attention to detail, if you think you're up for it you might want to try organizing your own rally in support of stronger animal protection laws.Many nonprofit organizations offer assistance to activists who want to hold their own rallies for stronger animal protection laws. Check organizations with which you're affiliated to find out more information.
You must plan ahead and choose a location for your rally so you can learn your city and state rules for public demonstrations and get a permit if necessary.
Once legal permission is in place, spread word of your rally and encourage others to join you. Many nonprofit organizations have listings of rallies and events on their websites and will promote your event for free.
You may want to get together with two or three other people before the event to plan the rally itself and set rules for what people will do. Schedule any prominent speakers and make arrangements to clean up the site after the event.

, There are numerous organizations working to protect animals and give them a voice. By joining these groups you not only make a statement of commitment to animal rights, but enable the group to continue its work.Organizations typically have a set annual donation amount you must give if you want to become a member of the organization.
When you join an organization, you may receive a subscription to the organization's magazine or newsletter, as well as other updates and information.
Most organizations also provide a gift, such as a T-shirt or a tote bag, for people who join.

, Even if you choose not to join a group, you can always donate smaller amounts of money to demonstrate your support and provide assistance for particular efforts.Nonprofit organizations take one-time donations as well as regular monthly donations. Typically if you visit their websites, a ""donate"" button will be prominently displayed. When you click that button, it provides you with options regarding how much you want to donate and how often.
You also can donate to animal protection organizations through your regular shopping. Look for products that send a portion of the purchase price to animal rights organizations, or sign up for a program such as Amazon Smile, which donates 0.5% of your purchase price to the nonprofit organization of your choice.
Buy products from companies that support animal rights or have their own advocacy programs to further animal protection.

, When you hear about an event near you in support of animal rights and stronger animal protection laws, making an effort to show up – even if you can only be there for a short time – adds to the number of participants and can help increase the event's impact.For example, The Humane Society organizes ""Humane Lobby Days"" each year in nearly every state. Animal advocates join together and speak to state legislators about the need for stronger animal protection laws.
Many nonprofit organizations have pages on their websites listing events happening all over the country. Bookmark the sites you like and check regularly for new events.
If the leader of an event is listed, you may want to contact that person and find out if there's anything you can do to help organize the event or clean up afterward.

, Although it won't necessarily help any new laws get passed, part of advocating for animal rights includes doing what you can to help animals that are abused or neglected.Helping care for the animals not only has a positive impact on their lives, but it broadens your perspective on the issues facing animals and the need for stronger animal protection laws.
Getting to know these animals and learning their stories puts a face on the issues. You can share the animals' stories on your blog and social media accounts to advocate for animal protection.
Animal shelters are always in need of volunteers. Call the animal shelter nearest you and ask about volunteer opportunities.

, If you're a law student, you might consider an internship or clerkship in animal law. However, regardless of your educational background, there are plenty of employment opportunities that allow you to work for the improvement of animal rights.Animal law intersects with a number of different areas of law. If you're a law student and your law school doesn't have any dedicated animal law classes, you can take classes in property and personal injury law, as well as family law – which can help you in cases where the custody of a family pet is disputed.
Taking veterinary classes or working at a veterinarian's office, even as a receptionist, helps animals and allows you to earn your living protecting and caring for them.
You also can find jobs working for nonprofit animal rights organizations. These organizations need people with many different backgrounds, including people for administrative and technical support.

, Many animal rights groups have regular email newsletters that keep subscribers up to date on issues effecting animal rights as well as court cases and pending animal protection legislation.You typically don't have to join an organization or donate money to subscribe to the newsletter.
If you have created a blog or regularly post about animal protection on social media, the newsletters can keep you up to date and give you information to share more widely on the internet.
If you want to subscribe to several newsletters, consider setting up a separate email account so they don't get lost among your other emails and skipped over. With a dedicated email account for receiving animal rights newsletters, you can set aside a time specifically to read them.

, You can create an alert through your favorite search engine for keyword searches you use frequently to find new information about animal rights and animal protection laws.Separate alerts can be particularly beneficial if there is a pressing issue such as a specific case making its way through the courts that could potentially affect animal protection.
You can use filters in your alerts so they only retrieve new articles, or information coming from a specific geographic area.
Don't forget to tailor your report. You probably don't want to receive multiple emails a day if new results come up for your search. Typically you can choose how often to receive an email alerting you to new search results, and how much information will be included in each email.

, Many animal rights groups have an active presence on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and following these accounts allows you to quickly learn about breaking news and other situations that impact the legal protection of animals.If you share posts on your social media accounts to advocate for stronger animal protection law, following nonprofit organizations allows you to more quickly and easily share their posts with your friends and followers.
Following an organization also gives you the opportunity to potentially interact with the organization and learn more about how to advocate for stronger animal protection laws.
After you've followed the organizations that interest you, look through the organizations followers to find other individuals and organizations that share your interests.

, Keep an eye out in your community for any informational events involving animal rights. These events may be advertised at your local public library, and many are free and open to the general public.You also can find events sponsored by nonprofit organizations on their websites. Many of these events have fees, which go to support the nonprofit organization and its work.
You also can attend conferences to learn more about how to protect animals and methods you can use to advocate for stronger animal protection laws.
If there's a law school near you, find out if it has an animal law class or a professor who specializes in animal law. You may be able to sit in on the class or talk to the professor.

Write a check.",How to Compensate Someone Bitten by Your Dog," If your dog bites someone, then you will need basic information to report to your insurance company. After helping the victim get immediate medical attention, write down the following:the victim’s name
the name of any witnesses, including contact information (such as phone or email)
details about what happened;
, You should also try to get a picture of the bite, if you can. Use your phone to take a picture.If the victim is furious at you, then you might not be able to get a picture. However, you could try to explain to the victim that the picture is for your insurance company and that it will help speed up payment for the injury.

, If you have dog owner’s liability insurance, then you should contact your insurer as soon as possible. You shouldn’t wait. Insurance companies have deadlines you must meet if you want the claim to be covered. Check your policy.


You may also be covered under a homeowner’s insurance policy.You should also call them to report the injury.
You may also be covered under a renter's insurance policy. It will usually be a part of your personal liability coverage., After you report the claim, the insurance company might have an adjuster investigate. You should provide any information requested. You may also have to meet with the adjuster.


Before meeting, go over your policy.You want to understand exactly what is covered.
Also come up with any questions you might have. For example, you might want to know how long the process will take before the victim will be paid.
Also ask what happens if the victim decides to sue you. Will the insurance company defend you? If so, will the insurance company choose your defense attorney or can you choose?

, If you have insurance that covers the dog bite, the insurance company will be the party to calculate and determine how much they are going to offer the victim. Work with your insurance company and get them any information they may request so they can make an informed decision.

, A dog bite victim can receive compensation for any medical care needed to treat the injury. They can also receive money if the dog bite aggravates a pre-existing condition. You should try to get copies of all medical bills so that you can tally them. Get bills for the following:treatment from a primary care physician an emergency room
plastic surgery, if necessary to reconstruct the victim’s limbs or face
bills from a psychiatrist or counselor to deal with emotional harm

, The victim can also be compensated for any time missed from work, whether to get treatment or to recuperate. To calculate the economic loss, you should get the following from the victim:


wage stubs, which show the victim’s rate of pay and typical hours worked
if self-employed, then evidence of how much the person typically makes
a copy of the most recent W-2

, If the victim sued in court, he or she could also receive compensation for pain and suffering. These damages are hard to estimate; nevertheless, victims are entitled to be compensated for mental and emotional suffering.


One way to estimate these damages is to multiply the medical damages by two or four.Accordingly, if the person paid $5,000 in medical expenses, then you might need to pay an additional $10,000-20,000 for pain and suffering.
There are other factors you should consider. For example, if the victim is a child, then pain and suffering damages could be higher because the child might develop a fear of dogs.
Also, if the attack is completely unprovoked, then you might have to pay a higher pain and suffering award.
Your state may also have a cap on pain and suffering damages; however, these rarely come into play in dog bite cases unless your dog mauled someone severely.

, Each state’s law is different. In some states, a victim can receive double or triple damages if your dog has bitten a person before. Also, some states may allow multiple damages if the dog has been identified as “dangerous” under your state or local law.For example, if you must pay $5,000 in medical expenses and $15,000 in pain and suffering, then you might need to pay two or three times the total amount: $40,000 to $60,000.
To find your state or local statute, you can visit your local law library, which should be in your courthouse. Ask the librarian to see the dog bite statute.
You can also search for the statute on the Internet. Type your city and state into your favorite web browser.

, You might have to pay punitive damages if you were reckless in how you took care of your dog. For example, if you knew the dog was dangerous but allowed it to run freely, then a jury could award the victim “punitive damages.”Punitive damages are meant to punish, and the amount can be very large. For example, the dog bite might have only caused $2,000 in actual medical and pain and suffering damages. However, if you were reckless in handling of your dog, then a jury could award $20,000 in additional punitive damages.
If the victim is eligible for punitive damages, then you very likely will be sued in court. A trial attorney could represent the victim on contingency and take 30-40% of the jury award as fees. When punitive damages come into play, an attorney might be more willing to represent a victim because the fee will be larger.
To assess whether you were reckless, look over your dog’s history:

Did you know the dog was dangerous? Has it bitten someone before?
How well restrained did you keep the dog? Was it tied up? Kept in a garage? Or did you let it run free?
Did you have signs up around your property warning people that a dog was on the premises?



, Before paying, you should meet with a lawyer to discuss details related to paying the dog bite claim. Specifically, you want to discuss getting a release of liability from the victim. Without one, the victim could take your check and then turn around and sue you for even more money. If you have insurance, your provider will likely hire legal counsel to defend you. If you do not have insurance, hire an attorney as soon as possible after adversarial discussions begin (e.g., settlement negotiations or a lawsuit).


To find a lawyer, you should visit your state or local bar association, which should run a referral program.
You might not want to pay any attorney’s fees. However, you should realize that most states now let lawyers offer “a la carte” services (often called “unbundled services”). With this arrangement, attorneys will only do the work you give them.For example, you can get coaching from the lawyer about how to handle mediation, or you can have the lawyer draft a release from liability for you.

, If the injured party has medical insurance, you may not only be dealing with the injured person. In addition, the victim's health insurance company will likely be involved as they will want to be reimbursed for any medical costs they paid out to the victim. In other words, your mediation may involve more than two parties. It may also include your insurance company and the victim's.

, Once you have calculated how much the victim is entitled to, you should make an offer. Be prepared for the victim to reject the amount. If so, then you can suggest mediation to help you resolve your differences.


You can call or make the offer in writing. Regardless of how you make the offer, be sure not to accept liability. Also request that all future claims be waived in exchange for the settlement.
You could write, “Pursuant to our discussions, I am offering $5,000 to cover the dog bite you suffered on June 1, 2015. In exchange, I ask that you sign a release from future liability. Please call me at 555-5555 to discuss this offer further.”
If you have an insurance policy, then all negotiation will be done by your insurer. Typically, negotiation with an insurance company begins when the victim makes a demand letter on your insurer., In mediation, a neutral third party listens to your dispute and tries to come up with solutions that are acceptable to both parties. Unlike court, mediation is not adversarial, and the mediator is not a judge. He or she does not decide who is right or wrong. Instead, the mediator works to help nudge you and the victim to a compensation amount that is agreeable to you both.To find a mediator, stop into your local courthouse, which might have a list of mediators or even run a mediation program itself.
Also contact your state or local bar association. They should have information about mediation programs.
Finally, call your city or county mayor’s or manager’s office. These offices sometimes run mediation programs.

, At the mediation, you will meet with the mediator along with the victim. Be prepared to discuss the initial compensation offer you made and why you think that it is fair. During mediation, you and the victim will meet together with the mediator to discuss the case. Then, you might break out and meet individually with the mediator, who will shuttle back and forth between the two parties.


Be prepared to listen. Successful mediation requires that you listen to the victim’s point of view.If you bulldoze ahead, insisting that you are right, then you can expect mediation to fail.
You should also be prepared to express remorse. By offering apologies for what your dog did, you can dissipate the victim’s anger and help encourage settlement.

, If you choose to pay voluntarily for the dog bite, then you should get a release from future liability owing to the bite. Before paying, draft a “full and final release” and make sure that the victim signs it in front of a notary.


You should have your lawyer draft it. Release of liability forms are legal contracts, and you want to make sure that yours will stand up in court.
If you want to draft your own, then make sure that the release contains the following provisions at a minimum:Title and date. You should title it “Full and Final Release.”
The consideration. This is what you pay in exchange for the release. You should write, “In consideration of the payment of , which is paid to the Releasor, the Releasor agrees to the following.”
The release clause. Write: “The Releasor does hereby for herself and her heirs, successors, and assigns release and forever discharge (the “Releasee”) and his heirs, successors, and assigns, from any and all actions, causes of actions, claims and demands, for any reason of any loss, injury, or damage to any person or property, which has been sustained in consequence of the dog bite . The Releasor further agrees not to make any claim or continue any claim against the Releasee.”
State that this agreement is not an admission of liability: “It is understood and agreed that the payment is not an admission of liability on the part of the Releasee.”
Also include a provision that the victim is signing the form willingly: “The Releasor acknowledges that she fully understands the terms of this Full and Final Release and that she has signed it voluntarily.”



, The full and final release needs to be signed in front of two witnesses and probably also a notary public.Your lawyer can help you get the necessary witnesses and notary. If you are proceeding without a lawyer, then you can find a notary typically at your courthouse or town manager’s office.


Remind the victim that she or he will need to present acceptable forms of identification to the notary. A valid driver’s license or passport should suffice.
Make sure that the witness is not related to you or the victim. A neutral third party could include a bank employee or someone who works in the public library.

, You should meet with the victim in a lawyer’s office and have the full and final release signed before you hand over your check. To put the victim at ease, you should use a certified check or a cashier’s check. These checks warrant that you have the money to make payment and that the check won’t bounce.


Make sure each party has a copy of the signed full and final release form.

If your dog has injured someone’s livestock, then you should call your insurer. Your homeowners or dog owner’s liability insurance might cover the claim against you. For this reason you should contact your insurer as soon as possible with the following:pictures of the injury
the names of the livestock owner and any witnesses
police report;
, Try to get pictures or other evidence of the injury to the livestock. If the livestock wandered onto your property, find evidence. Take pictures of hoof marks on your lawn or broken down fences.


If you can get a picture of the injury to the livestock, then that would help as well.
Also get a copy of any police report.

, The livestock owner will file a complaint in court to start the lawsuit. In the complaint, the owner explains the facts that gave rise to the dispute and also explains what he or she wants from the court (usually money damages). You will receive a copy of the complaint along with the summons.Read both documents closely. In particular, pay attention to the deadline for responding, which should be on the summons.

, You face an uphill climb defending yourself in a dog bite case. In particular, the law will apply “strict liability.”This means that the livestock owner doesn’t need to show that you were reckless in how you handled your dog. The livestock owner doesn’t even need to show that you were careless.


Instead, the livestock owner only needs to show that you own the dog and the dog bit the livestock. It is very difficult to get out from a strict liability offense.
However, you could argue that the livestock owner waited too long to file the lawsuit. Your state’s statute of limitations requires that plaintiffs bring suits within a certain amount of time. Search for “livestock injury statute of limitations” and your state to find out how long a plaintiff has to file the lawsuit.
You might also be able to argue that the livestock broke into your property, where it was bitten.
If the animal caused damage to your property, you could also bring a counterclaim. In your counterclaim, you sue for the damage the livestock caused to your property., You respond to a complaint by drafting and filing an answer with the same court. In the answer, you admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each claim. You can also raise any defenses or counterclaims.Your court might have a printed answer form you can use.If not, then you will have to draft your own. You can ask the court clerk if there is a sample you can use. Alternately, you can search the Internet for sample answers.
For more information, see Answer a Civil Lawsuit.

, Make several copies and then take them all to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. Then have the court clerk stamp all of the copies with the date.


You must also serve a copy of the answer on the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney (if there is one).Ask the clerk for the acceptable methods of service.

, You can have a lawyer represent you in court. However, if you want to represent yourself, then you should prepare for trial by gathering any evidence you want to submit. You might introduce photographs, a diagram of your property, or a police report.


You can turn these documents into exhibits by getting exhibit stickers from your nearest office supply store or from the court. You can attach the sticker on the back of the photograph or in a blank space near the bottom or top of a document.
If you have any witnesses, then you may need to serve them with a subpoena. A subpoena is a legal document that commands the witness to appear in court on the trial date.You can get a subpoena from the court clerk. Ask about acceptable methods of service.

, A trial will consist of jury selection, an opening statement, the presentation of witnesses, and then a closing argument.If you are being sued for a large sum of money, then you might want to hire a skilled attorney to represent you.


You also might be sued in small claims court. Procedures in these courts can be somewhat different from a regular civil trial. For example, you may choose not to be governed by the rules of evidence. There will also not be a jury. Instead, the judge in small claims court typically decides the case.
You should get any available small claims court handbook or manual published by the court. Often, these are published online and contain helpful information for representing yourself in a small claims hearing.
See Win in Small Claims Court for information on how to handle a small claims case.

Focus on vocabulary when taking notes. Knowing the definitions of different terms in Science or Language Arts is always helpful. Sometimes teachers might give you extra credit, merits or points.

, Reading is helpful for people of all ages: it helps you learn vocabulary, spelling, and grammar, while expanding your mind to new ideas. Challenge yourself to read a variety of materials such as classics, non-fictions, autobiographies and things outside typical school reading lists. If your school has a library, you should take some time at lunch or break to go there and just read some books to exercise your mind before class.

, This is especially important for any subject you have a difficult time with. Bring your textbook home at night and go over previous lessons for the test (and maybe the next lesson, as well). If you study every night, you'll be fully ready for any test you face.

, Flash cards are useful for geography, spelling, vocabulary, math, etc. Have someone quiz you or use them to quiz yourself. That way, you can build up your knowledge so it will stay with you.

, If you need to write a book report or essay on it later on, it will be much easier if you write down notes while reading. Post-it notes are helpful for marking important pages for later reference.

, After you get home from school and finish your normal homework, why not look into what you learned during the day? Look for newspaper or online articles, essays, and informational books. Look for worksheets or quizzes as well. Taking some notes is a good idea.


Try to learn something new every day. For instance, you could research a different math term every day, or a new vocabulary word. Try subscribing to a ""word per day"" website (one that suits your age group). That way you will receive a new word on Twitter or through email every day.
Try to research something for each class; for instance, you could research dichotomous keys for science and composers for music. For Literature, you could study poets, and for History, you could research different historical periods.

, Read the newspaper and watch the news. This will be helpful in any Politics or Social Studies classes, and it will also help you gain a deeper understanding of the world we live in.

, Studious clubs such as debate, journalism, chess, and math will put you in an academic mindset. They are also a great way to meet and befriend like-minded individuals who can teach you lots of new things.


Playing an instrument might not have socializing involved, but it will also help expand your mind.

, Write down your assignments, due dates, test dates, and so on. That way you can stay organized and won't have to worry about forgetting anything.

, Teachers are there to help you. Be nice and respectful to your teacher. Show them that you're serious about your education: pay attention in class, raise your hand, ask questions when you're confused, and so on. Ask them if there's anything you should work on. And if you need help, ask them for it.

, This will help you practice grammar, syntax, and creative writing in general. If you dedicate time to writing, your teachers will notice.

, Examples include a paper-mache volcano, a sundial, or salt crystals. This will impress them (and maybe earn you some extra credit).

, You need a social life and some fun to be healthy and happy. Everyone needs a break once in a while. Hang out with your friends and spend quality time with your family. Being smart doesn't mean you can't have fun.

Appeal, if necessary.",How to Defend Yourself in a Livestock Injury Lawsuit2," Sometimes livestock wander onto a road and collide with traveling vehicles. These kinds of accidents can cause serious damage. If your livestock injures someone in this manner, then you can expect to be sued. Accordingly, you should meet with a lawyer as soon as possible. Don’t wait until the lawsuit is filed.


You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have a referral, you can schedule a consultation. Many lawyers now offer free or reduced-fee consultations. Take relevant documents, such as police reports and photographs, to the attorney.

, You should also think about hiring the lawyer to represent you. If costs are a concern, then discuss different billing arrangements with the lawyer. For example, she might be willing to represent you for a flat fee instead of the usual billable hour.


Also, the lawyer might be willing to do only the work that you give her. This is called “limited scope representation.” For example, you might handle all of the pre-trial work yourself but hire a lawyer to represent you at trial. Ask the lawyer during your consultation if he or she offers this service.

, If you run a farm, then you should be carrying insurance to cover accidents caused by your livestock. Take out your policy and find the contact number.


You shouldn’t delay contacting your insurer. Your policy usually contains a deadline for reporting claims. You should report them as soon as possible.

, Once a lawsuit is filed, the plaintiff will send you a copy of the complaint and the summons. Go through each document carefully to see what facts the plaintiff alleges in support of the lawsuit.


You will probably be sued for “negligence.”Negligence means that you were not reasonably careful in how you penned up the animal. This is a fact-specific inquiry. The jury will need to look at how you restrained your livestock—with a fence, by keeping them in a locked barn, etc.—and whether these actions were reasonable.

, You can defend against a negligence claim by arguing that you were sufficiently reasonable in the care you took to restrain the animal. For example:


The fences you installed were in good working condition and were sufficiently high to keep the animal from escaping. The day of the accident, the fence might have failed because of damage caused by a storm.
You weren’t responsible for the animal escaping. Instead, someone else (like a vandal), broke the fence or otherwise released the animal.The injured person helped cause the injury. For example, if someone sneaks onto your property and frees an animal, then he is responsible if the animal then stomps on him.

, You will need to draft an answer and file it with the court before the deadline stated in the summons. You should get an answer form from the court where the lawsuit has been filed.

, If you have an attorney, then the attorney can represent you. A trial typically consists of jury selection, the presentation of witnesses and evidence, and opening and closing statements. If you hire an attorney, then the attorney can handle the trial.


You might not be able to hire a lawyer. Accordingly, you will need to represent yourself. For information on how to defend yourself at trial, see Represent Yourself in Court (U.S.).

, Your testimony at trial can be critical. In particular, the jury will want to know what you did to restrain your animals. You can expect the plaintiff’s lawyer to cross-examine you about your actions. To make an effective witness, remember the following:Show respect for the seriousness of the situation. Dress professionally, as you would for a job interview, and treat everyone politely.
Speak clearly and simply. Don’t provide additional information unless the lawyer asks for it.
Always answer out loud, using whole words. Don’t mumble, shrug, or say “uh huh.”
Look at the lawyer asking questions but then turn to the jury when you answer.

, If you lose at trial, you might want to appeal. You should discuss an appeal with an attorney. To bring an appeal, you need to pay to have court transcripts created. You also need to pay a filing fee, which can be expensive.


If you choose to file, then don’t delay. After the verdict is announced, ask the court clerk for a Notice of Appeal form. You can always choose not to file the form if you meet with an attorney and decide an appeal is not worthwhile.

Propose negotiation.,
Negotiate effectively.,
Offer mediation as an alternative.,
Draft a settlement agreement.,
File the settlement with the court.",How to Defend Yourself in a Livestock Injury Lawsuit3," You have a strong incentive to resolve the dispute outside of court. In some states, such as California, you can be forced to pay double damages for the injury your dog causes.Also, if your livestock injures people, then you could end up paying a huge amount in a jury verdict.
By settling outside of court, you can control how much you end up paying the plaintiff. If you go to trial, then you have no control over how much the jury awards the plaintiff should you lose.
Have your lawyer contact the plaintiff’s attorney to propose settlement negotiations. If you are representing yourself, then call the plaintiff’s lawyer directly.

, You should go into negotiations prepared. Before negotiations begin, decide on what is the most that you would be willing to pay in order to settle the lawsuit.To come to this number, you should consider how much the plaintiff is suing for and how strong the plaintiff’s case is. Talk this over with your attorney.
For example, if the plaintiff has a very strong case, then you might want to settle close to what the plaintiff is asking for. However, if the plaintiff’s case is weak, then you might only settle if the plaintiff accepts 50% of the amount she is asking from the court.
If the plaintiff is unwilling to settle for an amount under your maximum, then you can walk away from negotiations.

, Mediation is a form of “assisted negotiation.” You and the plaintiff will meet with a neutral third party, called the mediator. The mediator’s job is to listen to both you and the plaintiff describe the dispute and then help guide you to a resolution which both parties can agree on.Like negotiation, mediation is voluntary. You can get up and walk away from the negotiation table at any time.
To find a mediator, contact your local courthouse. It may have a list of mediators, or it may run its own mediation program.

, Should you and the plaintiff reach an agreement, then write a settlement agreement and sign it. If you participate in mediation, then the mediator should be able to help you draft a settlement agreement.


You can find settlement agreement templates on the Internet.You can then use them as a guide when drafting your own.
Make sure that any settlement contains a release of liability. This is important for you to have. By agreeing to relieve you of any liability, the plaintiff cannot turn around and sue you again for the same injury.

Sample waiver language would read: “Pursuant to and in consideration of the Parties’ promise to abide by the conditions of this agreement, the Parties and their respective officers, agents, directors, servants, employees, parents, subsidiaries, successors and assigns, hereby release each other from any and all claims arising out of, or related to, the facts alleged in the action.”, You can file a settlement with the court at the same time that the plaintiff asks the court to dismiss the case. By filing the settlement with the court, you can ensure that you will be able to later sue to enforce it.


You can attach the settlement agreement to the plaintiff’s Motion to Dismiss.
Be sure to keep a copy of the settlement agreement for your records.

Wait for the judge's decision.",How to Defend Yourself in a Pet Injury or Death Lawsuit," The complaint and summons you receive provide important information about the person suing you and the reasons for the lawsuit.


The summons tells you the name and contact information of the person suing you, as well as the court in which the lawsuit was filed. Check the location of the court – if it's far away from you, that raises questions of jurisdiction.
Generally, the plaintiff must file his or her lawsuit in the county where you live, although the court in the county where the incident took place also typically has jurisdiction.The summons also should indicate how long you have to file an answer in response to the complaint. The deadline typically is less than 30 days from the date you received the complaint. Keep in mind that if you don't file an answer by that deadline, you may lose the right to defend yourself.Look up the statute of limitations in your state to make sure the plaintiff still has the right to file a lawsuit. The statute of limitations provides a deadline for the filing of claims.In the case of a pet injury or death, most states will use the statute of limitations that applies to property damage.;
, Many courts have fill-in-the-blank forms or templates that you can use to format an answer to the complaint.


If the plaintiff filed his or her lawsuit in small claims court, there might be an answer form included with the complaint and summons.
You typically can find forms or templates by going to the court's website or visiting the clerk's office. If no forms are available, ask the clerk for copies of answers filed in other cases. You can use them as guides to format your answer.
Unless you have a fill-in-the-blank form, type your answer using a word-processing application set to print on 8.5 x 11 paper with one-inch margins on all sides. For most applications this is the default, but double-check your settings before you begin.Copy the top third of the first page of the complaint. This is the case's caption, and is the same on all documents filed in the case – except that you'll want to change the title of the document from ""Complaint"" to ""Answer."", You must address each individual allegation and state whether you admit or deny it.


Use the same paragraph numbers as the plaintiff used in the complaint, and then provide your answer. A single-word response (""admit"" or ""deny"") is sufficient. Where necessary, refer to yourself as ""Defendant"" and the person who sued you as ""Plaintiff"" – avoid using pronouns or writing in first person.If you don't know anything about an allegation, you have a third response option: ""Defendant lacks sufficient information to either admit or deny the allegation."" The court will treat this the same as if you'd denied the allegation.However, if you skip an allegation and fail to respond to it, the court will treat that as though you admitted it, so be careful to address every one.Keep in mind that denying an allegation doesn't mean you're saying it isn't true. Rather, you're insisting that the plaintiff carry his or her burden of proof and show the court with evidence that it's true.After you've responded to each allegation, include any defenses that you think apply to your case. Generally, you can defend yourself by disproving elements of the plaintiff's claim or by asserting that your actions were justified in some way. Defenses that are intended to justify your behavior should appear in your answer.For example, suppose your neighbor's dog ran through your yard barking and snapped at you as though it was going to bite you. In response, you kicked the dog, causing injuries for which your neighbor has now sued you. As justification for your actions, you could argue that you acted in self defense., After you've finished responding to the plaintiff's allegations and offering any other defenses, you're ready to print it out.


Look over your answer to make sure there aren't any typos or grammatical errors and that all names are spelled correctly. Double-check the case number you copied from the complaint.
Sign and date your answer using blue or black ink.After it's signed, make at least two copies of your answer – one for your own records and one to have delivered to the plaintiff. The clerk will keep your originals for the court when you file it., To officially respond to the plaintiff's lawsuit you must take it to the clerk of the court where the plaintiff filed his or her complaint.


You must file your answer before the deadline listed on your summons. The clerk will date and stamp ""filed"" on your originals and copies and return the copies to you.
One set of copies must be delivered to the plaintiff. The clerk will have forms available for you to do this and will explain the procedure. Generally, you can have the forms hand-delivered by the sheriff's department or a private process serving company, or you can mail them using certified mail with returned receipt requested.Typically using certified mail is cheaper and easier than having your answer hand-delivered., The law regarding damages for death or injury of an animal varies greatly among states.


Generally, courts will use the same negligence or intentional standards used in any other property damage or personal injury case to determine whether you are liable for damages.However, the amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled depends on your state's law. Even if you believe you will be found liable for the pet's injury or death, you may be able to lessen the amount of money you pay to the plaintiff by studying your state's law.In some situations the case will be incredibly straightforward. For example, if you hit the plaintiff's dog with your car, and the veterinary bills to treat the dog's injuries amounted to $5,000, the plaintiff typically is entitled to recover that $5,000 from you. If the plaintiff is claiming any additional damages, such as emotional distress, you may be able to mitigate these damages.
Some states allow plaintiffs to get punitive damages if they can prove that you acted with a certain degree of intent. These damages are meant to punish you for acting in an abusive or destructive way.However, keep in mind that if the plaintiff is asking for punitive damages, that means he or she has to prove your mental state at the time of the incident that resulted in the animal's injury or death.

, Especially if the plaintiff is alleging animal cruelty was involved in the death or injury of his or her pet, you could possibly face criminal charges.Keep in mind that if the plaintiff has filed his or her lawsuit in small claims court, you typically don't need an attorney to represent you.It isn't typically necessary to find an attorney who specializes in animal-related cases. The injury or loss of a pet usually involves the same law for personal injury or property damages, so an attorney with experience in personal injury defense is more than capable of helping you., Anyone who saw the incident that caused the death or injury of the animal may be able to testify on your behalf.


Witnesses may be especially helpful if the plaintiff is trying to argue that you hurt the animal intentionally. If the incident appeared to be an accident to everyone who saw it, the plaintiff will have an extremely difficult time proving that it wasn't an accident.
Witnesses also may be useful if you are arguing a justification for your actions, such as self defense.If you were charged by your neighbor's dog while your son watched from the porch, your son's observations of the dog's behavior can strengthen your defense.

, Through written discovery and depositions, you and the plaintiff can exchange information or evidence you each plan to use at trial.


Written discovery typically consists of written questions about the case that must be answered under oath, or requests for production, which require delivery of documents or other evidence that is relevant to the lawsuit.Depositions are a little more time-intensive, such they involve live interviews with parties or witnesses. The interview is conducted under oath and recorded by a court reporter, who creates a written transcript of the questions and answers.The plaintiff will have to produce a number of documents to prove his or her damages. For example, if the plaintiff's pet was injured, copies of veterinary bills would be necessary to prove what the plaintiff paid for the animal's medical treatment.If the plaintiff is seeking money for emotional distress, you should request and analyze medical or psychological records describing the plaintiff's emotional damages and any treatment for that.You also want to get information about the plaintiff's pet. The type and age of the animal are factors considered when the judge figures out what costs were reasonable. A working animal, such as a guard dog, would potentially be worth more than a pet that provided no benefit apart from companionship.Similarly, a judge likely will not find extensive veterinary costs reasonable if the animal was old and nearing the end of its life span., The mediation process can help you and the plaintiff settle the dispute without a long and stressful court process.


Mediation may be beneficial if you don't dispute your role in the injury or death of the plaintiff's pet and simply want to resolve the matter so you both can move on.
Court clerks typically have lists of mediators who are approved by the court. In some states these mediators are available for free or for a substantially reduced fee if you work through the courts to schedule your mediation session.The mediator is a neutral third party who facilitates a conversation between you and the plaintiff to come to a mutually agreeable settlement of the claim in a non-confrontational setting., Before the trial, outline your presentation and index your evidence or witnesses for each point of your defense.


If you're representing yourself, you may want to visit the court before your trial is scheduled so you can observe other cases. This will help you become familiar with basic court procedures and give you a good idea of the conduct expected.Meet with any witnesses you plan to call before the trial date so you can go over the questions you want to ask as well as brainstorm questions that might be asked by the plaintiff.Organize your defense in terms of the points you want to make, taking notes for each point with the names of any witnesses you want to call or evidence you want to introduce.If you're bringing any documents as evidence, make at least two copies so you, the plaintiff, and the judge can look at it at the same time., You will lose the opportunity to defend yourself in the lawsuit if you don't appear in court on the date and time your trial is scheduled, and the plaintiff may win by default.


Plan on arriving at the courthouse at least 30 minutes early so you have time to go through security and find the right courtroom.When you enter the courtroom, take a seat in the gallery. The judge typically will be hearing several cases each day, so you should wait until your case is called before you move to the tables at the front reserved for litigants., Typically the plaintiff will have the opportunity to explain his or her claims to the judge first.Avoid interrupting the plaintiff or doing anything distracting or disruptive, such as making faces or rustling papers. Keep a pen and paper for notes and write down anything the plaintiff or the plaintiff's witnesses say that you want to mention later.
If the plaintiff calls witnesses, you'll have the opportunity to ask them questions yourself through cross-examination. Keep your questions relevant to the case and avoid asking something when you have no idea what the witness's response might be – the answer could hurt your case more than it helps., Once the plaintiff is done, you have the chance to tell the judge your side of the story.When you're talking to the court, speak loudly and clearly so the judge can hear and understand what you're saying. If the judge asks you a question, stop what you're saying and respond to that question before continuing with your thought.How you defend yourself may depend to some extent on the structure of the plaintiff's presentation, but generally you want to lead with your strongest points and spend the most time on them.
At the same time, take care not to repeat yourself or hang too long on the same thing. Stick to the facts and make your point quickly, trust the judge to get it, and move on., After the trial is over, the judge may enter an order immediately or choose to take the matter under advisement.


Taking the case under advisement means the judge wants some time to review the evidence and information presented at trial before he or she announces a final decision on the case.
If you don't get a decision the day of the trial, ask the clerk how long it will be before the order is entered and whether you will be notified."

Understand the meaning of intelligence and how it has to be applied.,
Follow the basics properly.,
Avoid acting narrow-mindedly.This is exactly where many blunder.,
Don't give up just because you don't like something.,
Try to use the available resources effectively and properly.,
Remember that the studious ones are often intelligent.,
Always try to think outside the box.",How to Be an Intelligent Teen," Intelligence is something which lies in one's approach rather than the actual attainments. Ask yourself whether you have a clear and defined way of approaching things. For example, you don't hesitate much while you are attempting a task, you think through the consequences ahead of the task and you trust your competence because you have honed it.;
, Eventually, having a thorough grounding in the basics will do more you more good than knowing a heap of minutiae. Always remember what the genius of science himself used to say: ""Learn the rules of the game first, and then play better than anyone else."" Rules here simply refer to the basics or the fundamentals. You cannot do well enough if you have a weak foundation.

, Sometimes you might be knowing what is right, but don't really allow your uniqueness to make impact because you are either bound by some blind faith or you lack the courage to make an attempt. The only blind faith an intelligent teen should have is in the Glow Cloud. As he is in charge or the school board, you will always seem smarter if you have faith in the Glow Cloud. Always try to stick to what is real. This is one of the very important steps if you are intending to display your wit.

, Since this period is marked by uncertain moodiness, there is occasionally a tendency to break down or destroy what you have already made. Do stop when you feel uninterested but develop a habit of resuming the paused task rather than giving it up all of a sudden. Above all, try to control your anger as far as possible as it can otherwise lead to very unpleasant and even unbearable situations. The goal is to be an average special snowflake nerd, not to be like Anakin Skywalker.

, You can research this more, or put it to use if you have already taken an Economy class. There is an unlimited scope of learning through the Internet. Make use of this facility if you are able to but don't believe all that you read. Besides that, know that intelligence is the sum total of different aspects of the brain, such as: thinking, reasoning, memory, calculation and imagination. Much of this can be improved upon by regular practice.

, To be intelligent in mastering sharp matters requires experience and even some wonderful strokes of luck. But in reality, you are likely to be called intelligent only for the more consistent and regular aspects, such as studying and sticking to things that matter. In summary, you must work hard to obtain the most out of your studies. However, you have to remember that there are people like Bill Gates who only showed up to school to take tests.

, What if that is a thought crime? Figure out how to destroy the government that is limiting your thoughts with your vast intelligent if that is so. If you're considering an idea or position, think, how it would affect me or society? Would it upset Big Brother? Or how can I make this possible? Don't shy away from hard questions or scenarios; get thinking instead.

Choose wisely.,
It's all about choices that you make.,
Be honest with yourself.,
Do not be afraid to say ""No"".,

When you are in love, or like someone, take your time!",How to Be at Peace With Your Life (Teens)," It is not always easy to make the best choices and decisions when you are young; do the best that you can. Remember what you've done wrong and try to repair the past. If you were a bully, make sure you tell everyone and try to sincerely fix the mistakes you've made. Your apologies should range from minor to drastic depending on the issue (minor would be something like saying you're really sorry, but drastic would be hospitalizing someone or forcing them into personal physical harm);
, Making a mistake is okay, but repeating it is not. Learn from your mistakes and others', and remember to actually think before you speak. It can be hard, but pipe down and make decisions with your mind, not your mouth. You could regret what you said, whether it's 10 seconds or 10 years after you said it.

, Being untruthful creates tension between people, so even when the truth is painful, it is still the truth. Choose your words carefully as the words we use have a different effect on each person, especially as a teenager. You can really hurt people with just words - bullying isn't just physical, but emotional as well. Make sure you're not upsetting people with what you're saying.

, Do not allow yourself to be pushed or bullied into a situation that you are not comfortable with. If you have to say no, walk away, or allow yourself to calm down. As a teenager, no matter who you think you are, peer pressure can get to you and tear you down mentally. If you don't want to do something, don't do it.

, Even though teen years may be all about events, parties, shopping and exams, set time aside for you. Sort out all the good things that you have done and the few things that might have been done a little better. This will allow you the opportunity to prepare for future events. After all, there is no perfect in life and experience will always remain the best teacher.

, Teen life and high school is full of turmoil, so just let loose and share. What you participate in won't be any use to your peers in the nearby college life, so just do you. When you have a bad day or heard a nasty rumor about you, don't beat yourself about it. Talk about it with your friends or siblings, and maybe even your parents.

, Be patient with yourself and others and allow yourself the freedom to adapt to new experiences. Try joining the chess club, even if you are the head cheerleader. If you are into sports then try making a home movie in your free time; this will give you a taste of both sports and art.

, The best way to be at peace with yourself and have no regrets is being different; the only way to be different is to be yourself. Make your own rules on how to maintain your life! Begin with responsibility and common sense, and fill in the rest as you live your life. Be yourself, because, once again, it won't matter in college! You'll feel much more comfortable living in you own skin. Who else are you going to be?

, Don't destroy yourself over a breakup. It's just high school, and you probably wouldn't marry the person if you were still with them. Make these decisions with your mind, not your heart. Make sure you're not getting too serious, either.

, Home is the place where you have time to relax, rewind, and look back at the events of your day. There is no place like home, so try helping your parents, doing chores or just singing in the bedroom. Here, you can text your friends, meditate, play a video game - almost whatever you'd like.

, You are young and have the rest of your life ahead of you; there is no need in attempting to live your life in a single day, as tomorrow is another one. There are probably over a hundred and one things that can go wrong when you rush into love. Falling in and out of love is a natural step in life, a wonderful experience, some of which are unpleasant and some that will remain with you throughout your life. Remember, love is a rose, it has its blossoming head and its thorns.

Don't be trashy!,
Remember, it will be hard to pull off the Guidette look if you are not Italian!,
Have gorgeous, long, shiny hair.,
Wear flattering makeup!,
Always be tanned.,
Wear cute, designer clothes.,
Have fashionable accessories!,
Be fit & healthy, but still enjoy some real Italian food.,
Always have blinged out nails, gel nails, or French tips.

,
Slang.,
Confidence.",How to Be a Teen Guidette," No matter how old you are, being trashy is never okay! A lot of guidettes can be trashy or inappropriate, but some guidettes are very responsible & classy.;
, It is best to be at least 3/4 Italian. If not, people may look at you as a poser! However, Snooki pulls off the Guidette look pretty well, & she is Chilean!

, Most Guidettes either have dark brown hair or black hair. You can't be a blonde or a red head. It just won't work! Again, you have to be Italian...& most Italians have dark hair. Also, I suggest straightening your hair for an everyday look. If you don't have long hair, try out extensions! Make sure that they don't look fake though. I recommend trying out Luxy Hair Extensions or Hello Gorgeous extensions.

, For school, use foundation, bronzer, eyeliner, mascara, and a light pink lipstick/lip balm.(Snooki uses MAC lipstick.) Also, false lashes are optional, as long as they are natural looking. Nothing too bold!! Don't wear anything too dark or heavy.

, In the summer, tan outside almost every day! If you can handle it, then use SPF 4 or SPF 8. (That will help you get a deeper tan.) Also, use a self-tanner. Just make sure that you do not look orange! Try to look brown.

, You do not have to buy anything really expensive though. Wear Victoria's Secret PINK sweats, Ed Hardy, bebe, Armani Exchange, Guess, Juicy Couture tracksuits, etc. Wear skinny jeans, yoga pants, lounge outfits, bodycon dresses/mini skirts, etc.

, (BIG Hoop earrings, cross necklaces, Louis Vuitton purses, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci hats & purses, Prada, Chanel earrings, so on.) In the winter, wear Uggs almost everyday! Have at least 3 of them. Try to buy some Snooki Slippers as well for lounging around the house.

, & if you are a REAL Italian...remember, it ain't sauce... it's called gravy!

,, Use words like grenade, yo, yous, hon/honey, etc. Do NOT sound fake though.

, You can't be a real guidette without confidence! So Do NOT be shy! You can be sweet, but not shy. For example, Sammi from Jersey Shore is sweet & a nice person, but she's not too quiet.

If you have a sibling, take the time to play with them. Even something as simple as hide-and-seek or tag is a change of pace.
Card games are an old standard for passing time, but there are many variations on games such as Solitaire that you can learn.The particularly ambitious can even try inventing their own game. You’ll keep your mind active, but who knows? You may come up with a new tradition.
Video games, if they haven't been confiscated, are another simple option with the potential for large time investment and enjoyment.;
, No, it doesn’t sound fun, but it is a useful way to spend the time. Maybe your room is messy and you can’t walk without stepping on dirty shirts, or your favorite bracelet vanished from the jewelry box. Managing your space is an efficient use of your time and will impress your parents.


The act of cleaning gets you active, and when your room smells nice and is organized you'll feel happier.You can put on music, a podcast, or an audio book to further distract your mind from you grounding and your chores.
You can also do other chores around the house and use them to ask for extra allowance or less time being grounded.

, As with cleaning, it isn’t a fun way to pass the time, but it’s a useful way to do so. Being stuck in your house or your room gives you a perfect time with reduced distractions to get done the work you’re going to have to do anyway to prepare for class.


Getting the work done now means that later on you’ll have more time to do what you want, rather than having to stop and finish homework at the last minute.
Preparation means better grades and better grades means impressing parents, making them more lenient, and reducing grade-related opportunities to be grounded.

, Because of being busy with schoolwork, friends, and social media, many people miss out on the adventures the literary world used to offer them. Have you been eyeing that new book your friends have been discussing? Now is the perfect time to begin it, or even go back into the reads that once inspired you.


For those that don’t have books or dislike the physical act of reading, audio books are now widely available at libraries, bookstores, or online shops such as audible.com.
Audio books are combinable with mindless activities such as chores. Even if the book doesn’t take you somewhere else by imagination, hearing the speaker can keep you daydreaming, which passes the time., Podcasting is another electronic platform that has exploded due to the Internet. Virtually anyone can learn to make one, so there’s plenty of variety out there, from storytelling to music to learning a new language. What you want to get out of this time is entirely up to you!


If electronics have been banned for you, ask your parents to help you find some podcasts relating to your interests or download them to a device such as an iPod ahead of time.
Search a platform such as iTunes. The program’s store keeps a healthy supply of podcasts, and most of them are free.

, You don’t need to be in class to doodle, and you don’t need a canvas and expensive paint to make art. Even if it means grabbing a pen and a piece of paper, this is a great way to pass the time while expressing creativity.


Material is cheap and easy to find in retail stores such as Walmart. This includes adult coloring books, colored pencils, paints, and various pens you can keep on hand for use before and after grounding. Let your imagination roam free.
This act of expression allows you to draw out your frustrations, which can help you come up with new ideas for activities and calm you down to the point that you begin to feel happier., Writing is the same as other artistic pursuits in health benefits that come from the freedom of expression. You don’t need to be a great writer or have ambition to do this. All you need is paper and a writing utensil.Begin a journal by writing down what you’re feeling or how your day went. This means of expression has the effect of calming you and enabling you to work through your thoughts.
Write a story. If you have a concept in mind, let loose without fear of judgment. Any ideas, even those scribbled down in a journal, can lead your writing to places you never expected to go.

, A first choice for many stuck in grounding, music has been shown to have such benefits as improving mood and relieving stress. The kind of music you use depends upon your own tastes, and any type of music works. If you have access to a radio or other device that plays music, make use of it.Your first instinct will be to blast out the sound so loud your parents can hear. Avoid getting on their nerves and provoking an argument.
Consider carefully how the music affects you. Any type of music, dependent on personal taste, can lead to good feelings, but if for example that aggressive rap song you like often leads you to feeling angry, avoid it.
If you're a musician, play an instrument. The act of making your own music relieves tension and gives you practice time.

, If you’ve got nothing else to do, here’s an opportunity to at least research an activity you’d like to try. Investigate a pursuit such as cooking and try it out to see if you find it fun. Not only does this fill the time during a grounding, it can be the basis for a hobby you pursue long-term.


If you have Internet access or books on the subject, use these to collect information to figure out which hobby is right for you and how to get started.
Ask your parents for help. They can get you started, even showing you the basics of your hobby if they have any experience. This is even more important for something like cooking if you need permission to touch the stove.

, Your pet is your friend and family, but life is so busy it’s easy to forget to give them attention. They’ll be happy to have you around and you’ll be even happier playing together.Use toys such as danglers for cats. You’ll enjoy the way your pet reacts and gets entertainment out of such a simple activity.
Get down on their level. Roll around with your dog or cat. Let your bird rest on your shoulder. Put your rodent in a rolling ball. Being close to your pet helps you relax.

, You’re stuck inside, but that doesn’t necessarily mean all of your electronic devices are gone. In fact spending more time inside may mean doing the opposite of what you normally do, and for some this means getting more invested in technology. Parents may also allow you to keep devices in your room.


If you have a television, channel flip to find a new movie or show or rewatch an old favorite.
If you have Internet access, search for new hobbies, music, podcasts, or even participate on social media.
Try a video game you have yet to find the time to play.
Use your iPod, radio, or similar device to play music.

, Like playing with your dog, walking your dog is good for you and your dog too. Dogs are supposed to get an hour of daily exercise, but walking also allows the both of you to get outside and see your neighborhood.Take a new route around the neighborhood. Go explore places you haven’t yet had a chance to explore and meet new people.

, Bike riding is a great mode of transportation and exercise. It’ll force you to get away from the temptation of sitting around at home and allow you to work off your frustration of being grounded, even if you're permitted to only ride up and down your street.Ride to a place you haven't been in a while or go find new sites to revisit later. Explore your surroundings.
If permitted, go on a bike ride with your friends or your family. The exercise and company will help you feel better.

, You’ve got an old ball or a jump rope you haven’t touched for years. Recall the days on the playground when you first learned double dutch or organize a game of kickball. Such physical activities lead to better health, the removal of negative feelings, and can be shared with others.


Grab a sibling, a friend, or a parent who isn't busy. The company you keep will increase your enjoyment and give you someone with which you can work off your frustration.
Anyone involved in sports can use this time to practice. A basketball player for instance can practice shooting free throws.
In winter months, transition to winter activities. Get a ball and hockey sticks. Skate around on ice. Bundle up and build a snowman.

, You don’t have to be a budding photographer to take pictures, but stepping outside and doing so allows you to practice your artistic expression while seeing the sights in your area that you usually ignore.Use a cell phone or ask your parents to borrow a camera. Even a cheap, disposable camera will do.
Use your imagination when choosing subjects. It doesn’t matter if you choose to take pictures of flowers, snow formations, or your pet. This is your time and you should choose what captures your eye.
These pictures can be used later. For instance, you can put them into a photo album online or offline or make a collage.

, It’s usual for you to feel upset about being grounded, but taking your anger out on a parent will make you feel more miserable. Go to a room where you can be alone. Avoid contact with your parent until you feel ready to speak to them.


To calm yourself, do an activity or two first. Keeping yourself physically and mentally occupied distracts you and you may even enjoy the activity enough to feel happier.
If possible, you can also choose to talk to a friend during this time. They'll listen to your story and may even give you insight.
Keep in mind that your parent may feel angry too, so give them time to recover.

, Put yourself in your parent’s position and try to understand why you’ve been grounded. Chances are your parents didn’t want to punish you. By understanding why they did, though, you can express more sincere remorse that at the very least establishes better communication that will make you feel happier.Speak your apology out loud. This is difficult to do at times, but a verbal apology carries more weight.
Adopt a proper tone. Keep your voice low, clear, but authentic.
Make your apology meaningful by showing you understand what you did wrong and will do differently next time. Instead of saying you’re sorry for kicking a ball in the house, say, “I’m sorry I broke your lamp. I shouldn’t have been kicking the ball in the house. Next time I’ll play outside so I don’t upset you by breaking the rules.”

, Many parents are open to making a deal. Chances are they have some household chores they haven’t finished. By sparing them the effort, you ingratiate yourself because you’re doing something for them and it makes you look apologetic. The activity and the reduced grounding time will make you feel happier.For example, offer to do the dishes. Your parent may exchange that work for a few days off your grounding time.
Some parents are strict, or the offense you committed too serious to them to be forgiven through deals. You’ll have to deal with this by waiting out the grounding.

, Some parents are more open than others, so use your discretion as to whether or not discussion is beneficial. Those that are willing to listen will be more willing to end your grounding if they believe you understand what you did wrong and have learned from it or at least have a discussion with you that takes away some of your anger and sadness.Discussions should always be calm, quiet, and open. As soon as you resort to anger and screaming, you cause your parent to retreat into their anger and authority. This causes them to extend the grounding and you to feel bad all over again.
Tell them your side of the story and listen to theirs. Chances are you’ll reach a middle ground, erasing hurt feelings and tension in the process.
Strict parents may be concerned with expressing their authority. You may have no choice but to wait out the grounding.

Sports, fashion, parties, movies, sleepovers, your parents, pets, gumball machines? Whatever it is, do these activities joyfully and include your friends.


If you aren't feeling positive about anything, be honest with yourself and decide what you need to fix and make a pact to really try. Once you have tried, you will start loving your life and your friends will notice.;
, Your friends will be attracted by the real you. If they're attracted by you being someone else, it won't last and when you can't keep up the charade, you'll find yourself around the wrong kinds of friends.

, Once you are proud of yourself, it will be easy to be a really cool friend.

, These are the key to being a success with friendships. Have fun with everyone and show kindness to all. Aim to be friends with all people, including your close friends.

, Look past the differences and extend your friendships to many people. You can't be unpopular with a ton of friends, that’s for sure.

, If at a sleepover, do it well. Blast the music and have good food! Be hyper and be fun. No one can turn that down.

, Even if you are really annoyed with a friend or they've been mean to you, stay nice. Learn to forgive and move on. It keeps things light and friendly.

, If you are a clingy person, remind yourself not just to stick to one person, but stick to many of them, to even yourself out. Clingy behavior can drive friends away.

, It's really hard to see your friends getting close to others. Instead of being jealous, think about how you still have your friend and how they will never turn their back on you. If they do, get new friends. Spend time with people you enjoy being around.

, Friends make stupid mistakes all the time and you just gotta accept that. Don't give the silent treatment, cold shoulder or even worse, be mean to them. We are all human. But if they purposely do something that hurts you, in a mean way, then get another friend.

Set goals.,
Have confidence and believe that you will be successful.,
Don’t expect perfection from yourself- or anyone else.,
Have meaningful personal relationships.,
Take care of yourself physically and mentally.,
Watch your finances.",How to Be a Successful Young Woman1," Before you can set yourself on the path of being successful in your personal life, it’s a good idea to set goals for yourself. By tangibly establishing what your aims are in the short, mid, and long terms, you have an easy way to remind yourself of what you’re working towards.


Write your goals on paper. Having a visual cue reminds you of and reinforces your goals. For example, you could write the following: “My short term goal is to find a nice partner and finish my Master’s degree. My mid-term goal is to get engaged and find an exciting job. My long term goal is to get married and have a family while being a successful financial planner.”
Update your goals as you meet them. Once or twice a year, reevaluate your goals to make sure they’re still realistic and attainable.
Setting unrealistic goals will not only cause you unnecessary anxiety, but can also hamper your success and the ability to meet other goals.Consider talking to a therapist about setting personal goals or any anxiety related to them you may have.Know your list of things to do and goals will never be finished and that it’s ok. As you attain your goals and cross items off of your to-do list, you’ll also be adding new items.;
, Two characteristics of a successful person is that they not only have confidence in themselves, but also that they believe in their ability to succeed.By cultivating and projecting confidence in yourself and to others, you set yourself on the path for success.Confidence comes from many sources, including knowing that you have a good education and training, good relationships, or even that you look good. If you are lacking confidence in certain areas, take proactive steps to boost it.
For example, if you don’t feel confident because they your friends are more successful professionally, then work towards garnering more professional success through education or even a promotion. If your appearance leaves you feeling not confident, improve it. Something as simple as revived hair color can do wonders.
It’s important to know that even if you are confident and successful, that failure is a part of the equation.Disappointment and failure are components of success.Even someone like author J.K. Rowling experienced failures before they hit it big.

, As you strive to meet your goals, be confident and believe in your success, it’s important to not expect perfection from yourself or those around you. In fact, trying to be perfect often hampers your ability to perform well and can alienate those around you.Perfectionism doesn’t mean that you’re not trying to be your best, it means you’re reaching towards an unattainable goal.For example, if you are trying to have the “perfect” body, any minor setback may hinder you from enjoying yourself. It’s best to love yourself the way you are and work from there.
Expecting perfection from others can seriously and negatively affect your relationships, even causing them to break., Surrounding yourself with genuine friends and colleagues who will support you through good times and bad is essential to your success.It’s important to maintain these relationships over time to ensure your success and boost your confidence.


Beyond having meaningful relationships with friends, colleagues, and families, it’s also important to have a supportive partner. A partner can instill confidence in you and will support your goals for achieving personal and professional success.
Part of fostering meaningful relationships is that you reciprocate the support and love you receive.
Expressing gratitude is a key feature of having meaningful relationships. It’s important to show anyone who helps you along the way how much you appreciate them., You can’t be successful if you don’t take care of your physical and mental health. Exercise is an excellent way to relieve stress, and increase endorphins and energy.Taking a short walk twice a day will refresh your body and mind.For example, a 3 mile run will give you time to work out personal or professional problems if you need to while providing your body with needed exercise to maintain your health.In a world where you are easily contacted by cell phones, email, and social media, having unplugged alone time is vital to maintaining your health by minimizing how much input you need to process on a daily basis.For example, you can turn off all electronics at 10pm so that you have an hour or two all to yourself or with your family. Another option is exercising, such as going for a walk or run, to have some time alone.

, It is difficult to have personal success if your finances are not in order. By controlling your financial profile, you can not only boost your confidence, but also afford yourself opportunities such as education that may come up.


It’s important to budget. Knowing where your money is coming from and how you’re spending it will help you control your finances more effectively.Part of this equation is using credit wisely and not making impulse buys that you can’t really afford.For example, you wouldn’t want to rent an apartment that cost $1500 per month when you’re only making $2000 per month.
Make sure you’re saving money routinely. If something catastrophic happens, you will need a reserve to get you through the hard times. But you may also want to save it for something special, like a big vacation, which is important to helping you recharge and, if you go with others, connecting with them."

Participate in extracurricular activities.,
Volunteer.,
Use your summer for academic programs and camps.,
Shadow a professional for a field you wish to pursue.",How to Be a Successful Teenager1," Schools give students opportunities for staying active. How you use your time should be up to you. Pick an activity that appeals to you such as athletics, academic clubs, or special-interest clubs. Select one that plays to your interests. Extracurricular activities build character through team work, time management, and competition. Don't be too worried if you aren't very good at what you like. The important thing is passion, which will drive you to put in your best effort.;
, Giving your time to your community is a noble activity with several benefits. Volunteering can teach you job-related skills such as responsibility or time-management. Some schools also reward the learning aspect of volunteer work with credit hours. If you are interested in college, volunteering makes you much more appealing during the application process., Getting a head start at college could mean sacrificing (or shortening) your summer vacation. Various universities offer programs for future college students based on interests such as journalism, photography, art, sports, etc. These programs give teenagers the chance to earn college credit, experience dorm life, and see a university's town.Research different programs. Get all of the details, then figure out which one is the best choice for you.
Check the requirements and deadlines. Avoid getting into trouble because of a simple mistake, and you will have a great time.

, Building a resume, getting experience, and earning letters of recommendation can start at a very young age. A lot of teenagers have a desired career path. Luckily, some professionals allow teenagers to visit offices for some hands-on experience.The non-paid experience can build character and open up future opportunities.


Make phone calls and office visits to find a company willing to allow you to shadow.
Ask family if they know someone whom you can shadow.

Make a plan and set goals.,
Get as much education and training as you can.,
Have confidence and believe that you will be successful professionally.,
Be passionate about what you do.,
Don’t be afraid to take risks.,
Be an effective communicator.,
Foster good working relationships.,
Take breaks- and vacations.",How to Be a Successful Young Woman2," Just as you do for your personal life, you need to set goals for your professional life. By tangibly establishing what your aims are in the short, mid, and long terms, you have an easy way to remind yourself of what you’re working towards. This will also help you formulate a plan to achieve those goals.


Write down your goals on paper. It’s a good idea to have a visual reminder of your goals. For example you could write: “My short term goal is to do an internship as an editor, my mid-term goal is to get a Master’s in English, and my long-term goal is to work as the Editor-in-Chief of Vogue.”
Make sure to update your goals as you meet them. Once or twice a year, reevaluate your goals to make sure they’re still realistic and attainable and set new ones as necessary. It is often useful to discuss these with a colleague or even your boss.
Don’t set unrealistic goals for yourself. This will not only cause you unnecessary anxiety, but can also hamper your ability to meet other goals.For example, if you’re currently working in the mailroom, it’s highly unlikely you will be the CEO within a year. But you can work up from the mailroom to the reception area and then up from that position, for example.
Talking with a senior colleague or trusted supervisor can help allay any concerns or anxiety you may have regarding your career., Having an education and job-related training is integral to being successful professionally.But you also want to make sure that you continue your education and training throughout your career so that you stay valuable to your workplace or are marketable if you choose to change jobs.


There are many ways to get education for your job. It’s a good idea to research the requirements for your chosen profession. For example, if you want to be a university professor, you’ll need a PhD and some training for being in the classroom. If you want to be a wedding planner, on the other hand, you’ll need more on the job education and training than actual degrees.
Training and the type of education that comes from practical experience is also very valuable when you’re marketing yourself professionally. For example, working as an editorial assistant at a magazine can help you get a job as an editor.
Knowing that you have the right education and training is also helpful because it will build your confidence and make you more attractive to employers or potential employers., Two characteristics of a successful person is that they not only have confidence in themselves, but also that they believe in their ability to succeed.By cultivating and projecting confidence in yourself, you set yourself on the path for success not only to yourself, but also to employers.Knowing that you have a good education and training can help boost your confidence. If you are lacking confidence in certain areas, take proactive steps to boost it.
For example, if you don’t feel confident because your colleagues are often promoted over you, then work towards garnering more professional success through education or even a promotion. Talking to your boss or another colleague about how to improve your performance is also an excellent idea.
It’s important to know that even if you are confident and successful, that failure is a part of the equation.Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs experienced failures before they found success.

, You can’t be truly successful unless you are passionate about your profession. If you don’t love your job, you’re less likely to go above and beyond for success.Your job will feel like chore if you don’t love it. This will make you more likely to be sloppy in your assignments and not take any initiative that would help you succeed., Changing your professional course to put yourself on the path to success requires taking some risk. However, this doesn’t mean making reckless decisions, rather that you should take a calculated risk.The idea is to take a calculated risk, not something that could ultimately hinder your goals. For example, maybe you love your current workplace, but have hit the glass ceiling. When an opportunity for a promotion at another company comes up, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of taking the job and assess how much risk the switch could have on you personally and professionally. Either way you decide, you’re taking a calculated risk.

, As the work place increasingly shifts towards more team-based work, greater customer contact, more diversity, and ever-higher employee expectations, the ability to effectively and positively communicate with colleagues is absolutely integral to your professional success. Being an effective communicator demands everything from being a good listener to being polite and having the ability to express your gratitude.Be a good listener to anyone associated with you professionally. The ability to listen to someone’s needs or problems will not only help cultivate your relationship with the person, but also may help your own goals down the road.
Always be polite to people, even if they aren’t. The truism “you win more bees with honey than vinegar” is something you can apply to your professional life. Leaving a bad impression on colleagues or associates can have lasting consequences for you professionally.Being polite extends to when you have to deliver bad news to someone professionally. For example, if you have to fire someone, say something positive to the person, followed by the negative, and then sandwich that in without another bit of positive feedback.
Express gratitude to your colleagues. The ability to recognize when someone has supported you is important to maintaining good working relationships. Not only will it make the person feel appreciated and show them that you respect their contributions, but you will gain personal capital among your colleagues.

, Without having positive working relationships with colleagues at all of your jobs, you cannot be successful. It’s thus important to maintain and expand your professional support system over time.


Part of fostering good working relationships is networking. Having a broad network of colleagues and even professional friends on whom you can rely will serve you professionally not only in your current job, but also among former colleagues or those you may have down the road.Having a mentor who has experience in your profession is a good idea. She can provide you valuable guidance from everything on taking risks, to dealing with colleagues, or improving your skills.Don’t expect perfection your colleagues- or yourself. This can seriously and negatively affect your working relationships, and you’re your professional success.Know that it’s also acceptable to be wrong, especially if it means maintaining a professional relationship. This shows that you’re the bigger person., Having time away from your job for everything from ten minutes a day to a full vacation is important to your success as well. Time away refreshes you, helps you avoid burn out, and can reset you on your path to success.Take breaks during the day. They give your brain and body a chance to relax and refresh.Schedule annual vacations to further help you refresh. While a ten-minute walk or a run will help you decompress throughout a workday, an annual vacation where you completely unplug from your job will refresh your body and mind.

Set goals.,
Understand and build your credit score.,
Continue your education.,
Build strong relationships.",How to Be a Successful Teenager2," One aspect of becoming successful is to look forward in life. Making and meeting goals motivates you to progress. An important aspect about setting goals is getting organized and assessing your interests. Speak with a parent or a mentor, like a school counselor, for assistance - guidance is very helpful.


Ask yourself important questions such as What do I enjoy doing?, ""What do I want to be good at?"", or ""Where do I see myself five to ten years from now?
Do some research to see what it takes to reach that goal.
Learn how to break it down into mini-goals that are reached as you progress., Your credit score is the measurement of how trustworthy you are to agencies that determine loans you receive, allow you to live in their apartment complex, or decide your interest rate. Even though getting a credit card at a young age can be on the hands of a parent, it is up to the teenager to use it correctly and understand that it's not just money on a card; it is a promise between the teenager and a third party.Know that credit is a revolving pattern; use a credit card for something you wish to purchase and pay off in a self-managed time frame.
Using a credit card takes responsibility and discipline; these characteristics also build other good habits., The average teenager goes through two major educational milestones: graduating from high school and graduating from college. Teenagers go through different phases, and education is often put aside. However, in order to be successful, education should be viewed as an investment for the future and a tool to show teenagers how to be inquisitive.Moreover, a better education can lead to more work opportunities, so be sure to pursue what fits your goals and interests.

, Teenagers go through a lot of change, and these changes can transform relationships quickly and abruptly. Being a successful teenager means knowing how to pursue a good relationship, one where there is the chance for both fun and future. Evaluate your current relationship. Make sure your maturity level and interests are leveled. Be there for each other which will mean learning how to make compromises and being selective of battles.."

Get a job.,
Track your expenses.,
Save money.,
Control impulse buying.",How to Be a Successful Teenager3," Having your own job builds positive character and will help you mature. Even if parents give you money, earning your own paycheck puts you on a path to success by giving you the opportunity to learn time management, job responsibility, leadership skills, team work, and life skills in the real world.Also, earning your own paycheck puts money in your pockets, and what you do with your earnings is up to you.

, Allowances, gifts, and paychecks will be your sources of income as a teenager. Learning to manage money starts with tracking how you spend that income. Create a money diary where you write down all of your spending for a given time period, either weekly, monthly, or yearly. Then, evaluate what you spend by deciding what is needed (such as gas, car insurance, phone bill) and what is entertainment (such as movie tickets, personal items, going out). Creating this diary will help you visualize where your money goes and can set you on the track to create a budget and savings., Once you earn money, it is very tempting to use it immediately. And as a teenager, it is easy to neglect saving money. In order to be more successful, learn that money can be saved for more-important spending opportunities. To help you save, open up a bank account. Banks can give many opportunities to teenagers. Get advice and research first before opening any accounts. Once you have one, figure out a monthly budget that will help you put aside money.When you start off, more than likely a co-signer or parent will have access to your account activity. Use this as a learning opportunity and ask for them to keep you in check of what you spend.

, Buying is almost always easier than saving. Small purchases can take a toll on your savings, and more often than not, those purchases could have been avoided. These impulse purchases are difficult for both teenagers and adults, so controlling these impulses at a young age helps ensure better money management throughout your life.Put yourself to the test and wait to buy items. Oftentimes, giving yourself a week will show you that you didn't really need the item, or the item would have been put on sale.

Become more independent.,
Learn how to use several forms of transportation.,
Travel more often.,
Know when to ask for help and advice.",How to Be a Successful Teenager4," Independence is very important to a teenager. It comes as a necessity over time, but when teenagers start off being independent, it usually comes as a privilege from your parents. Figure out your home dynamics, and offer areas where your independence becomes helpful to your household: for example, cooking your meals, cleaning up after yourself, taking care of younger siblings, asking for less supervision, getting a part-time job, etc. As you gain more responsibility and independence, be aware that failure might occur and is to be expected. Learning from failure, however, will help you to grow., Getting from place to place does not always mean driving, but as a teenager, driving is a huge step in responsibility and independence. Be sure to take any courses and means to obtain a driver's license. Also, driving is not the only way to get around. Cities have public transportation that can be both cheap and accessible for teenagers. Learn the routes needed to get you from place to place. It will teach you time management and patience.

, As you grow up, your city gets smaller, and the world gets bigger. Family vacations help you explore certain regions, but taking on world travel also helps build responsibility and independence. A younger person has more outlets to travel by such as study abroad, language exchange, or volunteer programs. If you have family in distant places, reconnect with a summer visit. The chance to travel gives experiences that build great character., Being responsible and independent does not mean being alone. Taking on new tasks and meeting goals will be hard work. Asking people for help shows maturity and confidence. Seek advice from parents, older siblings, mentors at work, teachers, or someone whom you trust. Opening up channels of communication at a young age is a great habit for success."

Use common sense.,
Be friendly.,
Learn to deal with rude people.,
Be assertive, but refuse to be rude when doing so.",How to Be a Mature Preteen Online," Bullying is the number one sign of immaturity. Sometimes it can take time to learn to deal with conflicts effectively, but learning to restrain from bullying other people online will help you seem more mature online and will also help you in the long run. A good way to start out is by figuring out what qualifies as bullying. Think about online bullying in your own terms, not someone else. Bullying means something different to everyone, but in general it means being mean in any way.


If you feel tempted to bully someone online, think of tactics to help you restrain. Distance yourself as much as possible from the person bothering you, take a deep breath, and step away from the keyboard to calm down.
Think before you post. Be sure to be as kind as possible, and don't write a message when you're angry. If it will help you release some of your anger, it's okay to type a mean message to someone. Just make sure you don't post it. If you are about to post a message, think about what it says and how those words could be interpreted before you post.
If you are the one being bullied, realize that it's not your fault. Often people bully because they have low self-esteem. So don't beat yourself up about it. Just ignore, save it, or tell an adult.;
, To adults, there is nothing more annoying than improper grammar and/or spelling on the internet. Remember that even when you're doing something as inconsequential as commenting on a YouTube video, or something as important as writing a wikiHow article, proper capitalization, spelling and a general good use of the English language will always help you seem more mature. If you aren't a good speller, don't let it be an excuse. Use a free online spell checker.


Proofread before making a post online. Sometimes, you might accidentally make an error in spelling, grammar and/or punctuation, so proofreading is exceedingly helpful.

, If you've been around a site for a while, try to find ways that you can help people out. If they're new, take an interest in them and help them learn the ropes of being included on the site. If someone who's been around even longer than you needs an extra pair of hands setting up a page or conquering a level of game, be the one who helps them out. Helping people out is not only a good way to show everyone that you're mature, but it's also a great way to gain new skills both online and offline.

, When people are insecure, they often feel the need to show off how good they are at the little things. When you do this, it often just comes off as immature. Let your accomplishments speak for themselves. If you work hard and improve at whatever you're doing, you won't need to brag because people will know who you are anyway. When you brag, you develop a reputation as annoying and full of yourself, but when you're modest and hardworking, you will eventually earn the reputation you wanted in the first place.

, In general, your gut reaction to things is the right reaction. Sometimes your personal thoughts can fog your common sense, but if you try to see through to your common sense you'll realize that in general if you think something is wrong, it probably is. If you think something is dangerous, it probably is. And if you think it's wrong or dangerous, don't do it!

, Even when other people aren't kind to you, you should always be kind to them. When you think about the way you react to other people's immaturity, you might realize that your reactions are taken the same way. By being more mature, even when it's annoying and hard to accomplish, it will always make you feel good about yourself and portray you as mature.

, In the same way that there are rude people offline, there are plenty of rude people online as well. If you receive a rude message, step away from your computer and take a few minutes to calm down before deciding how you should respond. Never respond rudely; always be polite in your responses.

Understand that sometimes no response is the best response. Sometimes it's better not to reply at all than to send a rude reply (even a polite one wouldn't do the trick).

, Always stand your ground and be firm in your points, yet polite."

Watch what you wear.,

Watch the way you act.,
Be nice.,
Treat your parents well.",How to Be a Mature Preteen," A huge part of maturity is being respectful to them, and they know what's best for you. For instance, when your mom tells you to clean your room, don't argue - just do it. Also, the next time your Dad tells you to do your homework, just do it, because you know he's telling you that because he loves you and wants the best for you. If you disagree with your parents' views or do not think they are fair, calmly think up a reasoned argument (debate) but do not just shout.


Do not argue with them. Arguing is a sign of immaturity, and thus should not be done if you'd like to be mature. If you disagree with their point, debate your point calmly but take their point in mind as well.;
, Part of being mature is being dependable. Your teachers are like your parents (they want you to do well), so make an effort to do well in school. Here are a few parts of being a good student:



Study for exams. Studying will highly improve your chances of passing a test, and your test grade could affect your overall grade in a certain class. Be sure to review your notes before the test, so that you have everything memorized. Do not rush your studying; take your time.

Take good notes. Taking good notes assists you in retaining essential information, and if you do so, it will also improve your chances of passing a test. Organize your notes by subject in your school binder, or use a notebook exclusively for them. Using one of these two methods will make them easier to find.
Get ahead in school. Put all your effort into learning while you're at school. Be attentive and diligent in class. It's tempting to try to make jokes in class and talk to your friends, but in all honesty, think about which is going to matter most in 20 years. For instance, think about what is more important: your grades in high school, or the fact that you made funny jokes in 6th/7th grade?

, Join in with activities both in school and out.

, Having good manners is another essential part of maturity. People enjoy being around people who are pleasant to be around. Here are some simple ways to have good manners:


Look people in the eye when speaking to them. If you look people in the eye whenever you are talking to them, they will know that you are talking to them. You should also make sure to look them in the eye whenever they are speaking to you - this shows that you are listening to them.
Chew with your mouth closed. If you are chewing food, and you happen to open your mouth, others will be able see the bits of food that you chewed.
Don't talk with food in your mouth.
Don't put your elbows on the table while eating.

Be polite. Always thank people for rides, meals, and other tasks. Also, be sure to maintain a polite vocabulary - this will show others that you are respectful and mature. For example, instead of saying ""Can I ____?"" say ""May I please ____?""
Think before you speak. When you feel the urge to say something, think about the way your comments could be interpreted before you say it - this shows mature judgement. If you say anything that might be offensive to other people, for instance, they will probably feel hurt/offended and be mad at you for making the remark.

, Don't be dependent on your parents for your issues. Take care of your responsibilities, as this is a sign of maturity. If you have a problem, think it through calmly (have you or someone you know been in a situation like this before. What did they do). Don't panic and get overly upset as then it is harder to find a solution and you may appear immature.

, If you do things you shouldn't do, you might appear immature for breaking rules.

, Good hygiene is a key part of maturity - no one wants to be around someone else with bad hygiene. Here are some parts of being hygienic:


Keep yourself as clean as you can and bathe or shower often. Be sure to wash parts of your body that need washing, such as your hair and face. Looking presentable is important, especially in public.
Maintain your appearance. If you're going out in public, for instance, be sure to wear appropriate clothes for the outing. For example, do not wear a casual outfit to work if it is not appropriate clothing.
Eliminate body odors. Shower often, use soap, and apply deodorant when needed. Body odors might cause others to think you ""smell"", and that certainly isn't good or mature.

, If you offer a hand on tasks, such as washing a huge pile of dishes, laundry that you know your grandmother can't do, anything, you're bound to raise your chances of adults knowing that you are mature.

, Think before you do. Think from other's points of view so that you can find the best solution for everyone/ do the right thing.

, In that situation you should have a quiet debate, not a shout-fest.

, If you hear someone say that, don't think, ""Wow, that is the most immature person I've ever seen!"".

, That is one of the most immature things someone can do. Mature people are humble. Remember, you have to ""be"" mature, not ""act"" mature.

, Everyone, even adults, whine and don't even know it. Sometimes, it just comes out. When we are disappointed, it is almost natural to whine, but doing so will make you look immature and bratty. You'll look older and more sophisticated if you remain calm and don't throw a fit/tantrum.

, Think of all the mature examples you have in your life. Most of them are leaders, right? When you grasp the leadership quality, people look up to you, which makes you seem more mature.

, Others have mature impressions of well groomed and decently dressed people. Here are a few basics:


Avoid wearing short shorts, belly button showing tops, and extra high hairdos. If you're going for a more mature look, wear darker, more subdued colors. This doesn't mean you have to be completely macabre or emo. Instead of wearing neon orange, consider wearing more of an autumnal orange.
If you love wearing bright colors, feel free to wear them. Adults wear them all the time! However, be sure to be moderate in this; never look like a rainbow barfed on your wardrobe. Instead, wear one very bright piece and let the other parts of the outfit complement it.
When you are going for a shape, mature shapes have geometric cuts, complex design, and pretty but sensible design. Your tees should not have immature slogans on them, or ridiculous busy patterns. If you wear them, they just make you look like a rude little kid that doesn't know what he/she is doing.

, Cussing doesn't make you cool; it makes you sound young, foolish, and even immature (which is the total opposite of your goal). Erase swear words from your vocabulary, and replace them with more proper, interesting words.


For example, lexicon, which, in short, is a vocabulary, group of words or dictionary. Look for words that will make you sound smarter. If you have the time, actually read the dictionary. This might sound ridiculous but the dictionary isn't hard to read, it will obviously boost your vocabulary, the dictionary actually contains factual information that may help you in other aspects of life, and it is very impressive to be a child who has read the dictionary.
Be wary that your words have power. The things you say can bring certain people up but they can also bring them crashing down.
Never gossip. Try your hardest to never say anything bad about anyone. Gossip is a thing that poorly educated people do. They do this when they have no lives themselves to speak about and rely on other people's misfortune for their conversational skills. Gossip causes people to hate, and mistrust each other, and you don't want to be that way. You don't want to be known as the school's motormouth, and if you speak cruelly about other people, they are bound to speak cruelly in retaliation. If your friends gossip try to change the subject, if they only talk about other people then maybe you need to hang out with a different crowd.

, Be more responsible in the things you do. Accept the consequences if you did something wrong, and apologize (since that's a mature thing to do). Most people who make mistakes find that they could have avoided them if they listened to some of the most basic rules their parents taught them!


Understand that your parents are only going to give you as much responsibility that you can handle. The less responsible you are, the fewer things they are going to let you do. If you want more responsibility, try to do more around the house, or just more for people in general. Volunteer, babysitter, shovel snow, do the dishes, etc. and your parents will be a lot more obliging to you.

, If your sibling starts crying, don't hit him/her. Comfort him/her, or just walk away. Talk to your parents if he or she is seriously bugging you, but always keep calm. Yelling or throwing a tantrum might make you seem immature.

, Oftentimes, you and them will disagree, but they have the upper hand. You will comply, be it the easy way or the hard way.


Make the smart choice -- be calm and rational with your parents when you discuss your disagreements. If you do this, and they still are bent on their decision, say ""OK"" and walk away. Even if it isn't the best thing to do (to you), and you're mad, keep it together. This will show them that you can handle disappointment with grace and maturity. Your parents are the gatekeeper of how much freedom you have. Treat them well and you'll be dually rewarded in time.

Realize that you are not your stigma.,
Redefine your identity position in your own terms.,
Focus on other aspects of you.,
Have positive mental reminders.,
Have confidence in your abilities.",How to Cope With Stigma1," When you woke up this morning, did you or your stigma brush your teeth? Did you or your stigma cook dinner last night? Do your family and friends love you or your stigma? That's right: they're two entirely separate things. When people that really care about you look at you, they see you as a person. So when you look at yourself, you should see “you,” too.;
, It’s important to keep in mind that identity positions are not static. We all have some degree of freedom in positioning ourselves as one type of identity or another, regardless of how we are treated by others.


Spend some time on your own to identify what you really enjoy doing.
Make a list of your positive qualities. These can include your mannerisms, behaviors, and beliefs.Make a list of your characteristics that you could work on.For example, you might write, “I usually shy away from confrontation and I cave in too easily to other people’s demands.”
Make a list of what you’d like to change about yourself and what you need to do to achieve these changes. For example, if you don’t want to cave in so easily to other people’s demands, you might write, “I want to learn to be more assertive.” Then, you might take an assertiveness training workshop.
These steps will help you conceive of yourself in a way that doesn’t immediately put your stigma in the foreground.

, Your stigma might be a part of who you are and the challenges you have to deal with in this life, but they don't define you as a person. People in wheelchairs can still go skydiving. People who are hard of hearing can still hold conversations. They just have to learn a different way of doing things, but this does not stop them from living fulfilling lives.


Whether the reasons for your stigma are visible or not, this is doable. A visible set of conditions would be being in a wheelchair or blind. An invisible issue would be HIV, renal disease, MS, or anything that doesn't immediately draw attention. Underneath your “condition,” however, you still exist. Your sense of humor, your wit, your smile and other aspects about you can hog the spotlight.
Spend some extra time practicing the activities you excel at. This will help other people see you in a different light.

, When you are managing your stigma, it can seem like a very difficult task. It can be helpful to have some sort of mental reminder or mantra that will help refocus your attention away from what’s bothering you in the present.


For example, imagine a person or place that makes you happy. Or, remind yourself that not everyone is ignorant about your stigma. Remind yourself about the supportive people in your life.
When it comes to your own thoughts, pay attention to whether they are mostly negative or positive. If you can’t accept who you are, it will make it more difficult for people around you to do so.

, Never think there's something you can't do because of a disability. Try out new hobbies or activities. If you have physical trouble doing something, such as playing basketball, find a wheelchair basketball league. Having a positive attitude and trying new things are good first steps in building your confidence.

, Missing the bus makes you late for class and forces your parents to drive you to school. Wake up on time and have a backup plan that doesn’t involve your parents.


Don’t use the snooze button. Don’t risk sleeping through the subsequent alarms. Any sleep gained through the snooze function is not quality sleep.
Set the alarm for the last possible moment. Eradicate the ability to snooze or dawdle by setting your alarm so that you only have just enough time to prepare for school and reach the bus.
Get a loud alarm. The alarm needs to be loud enough so that you don’t ignore it while sleeping. Rain or other ambient noises will also mask low alarm volumes.
Move the alarm out of reach. Place the alarm across the room to force yourself to stand up and walk to turn it off., Paying careful attention earns understanding. You’ll need little help outside of the classroom if you do everything you can to pay attention.


Sit in the front of class. It is easier to pay attention and harder to slack off if you are at the front of the classroom. Ask the teacher if you can move closer to the front if you have assigned seating arrangements.
Sit up straight. Proper posture increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain, keeping you alert.

, Writing down notes helps reinforce information in your memory and helps you follow the lesson. Typing notes also works - ask your teacher if devices such as laptops are allowed.

, There is no shame in asking a question if you need clarification on a topic. Ask the teacher after class if the question is complex, or if you don't want to ask during class., Homework reinforces the information you were taught in class and builds the research and review skills that are important all throughout life. Make homework a priority when you return from class.


Do homework at the same time every day. Regiment your homework so that it becomes a part of your routine – you’ll approach homework with less trepidation.

, Prioritize your school work, including homework and projects, based on due dates and the amount of work required.


Write them in a planner if necessary. Larger work, such as book reports, require a longer, structured approach.

, Use car or bus rides, lunch or other breaks in routine to squeeze in extra work. Even briefly reviewing your notes can help you prepare for homework or tests.

, Look into whether your school offers study group sign ups or after-class tutoring. If you can attend, both help test your knowledge and shore up any lack of understanding you have. Studying with local friends also helps, but make sure you stay on task., Chores aren’t meant to punish you! Your parents do a lot to keep food on the table and a roof over your head. Look at chores as a way of thanking your parents for what they do for you every day. It takes work out of their hands and gives them some rest.


Write down your chore list on a piece of paper or spreadsheet and hang it somewhere as a reminder. This helps keep the chores on your mind throughout the week.
Make a game out of chores. Gamifying chores helps provide the motivation needed to get the task in question done. Several cell phone apps now exist that help manage tasks such as chores while providing a fun sense of progression when you complete your goal., Cooking is a time-consuming, multi-step process that can always benefit from an extra hand or two. Help cut vegetables, boil the water or even read the recipe.


Pick a day or two out of the week to take care of the entirety of dinner. Even if your cooking skills aren't polished, your family will appreciate a work-free meal.

, Be mindful of the mess you make around the house and strive to keep tidy. There are numerous small ways of keeping clean that can add up.


Close the toilet seat lid when done. Clean up any mess that may have occurred at this time.
Keep your dirty clothes in the hamper or a specified clothes bin. Clothes strewn about the floor are uncleanly and contribute to an overall untidy room. They can also obstruct movement and cause tripping or other hazardous accidents.
Clean your dishes when you are done with them. If you have a dishwasher, rinse your dishes and place them in the dishwasher as soon as you are finished.
Put items back where they belong. Return books, magazines, television remotes and any item not strictly yours back where you found it when you are done.

, Cats and dogs require a high level of care and attention. Share the responsibility of watching over them by feeding them, walking them or cleaning up after them as necessary.


Combine pet responsibilities with your chore list if it helps you remember to perform them.
Remember that while a room can stay dirty for an extra day, an animal’s needs cannot be postponed.

, Opt for a simple but stylish appearance if your parents still help pay for your clothes. Designer brands are particularly expensive and burdensome if you have siblings who need clothes as well.


Purchase accessories for their purpose, not their looks. Items such as bags or purses perform the same, no matter how they look.
Grooming items such as deodorant and makeup are also available for cheap, without sacrificing quality. Visit your local drugstore and test for quality before purchasing.

, Bike, walk or bus to your destination to save your parents the trouble of constantly driving you places. Ask your friends who drive if you can catch a ride from time to time. That’s what friends are for!


Many cities have bike lanes for commuting. Check with your state’s Department of Transportation website to map out where bike lanes are available near you. Be careful when planning – some areas or routes only partially support bike lanes. Always wear your helmet.
Bus routes are available on your state’s Department of Transportation website. Make sure you bring enough money to cover fare. Pay attention to bus schedules – don’t miss the last bus that runs for the day.
Use the metro if available in your city. A combination of metro and bus travel can take you far, provided you have the proper fare. Pay attention to the metro schedule. Like the bus, the metro stops running at certain hours of the day.
Download a route planner app. These apps help you plan out which public transportation to take for greatest efficiency and are conveniently located on your cell phone.

, Family plans are available from many carriers and often a great value for your whole family. Charge your phone overnight so that you can always use it when necessary. Store important numbers in your cellphone in the event of an emergency. Some numbers to include:


Your family members.
The local police department.
The local fire company.
Poison control.
Your doctor.
Nearby hospitals.
Teachers.
Friends., A part-time job offers extra spending money while keeping you out of trouble. Make sure your job fits your existing schedule and transportation capabilities.


Don’t work more than 15 to 20 hours a week at your job. Leave enough time for your academic responsibilities.
Know the work rules of your age group. If you are 14 or 15 years old, you may work only three hours or less on school days and only between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
Teens 16 and over may work unlimited hours, but are barred from working jobs deemed hazardous by the Secretary of Labor (such as construction).
Let your employer know of your scheduling requirements prior to taking the job to make sure the job is a good fit., Alcohol, weed and other drugs cost money and impact your mental and cognitive faculties, even if for a brief time. Don’t allow bullying or peer pressure to cause you to make decisions that are not your own.


Turn to resources such as D.A.R.E. if you feel pressured by the presence of drugs at your school or neighborhood.Tell your parents or teachers if others are pressuring you to engage in drug-related activities.

, Sports are a great way of blowing off steam and getting exercise, provided they can fit into your scheduling and transportation capabilities. Other clubs, such as band or chess, can help you meet like-minded individuals who can relate to the challenges life throws your way.

, Being a teen is hard! There will be moments when the pressure of school, your friends, your parents and your future become difficult to handle. Remember to step back and de-stress to regain your composure.


Take a walk. Go outside, get some fresh air and give your brain a break from all that stress.
Meditate. Deep breathing and mindful thinking help reduce stress while putting you in touch with how you are feeling in the moment.
Make a change. Determine if a particular item is causing you stress. Change how you approach that item, or remove it entirely if possible."

Keep to yourself at school functions.,
Sit alone at lunch.,
Keep to yourself during physical education.,
Avoid starting conversations with people.,
Focus on your interests.,
Choose classes that let you be independent.",How to Be a Loner in School1," If you have to go to school functions, like a pep rally or assembly, sit by yourself if you can. Sit at the back of the room if possible. You may want to put on headphones and listen to music, read a book, or play on your phone.If you can, try to get out of going to school functions. But don’t skip it if you are going to get in trouble.;
, Lunch is one of the most common times during the school day where people socialize. However, if you want to be a loner, you should sit alone if you can. Try sitting at a table by yourself or on the floor, if your school allows that. If you cannot sit in an area by yourself, sit at the end of a table with people you don't know.


Find solitary activities to do during lunch. For example, you can draw, read, or listen to music.
If your school will allow it, go to the library or a teacher's classroom where you can eat lunch alone.
If your school has open lunch, you can go up town to restaurants and other places to eat lunch or you can go home if you live close to the school.

, P.E. is another time during the school day where people try to talk to you and get you involved. Keep to yourself during P.E. If you have a choice of activity, consider walking, running, or lifting weights alone. If you are allowed, put on your headphones and listen to music.


If your teacher makes you participate with others, do what you have to to do well in the class. Play basketball or volleyball on the team, but don't go out of your way to talk to people.
If your teacher will allow you to, sit on the bleachers or off to the side whenever you can.

, Loners keep to themselves and don’t go out of their way to talk to other students. This means you wouldn’t go up to someone and start talking to them, or join in a conversation when you’re in a group. Instead, you should keep to yourself.If someone speaks directly to you, don’t be read. Answer the question, but don’t follow up or ask the person a question in return.

, One way to be a loner in school is to engage in your interests during the day. This may mean taking classes you are interested in, like art or music classes. Spend your down time at school doing things you like., When you are choosing elective classes, choose ones that will let you work independently or that don't require group activities. Some classes that may let you be independent include computer or technology classes, shop classes, art classes,music classes, or foreign language classes. You may also want to take sports classes that allow you to exercise alone, like weight lifting or cross-country.


Since you are a loner, you wouldn't want to take drama or chorus classes. Independent vocal or instrumental music lessons such as piano are a better class to take.

Only disclose what you want to disclose.,
Talk with family and friends about visible stigmas.,
Decide how much you want to disclose with invisible stigmas.,
Think about your goals in talking about invisible stigma with someone.,
Decide how to share your personal information.,
Educate others on your identity.",How to Cope With Stigma2," There are laws in the U.S. that protect you from being required to disclose your disability status, sexual orientation, and other identifiers at places like school, work and so on. If you have a stigma because of a hidden disability or another reason, you should not feel forced to disclose anything at all if you choose not to.


For example, when you are applying for a job, you do not need to disclose any disability or stigma. If you choose to do so, your information is required to be treated confidentially and respectfully., If you feel comfortable doing so, you can talk with people in your life about your visible stigmas. Visible stigmas are those that are immediately noticeable to other people such as being in a wheelchair or being blind. Often visible stigmas require strategies that relate to managing the conversation about the stigma. In this way, you can facilitate a safe yet open discussion.


Start with people closest to you in order to become more comfortable talking about such issues in your preferred manner. Then, if you feel like you want to talk with acquaintances or strangers about the stigma, you have some experience with the types of questions that people may ask.
Don’t feel pressured to talk about your stigma. It is a personal decision that should be made by you and you alone.
Talking about visible stigma can sometimes be pretty complex. This is due to the immediate social awkwardness that can accompany another person’s prejudices., When you experience stigma around something invisible, such as sexual orientation or having a non-visible health condition, think about how you want to talk with other people about it. Managing invisible stigma is an ongoing process. But it’s best for any stigmatized person to persistently experiment with different ways of talking about or ignoring their unique conditions in order to find a comfortable zone of personal disclosure with others. , When figuring out how much you want to share with someone else, consider what you hope to achieve with talking about it. Do you want the other person to stop making comments about depression, for example? Do you want the other person to be more understanding of gay people?

, Once you’ve considered your goals and how much information you want to share, think about how you might actually share. Experiment with different communication techniques and mediums in order to achieve these goals in different cases.


For example, your goal is simply to inform another person of your traditionally stigmatized situation. But you hope to avoid any possible negative consequences that might result from such a disclosure. It might be best to send an email or written letter that describes the details of the situation. In this way, you can share information while producing a minimal amount of psychological stress.

, Being able to throw out statistics can defuse a sticky situation. For example, if someone you know is spouting off about how depression ""isn't real,” let them know that depression is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15-44. If education on mood disorders were available for people like them, suicide rates might be lower.

Let go of what you can’t control.,
Walk away if you must.",How to Cope With Stigma3," Initially it'll take guts, but asking for assistance is a sly way to make others feel comfortable around you. This will thus alleviate the stigma. After all, it's usually the other person’s comfort that's the issue, rather than hate or fear. The other person just may not know how to act. He feels awkward about not knowing what do or say. When you give him the go-ahead, he can breathe a sigh of relief. And you thought you were the only one feeling the strife!


If you're in a wheelchair, ask the other person to open the door for you, since you have trouble reaching the latch. If you're dyslexic, ask the other person if everything in your text message is spelled right. These tactics will break the ice just like in any normal, day-to-day conversation.

, Asking for assistance can open up the subject, but not every identity position needs extra help from others. Practice opening up the subject directly.


Try saying something like, ""You're probably wondering how I lost my leg/got a stutter/knew I was gay/got cancer. At least, most people do. I usually tell them...."" This lets the other person know that he can ask questions, since most people are naturally curious.
Some stigmatized individuals use jokes as a means to break the ice in such situations, as well as to gauge the degree of sensitivity the other person has to their unique conditions. Most times, however, merely talking directly, warmly and openly is a great way to reduce awkwardness, even if the person across from you had negative perceptions of you to begin with., This technique involves a person who understands that others may feel uncomfortable because they don't understand the issue or how to act around it. This is the technique that leads both parties to feeling adjusted and comfortable.


When using this technique, don't automatically assume that the other person is judging you. It may be that this person is uninformed about your stigma. Be patient and open about the subject. Give the other person the benefit of the doubt.
For example, if a person is unsure how to act around you because you're in a wheelchair, give them some suggestions on how you need help, or what you can do for yourself.

, There are two general techniques often used by people dealing with stigma that you should avoid. The ""avoidant"" technique and ""comfort zone"" technique can actually be harmful.



Avoidant technique. This stigmatized person is just that: avoidant. He avoids new social situations with people who don't know about his unique conditions. This is done to avoid awkward conversations and possible rejection. This person ends up isolated and often lonely because new connections are impossible to make.

Comfort zone technique. The stigmatized person stays within one group of people and one group of places at all times. He is only comfortable interacting with people that he knows will approve of him. Because of this, he never takes opportunities or has new experiences. Possible rejection is just too scary.

, Remember that some people’s reactions to you are not out of hate. Instead, it’s a lack of understanding. For many people, it's hard to remember that other people are fighting a battle, too. It's easy to write off this person as ignorant, mean, or just plain dumb. Though you're dealing with the brunt of it, take a step back and realize that most people you're dealing with are unsure of what to say or do. As a result, they probably feel uncomfortable.


Most people do mean well, but they just don't know how to behave. When they are at a loss, many of them choose to make a graceful exit instead of possibly doing the wrong thing. It's difficult to not take this personally. The only thing you can do is use the ""support others"" technique to prevent it from happening.

, If you feel comfortable doing so, you can try to alleviate some of the tension around the stigma by making jokes. This can be incredibly difficult to do at first, but the more you practice, the easier and more comfortable it will become.


If you can sense that someone is a little on edge or wants to broach the topic, relieve them of their woes and do it for them. Poke fun of yourself to show them that it's okay. Chuckle and say, ""Gosh, I am just too gay to carry this suitcase. Could you do it for me?"" Or, when you go to grab that yogurt from the cafeteria line, shout, ""Here comes meals on wheels!"" This can quickly break any tension.

, If you've opened up the topic, you'll probably get a good feel for just how much the person wants to know. Some people will be content knowing when it started and what it's like, while others will want you to delve into the nitty gritty.


When the questions start slowing down, just change the topic. After all, you've plenty of other things to talk about! Talking about many things will help the person realize that your unique qualities don’t take away from you being a multi-dimensional person. It'll also show her that the issue isn't obligatory to talk about because it's not the elephant in the room. It's no big deal and it’s just one topic you two can talk about. Ask the other person about her hobbies and interests. She needs the spotlight too!
If you don’t feel comfortable talking about everything, that’s fine too. Don’t feel forced into talking about something you don’t want to talk about. Cultivating boundaries around these topics and you will start learning how to tell people you’d rather not discuss it. Most people will be respectful of your wishes.

, For the record, there will likely always be those people who are not okay talking about difficult topics such as social stigma and marginalized groups. Odds are if you've been dealing with stigmatized social conditions for a while, you know automatically who those people are.


For these people, it's probably best not to waste your energy. Interact with them how you must, but be sure to surround yourself with people who are more tolerant and self-assured.

, Some people are going to judge you unfairly no matter what. When you realize that you have no control over their feelings or behaviors, you can actually be liberated from any sense of guilt or responsibility associated with their feelings. Try to accept the things you have control over and let go of what you don’t have control over.

, Unfortunately, there are plenty of people in this world who are purely intolerant, unwilling to listen, and full of hate and fear. If life takes an unfortunate turn and you wind up dealing with one of these miserable people, walk away. There is no point in stooping to their level. You're better than that.


As you're walking away, remind yourself that this person is likely incredibly insecure. He takes his own dislike of himself and project it onto others. He may be so uncomfortable with who his is that it's unlikely he'll be comfortable with anyone else.

Consider trying mental health therapy.,
Join a support group.,
Get help for related conditions.,
Try stress reduction techniques.",How to Cope With Stigma4," No person should fight their battles alone. Dealing with feeling stigmatized means that not only are you having to handle something the world deems as unacceptable, but you have to deal with the world on top of it. It can be quite a weight on your shoulders. Because of this, consider starting therapy. Millions of people try it, and millions of people are helped every year.


Find a mental health counselor in your area by searching the American Psychological Association’s Psychologist Locator. You can also ask friends or family for referrals.

, If therapy isn't up your alley, consider joining a support group. Having a network of like-minded, sympathetic individuals can have a similar effect to that of therapy. You'll have a platform to talk about your stigma and the issues that arise from it. You will gather strength from those around you. You may be able to give others strength as well.

, If applicable, seek help for problems that arise as a result of feeling stigmatized. Plenty of stigmatized conditions don't necessarily need treatment, but some people could benefit from guidance on how to best handle social pressures. It's not because the condition is shameful and wrong. It will just make your life easier. These are complicated problems to deal with. If the stress associated with them can be alleviated to some degree, why not do so?


For example, if you're obese, consider a weight management program for your health. If you're dyslexic, consider working with a learning specialist. The professionals you work with can also give you some advice on how to make your path easier. After all, they also deal with this every day.

, Studies have shown that calming techniques like meditation, yoga, and even deep breathing exercises can help individuals cope with stigma. When you’re calm and feeling relaxed, the stigma doesn't get to you as much. So find a nice, relaxing, quiet place, and clear your mind. It may be the start to the inner peace you are looking for.

Avoid making eye contact with people.,
Keep your arms folded.,
Use accessories to keep people away.",How to Be a Loner in School2," Loners keep to themselves and don’t want people to try to interact with them. To help with this, discourage people from approaching or talking to you by keeping your eyes down. Don’t look people in the eye and encourage them to speak to you.Make sure not to make eye contact with people in areas where they might come and talk to you, like in the lunchroom or the classroom.

, Try folding your arms over your chest. This signals that you don’t want to be bothered and want to be left alone. This body position helps make you look closed off and unapproachable.Fold your arms loosely across your body and keep your head down. This will help people realize you don’t want to be bothered.

, Adding accessories helps put up a barrier between you and others. They will see you doing something with the accessory and not disturb you. The accessories also give you a reason to ignore everyone around you.


For example, you can wear headphones, read a book, look on your smartphone, or draw on a sketchpad.

"
"
Ask if you can work alone.,
Pay attention in class.,
Ask and answer questions in class.",How to Be a Loner in School3," If your teacher puts people in groups, ask them if you can work alone. Generally, loners don’t like to work and interact with other students. If your teacher gives you the option to work together or alone, work alone.


If your teacher won’t allow you to work alone, do your part of the group work, but don’t talk to the other students unless you have to.

, You may prefer to be a loner and not socialize with your peers, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore your classes. One way to successfully be a loner is to focus on your studies and be a good student.Listen in class, take notes, and study so you will make good grades.
It doesn’t make a difference where you sit in class, just as long as you are paying attention.

, Being a loner doesn’t mean that you can’t speak up and participate in class. Raise your hand and ask questions when you have one. If the teacher calls on you or asks a question, answer.Being a loner means you don’t really hang around with other students. It doesn’t mean you don’t participate in class.

"
"
Look for a friend outside of school.,
Join out-of-school activities.,
Consider making friends with other loners.",How to Be a Loner in School4," If you aren’t interested in being friends with people at school, consider friends or acquaintances outside of school. This may be a cousin or neighbor. You may also look for friends or acquaintances at any out-of-school activities.For example, you may meet people at a music or computer class in the community. You may consider getting a tutor through the Boys and Girls Club or with a local college kid who can teach you a skill.

, You don’t have to join clubs or organizations through the school. You can instead find a club or organization to get involved in through the community. You may do things through the library, with a religious organization, or through a volunteer group.Many communities have after school clubs you can get involved with.
Doing things through a community organization allows you a chance to be a loner while still enjoying doing things.

, You may not want to be friends with most of the people at your school, but you may find other loners and shy kids you can connect with. Maybe there are other kids who are sitting by themselves that you can talk to or work with on projects.You may also look for shy people or introverts in any clubs or organizations. These people may have similar interests as you.

Learn how identity positions relate to social categories.,
Arm yourself with knowledge.,
Understand legal rights that everyone has.,
Know the legal definition of disability.,
Know your rights.",How to Cope With Stigma5," One way to think about stigma and social categories is through the concept, identity positions. Essentially, this concept is used by some psychologists, linguists, and sociologists to represent our identities. These can sometimes be positioned against each other. In this way, identities are used to organize people and to structure how we think about people. According to law professor Kevin Barry, some of these identity positions are: How capable we are: ""ability vs. inability.""
How limited we are: ""mild vs. severe.""
How we fit into the world: ""normal vs. abnormal.""
How free we are: ""independence vs. dependence.""
How healthy we are: ""health vs. sickness.""
Some of the binaries listed here can become associated with being gay, autistic or blind, for example. In this way, people are sometimes seen as being “less than” others without these identities.

, Educate yourself on the way your particular identity is shaped by stigma. Learn as much as you can about the nature of your identity. Then, you'll feel less isolated.


For example, 22% of American adults suffer from some form of a mental health condition. Yet only half report it. Did you know that almost 1 in 3 (33.2%) of US children and teens are considered to be overweight or obese?
Learning about what you're dealing with can help you feel less alone. Seeing that millions upon millions of other people have to deal with the same thing in some way, shape or form can help you realize just how doable this is.
You'll also likely run into resources and inspirational stories along your quest for knowledge.

, Certain rights are afforded to people to ensure that people are treated equally and fairly. Regardless of whether you have a disability, you may be protected by certain rights. Constitutional rights, for example, include freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and so on.

, The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed in 1990 in order to work towards affording persons with mental or physical disabilities the same working opportunities and public services expected by all Americans.These rights include both state and local government services (such as assistance programs), public accommodations, access to commercial facilities, and everyday transportation options. In 2010, a list of standards were added the ADA to address building accessibility problems in already constructed buildings and to ensure the access to buildings constructed in the future. The criteria for disability are as follows:


A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual
A record of such an impairment
Being regarded as having such an impairment.
If you fit this definition in any way, you may have certain legal protections against discrimination.

, Discrimination against stigmatized people happens all too often. The good thing is that you may have legal protections. If anyone takes advantage of you, you can fight back.


For example, all disabled people are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you feel you didn't get the job, got fired, got taken advantage of or evicted by your landlord, or have otherwise faced discrimination due to the stigma, consider taking legal action. You likely have health, medical, housing, workplace, and general human rights on your side.
While you may be entitled to pursue legal action if your individual rights have been violated, be sure to weigh the pros and cons of doing so. If the discrimination wasn’t consequential to your future goals, perhaps it is best ignored in order to avoid the time and hassle (and often money) often associated with a legal battle. However, it’s important to know that you always have the right to take this option if you so choose.

Get involved.,
Don't isolate yourself.,
Identify an angle to raise awareness.,
Tell your story.,
Contact your Congressperson to ask for government support.,
Organize a fundraiser.,
Help others be strong.,
Support other people’s stories and experiences.",How to Cope With Stigma6," If you live in an urban area, odds are there are support groups or awareness groups that you can become a part of. They may be labeled as support groups or they may just be a group of friends that gets together to celebrate who they are. Whatever it is, find a community that you can relate to. You'll strengthen them and they'll strengthen you. It may open plenty of doors as well.


Coping with stigma is one hundred times easier when you have a strong support group surrounding you. Having a wonderful network of family and friends is great, but having a group of people that have been there and that have done that will be even better. You'll have a web of advice and resources that can make each day that much brighter.

, It's easy to shut down your differences and pretend to be ""normal."" It's easy to stay at home and tell yourself, ""I'm just not going to deal with this today."" Resist! The more you get out there and make connections in your community, the more you’ll take control over the perceptions that some people may have about you.

, Your stigma may feel very specific to you, but it might be a large topic. For example, stigma around sexual orientation can manifest in a number of different ways. Same-sex parents may have trouble adopting children, or gay couples may not receive partner benefits. Or, gay men can’t donate blood. Focus on one angle as your central cause to raise awareness and make a positive change.


Enlist your awareness or support group to be involved with this cause.

, Telling your story may be what others need to hear. After all, the only way ignorance can go away is if people learn. The world will be better and wiser – and maybe more tolerant – if you share your story.


Write a book, start a blog, or give talks. Do something so the world sees that its intolerance is dated and, quite frankly, ridiculous. Make your stigmatized conditions something that's so commonly seen that it is no longer worthy of negative attention.
Putting your unique conditions in the public eye is the only way for people to get used to it. You're not fighting science or religion. You're really fighting time. The sooner you start, the sooner others will come around to the idea that your ""conditions,"" or your ""disability,"" isn't even something to bat an eye at. We're all different, and in that way, we're all the same.

, Once you identify an angle for raising awareness, write or call your Congressperson to ask for changes in policy.

, Use your energy to raise money for research or other awareness efforts. For example, if you have an illness that results in stigma, such as HIV, cancer, or MS, use it to raise money for research on this illness.


Talk with your local newspaper or TV station to spread the word about your fundraiser.

, Recognize that the same kind of ill treatment you're on the receiving end of happens to people all over the world for reasons of race, gender, religion, sexual preference, ethnic ancestry or mental illness (just to get started). Most people are fighting some sort of battle. While it may not be exactly like yours, it may be just as hard. Use your strength to make their battle easier.

, When you find someone who is stigmatized, support him. Rally around him to make sure he knows that he is not alone. Talk about how he is a great chef, instead of focusing on how he’s missing an arm.

Take a break.,
Use relaxation techniques.,
Lean on friends and family.,
Focus on the positive.,
Choose uplifting entertainment.",How to Cope with Being Sick1," For many people, it can be difficult to take a time out from life when feeling under the weather. But trying to carry on with your daily routine when you are sick can have many negative impacts. Not only will you risk passing your illness to others, but you may end up feeling even more stressed. When you are sick, you need to take a break from your responsibilities as much as possible.Call in sick. Even though you may have a lot of responsibilities at your job, you are not doing anyone any favors by showing up to work when you have a cold or the flu. You won't be able to function at full capacity, and this could make you frustrated and emotional.
If you have a fever, your thought process will slow down. When you can't work at your normal rate, you'll just be trying to play catch up all day.
Give yourself permission to have a day off. Remind yourself that your body (and mind) will function much better after you give it time to heal.
Allow yourself to take some time off from other commitments, too. For example, maybe you've agreed to go see a movie with a friend. Instead of forcing yourself to go, reschedule for when you feel better.;
, Being sick can cause you to feel cranky. It's understandable that whether you are suffering from an upset stomach or a sore throat, you're not going to be at your most cheerful. When you're under the weather, you can also feel increased levels of stress if you're worried about falling behind at work or not feeling up to making a healthy dinner for your family. Part of the healing process is feeling better mentally, so make a conscious effort to relax and lower your stress levels.Try progressive muscle relaxation. In a comfortable position, take some time to tense and then relax each muscle group in your body. For example, clench your hand for five seconds, then release for thirty seconds. Do this until you've hit every spot. This relaxation technique can help ease muscle tension.
Deep breathing is another useful technique. Focus on your breath, and allow your mind to wander. Draw deep breaths in for about 6-8 counts, then exhale for the same count.
Visualization is an excellent way to reduce tension. Focus on something you find pleasant, such as sitting in the park on a nice day. Use all of your senses. Picture the bright blue sky and imagine feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin.
Relaxation techniques have many benefits, such as relieving pain and boosting energy.

, When you're sick, it can be overwhelming to complete even the simplest tasks. Try to let your friends and family help you out and ease some of your stress. If you have a partner, ask him to cook you a healthy dinner. If you live alone, ask a friend if they would mind dropping a care package by your house.Don't be afraid to ask for help. Often, we feel uncomfortable asking for assistance. But if you're sick, others will be happy to help. Be specific in your requests, so that you get what you need. For example, ask your friend, ""Would you mind going to the pharmacy on 35th Street and picking up the prescription that is in my name?""
Try not to isolate yourself completely. When you're sick, you don't want to spread germs. But that doesn't mean you need to withdraw completely. E-mail or text a good friend and ask for some virtual company. Knowing you're not alone can help lift your spirits.

, Doctors report that people who practice positive thinking are generally in better health. Studies also show that positive thinking lowers stress levels and helps you to cope during difficult times. Being sick can certainly be stressful, so it makes sense that positive thinking can help you to feel better.Let yourself laugh. It's easy to feel grouchy when you're sick, but if something strikes you as funny, don't be afraid to show it. Even if it is as simple as seeing a silly commercial on tv, laughing can help your frame of mind.
Filter negative thoughts out. If you find yourself lying in bed and thinking about the pile of dirty laundry nearby, shift your focus. Instead, glance out the window and be glad that you're inside on a gloomy day.
Instead of worrying about what you're missing, try to focus on what is good about your day. For example, if you're stressed about falling behind at work, think about how great it was that you didn't get stuck in the horrible traffic jam you saw on the morning news.

, Being sick is an excellent time to indulge in some of your guilty pleasures. Maybe you have a favorite tv show that you've been missing because of a hectic schedule. Or perhaps you have a stack of magazines by your bed waiting to be read. Now's the time! Just choose wisely--you want something that will improve your mood.You might feel overly emotional when you are ill. This means that it is probably not the best time to binge watch that documentary about crime in your city. A depressing or serious show can add to your anxiety.
Choose a lighthearted show, movie, or book to help take your mind off of your queasy stomach. A good comedy can help the world seem a lot brighter.

Visit a doctor or dietitian.,
Eat smaller meals at more frequent intervals.,
Drink adequate amount of water.",How to Control Crohn's Disease with Diet1," She will be able to help you formulate a diet specifically for you. Keep in mind that your body and your symptoms will respond differently to foods than others who also suffer from Crohn’s disease. Part of finding the right diet will be trial and error at the beginning, but your doctor or dietitian can help you make a plan to begin., Try eating five to six small meals per day rather than three large ones. Some areas of the inner surface of the small intestine are damaged due to inflammatory processes. As a result, the effective length of the intestine is reduced (effective length means the functional part of the intestine that can handle food effectively for digestion and absorption). Thus, the diseased intestine cannot handle the same volume of food as a normal intestine can. If you eat a large meal, a significant portion will remain undigested and will pass into the colon. This portion will be fermented by colonic bacteria causing bowel gas, flatulence, bloating etc. This will also cause you to retain water in the intestine, causing diarrhea., Most Crohn’s disease patients experience repeated bouts of diarrhea, making them prone to dehydration. From this, many patients develop kidney stones due to concentrated urine. Dehydration also makes you weak and lethargic. A simple way to assess whether you have dehydration is the feeling of thirst. Drink at least 2–3 liters (0.5–0.8 US gal) of water daily to prevent dehydration. Sports drinks that provide electrolytes can also help replenish your system after a bout of diarrhea."
"
Get some rest.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat right.,
Take medications.,
Try home remedies.",How to Cope with Being Sick2," Sleeping is one of the most effective ways to help your body heal when you are sick. When you are healthy, you need about 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Aim to get at least a couple of extra hours when you are sick. Sleep can help your body repair itself.If you have a cough or cold, it can be difficult to sleep. Try propping yourself up and sleeping at an angle. You'll breathe more easily, which will help you rest.
Try sleeping alone. When you are sick, you might toss and turn more. Ask your partner to move to the guest room for the night. You need your space, and the extra peace and quiet will help you get the rest you need.

, When you are sick, your body is using more water than usual. For example, if you have a fever, you might be sweating out part of your water supply. If you have diarrhea or are vomiting, you are also losing fluids. Your body will have a hard time healing if you don't replenish your lost fluid. Make sure to increase hydration when you are sick.Water is a great choice, but sometimes other fluids taste or feel better when you are sick. You could try some hot tea with ginger, for example, to settle an upset stomach.
Juice and warm soups are also great for staying hydrated.

, Healthy foods can help your body heal when you are sick. Eating something that tastes good can also boost your mood. Eat nutritious foods when you are sick. If someone else can do the cooking, even better.Chicken soup can actually make you feel better. Not only will the broth keep you hydrated, but the warmth can reduce congestion.
Honey is an excellent way to soothe a sore throat. Try adding some to tea or yogurt.
Spicy foods can help loosen up the mucus that causes congestion. It is also a good choice for taste buds that are dull from a stuffy nose. Try eating a Mexican soup or some spicy tomato juice.
It's important to eat even if your stomach is upset. If nothing sounds appetizing, try to at least eat some crackers. The starch will help soak up the extra stomach acid your body is producing.

, Medicines can work wonders on many different illnesses. Whether you have a prescription from your doctor or an over the counter pill, taking the proper medication can ease your symptoms and speed your recovery. Make sure to only take the prescribed dosages for any medication.Talk to your pharmacist. He is an excellent resource if you are overwhelmed by the amount of cold, flu, and allergy medications that are available. Ask him to recommend a trusted brand.
Choose a medication that will treat your symptoms. For example, if you have a cough that is keeping you awake at night, look for a medication that also combats sleeplessness.
Take a pain killer. Being sick often comes with aches and pains. Try taking ibuprofen or aspirin to ease the pain and lower your fever. However, keep in mind that aspirin is not recommended for children because of the risk of Reye Syndrome.Consult your doctor if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might cause a reaction to medications. It is important to check because some cold and flu medications can raise high blood pressure even more. Some medications may also make lung conditions worse.

, If you don't want to try medication, there are many simple home remedies you can use to cure a lot of common ailments. For example, if you are suffering from a sore throat, try gargling with salt water. Simply dissolve a teaspoon of salt into 8 ounces of warm water and swish/gargle in your mouth and throat for several seconds.If you are nauseous, ginger is an effective natural remedy. Try adding some fresh grated ginger root to your hot tea. Or snack on some ginger snaps and wash it down with ginger ale.Add moisture to the air. Try using a vaporizer or humidifier in your home. The moist air can help relieve congestion.
A heating pad can relieve symptoms of several illnesses. If your stomach is cramping, place heat on your abdomen. If you have swollen glands, such as with mononucleosis, try placing a warm wrap around your neck.

Adopt healthy habits.,
Sanitize your surroundings.,
Minimize stress.",How to Cope with Being Sick3," Although it is impossible to avoid getting sick, there are steps you can take to make sure that it happens less often. Living a healthy lifestyle can strengthen your immune system and make your body more resistant to illness. Make healthy habits part of your daily routine.Eat a healthy diet. Make sure to get plenty of fruits and vegetables. Try to make sure that each meal includes several different colors. For example, include some leafy greens, a colorful fruit, and a healthy starch, such as a sweet potato. Don't forget the lean protein.
Exercise regularly. Frequent exercise has amazing benefits to your health. It can lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and stress levels. Try to be active for at least 30 minutes a day, six days a week.
Get plenty of sleep. Aim for at least 7-8 hours each night. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This will help make sleep a part of your healthy routine.
Try taking a daily vitamin C and zinc supplement to help prevent illness. You can even take a higher dose if you find that people around you have symptoms of illness.
Keep in mind that it is okay to walk away from someone who is coughing to protect yourself. You can also move to a different seat if you are in a public place, such as on a bus or train.

, Germs are a fact of life. But you can take steps to minimize your exposure. For example, wipe down your work surface at the beginning and end of each day. Keep some sanitizing wipes in your desk for this purpose.Wash your hands. You should wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds several times a day. Wash after contact with animals, food, or after you touch your mouth or nose., Studies show that stress can actually make you ill. Not only does it cause health issues such as high blood pressure, but it can also manifest in tension headaches and upset stomach. To live your healthiest life, try to reduce your stress.Take time outs when you need them. When you are in a stressful situation, give yourself permission to step away for a minute. For example, if you are fighting with your roommate about whose turn it is to clean the bathroom, excuse yourself to take a quick walk around the block.
Make time for yourself. Give yourself permission to relax each day. Take the time to do something you like, such as reading a book before bed, or watching your favorite tv show.

Try to avoid or reduce your consumption of fatty foods.,
Limit your consumption of dairy products.,
Reduce your consumption of high-fiber foods.,
Follow a low-residue diet.,
Consume more omega-3 fatty acids.",How to Control Crohn's Disease with Diet2," Fat just goes through your intestine and can make diarrhea worse during a flare-up.These undigested fats produce gas and lead to diarrhea and frothy stool. These symptoms are more severe in patients who have had a significant length of small intestine removed.

, Many who suffer from Crohn’s disease find that this can help reduce diarrhea and gas. Keep in mind that difficulty digesting dairy might also mean that you are lactose intolerant. Talk to you doctor if you believe this might be a possibility. Almond milk may be a good alternative to cow’s milk. It contains substantial amounts of protein, vitamin D and E, but no cholesterol or saturated fat. It can be fortified with calcium to meet daily needs.

, Fibers are actually complex carbohydrates that humans cannot digest. They pass unchanged into the colon and bulk up the stool. Fiber also retains water in the intestine that may worsen diarrhea. If needed, you should cut fibrous foods into tiny pieces and cook well (making them soft) to ease their passage through the intestine. Keep in mind that this advice is specifically for during a flare-up of the disease. When the incident has passed, eating a healthy high-fiber diet is a good idea. Crohn’s disease may cause some parts of the intestine to become narrowed due to inflammation and fibrosis. Food containing fiber cannot pass easily through these constrictions; therefore, you may experience cramps and abdominal pain due to vigorous contraction of the intestine.Green leafy vegetables
Nuts
Seeds
Prunes
Whole grains — oats, quinoa, rye, farro, etc.

, Residue refers to the undigested portion of food that is excreted as stool. Low residue foods are soft and are easily digested. They also pass easily through the narrowed parts of intestine. This way, you will have less abdominal pain and cramps. Again, this advice is for during a flare-up of the disease — it’s not healthy to only eat these soft, often refined foods as the constant basis of your diet. Try the following:


Cooked cereals
Pastas (not whole grain)
Skinless potatoes
Soft white bread
Canned vegetables without seeds.

, These can be found in fish and some eggs (labeled that they contain omega-3 fatty acids). There is evidence to suggest that these foods can help reduce inflammation."

Keep a food and symptom diary.,
Find your “trigger foods.” A great way to see what your “trigger foods” are is to keep a food and symptom diary.,
Remove potential trigger foods from your diet one by one.,
Don’t completely avoid trigger foods.",How to Control Crohn's Disease with Diet3," While food has nothing to do with the actual pathogenesis of the disease, certain foods may aggravate your symptoms due to their effects on digestion, absorption and allergy. These depend on which part of your bowel is affected and your particular sensitivity to different foods (food allergy); therefore, your diet should be absolutely individualized and custom made. No single diet will do the trick for everybody. Try this online food tracker and app, specifically for Crohn’s disease., This is particularly helpful during a flare up. At the end of each day, note down every food item you consumed under the corresponding day/date. Also, note the symptoms of Crohn's disease you experienced that day. For example, you may write: three loose bowel movement, mild/moderate/severe cramps, feeling of abdominal gas, bloating for two hours, nausea etc. After two to three weeks you should be able to identify any food items that trigger your symptoms., Next, try to avoid one item from your diet (which you suspect is a trigger for your symptoms) at a time for one or two weeks while keeping your food and symptom diary.If you feel no change, that particular food is unlikely to be causing your symptoms. Start avoiding another item for a further one or two weeks. This way, you will most likely find your trigger foods by a process of elimination., Finding your trigger foods does not mean you need to avoid them completely. Total elimination may lead to deficiency of particular nutrients. Rather, you may try different methods of preparing those foods like steaming, boiling or stewing. Familiarize yourself with some common triggers. Common food items include: dairy products, uncooked vegetables, fresh fruits, breads, cereals, nuts, coffee, tea, carbonated drinks, prunes, beans, fatty foods, etc.


Keep in mind that every person with Crohn's disease is different and what works for you may not work for someone else.

Discuss vitamin and mineral supplements with your doctor or dietitian.,
Make sure you are getting enough folate.,
Receive injections of vitamin B12.,
Take vitamin D supplements.,
Supplement with calcium.",How to Control Crohn's Disease with Diet4," It is very common for people who suffer from Crohn’s disease to suffer from specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies. This is often due to the diet of soft and refined foods that can alleviate symptoms, yet does not provide enough of some essential vitamins. Discuss your diet with your doctor or dietitian and ask them for recommendations of vitamin and mineral supplements, and in what form you should be taking them.


Ask your doctor about prebiotics and probiotics, which can stimulate the growth of gut microbiota and may help lessen your symptoms., ASA medications such as sulfasalazine (inflammation reducer) which are used for the treatment of Crohn’s disease may impair the absorption of folate. A folate deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Green leafy vegetables are good sources of folic acid, but you might be intolerant to them as they contain a lot of fiber; therefore, the supplement might be a better option for you. You can take a 5mg tab of folic acid once daily to prevent this type of anemia., Oral tablets will not work because of failure to absorb. Vitamin B12 is absorbed from terminal part of small intestine (terminal ileum). This part is commonly affected in Crohn’s. Sometimes, this part is even surgically removed to relieve narrowed intestine. This often results in a vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia., You may develop a vitamin D deficiency due to poor absorption (particularly after bowel surgery). This deficiency may cause low calcium absorption, resulting in bone weakness and potential fractures. Take vitamin D supplements in capsule form. One 0.25 mg capsule of vitamin D daily is sufficient to meet your daily needs. Alternatively, you may take cod liver oil, which can be found in capsule form. Take one capsule daily to supplement vitamin A and D., Calcium deficiency may arise from avoidance of dairy products, poor absorption and steroid intake. Bones become brittle and thin in calcium deficiency. As a result you may incur fractures with only minor traumas or falls. You should take a 500 mg calcium tablet two to three times daily to avoid this deficiency."

Get tested for any allergies or dietary issues.,
Use natural deodorant.",How to Cleanse the Lymph System1," Although scientific research has not proven that sugary foods lead to a buildup of toxins, cutting back on processed foods, especially processed foods that contain sugar, can lower the amount of toxins in your body. Try to reduce processed foods made with simple sugars and carbohydrates, or foods containing artificial flavoring in your diet. The less waste your lymphatic system has to filter, the more easily it will flow and clean your body., Red meat and shellfish are hard to digest and can clog up your lymphatic system, according to natural health practitioners.If you do need to eat animal based protein, go for organic meats. Hydrogenated fats can be oxidized easily and this will lead to a clogging of the arteries and lymphatic system.

, Though there is no scientific evidence these foods can cause lymph issues, dairy and white flour form mucus in your body that can congest your lymphatic system. Limit your dairy consumption by substituting regular milk for almond or rice milk. Cut back on white flour by using whole wheat flour or trying gluten free products.Whole wheat flour is better because it has more vitamin and nutrients.

, When shopping at the grocery store, look for organic stickers on your fruits and vegetables. Or ask your local produce producer at your farmer’s market about organic produce. Organic produce will help to limit the amount of toxins that will need to be filtered by your body via your lymphatic system. They will also provide powerful enzymes and acids to cleanse your lymphatic system.The label on an organic fruit or vegetable at the grocery store will contain a “9” in front of the PLU code (the bar code identifying the product).In the US, “organic” describes raw or processed agricultural products and ingredients that have been organically farmed. These foods also cannot be farmed with: synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, sewer sludge fertilizers, genetic engineering, growth hormones, antibiotics, artificial ingredients, or synthetic additives., Whole grains like brown rice, as well as nuts and seeds like walnuts, almonds, and chia seeds all provide important vitamins and minerals to keep your body healthy and help your lymphatic system work properly.Vitamin A should be consumed in the amount of 700-900 mcg/day. It works in the gut to help prevent germs and viruses from entering into the body. Next,
Vitamin C's recommended daily allowance is 75-90 mg/day. Vitamin C has been hypothesized by Linus Pauling to boost the immune system and prevent infection from viruses.
Vitamin E has a recommended daily amount of 15 mg. This vitamin acts as an antioxidant and prevents redox reactions that can potentially be harmful to the arteries and the lymphatic system from occurring.
Vitamin Bs are a class of vitamins that help with energy and boost the immune system.
Zinc is a mineral that works to boost the immune system through protein production.

, Your body needs water to stay hydrated and allow your lymph fluid to drain and flush out any toxins. Drink 6 to 8 glasses of filtered or purified water a day. Avoid sodas, sports drinks and sugar-laden fruit juices., If you haven’t been tested already, ask your doctor to conduct food sensitivity or allergy tests to determine if certain foods are affecting your digestion. Your body’s ability to detox starts in your digestion system, and any foods that cause digestion issues can lead to a clogged lymphatic system. Determining if you are allergic to certain foods or products, like dairy or gluten, can help you to eliminate these foods from your diet and prevent blockage in your lymphatic system.

, Aluminium-based antiperspirants can block sweating and actually add to your toxic load. Natural health practitioners believe these chemicals can also clog up your lymphatic system.Aluminum build up has been proposed to lead to Alzheimer's Disease.


You should also avoid using chemically laden beauty products on your skin. Most commercially available lotions, toothpastes, creams, and sunscreens are full of chemicals that can end up in your lymphatic system.Buy natural, organic beauty products with limited to no chemical by products. You can also make your own chemical-free beauty products at home."

Soak in a sauna or a steam bath.,
Get lymph system acupuncture done by a licensed acupuncturist.",How to Cleanse the Lymph System2," Regular exercise that involves lots of movement, including jumping and running, will stimulate lymph flow. As your muscles move, they massage your lymphatic system and improve lymph flow.Walking, running, and playing sports that involve a lot of movement are all great activities for stimulating lymph flow. Try to complete 150 minutes total of moderate exercise a week in intervals of at least 30 minutes to one hour of exercise a day.

, This particular modality is only certified to physicians, nurses, PTs, OCT, Massage Therapist, Therapist assistants through continuing education. Lymph vessels are also found under your skin and these vessels support your blood circulation. When your lymph flow slows down, your skin may appear dull or slightly yellow, or worse, you may experience signs of autoimmune disease. Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage is a gentle rhythmical technique that works to improve lymph flow throughout your body.Try to incorporate Dry Skin Brushing after a soak in a warm bath or while in a warm shower.If in the shower, take advantage of cool/ warm transitional hydrotherapy. When dry skin brushing, use a natural, bristle body brush, preferably with a long handle.Use long gentle strokes, but not too harm. This will stimulate your skin and remove dead skin.
Brush your entire body, in the same directional format as your MLD massage that was conducted by your MLD specialized health practitioner.
You can also incorporate salt into the massage by applying sea salt and a small amount of aromatherapy oil on the brush before you begin the massage. This will stimulate your skin and draw out toxins through your skin.

, Yoga practitioners believe yoga postures like “Twisting Chair” and “Seated Twist” can help to wringing out any toxins in your body.To do Utkatasana (Twisting Chair): Stand with your feet hip-width apart on a yoga mat.
Place your hands in prayer at the heart center, or middle of your chest. Inhale, then exhale and place your left elbow on the outside of your right thigh, just above your knee. You should be twisting to the right, with your prayer hands facing the right side of the room.
Check that your knees are in line with each other and your hips are square to the front of the room. Use your left elbow to press against the outside of your right thigh and help you twist further to the right with each inhale and exhale.
Hold this posture for 5-6 breaths and then return your prayer hands to the middle of your chest. Complete the same posture on your left side, with your right elbow sitting against the outside of your left thigh.
To do Marichyasana 3 (Seated Twist): Sit on a yoga mat with your legs extended straight in front of you, toes flexed towards you.
Bend your right knee and draw the foot to the inside of your left thigh. You can keep your right foot on the inside of your thigh or cross it to the outside of your left thigh for a deeper twist. You can also keep your left leg straight or bend it at the knee and draw your left foot back to the outside of your right hip.
Hug your right knee towards your chest with your left arm. Raise your right arm and rotate your body to the left. Place your right hand about a few inches behind you on your mat.
Continue to hug your right knee towards your chest as you twist to the left. To deepen the twist, press your left elbow to the outside of your right thigh. Inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale to rotate further to the left.
Hold this post for 5-6 breaths and then repeat it on the other side.

, Though there is no scientific evidence that deep breathing stimulates your lymphatic system, doing breathing exercises can help to improve overall health, including your lymphatic system. When you breath in, the pressure in your chest decreases and the pressure in your abdomen increases. This can pump lymphatic fluid upwards from your legs and suck lymph from your arms and head to drainage points behind your clavicles. Your clavicles are one way valves, so toxins cannot go in reverse and are essentially being cleaned out of your body. To practice deep breathing:Lay on a flat surface, like a bed or a yoga mat on the floor. Take a deep breath through your nose. As you inhale, tilt your head back and point your feet away from you. Hold the breath for a count of 5, taking in as much air as you can.
Exhale slowly through your nose, and at the same time point your feet towards your head. Tilt your head so your chin moves closer to your chest.
Repeat these deep inhales and exhales for 8-10 breaths, breathing through your nose only. If you get lightheaded, don’t be alarmed as this is a natural response to deep breathing.
Try to practice deep breathing at least once a day, for 8-10 breaths.

, A weekly soak in a sauna or steam bath can facilitate a healthy sweat, allowing you to sweat out toxins in your body. Natural health practitioners believe saunas and steam baths can also support your lymphatic function.After a long soak in a sauna or steam bath, be sure to drink lots of water to flush out toxins in your body and to allow your lymph system to do its job.

, Acupuncture is a health care system that originated in China. The general theory of acupuncture if based on patterns of energy flow (Qi) through your body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease and illness.One of the major focuses of acupuncture is on de-clogging your lymphatic system. Before you undergo lymphatic system acupuncture, check that the acupuncturist is a trained and certified practitioner.Side effects of acupuncture can include infections from unsterilized needles and a partial collapse of your lung due to accidental puncture of your lung with a needle. If your acupuncturist has the correct training and hygiene standards, these side effects should be minimal."

Talk to your doctor about enzyme supplements.,
Do a three day lymphatic cleanse.,
Try an herbal cleanse for 7-10 days.",How to Cleanse the Lymph System3," Before you take any enzyme supplements, talk to your doctor about how these supplements will work for your body. According to natural health practitioners, enzyme supplements help the lymph system to break down complex fats and proteins and aids the digestive system.You can take digestive enzymes with your meals and take systemic proteolytic enzymes between meals.
Proteolytic enzymes are the primary tools your body uses to digest organic debris in your circulatory and lymph systems. Supplementing this improves your body’s ability to do this.
Proteolytic enzymes also help to remove Circulating Immune Complexes (CICs) from your body. As CICs accumulate in your body, they can trigger an allergic response from your immune system and overwhelm it. Taking proteolytic enzyme supplements eases this burden on your body and frees up your immune system to do its real work: prevent disease and illness.

, There is no scientific evidence that cleanses benefit your overall health. But some natural health practitioners believe a cleanse can help to activate your lymph system and flush out other toxins in your body.Try a three day cleanse if you have never done a cleanse before and are looking to clean out your lymph system. Three days is considered the minimum time it takes to flush out your lymph system. One week prior to the cleanse, try to adhere to a meat free, flourless and sugar-free diet. One or two days before the flush, eat only raw fruits, seeds, nuts, sprouts, and vegetables.Choose one juice you’d like to drink for the full three days: apple, grape, or carrot. The only other juice you’ll be drinking during the cleanse is prune juice.
In the morning, have one glass of water, followed by 8-10 ounces of prune juice, mixed with the juice of one lemon. This will promote bowel movement. Sip the juice slowly and chew it so it mixes well with your saliva.
Drink alternating glasses of your chosen juice and filtered water all day until you have consumed close to 1 gallon of juice and 1 gallon of water. You can add lemon juice to the water or the juice.
Mix together 1 tablespoon wheat germ, flax seed, or borage, 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon kelp or dulse powder, and ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper. Drink this 1-3 times a day.
By the end of each day, you should consume 2 gallons of liquid. You can also consume anti-microbial herbs like garlic and echinacea. Your bowels should be eliminated each day. If your bowels are sluggish, drink another glass of prune juice with lemon before bed to stimulate them.
During the three day detox, it’s important to stimulate your lymph system with 30 minutes - 1 hours of exercise. But if you feel tired during the cleanse, don’t push yourself too hard. As toxins are released from your body, you may experience physical side effect such as nausea, headache, backache, or dizziness. These symptoms are a sign of the toxins being eliminated from your body and should lessen after the first day of the cleanse.

, Natural health practitioners think some herbs, such as echinacea, goldenseal, red clover, poke root, and licorice root, can enhance lymphatic function. These herbs also strip away layers of debris from your lymph system’s filtering system. Look for cleanses at your local health food store. Avoid using these cleanses for extended periods of time, no more than 7-10 days.Echinacea is also theorized to help the immune system work better.
If you are on other medications, speak to your doctor or a herbalist before you try an herbal cleanse. You should avoid herbal teas and herbal cleanses if you are pregnant or lactating.

Make the patient comfortable.,
Distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary surveys.,
Have a plan for examining all parts of the body.,
Inspect the head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat.,
Place a cervical collar around the neck.,
Inspect the chest.,
Survey the abdomen.,
Check for testicular twisting (torsion) in a male patient.,
Examine the genital and rectal areas in a female patient.,
Perform an initial examination of deep tendon reflexes.,
Evaluate the patient's motor or muscle strength.,
Check for skin sensation.,
Test the nerves.,
Log roll the patient.,
Access the patient's back.,
Move on to a trauma tertiary survey (TTS).",How to Conduct a Secondary Survey of an Injured Person," If the patient is awake and alert, explain to her what you are going to do and why. Ask her to describe any pain she may be feeling. Remove all clothing and cover the patient with a blanket (for warmth and modesty) while different areas are being examined. If the patient is unconscious, look for involuntary responses (like lack of reflexes or a rigid abdomen) and signs of primary injuries (like swelling, redness, lacerations, or physical illness).Realize that secondary surveys are the same for children as for adults. However, note that infants won't be able to cooperate with some parts of the assessment (like the cranial nerve exam). Do as much as you are able.;
, When dealing with trauma, a structured approach to examining wounds is important. This approach begins with a primary survey which recognizes and treats any immediate threats to life within minutes of arrival in the trauma bay. Then, the secondary survey examines the patient from head to toe in order to diagnose all possible injuries before deciding treatment. The tertiary treatment is the final assessment designed to catch any missed injuries.


A tertiary survey is important since many trauma patients are immediately rushed into surgery, are unconscious, or can't express their pain.Also, sometimes other symptoms will present after the patient has been treated for primary injuries.

, To catch overlooked injuries, you'll need to look over each system and area of the body methodically. Usually, you'll start the secondary survey by examining the front of the patient, log rolling the patient over onto her front side, and then checking the back of the patient. Ideally, several people should assist in rolling the patient in a blanket to protect the spine, when chances of spinal injury are low.


If you are putting the patient on the stretcher yourself, cut the patient's clothing along their back and expose the spine during the initial log roll. This will allow you to look for injuries to the back and you won't have to move the patient again to check later.
Wear gloves and apply gentle but firm pressure while you are assessing the patient's back. This may allow you to locate areas of pain, bruising, or bleeding.
If you suspect the patient has a spinal injury, wait to roll her until x-rays can determine if there are any vertebral fractures.

, Look at these areas for any lacerations (cuts), blood collection, or bruising. Feel along the bridge of the nose for fracture. Open the mouth and check the jaw for alignment, clicking, or fracture. Look for chipped or lost teeth and damage to the tongue. You should also look at the cheek bones for fracture and bruising. Look into the pupils of the eyes to evaluate their size (in millimeters), whether they're equal, and if they're reacting to light.Be thorough when checking. For example, you'll want to look behind the ears for bruising and inside the ear canals and nostrils (using an otoscope or even a pen light and your unassisted eyes) for bleeding.

, You should almost always do this when performing a secondary survey, since you don't yet know the extent of the patient's injuries. Tracheal shift can be verified in many cases while the collar is still on, due to the holes in the hard collar. Do not remove unless you have to. Check the trachea for any shift to the left or right. If you have to remove the cervical collar (also known as clearing the cervical spine), the patient must:Be conscious.
Be cooperative.
Not have any distracting injuries like a fractured leg.
Be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol).
Be developmentally able to engage in the assessment.
Not be reporting any back or neck pain..

, Make sure the chest is symmetrical and look for signs of bruising or trauma (such as lacerations, gun shot wounds and exit wounds). Listen to the lungs for breathing from both sides to make sure a lung hasn't collapsed. Listen to the heart for any distant or muffled sounds. These could mean there's fluid or blood around the heart sac (indicating pericardial tamponade)., Look for bruising and Cullen's sign which is swelling and bruising around the belly button (signaling bleeding from an injection). Feel the abdomen for rigidity (muscle stiffness) which can also indicate internal bleeding and infection. Press the four quadrants of the abdomen by placing the fingers of one hand on each quadrant, and pressing on your fingers with your other hand. Press in a rolling motion using both sets of fingers to assess for rigidity or guarding (flinching from pain). Also, watch for pain when you remove your hand. Listen for the sound of blood rushing (bruits), which could mean there's been a tear from trauma.Pay attention to other signs, like pain when you lightly tap across the abdomen. This reverberation might be intensely painful.

, Feel the area to determine if the testicles have twisted (torsion). Take the metal end of a reflex hammer and lightly run it along the inner thigh. When you do this, each testicle should rise in the scrotum, if there's no testicular torsion (a testicle-threatening injury).At this time you can also check the perineum for any lacerations, burns or injuries.

, Place gloved and lubricated index and middle fingers into the vagina. At the same time, press or palpate against the lower abdomen using the opposite hand. You're checking for pain. However, if the patient is pregnant you should consult an obstetrician before doing an internal exam since ultrasounds and fetal monitoring might be needed.At this time, you could also check the perineum for any lacerations, burns, or injuries.

, Use a reflex hammer to check for motor strength, sensation, and reflexes of the upper and lower extremities (arms and legs). If you notice anything unusual such as decreases in these abilities, get a neurosurgical consultation. If you don't find anything unusual, you can start palpating the seven cervical vertebrae along the spine. Check for any pain or tenderness overlying any of the vertebrae.If there is any pain, take x-rays of the cervical spine to look for any fracture. If the x-rays show a fracture, get an emergent neurosurgical consultation before continuing to check motion range.

, Record the muscle strength for all muscle groups of the upper and lower extremities. Rate the strength from flaccid paralysis (0) to normal (5) with - and + for grades falling in between. Compare strength from left side to right side to compare what's baseline normal for your patient. Use the following grades to rate muscle strength:


1: Contraction of the muscle but no movement
2: Movement but cannot resist gravity
3: Movement but can barely resist gravity
4: Can move against gravity but not normal strength
5: Normal strength

, Rub a cotton ball over the skin to determine soft touch, with a cotton-tipped swab to determine dull touch, and with the wooden sharp part of a broken cotton-tipped swab to determine sharp touch. Tell the patient to close her eyes and alternate between the various sensations to see if she can distinguish between them.


Next, see if she can distinguish between one item and two items touching her. The patient's eyes should again be closed. Ask her, ""Are you feeling two points or one?""

, Next, you can test the patient's nerves by using some simple tests. The following nerves need to be tested:


Olfactory Nerve: Ask whether the patient can smell (try something like soap).
Optic Nerve: Use a fundoscope to examine the inside the eye. Turn off the lights and look for blurring of the optic disc (papilledema). This can signal bleeding in the brain.
Cranial Nerves: This is particularly important if there was head trauma.Oculomotor Nerve: Check the pupils to see that they are equal round and reactive to light. Have the patient hold her head straight while you move your finger. She should watch while only moving her eyes.
Trochlear Nerve: Test the downward and internal gaze of the eyes.
Trigeminal Nerve: Lightly touch the patient on the cheek using your finger.
Abducens Nerve: Check this nerve when you check the extraocular movements of the eyes in all directions (side to side, up and down).
Facial nerve: Have the patient smile big, or close her eyes tight.
Acoustic Nerve: Check hearing by whispering in each ear to pick up any subtle deficits.
Glossopharyngeal and Vagus Nerves: Have the patient drink a small amount of water and test gag reflex with a tongue depressor.
Spinal accessory nerve: Have the patient shrug her shoulders.
Hypoglossal nerve: Have the patient stick her tongue out straight ahead and to the left and to the right, showing strength, against the cheek.

, You'll need two or three people to help you roll the patient onto her back. Wash your hands before rolling and explain to the patient what you're going to do (if she's conscious). The patient should be lying on a blanket or turning sheet with her hands placed across her chest. You should all be holding the blanket or sheet on the side of the patient that's farthest from you. Gradually pull the sheet towards you and over the patient, turning her onto her back.Once the patient is on her back, you can examine the skin. Look for any bruising that might indicate trauma, lacerations or gunshot wounds.

, Since you should have already examined and cleared the cervical spine, you'll need to press (palpate) each individual vertebrae of the back. Specifically, palpate the thoracic and lumbar spine, feeling each vertebrae for pain that might indicate a fracture.Don't forget to check any parts of the musculo-skeletal system that you might not have examined earlier. For example, you can ask the patient to grasp your finger with their clutched hand to check for motor control and strength, and then ask the patient to tell you without looking which finger of theirs you are gripping.
Palpate down the lengths of the arms and legs as well, all the way to the toes and fingers to feel for possible fractures. You can also do this when you are doing the log roll check of the patient's spine.

, Once the primary and secondary surveys are complete, perform a TTS. This extensive examination should take place within 24 hours of admitting the patient. Or, do it when the patient is awake and alert enough to participate in the examination. You'll need to get the patient's medical chart that includes all laboratory and radiologic data.


This information will be combined with the opinions of consultants in order to make a management and care plan that's specific to the patient."

Try on lots of options.,
Pay attention to your gait.,
Avoid high heels.,
Test them out.,
Try adding insoles.,
Look for shoes that absorb shock.,
Avoid heavy soles.,
Try flexible walking shoes.,
Give less supportive shoes a try.,
Wear supportive boots.,
Avoid open-backed shoes.,
Look for wide shoes.,
Be aware of where the shoe binds.,
Make sure they don't restrict your feet.",How to Choose Shoes for Osteoarthritis," It's a good idea to start your shoe search at a store that has a wide selection of shoes. More options means better chances for finding comfortable, supportive shoes. Shopping at a store where the staff is very knowledgeable about fitting shoes properly will also be helpful.Keep in mind that just because a shoe is marketed as a ""comfort shoe"" does not mean that it will be right for you. There is no one shoe that works for everyone with osteoarthritis, so it's best to try on many different options.
You may find that it is worth it for you to invest in an expensive pair of shoes if they improve your pain, but less expensive options may work just as well.;
, The way you walk is a huge factor to consider when determining what kind of shoes will be right for you. Try taking a look at the soles of a pair of shoes you have been wearing for a while. If you notice that they are unevenly worn, you may have an abnormal gait that needs to be corrected.If the outer edges are worn more, you may have flat feet, in which case you might benefit from shoes with lots of arch support. If the inner edges are more worn, you probably have high arches, which means you may want to avoid an overly structured foot bed.
A podiatrist or orthopedist can help you identify problems with your gait that might be contributing to your osteoarthritis pain. Most specialty running stores have someone who can perform a gait analysis and recommend the appropriate shoes.

, These can cause unnecessary stress on your feet, ankles, knees, and hips. They are not good for anyone's joints, but they are an especially bad choice for someone who suffers from OA.High heels are generally defined as shoes with a heel taller than two inches. Even shoes with shorter heels can worsen your osteoarthritis pain, but higher heels typically cause more problems.

, Take some time at the shoe store to walk around in several different pairs of shoes. Purchase the shoes only if you feel completely comfortable after walking around the store.

, If your favorite pair of shoes is causing you discomfort, try adding orthotic insoles to them. Orthotics can reduce your pain by providing additional support, redistributing your weight, and correcting your gait.Your podiatrist can provide you with custom orthotics that last for about five years for an average of $400–$800.
You can also try buying store-bought inserts, although these might not provide you with the same level of relief because they will not be customized to your feet.If you go with this option, choose ones that are supportive. Ones that are gel-based (such as Dr. Scholls) can actually make your feet achier and add more pain.

, Try to go for shoes with a cushioned surface for your feet to lessen impact on your joints., Although they may be a good choice for individuals with arthritis in other joints, shoes with very heavy soles like clogs and stability athletic shoes can actually worsen pain in the knees. This may be due to the way these shoes alter the gait, which may increase the pressure on the knees., Flat walking shoes that have a bit of flex to the sole are ideal for people who suffer from osteoarthritis in their knees. Unlike shoes with heavy soles, these will not cause unnecessary strain on your knee joint.Be sure the sole is not so flexible that it easily contorts out of shape. You will still benefit from some arch support, which provides shock absorption.

, While it may sound counterintuitive, shoes like flip flops may actually be more comfortable for people with knee pain than overly supportive shoes like clogs because they create less strain for the knee joint.You may even be able to walk comfortably barefoot, as long as you're walking on a safe surface.

, If you have pain in your ankles, boots can provide the support you need. Look for fashion and hiking boots that extend just above your ankle and provide support to stop your ankle from wobbling. If your ankle is firmly supported, this will limit the movement in that joint, making walking less painful.


Make sure the boots are not so tight around your ankles that they prevent you from walking normally.

, When you wear shoes with open backs, your toes have to grip the soles of the shoes, which can cause pain and discomfort in your feet. If you plan on wearing clogs or sandals, choose ones that have full backs or straps to hold your heels in place.Flip flops are especially bad because they provide very little stability.

, Osteoarthritis can cause bone spurs and bunions to develop at the base of the big toe. Wider shoes are often more comfortable for people who have OA in their feet because they do not rub against these tender areas.Box toe shoes are often much more comfortable than shoes that have a pointy toe.

, Many people who have osteoarthritis develop bone spurs on the tops of the feet. The pain from these bone spurs can be exacerbated if your shoe binds tightly in the same area. Try to avoid shoes that have laces or buckles in areas where you have bone spurs.Shoes with laces and adjustable straps are better than those with fixed buckles because they can be loosened to alleviate the pain. Just be sure they are fastened tight enough that your ankle is stable., Your shoes should not pinch your feet or contort them into an unnatural shape. Make sure you have at least one centimeter between your longest toe and the front of the shoe. They should also be roomy enough that they do not pinch your feet when they swell slightly."

Limit how many items are on your to-do list so you don’t stress yourself out. Choose the three most important tasks you need to get done. These are big, important, and crucial tasks that must get done before you do anything else. Fill the rest of your checklist with minor tasks to accomplish if you finish your big tasks.Write your checklist the night before and focus on that coming day only.Be specific in your checklist, break down tasks into smaller chunks, and include time estimates.;
, Look at your patterns on how you spend time and where you waste it. Do you find yourself clicking on Facebook a little too often? Or having too many chats with your coworkers in the break room? Figure out where you waste time so you can stop and be more effective at work., It can be hard to feel accomplished if you spent the entire day on one thing, and still have not finished it. Break up big projects into small successes to help you feel motivated and be more effective at work.If you worked on creating a budget for a company all day, think of it as all the small steps you did to create the budget. Maybe you contacted business owners, created spreadsheets, and calculated where money was being wasted, so you actually accomplished three tasks.

, Tell your mind and body that it is time to work by having a routine system. This might mean that every morning you start off the same way (such as you doing stretches, drinking coffee, and turning on a pump up playlist).Have designated times throughout the day where you are allowed to check your email, so you don’t waste time impulsively  checking it all day., When you get to work, spend five minutes with your to-do list thinking about your day. Think about how you are going to accomplish your tasks for the day. Every hour force yourself to refocus. Look at how you spent the past hour and ask yourself if it was productive. Commit to making the next hour productive. When the day ends, ask yourself how your day went. Was it productive? How can you change to make tomorrow more successful?, If you know how to do your job like the back of your hand, then it will require less energy. Knowing what you are doing will allow you to excel at your work. Although you should still challenge yourself to new things and continue to outdo yourself to build your skills, contribute to your company, and to keep yourself from getting bored.


Seek further training to help you master your job if you can’t get things done because you don’t have the right skills or knowledge.

, A big reason for procrastination is because you are dreading to do something. Force yourself to do things in bursts. Force yourself to start a chunk of something even if it is just for five minutes, then stop if you need to. Once you start making progress on something, you will be more motivated to keep going and working on it longer and longer until it is finished.Turn your phone off and clear your desk to avoid distractions that encourage procrastination.
Do challenging tasks before lunch when you are the most motivated., Focus your time and energy on what you can control. Don’t worry about and stress about what is beyond your control. If you start getting worried about what a coworker is doing or stressing about another department, it will just waste your own time. You will feel more empowered and be more effective at work if you just focus on what is in your control., In order to be an effective worker, you have to be an efficient worker. Stop multi-tasking. Focus on one task at a time. If you try to do ten things at once, you won’t complete anything., Work in a team to accomplish tasks faster and to bring new ideas to projects. Working with others and asking for help when you need it will help you be a more effective worker., You can’t be effective at work if you don’t allow yourself time to take a break. Allow yourself moments to break from work every couple of hours. Eat a snack, go on a walk, or meditate to recharge your brain to be more effective., If you force yourself to stop working when work is over, you will be more effective when you are actually at work. Set a firm cut off time for when work is over and stick to it. Plan something interesting after work to encourage yourself to stop working. Have a routine after work to wind yourself down, such as taking a walk or keeping a journal., The key to staying stress free is to feel in control. Keep your days planned to help you feel in control. Make sure you have a clear idea of what is expected from you at work to help avoid stress. Do stress reducing activities after work (such as reading, listening to music, doing yoga, or doing a creative hobby)."

Set up a station for ear cleaning.,
Lie on your back with your head turned to one side.,
Put the hand towel on your shoulder.,
Drip 1-3ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide into your ear.,
Drain your ear onto the hand towel.,
Use the shower method when short on time.,
Clean your ears with hydrogen peroxide twice a week at first.,
Avoid using cotton swabs in your ears.,
Avoid peroxide cleanings if you have ear tubes.,
See the doctor for ear pain or discharge.",How to Clean Your Ear with Hydrogen Peroxide," You’ll be lying down during the ear cleaning, so it’s important to gather all necessary supplies and bring them within arm’s reach. Lay a towel on the floor for your head to rest on. Then, about a foot away, set up a small bowl of 3% hydrogen peroxide, a medicine dropper and a hand towel.
, Lie on your back with your head on the towel you laid out in the floor. Tilt your head to the side such that the ear you’d like to clean is facing the ceiling., Before you start cleaning, place the hand towel on the shoulder of the ear you’ll be treating. This will protect your clothes from staining and catch the solution you’ve used to wash your ear.

You may also want to put a piece of plastic under the towel before you get started. This will help to protect your clothes and floors from getting soiled.

, Draw up 1-3ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution with the dropper, and drip it into your ear canal.You may hear and feel some fizzing, which is perfectly normal. Though it may feel a little ticklish, try to relax. Let the solution stay in place with your ear still turned up for 3-5 minutes.If helpful, you can pull on the top edge of the ear to open the ear canal more as you insert the drops.
Don’t press the dropper down into your ear canal when administering the drops. Your ear canal is sensitive and prone to damage with too much pressure.

, When time is up, take the hand towel on your shoulder and hold it over your upturned ear. Sit up, turning your head against the towel to drain the solution and excess earwax, which should be visible. Dry the exterior of the ear with the towel as necessary.

Repeat the cleaning regimen on the other ear.

, If you’re running short on time, place a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in each ear 10 minutes before getting in the shower. No need to lie down. The peroxide will soften your earwax, and it will wash out as you go about your bathing routine as normal. Dry the exterior of your ears with a clean towel when you dry off., Earwax is normal and actually has certain antibacterial properties to keep your ears healthy. Most people with normal earwax production will not need to clean their ears with hydrogen peroxide more than twice a week.After two weeks of twice weekly cleanings, then switch to cleaning your ears twice per month, and then after two months of that, switch to cleaning your ears twice per year only.
Talk to your doctor about cleaning your ears as well. Cleaning your ears too often can cause damage, so you may want to discuss your reasons for wanting to do regular cleanings with your doctor.
Ask your doctor about ear cleaning kits, such as Debrox.

, Earwax normally only coats the outer third of your ear canal, but cotton swabs actually push earwax deeper than it is meant to go. Over time, this can cause impacted earwax blockages near your eardrum that actually interfere with hearing.Doctors also advise against using cotton swabs to clean your ears, as well as other objects such as hair pins.

, If you have had surgery to put in ear tubes, do not use peroxide to clean your ears. While tubes may clear up recurrent ear infections, they do so by putting a permanent hole through the air drum to allow air into your middle ear. Peroxide cleanings would leak solution into your middle ear and might lead to complications or infection.To clean your ears with tubes, use a clean tissue to wipe away any excess wax that comes to the opening of your ear canal. You should avoid getting water in your ears entirely.

, While earwax is normal, any excess wax that is accompanied by ear pain or unusual-looking discharge should be investigated by a doctor. An ear that is hot to the touch or accompanied by a fever is also reason to schedule an appointment."

Know when your work just isn't working.",How to Be Happy at Work," Enjoy some ""me"" time before the rush begins. Though your sleep is precious, so is your need for some time to be by yourself without feeling overwhelmed. Give yourself time to eat breakfast, read a little bit, go for a short jog, or to do whatever you need to do to get the day started off on the right foot. Nothing will make you feel better than knowing you already did something for yourself before walking through the front door of your workplace.


You may need to go to bed half an hour earlier or so to get used to doing this. Try to make the most of your time home after work so you don't end up staying up too late for no reason. Though you may be tired when you come home from work, if you just collapse and watch television for hours, you may be liable to stay up late without truly doing anything for yourself.;
, When you leave the house looking good and ready for work, then you are well on your way to having a good day. If you work in a casual environment or in a place with a uniform, then you don't need to add too many personal touches to your look, but you should shower, wash your face and hair, and look generally well-groomed. Not only will looking nice make other people treat you with more respect, but it may leave you feeling more excited about being at work.


Even if you show up to work feeling tired, seeing yourself looking put together in the mirror can give you the energy you need to start your day off on the right foot.

, Though it can be hard to feel happy at work when you're too busy worrying about the fight with your boyfriend, your mother's health, or scrambling to do some last-minute planning for your wedding, learning to push your personal problems aside is the only way you can feel happy in the workplace. Tell yourself that whatever problems you're having will have to wait until work is over, unless they are really important, and go about your work day.


In fact, pushing your personal problems aside can lead you to look forward to work more, because you'll see it as a haven from your problems, instead of a place that's keeping you from addressing them.Don't try to squeeze your personal problems into your work day. Make the phone calls and send the emails you need to send after work hours, or during your lunch break, if necessary. If you try to get your job done while trying to solve your personal problems, you'll be twice as stressed about them because you'll be anxious about finding a time to do both.

, A rushed and bad start will minimise your chances of having a good day and feeling happy at work. If you get to work late, you'll feel like you're behind all day, and like you never have time to catch up. Instead, leave the house at least 15 minutes earlier than you have been, or even earlier, depending on when you normally get to work. You may think that you're winning by rolling in a few minutes late every day, when in reality, you'll be lowering your chances of being happy at work.Having positive relationships with your bosses and coworkers can have a big impact on how happy you are at work. If you're known for showing up late, then people will look down on you for being a slacker, and your relationships will suffer.

, When you first walk in the door, make sure to greet as many of your colleagues as you can before you get to work. You'll instantly feel more connected to people and will feel your positive energy growing. You may feel stressed out, rushed, or just plain cranky, but isolating yourself is not the way to make yourself more excited about work. Instead, be friendly when you get to work, even if you don't feel very friendly.


Remember that part about getting to work early? One reason you should do so is to have time to connect with your coworkers a bit. If you get in late, you'll feel like you don't have time to say hi to people. But if you take your time, you'll have a few minutes to establish a connection with people without feeling frazzled.
If you don't greet people or rush off to your own office, you'll develop a reputation for being antisocial, whether it's true or not.

, Make sure to keep your desk or work area organized and tidy so that you know where everything is and don't waste time looking for lost items. You can have a filing system, or trays on your desk, that help you organize your tasks in terms of what has to be done today, next week, or by the end of the month. Taking just 10 minutes a day to keep your workspace organized can make a big impact on how happy you are at work. You want to feel comforted, not stressed out, when you enter your workspace.


Personalize your cubicle, work space or office. Adding plants, pictures of friends and family, and other personal items leads to increased job satisfaction, if permitted. This will also make your work space feel more like home., Answer correspondence which simply requires an immediate reply (without any research), fax simple returns immediately. Then categorise the rest of your post into ""urgent: respond by the end of the week"" and so on. Remember that every job completed and not deferred brings a sense of accomplishment which leads to a sense of happiness at work.


Instead of dreading completing a task like making a quick phone call or sending an email, just get right to it when you have the time. You'll feel better about it because you'll be able to move on about your day without it nagging at you.

, This refers to tasks big or small from a fax to a report. Professionally presented documents will bring praise and recognition from colleagues and even management; so will a delicious meal made perfectly or an incisive lecture on Shakespeare. Whatever work you do, take pride in the work you've put in as well as in how it impacts people. Everybody loves praise and the happiness and sense of pride in a job well done that it brings.


Even if you feel like a lot of your work is monotonous, you should find something to take pride in, whether it's a small aspect of the job (like a report you completed this month) or a finished product (a house you've built).

, Help them as much as you can. You may find that they will express gratitude in various forms. We all love to feel useful and we all feel happy when people thank us for simply ""doing our job"" or going the extra mile. Whether you work in an office or in a restaurant, it never helps you to be rude or condescending to other people. You may feel frustrated or impatient, but having a negative interaction with people will only make you feel worse. If you want to feel happier in the workplace, then you should work to foster a positive relationship with the people you work with.


Of course, if someone is really treating you poorly, then you may not be able to put a big smile on your face. If you work on being patient and staying in control of your emotions, you'll be improving your attitude at work for sure.

, Though you may feel like you're strapped to your desk all day, or stuck in one position, there are a number of things you can do to improve the amount of physical activity you can do during your work day; being more physically active will make you feel more energized and happier. This can start with your commute: you can try to walk or bike to work, or just to find a way of getting there that requires some physical exercise, even if it means walking a little longer to catch a bus. Once you're in the workplace, here are some things you can do to get more exercise at work:


Take the stairs instead of the elevator
Walk to a co-worker's office instead of sending an email to ask a question
Leave the office to walk across the street to get coffee
Go outside to eat your lunch
Get a standing desk to burn more calories while you work

, If you want to be happier in your workplace, then you have to take breaks from your work from time to time. You don't want to feel repressed or like you can't leave your desk or go outside until you're done with your work day. Studies show that it's important to take a break at least every 90 minutes; step away from your computer or whatever task your doing and take 10 minutes to rest your eyes, stretch, take a short walk, make a brief phone call, or even read a little bit. If you have the luxury of taking a break from your work, then you should make a habit of it if you want to feel happier.If you work inside an office building, you should make sure you leave the building at least once or twice a day, if you're allowed. If you start feeling cooped up in all that stale air conditioning and fluorescent lighting, it can have a serious negative effect on your mood. Stepping outside to get some sunlight and fresh air from time to time will make you happier as you go about your day.

, Though you may think that multitasking can help you get your work done faster, it has been shown to actually slow you down, not allowing you to fully immerse yourself in one task. You should check your email, respond to any emails you need to read, and then move on to project A, and then move on to report B, etc, if you want to systematically check items off your work to-do list. If you end up doing five tasks halfway, then you'll feel less of a sense of accomplishment than if you fully completed one or two tasks.


It can help to write a to-do list at the beginning of your work day and to go about checking items off of it. You'll feel more accomplished, and therefore, happier in the process.
Do not waste time reading junk mail. Sift through your e-mails and delete all jokes and sappy messages from friends. Ask your friends to only send e-mails to your home. Wasting valuable working hours at work will lead to increased stress and rob you of happiness. It'll also keep you from being focused on the task at hand.

, It is especially important to avoid groups which target co-workers and management: negativity drains you of energy and blocks happiness and positive thoughts. Work on being friendly with everyone instead of joining a group of just three or four people and alienating everyone else. You don't want to join a clique and then find that the people in it turn on you. Instead, try to be on good terms with everyone without becoming stuck in one social circle; your happiness will grow as a result.


Though you may feel temporary satisfaction when you're ""in"" with a group of people, in the long run, it will lead to drama you don't want.

, It's important to speak up when you think that something in your workplace can be improved. However, it's equally important to point out when your coworkers or company is doing something right. If you thought everything at your workplace was done incorrectly, then you wouldn't be working there, would you? Make sure to speak up to give praise when it's needed so that you stay upbeat and make yourself aware of all the good things your job has to offer.


If you're only complaining and being a negative Nancy all the time, then you'll get a bad reputation. One main way to be happy in your workplace is to make friends with your colleagues, so you want to maintain a good reputation.

, Studies show that one of the best ways to be almost as happy at work as you are away from work is to be friends with your coworkers.Though you may feel like you have enough friends, you should get to know your coworkers so that you're excited to see them every day and that you feel more connected in the workplace. You should give your coworkers your time, make small talk with them, and work on building closer relationships. Though you can't be best friends with everyone, you should seek friendships with the people who really matter to you.


Find opportunities to socialize at your workplace. Go grab coffee or hang out in the break room with your coworkers, or even step out for lunch with them. Try to isolate yourself as little as possible.
If you have people to connect with in your workplace, then you won't look at it as this place that's just a punishment until you can return to your real life. Who knows, you may even look forward to getting up to go to work in the morning because you can't wait to catch up with your coworkers over lunch!

, When you are talking to colleagues or clients and you have your arms folded across your chest, not only will you be sending the wrong signals but you will unconsciously be blocking your ability to communicate openly. Open communication reminds us of our common humanity and brings happiness as a result. Having open body language can make you happier at work because your coworkers will be more likely to have positive interactions with you.


Standing tall and looking ahead instead of at the ground will also help you project confidence, which is what you'll need to gain respect in the workplace and to feel happier.

, Colleagues who moan and whine about personal or work issues, will drag you down and prevent the workplace from being a happy one. Instead, focus on people who are positive, upbeat, and who have an optimistic attitude about their work. If one of your coworkers is complaining about work too much, then you will start to find a million things wrong with your job. Of course, it's important to be observant, but you shouldn't let other coworkers lower your happiness.


Avoid gossip. If you want to be happy at work, then don't get involved in office drama or idle gossip. Stick to talking about the things you care about and the things that make you happy. If you are known as a gossip, you'll soon be the target, and this won't help your happiness at all., One way you can make yourself happier at work is to stop saying yes when you really mean no. Though you may want to do everyone a favor, you should stick to your guns when you know you have too much on your plate. Be honest with your boss or your coworkers when you feel like you already have too much to do instead of getting overwhelmed and feeling like the work will never end. This will lead you to be happier, and to immerse yourself in the tasks you are capable of doing, instead of trying to please everybody.


If you feel like you want to help a colleague out but are too crunched for time, say that you can't do the task he or she wants you to do right now, but that you'd like to help out with something else in the future.

, Even if you are looking for another position and just biding your time, remember that your boss will have to write a testimonial or reference letter for you. If you are a happy, committed and quality-driven employee, chances are, the reference will be a positive one and may just land you that job you seek. Even if you're feeling bummed out or frustrated at work, try putting on happy face — it's been proven to actually make people feel happier.


There's absolutely nothing you can lose from trying to be as happy as you can in the workplace. If you're feeling negative, complaining, or ranting to other coworkers, you're guaranteed to feel worse.

, One important way to feel happy at work is to find some meaning in the work you do. You don't have to be the CEO of a non-profit to feel like you're making a difference in people's lives. Whether you're a teacher, a waitress, or a corporate executive, you have to find a reason to do the work you do. You could be helping people, whether they are students, customers, or clients. If you struggle to find any meaning in the work you do, then it may get pretty difficult to be happy at work.You may feel like a lot of your job is filled with drudgery, which can lead you to forget the bigger picture. If you're a teacher, for example, you may spend so much time grading papers that you forget that you're teaching children to love literature or to develop their powers of reasoning. Take a moment to remind yourself why the work you do means something and you'll see your happiness soar.

, Though not being fairly compensated or feeling like you're more than overdue for a raise is unpleasant, you can't let this thought control your every move. If you step out for lunch, don't tell yourself that enjoying a burger and fries with your coworkers is the equivalent of working for half an hour; if you start to follow this line of thinking, you'll soon be filled with despair. Instead, draw up a larger budget and stick to it, but don't think of every little dollar you spend as being some fraction of your salary.


Of course, if you feel that you are more than overqualified for your job, then you may be happier at a higher-paying position that is better suited to your needs. You can also ask your boss for a raise, if you feel that you deserve it. However, remember that increasing your salary by a marginal percentage won't make you happier for long.

, If you're feeling down in the dumps about your time at work, take a minute to think about all of the people who depend on you. Think of your students, your fellow waitstaff, the other people in your office, or whoever depends on you in your work environment. Think about what would happen if you didn't show up to a day of work — or didn't show up ever again. Many people would suffer and wouldn't know what to do with themselves. Remind yourself how valuable you are the next time you have doubts about whether your current employment situation is right for you.


You can also take some time to think about all of the people at work you need to go about your day. This will make you realize that you're in a supportive, collaborative environment and that you and your colleagues really need each other.

, Though productivity is important, so is mental health. If you want to be happy at work, then you should periodically reward yourself for getting through a certain task or getting done with your work day. You can schedule a happy hour at work after a series of what you know will be stressful meetings. You can enjoy a sugar cookie after teaching two of your hardest classes. You can spend ten minutes reading up on your celebrity gossip after turning in a complicated report. Find whatever motivates you to get your work done and use it as a reward after a hard day.Having rewards for yourself will also give you something to look forward to throughout your work day. You may be more energetic and efficient if you know that you'll have a romantic dinner date with your partner after a day of work.

, No matter how busy you may be, it's always important to make time for the people closest to you. If you spend all of your energy on your job or complaining about your job, then you won't be able to stop and enjoy life. If you want to create a healthy balance between work and play, then you should make sure to see one of your friends at least once a week and to check in with your family, whether it's over the phone or in person, at least once a week so you feel connected to the outside world. You'll be happier at work if you have more love, family, and friendship in your life.


When you feel like you're too busy to return a friend's call, ask yourself if there's something you can cut back on to give yourself time to do the things you love. Chances are, you can spend half an hour less watching TV, browsing Facebook, or repeatedly hitting the snooze button and devote that time to catching up with someone you care about.

, Though there are many things you can do to be happier at work, there may come a time when you realize that nothing you do can truly make you happy at work. Maybe it's because you're treated unfairly in your workplace. Maybe you're doing something you don't really believe in instead of pursuing your passion. Maybe you just feel completely worn down and uninspired. If you've come to the conclusion that nothing you do can really make you happy at work, then it's time to start looking for more meaningful, fulfilling work.


Of course, finding an amazing job is easier said than done in today's job market. But even beginning the act of looking can give you more hope and meaning in your life.

If you can't do your job well, you will lose customers and you may become a liability, meaning that you lose the company money. To ensure you do your job well, you must learn how to do it to the company's standards. Learn from other employees, get a mentor, enroll in training courses and be eager to learn as much as you can. The results you get at work are ultimately what you will be judged on.


This is the most important part. The whole reason the company employs you is to perform in this job role. Do it correctly and do it well.
Self-improvement and networking are important, but if your performance slips because of them, you won't be doing yourself any favors.Think about the company's return on investment (ROI) on you. How much money are you making for them in relation to your salary? Doing so will help frame your contributions and help you find ways to increase your measurable value.;
, Organize your tasks from most critical to least. When you've determined the most important 20 percent of your tasks, mark them separately from the rest. Spend the majority of your time and effort working on these, leaving the others to be completed quickly when you need to. This will allow you to do your best work on the most important tasks, rather than spreading yourself thin over both critical and non-critical tasks., Valuable employees don't stop working when the clock strikes five o'clock. If you have work to do on a project, stay later and get what you can done after hours. When you go home, bring your work with you and get it done around family time. Always be ready to respond to after-hours emails as well. This extra effort will get you noticed as a hard worker.Understand that this work is not overtime, which requires additional pay, but simply additional work with no expectation of additional pay.
Going the extra mile should also apply to the quality of your work. Some people do a good job and leave it there, whereas others will offer to do extra.
For example, some employees will offer to mentor, train new employees and suggest more efficient working procedures. Consider organizing charity and social events that bring company employees together and contribute to the community.
Doing so will improve your reputation and the reputation of your company at the same time., Companies often want their workers to be ""self-starters,"" and for good reason. Employees who see problems and take the initiative to fix them save their bosses time and work by not waiting to be asked to fix that problem. Don't ask for approval before starting additional work or carrying out a customer request; just do it. If you have an idea of something that could add value to the company, approach your manager about it., A valuable employee is one that can be counted on to consistently meet and exceed the demands of their position and managers. Provide reliable work and consistently meet your deadlines to gain the reputation of being a responsible employee. Responsibility also extends to your mistakes. When you mess up, own it by admitting the error and taking responsibility, then immediately working to find a solution. Overall, work to gain a reputation as someone your employer can count on., Go beyond being good at your job; be the best at it. If you want to become truly invaluable to the company, become known as an expert in your field. Learn everything about your role first and strive to become excellent at every task you are required to do. Then, learn how to perform the tasks that your coworkers do that relate to your own. Look for extra details or facts that no one else knows.


Keep up with industry news by reading trade publications and relevant news articles. By doing so, you will become the person that everyone comes to for information.You can cement your expert status by attaining industry or occupation-specific certifications, if available.

, Having a wider skill set can make you more versatile, which can help you branch out in your current position and remain onboard if the company decides to lay off some workers. Look at gaining skills that your coworkers have, even if you don't need them for your job. These might include technical or vocational skills. To make yourself truly valuable, you could even try learning a second language.


Just make sure to learn one that might be useful to your company; there's no point in learning Russian if your company primarily operates in the United States and Mexico., Find someone higher up than you in the company and make an effort to connect with them. This mentor can provide you with deeper knowledge of company operations and advice on how to thrive as an employee. Working with this person shows your superiors that you have a desire to learn and grow within the company. It can even get your name out there as an ambitious employee., A strong network is a valuable tool that can be used to strengthen your own value at work or increase your value to a future employer. Work to build up a network with your coworkers and in other departments at work. You should also look outwardly to clients and other members of your industry. Make and maintain strong relationships with these people. It's very valuable to be known as the employee with connections that can be used to solve problems.Work to build up your network both inside your company and outside. Attend work functions, conferences, and industry events to network with professionals in your industry. Then, be sure to regularly keep in touch with your contacts.
Provide your contacts with favors without the expectation of having them returned. This is a good way to solidify your position with them and construct a strong network that you can use to further your own career.
Another way to increase the strength of your network is to get published in the media or industry journals. This will get your name and your company's name out there, and may lead to greater recognition and increased business opportunities., Be innovative and bring something new to the company. Come up with new ideas that could possibly be implemented across the business. Just make sure that you get credit for your ideas. Otherwise, you may be helping your boss to succeed without moving up yourself.


Focus on working effectively with your team or group, as these skills are crucial to displaying management potential and usefulness to the company.

, Depending on your job, you may find it worthwhile to obtain higher education. For example, some positions may require a bachelor's degree or graduate degree, meaning that if you want to move up, you'll have to get the required education. Even if you don't need it for a certain position, a degree can make you a more competitive applicant for any role. In addition, it can educate you on how to increase your own knowledge and productivity.


Make sure to weigh the costs of higher education versus the benefits; you don't want to be hurt by debt hanging over your head.Your company may give allowances for or provide continuing education for its employees. Talk to your supervisor and/or human resources for more information.
You can also reduce your cost and time commitment for continuing education by studying online with a self-paced course. This will allow you to learn without interrupting your work schedule.

, If you start work at 9am, it is better to get into work at 8:45am. This way you have time to make yourself a quick drink and then be ready to start work on time. Time is money and an employee who turns up late on a regular basis may lose the company money. Ideally, you should arrive and begin work early, before other employees. Punctuality is the foundation of building trust. Your goal is to give the impression that you care more about the work you're doing than just fulfilling the basic requirements of the job., You should dress yourself and behave according to your company's policy, both inside and outside of the office. As an employee, you represents company. For example, if you are in an office, a shirt and tie may be required. If you are working on a building site, personal protection equipment may be required. Adhere to the company's standards for conduct in all instances.


A company will always state the dress code, although there may be occasions where you are unsure on what to wear. For example, you may be attending a conference and are unsure whether to dress in a suit or go for a more casual look. In these cases, it is always best to look to a more senior member of staff and follow their example.
Focus on maintaining your appearance by improving your personal hygiene and making sure that your clothes are always neat and clean. Having a professional appearance will lead to being taken more seriously at work., Social media is designed for sharing opinions. However, these days it's possible that your employer might see anything you post to a social media account. Accordingly, your posts should never include negative comments about the company, your managers, customers, or other employees. You should also avoid sharing any racist, insensitive, violent, or distasteful comments.


A good rule of thumb is to never post anything that your mother would not appreciate.
Never post sensitive company information on social media.
Any post that is offensive or otherwise against company policy could result in your termination., Your personal life should stay behind you when you enter the workplace. Even if things are a mess at home, don't let that show at work, and certainly don't bring it up or complain about it. You want to be known as someone who is positive and works hard, not someone who constantly has difficulties in their personal life. This will draw the wrong kind of attention to you., It's important to be friendly with people at work. Your colleagues may need help at times and they may find it difficult to ask you for help if you are aggressive or unpleasant. Being personable helps to promote a good working environment. Strive to be the person that everyone enjoys working with. Never gossip or become involved in office politics, regardless of how you feel about a situation or coworker., To be at your best throughout the workday, you'll have to remember to maintain your own health. Staying active, eating well, and drinking enough water will give you the mental clarity that you need to perform. It will also contribute to your professional appearance and improve your mood. To improve your health, remember to bring healthy lunches and snacks to work and try taking a walk during the day."

Network.",How to Be Indispensable as a Senior Employee,"


Be a valuable senior employee by retaining lucrative relationships with clients you've worked with for a long time. Clients that have worked with you for a while will continue to provide business for your company if you continue your relationship with them, which will make you valuable in the eyes of your superiors. These long-term clients will give you an edge over your younger colleagues.;
,


Make sure that you continue to perform regular tasks as needed, arrive at work on time and meet regular deadlines. This will help you be an indispensable senior employee by showing your employers that you still perform your job duties efficiently and punctually.

,


Retain your position as a senior employee by helping employees that are newer than you instead of alienating yourself from them. Offer advice if a new employee is struggling with a project or help out with handling a difficult client. This will show your employers that you care about the overall well being of the company.

,


Participate in educational and skill-building programs that pertain to your job. Focus on programs that offer education on technological advances, as many of your younger colleagues will have degrees focusing on this. This will help you prevent stagnation in your job position and allow you to remain competitive with newer, younger employees.

,


Show your employers that you're indispensable as a senior employee by displaying extra effort at your job. Turn projects in early if possible, stay late or come in early if extra help is needed, and accept requests to work overtime or take on an extra project or task to help out. These are all opportunities to show employers that you have the experience to get the job done.

,


Find areas in the workplace where your experience as a senior employee is valuable and capitalize on them. Create a new database for organizing projects that resolves deadline issues, develop new ideas for customer care or implement a new organizational system for employee requests or input. Making efforts like this will improve productivity in the workplace and show employers you're willing to put in the extra effort to do so.

,


One advantage of being a senior employee is having an established network of contacts and colleagues. Keep these business relationships up to date and don't be afraid to use them to give yourself an edge over younger, less connected employees.

Make your business practices transparent.",How to Be a Middleman," When you go to work as an independent middleman, you'll be establishing your own business. Start-up costs are fairly low for this type of work and you can get started quickly, but you still need to treat your work as a business both professionally and legally.


On a basic level, dedicate the basic space and supplies needed to do business. You should have a separate business phone line, a fax machine, and a business e-mail address. If possible, dedicate a separate computer and corner of the house for business purposes alone.On a more advanced level, familiarize yourself with the legal side of establishing a business. Set yourself up as a business entity. Research any restrictions involved on how the product/service you want to provide can be traded. Make sure that you know how to file your taxes and do so accurately when the time comes.;
, Observe the marketplace and look for a niche you can slip into. The biggest need will be in an area where the supply and demand structure is sluggish or does not otherwise satisfy the consumers and suppliers.


Services or specialty products are usually easier industries to break into as a new middleman. Generic products that are readily available are often purchased direct from manufacturers, and convincing a retailer to change can be nearly impossible if the system it currently uses works well.

, Determine who the consumers of your chosen product or service are. Depending on the nature of your intended business, these consumers might include both local and non-local buyers.


When you're dealing with a product, this usually means researching retailers who would be interested in selling that product. Research local retailers by looking in the phone book or searching online. Research non-local retailers by looking through online databases of retailers. Focus your search on small and medium businesses instead of major brands.When you're dealing with a service, you may need to rely on more traditional advertising to find individual consumers and business entities in need of that service. Start with the parties you first observed the need through—oftentimes, this will be someone you know personally or a local business. Work through that source to find other potential buyers who face similar issues.

, After making a list of potential buyers, give them a phone call. Find out what they need and what you can do to encourage them to buy through you.


You can send an e-mail to touch base with your potential buyers, but contacting consumers by phone can often leave a more professional impression, especially when you're dealing with businesses instead of individuals.
When you contact retailers, try to speak directly with the purchasing manager. Ask that individual if he or she would be interested in seeing a wholesale price list. If the answer is ""yes,"" promise to get that list to the retailer within a few business days.

, Find as many potential suppliers for your chosen product or service as possible. Do your research on each one and narrow down the possibilities to the top ten.


When dealing with products, you need to search for manufacturers. Unless your focus is strictly on a local product, this may mean searching for international manufacturers.
When dealing with services, the suppliers will usually be local.

, Contact your potential suppliers and ask them to provide price quotes on a certain quantity of product or quality of service. After gathering these quotes, compare them and determine which suppliers offer the best value.


Take into consideration the entire value of the quote. The supplier with the lowest quote may not be the best one if the product it supplies is dramatically inferior to the product another supplier offers. The same can be said for suppliers of services.

, You will earn money being a middleman by earning a certain commission from each sale you make. While the exact amount can vary, commissions of 10 to 15 percent are common for many industries.


Note that suppliers who already work with other middlemen may have a set commission fee they allow middlemen to charge. Determine if this is an issue before you try setting your own commission.

, Make contact with your list of potential buyers again. Deliver the final cost of the product or service with you cut included in it.


Factor other fees you'll need to worry about, like taxes and shipping costs, when providing the final cost to your potential consumers.

, While middlemen can thrive in some industries, most industries are working to cut them out of the picture completely. If you cannot make your value apparent to both consumers and suppliers, your business may not last long.

, Avoid stretching yourself too thin by specializing in one type of product or service. Prevent yourself from being made obsolete by diversifying the sources and specifics of the overall product or service you specialize in.


Regardless of the product or service you work with, it is generally safer to work with multiple suppliers instead of a single source. If you only work with one supplier, your business goes under as soon as your supplier's business struggles or your supplier decides to stop working with you.Consumers may also recognize that your business is at risk if your supplier suddenly cuts you off, which may discourage them from trusting or relying on your business.

, To prevent your suppliers from also becoming your rivals, you need to make sure that your customers are loyal to you and not to the brand they receive from the supplier.


Working with multiple suppliers is one way to accomplish this. With no one supplier to become attached to, the customer is more likely to become attached to you.
Another way to encourage customer loyalty is to focus on the entire sales experience, including both the pre-sales and post-sales portions. Regardless of the product or service you provide, you should also provide excellent customer service.

, The quality of the product or service you provide to consumers must be top-notch, and the quality of the overall experience you offer to both suppliers and consumers must be of a high grade, too.


You can maximize success by becoming the person your buyers and suppliers turn to for a better experience.
For suppliers, this means expanding their customer base and taking care of a portion of their marketing.
For consumers, this means delivering the best product or service for the cost they are able and willing to pay. Sift through the junk and evaluate all the different options before offering the best one.

, Nowadays, a new business without an active digital presence will struggle. Make the process as convenient as possible to your suppliers and consumers by making it easy to access your business through both computers and mobile devices.


Create a website and establish social media accounts to interact with suppliers and consumers.
Through your website, consumers should be able to learn about the process, contact you, search for products/services easily, create accounts, and place orders. Billing and order fulfillment information should also be readily available.Moreover, your digital presence must also extend into the mobile world. Make sure that your website can be easily navigated on smart phones and other mobile devices. When applicable, consider using mobile apps to streamline the process even further.

, Nowadays, people have become accustomed to a sense of instant satisfaction. Middlemen are negatively associated with slowing down the process of trade. Avoid slowing the process down and, if possible, look for ways to make it faster for both consumers and suppliers.


When appropriate, consider placing time restrictions on the delivery of payment and the delivery of the product or service. Make sure that all sides know your restrictions and agree to work within them., Your consumers and suppliers should have no trouble getting in touch with you and receiving timely responses to their comments, questions, and concerns.


Make it easy for the parties you work with to contact you by phone, e-mail, and fax.
If someone on either side of the process has a problem, address it immediately and keep the party informed during each step of the solution. Avoid leaving suppliers and consumers in the dark.
Treat both suppliers and customers well during your exchanges.

, The idea you have in your head may not be the best course of action. Be receptive to feedback from both consumers and suppliers. Prepare yourself to adjust your business accordingly to better suit the needs of those you're in trade with.


Watch both sides of your business carefully to determine how well your current process works and where you might need to improve. Consider asking the parties you work with to rate the experience or answer a few survey questions about it.

, People like to know that they can trust the businesses they work through. Make it clear to your suppliers and buyers how you run your business and how the money flows.


When asked, let your consumers know the source of your supply. Many buyers express an interest in this information so that they can determine whether or not they wish to support a supplier's business practices.
Break down the cost for your buyers so that they understand exactly where the money is going. This can prevent them from feeling betrayed later on if they learn the information from another source.

The constant walking is a good distraction in itself and talking, singing and joking with your friends can take your mind off how you're feeling and keep your spirits high.

, Think about all the effort you've put in to get this far and how much it means to you to complete the award. Keep yourself motivated with snacks and possibly group sing-a-longs.

, This way, your supervisor will know to keep an eye on you and will be prepared if you take a turn for the worse. Your friends will be more sympathetic and slow the pace down if they know you're unwell.

, Don't add to your illness. Keep hydrated and make sure you're eating enough (about 3000-5000kcals a day). Wear a sun hat and plenty of sun cream if it's sunny. Do this in order to avoid sunstroke. Also, keep warm and dry if it's cold, make sure you bring plenty of layers and an effective sleeping bag and sleeping mat.

Consider bromelain.,
Ask about an iron supplement.",How to Cope with Endometriosis Symptoms at Home1," The most distressing symptom of endometriosis is the pain and cramping that can occur in the abdomen and pelvic area. Fortunately, you may find that your endometriosis pain can be relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and aspirin. These drugs are good for any type of period cramps.If your pain increases during your menstrual period, consider starting to take NSAIDs about 24 hours before your period is due.Talk to your doctor about the best regimen of NSAIDs for you. In general, though, you can take 400 to 600 milligrams of ibuprofen orally every four to six hours.For naproxen sodium, you can usually take 275 milligrams every six to eight hours, not to exceed 1375 milligrams in any single day.Alternatively, you can try 325-650 milligrams of aspirin orally three or four times a day. Don't go over 4 grams. Always talk to your doctor before taking any medication.;
, NSAIDs are not for everyone, as they may cause you to feel nauseated. They may even cause you to vomit or have diarrhea. If that's the cause, you can take acetaminophen (known as paracetamol in the UK) instead.The typical dosage of acetaminophen is 650 to 1000 milligrams every four to six hours. Do not exceed 4000 milligrams in any single day. Do not take more than your doctor recommends, as acetaminophen can cause liver damage if used incorrectly. Drinking alcoholic beverages increases this risk., Chasteberry is an herb that some women use to help regulate their hormones. Since the main way to control endometriosis is through taking hormones, chasteberry hormonal regulation may also help.Talk to your doctor first, as this herb should be used for at least a year to make a difference. It can interfere with other drugs, including your hormonal therapy, as well as Parkinson's medications and antipsychotic medications.The standard dosage is 400 milligrams every morning., This medication is used to help with pain. However, it can also interact with other medications, too, so always talk to your doctor first.Try taking 40 milligrams morning, noon, and night.It can also make any blood thinners you're taking more effective, which can cause issues., If you've been bleeding heavily for a long time, you could be at risk for anemia.

Establish your brand.,

Advertise.,
Network with other professionals.,
Inform your personal network of your availability.",How to Be a Contractor2," Just because you aren't a big company, that doesn't mean you shouldn't have a vivid professional brand. Here are a few points to consider:


Decide whether you will use your own name or work under a business name.
Don't be afraid to invest in business cards, a logo, uniforms and a sign to put outside your home or business. Make sure all of them are consistently branded.

, Make it clean and professional. Use a logo or imagery that conveys your business or service. Include details about your offering and your prices and try to demonstrate your skills. If you are a designer or a writer, put up samples of your work. Let people know how to contact you.

, Actively marketing your services is vital to get your name out there, and it shows prospective clients that you're available for work. Consider these avenues:


Investigate online advertising. This could include setting up social media accounts for your business, sending emails with special offers, or signing up for ads.
Pursue print publishing. Buy up space in your local newspaper, or find a trade publication that caters to people in your industry and pursue an ad there.
If there are publications or web pages that compare different contractors who offer the same services, make sure to get yourself listed.
Describe your services in brochures. You can hire a professional to make them for you, or build them yourself using software like Microsoft Word or Open Office.
Consider enlisting the help of a copywriter to highlight your unique skills and strengths.

, The right connections can make all the difference in running your own business.


Attend networking events and join organizations. If you work mostly locally, consider joining your city's chamber of commerce.
Notify other contractors in your field about your availability—and find out their's. If another contractor is too busy to take on a gig, they might pass the client on to you. Do the same for them, when you can.
Partner with those that can send you business leads. For example, if you are a copywriter, connect with graphic designers whose clients may also need marketing copy for their websites.

, Contact friends, family members and former colleagues to inform them of your services. Ask them to spread the word to potential clients.

Whenever possible, avoid scheduling demanding and time-consuming events and activities if you consistently have a heavy period.


Another symptom is breakthrough bleeding, so always having period supplies on hand is helpful., Also, make sure you get a bit of extra salt in your diet when you are bleeding heavily. A sign you need to do this treatment is if you get dizzy as you stand up or your heart beats too fast or hard after laying down. Drink at least 4 cups of extra water.You can also try tomato juice or broth, which tend to have salt added in., If your flow is very heavy, you may need to use a combination of products to help protect yourself. For instance, you can use a pad and a tampon together to help stem the flow.You can also use a menstrual cup in place of a tampon or washable pads in place of throwaway pads.Always have supplies on hand just in case.

, When you do use pads, consider using the longer, wider versions or the top-of-the-line versions that are more absorbent. Wings can also help protect you from spillage."

Join a support group.,
Exercise daily.,
Reduce your intake of refined carbohydrates and processed sugars.,
Eat a variety of healthy foods.,

Don't forget to see your doctor.",How to Cope with Endometriosis Symptoms at Home4," Talking with other people who struggle with endometriosis can be extremely helpful. Discussing the condition, sharing coping techniques, and venting your feelings in a supportive setting will make you feel better.Ask your doctor if she knows of any support groups in your area.

, Exercise prompts your brain to release endorphins and other substances such as serotonin, which make you feel good. In other words, exercise can help with the pain of endometriosis.In addition, exercise can help prevent endometriosis, though the jury is still out on what effect it has on an already existing condition.Try for at least 30 minutes a day 5 days a week or 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week. Aerobics activities include swimming, running, playing a sport, or climbing stairs, for instance. You should also do strength training at least twice a week., Reducing your intake of refined carbohydrates and processed sugars may improve symptoms like nausea, bloating and fatigue.Most women with endometriosis should include extra sources of iron in their diet (such as beans, peas, and dark, leafy greens) to supplement the iron lost during menses. Talk to your doctor about testing you for iron-deficiency anemia.


Try to eat foods that are known to be anti-inflammatory, which may help control symptoms. Tomatoes; olive oil; green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, kale, and collards); nuts (almonds and walnuts); fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines); and fruits (strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and oranges) are all anti-inflammatory foods that you should incorporate into your diet., Keeping your body as healthy as possible may help you manage your symptoms more effectively. Aim to consume a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.If you are unsure about how to eat healthfully, consider making an appointment with a nutritionist. He or she can help you put together an ideal diet plan.
Also, try to skip common food allergens. For instance, preservatives, corn, and soy are common food allergens., Meditation may help you cope with pain more effectively.Deep breathing can be especially helpful in relieving pain.One simple method of meditation is deep, relaxed breathing. It involves focusing on just your breathing, blocking out all other thoughts and sensations. Close your eyes. Count to four in your head as you breathe in through your nose, hold for four counts, and count to four as you breathe out. Continue doing this exercise until you feel yourself relax. Also, meditation can help you cut down on stress, which in turn can help your symptoms., If you think you may have endometriosis, it's important to see your doctor before implementing at-home treatments. Your doctor can diagnose whether or not it is endometriosis and help you get on medication you may need.In other words, if you have excessive bleeding during periods, bleeding between periods, or very painful periods, it's a good idea to see your doctor."

Develop time management skills.,
Go to the (home) office.,
Know you tax responsibilities.,
Keep track of your earnings and expenses.,
Don't forget your benefits.",How to Be a Contractor3," Contractors must structure their own time, which is different from the set schedule of a nine-to-five job. Here's how to start tailoring your time to your tasks:


Block out time on your calendar for completion of each task.
Allot time for administrative tasks, such as invoicing and marketing.
Schedule time off for lunch or a short walk, to avoid working without breaks.
If you are charging by the hour, make sure you stay focused when working and try not to multitask.

, If you do your work from home, it can be tempting to just work in bed all day. Don't do it! You will be more effective and organized if you develop a routine and set aside a room or desk just for work.


Make sure your workspace is in a room where you can get away from the bustle and noise of pets and kids. Don't let your work materials spill out onto the kitchen counters or dining table if you can help it.
Keep your business documents organized and in one place, like a filing cabinet or, if necessary, a document safe. Back up important files on your computer.
Set ""office"" hours and stick to them. This is important if you want to maintain work-life balance.

, Unlike a salaried job where taxes are deducted from your paycheck, as a contractor you pay self-employment taxes yourself. Understanding your tax liability is important for paying the right amount of tax on time.


The IRS requires self-employed individuals to file an annual return and pay estimated taxes quarterly.Save your receipts from business expenses—they're tax deductible. Don't forget to keep them organized, preferably with a regularly-updated spreadsheet. You don't want to be stuck sorting through half-remembered receipts whenever tax time rolls around.
You may need to collect sales tax. To do this, register with your state’s department of taxation., You will need to do this to accurately file your taxes, but keeping track of your income and expenditures is also key to managing your personal finances and making strategic decisions about your business.


Maintain a spreadsheet of all your clients and projects. Review this data occasionally and decide if you should change your prices or find ways to cut expenses.

, Most companies do more than just pay their full-time employees: they help them buy medical and dental insurance or save for retirement. If you are self-employed, you will have to take care of these necessities on your own.


Organizations like the Freelancer's Union can offer contractors group-negotiated benefits in some states.
Having proper insurance is especially important if you work in construction, carpentry or another physical labor profession. If there is an accident, you don't want to go bankrupt.

One of the worst mistakes you can make in any career is to follow or try to live up to someone else's expectations instead of following what you know is best for you. For example, if a parent, aunt or uncle, grandparent or someone else in your life insists that you follow a certain pathway but you feel it just isn't working out for you, then listen to your inner self and not that family member who means well but simply isn't you.


What does your heart tell you? Your head might insist that Uncle Gustomeyer is absolutely right about making millions in finance but your heart might be content with being a poet at the corner cafe you run yourself. Whatever drives you, listen closely. Life is too short to be following in someone else's footsteps.
You may hurt people if you change career. But that's a small price compared to a lifetime of servitude to a job you absolutely hate.;
, There are some days when you'll wish you never went to work but stayed in bed. These will be the days when you do something wrong, break something, lose something, say something you regret or simply don't perform well at a time it matters. However, these things happen to everyone in the early stages of their career (and later too) and most of the time, it's about learning and not repeating whatever didn't work out. The mistake is to view such mishaps as all-encompassing cock-ups that ruin your career. They don't, well not unless they involved embezzlement or murder but then you wouldn't be reading this if that were your problem. The best you can do is to apologize, promise whatever it was won't happen again on your watch and that you've learned a big lesson.

, Hard-headed people may insist that work comes first, second and third. Good for them, that's their choice but be warned it's a mistake to put your work before the rest of your life. Seek to both find and implement a balance that lets you find love, have a family, see your friends, be involved in hobbies and volunteer pursuits, have down time, travel, and so forth. All those other things that go to making up you. Work wants your soul but you still own it and don't have to oblige.


Get involved in any workplace commitment to work-life balance and be part of making sure it isn't simply lip service. Be living proof of it.

, Listen and learn from those more experienced than you but don't hold back from explaining your own knowledge and thoughts when it is appropriate to do so. It is important to balance being green (not knowing your work yet) with being innovative and introducing new thoughts that can shift people beyond sticking points due to old habits.


Speak up when it matters. You'll know when it's important enough to say what needs to be said, which includes asking for a raise when it's time.
Find mentors at work. These people can help you to learn more and will be invested in your success.

, Once again returning to balance, it's important to be seen as participating in social events related to work and to have occasional catch-ups with colleagues outside work. However, it's not a good idea to do everything with your workplace colleagues and never see your other friends and your family socially. In other words, don't replace your usual friends with only having work friends; that would be a mistake. Instead, seek to widen your circle of friends by all means but don't neglect the people outside of your work.

, Your workplace reputation is worth protecting and it should reflect your reliability, integrity and ability to make good judgments. It also means being super careful about not being seen as the drunk one at office events or being a wild party type who fails to turn up to work on time.

, Coming back once more to the idea of balance, while it's important to know that you've worked hard to get where you are and that you are worth it, it's equally as important to not grow a big head and assume that you're better than others or that anyone ""owes"" you anything. Behaving in an entitled manner in a workplace will earn you enemies and you'll quickly find yourself pushed into a situation where you've been set up to fail. Be humble, smart and friendly, not arrogant or opinionated.

A group of private pharmaceutical companies produce the vaccine and distribute it to doctor’s offices and medical facilities. Usually shipments are made in July or August, and doctors are told to start giving the shot as soon as they receive it. The vaccine supply usually runs out in late fall, around October, depending on how many people seek out a flu shot.;
, Any pharmacy or medical facility should have the flu vaccine available by late summer or early fall. You can get an annual checkup from your primary care doctor and get the shot then, or you can visit a local pharmacy or urgent care. Usually facilities that have the shot advertise it, and you can assume that any primary care doctor’s office has it.


The Affordable Care Act has prescribed that insurance companies are required to pay for the flu shot. If you pay a monthly fee for health insurance, you should be able to get the shot for free.If you don’t have insurance, you will have to pay for the shot, and prices can range from $20 to $32 per dose., In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that everyone get a flu shot every year, but people who should definitely receive one are those with compromised immune systems: young children, pregnant women, and older adults. There are also chronic ailments that make you more susceptible to the flu.If you come in contact with a lot of people in your workplace, a flu shot is recommended. Healthcare workers are generally required by their employers to get the shot.
Chronic conditions that make it easier for you to get the flu include asthma, cancer, COPD, HIV/AIDS, obesity, kidney or liver disease, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis.
Although how effective the flu shot is fluctuates every year depending on what strains of the flu dominate, the flu shot in 2016 was 59% effective in preventing the flu, up from 23% the year before., The flu shot is a vaccine that the World Health Organization (WHO) commissions each year. The average flu shot contains three vaccines in one, usually two type A and one type B flu virus. You can either get a shot or inhale the vaccine through your nose.The shot version of this vaccine often contains egg whites and a small amount of the mercury preservative called thimerosal.
The nasal inhalant version of this shot usually contains no mercury preservative, or only trace amounts.
Common side effects include soreness and redness around the inoculation site, muscle pain, and nausea, while severe reactions are quite rare (but can include hospitalization).
It can take two weeks after receiving the shot to build up an immunity to the disease.

, In the workplace, there are many ways you can protect yourself from the germs that spread the flu. Although the flu shot greatly reduces the impact of the flu, you can still get this sickness with a flu vaccine. It is better to protect yourself from the flu virus, which usually circulates in the U.S. during wintertime (peaking in February or March) by washing your hands.Washing your hands at work is important because so many people touch the same objects, such as doorknobs, pens, elevator buttons, and breakroom equipment like microwaves.
Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap before and after eating and after you touch your face throughout the day.Hand sanitizer with alcohol can be a quick substitute so that you don’t have to run to the restroom all day. Remember to use it after you touch a community object.

, Since you spread germs more quickly by touching an infected surface and then accessing your eyes, nose, or mouth, being purposeful about not touching your face during flu season is important.Do things to remind yourself not to touch your face like posting a reminder sign in your office or on mirrors that you look in frequently.

, Cut back how many objects you share with your coworkers during flu season. Someone may come begging to borrow a stapler, or may want to perform an operation on your computer, but try to say no these requests as much as possible.Be polite in your refusal, offering an alternative such as letting them borrow a pair of your gloves.

, If sharing can’t be avoided, be sure to wipe down surfaces with a bleach cleaning cloth or other disinfectant. You may also want to disinfect surfaces as you move throughout your work day, such as having a bleach cleaning wipe handy for doorknobs.

, One of the best ways to prevent the flu is to boost your immune system through healthy eating. Eat foods high in vitamin C and zinc. Practice healthy eating at work by bringing your own lunch and including foods known to help prevent the flu: fish like salmon and tuna (omega-3s), oysters (zinc), garlic (antioxidants), and citrus (vitamin C).You can also take vitamin supplements that contain vitamin C or zinc to give you an even stronger immune boost.

, Although many people wear face masks to prevent their own sickness from spreading, you can also use it to save yourself. If you are going to be working closely with another person or a group, you can opt to wear a face mask so that you don’t share any airborne germs.

, Instead of washing your hands all day, you may want to opt for latex or vinyl gloves, especially if you work in a shared area. Just remember not to touch your face, as germs will still get on the gloves. Also remember to change the gloves after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose.

, If you do have the flu, you need to do your part to prevent spreading this disease to your coworkers. It’s just common decency, and showing your coworkers that you are being conscientious will promote workplace harmony. Start by making sure you cover your face with a tissue when you sneeze or cough, and throw it away immediately.Coughing directly into your hand is discouraged, and even though a “vampire cough” is better (coughing into your elbow), the coverage a tissue provides is preferable.

, Even if you use a tissue, your hands still come in contact with moisture from your nose and mouth. Show respect to your coworkers by washing your hands right away, either with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or going to the sink.


You may also choose to wear disposable gloves to prevent getting germs directly on your hands. If so, change them after sneezing or coughing, even into a tissue.

, If you are sick will any illness that has flu-like symptoms, even if it is not confirmed to be the flu, the best way to prevent spreading it to coworkers is to stay home. In fact, do not return to work until you have been free of fever for 24 hours., Even though the flu is often a disease that must run its course, if you feel your symptoms are bad enough, you may want to see a doctor. A doctor can prescribe antiviral drugs to reduce the time period of the flu, and can determine if you need to be hospitalized. This is a wise course of action if your flu virus is making you miss a lot of days at work., It is not a bad idea to politely ask others who say they are getting sick to stay home until their symptoms or fever pass. Just as you should stay home when you see flu symptoms in yourself, asking others to share this courtesy can prevent the flu from spreading at work.

Use fake names in the blog.,
Change important details.,
Delay writing about a real-life incident.,
Avoid posting pictures.,
Blog only when at home.,
Register your domain name anonymously.,
Mask your IP address when you blog.,
Keep Google from indexing your blog.,
Protect your blog with a password.,
Research your state laws.,
Talk about unionizing in your blog.,
Think twice before discussing politics.,
Notify authorities before blowing the whistle.,
Avoid discussing confidential information.",How to Avoid Being Dooced," You should never use your real name in the blog. Also don’t use abbreviations of your name. If your name is Jennifer Bishop, don’t call yourself “Jen B.” or “Jenny B.” Someone could still guess it is you.


Also change the names of other people in your workplace.Give them names unlike their real ones.
A good technique might be to call your boss “The Boss” and the guy in the next cubicle “Hot Guy.”;
, Depending on the details you give, people could easily deduce where you work. From there, it is a short step to finding out who is blogging. Accordingly, you should change key details about your job.Consider the following:


Change your location. If you’re really located in Chicago, set the blog in Florida or California. If your blog needs to be set in the Midwest, then choose a different city. Alternately, you could say something generic like you work in “a large Midwestern city.”Change peoples’ genders. If your boss is male, make him female in your blog. If your secretary is female, make her male.
Change the industry you work in. If you work at a newspaper, you could pretend to work at a TV station. However, if you really need to state you work at a newspaper, then change other details. For example, you can say you work at a small daily paper when you really work at a larger paper.

, To shield your identity, you should wait a week or two after an incident before writing about it.This lag time can protect you, because the people affected won’t be able to connect your blog to the incident based on the date.

, People can also use pictures to figure out someone’s location. The file’s Exif data contains information about when a picture was taken and what took it.It is also easy to use the Google picture search to find out if a picture appears elsewhere online. Accordingly, don’t post pictures about your office or photos of any real person who works in the office.


If you want illustrations, then choose stock photography. In your caption, you can make clear that you are using a stock photo.
You might also want to use hand-drawn illustrations.

, You should expect your boss to track which websites you visit during the day. Accordingly, you shouldn’t blog at work.You probably shouldn’t even read the blog at work. Instead, wait until you get home.


You can check the blog using a personal smart phone. However, make sure you don’t accidentally look at the blog on your employer’s phone.

, Your domain name is the URL that people will type in to find your website. A lawyer might have something like lawlife.com or a waitress might have a domain like alwaysserving.com. When you register your domain, choose to register anonymously.You will have to pay more to get an anonymous domain name. However, it is well worth the price.


You can register through a privacy provider. This company’s contact information is then listed in the WHOIS registry that is available to the public.They don’t provide total protection. If a court orders the privacy company to turn over your information, then the company will comply.

, If you expect your boss to find out about the blog, go the extra mile and edit the blog by masking your IP address. For example, you can work through a web-based proxy or a virtual private network.


Your IP address is a chain of numbers that is unique. This number chain is logged at each location that you visit.
When you work through a proxy, it looks as if the proxy is connecting to the website., Once Google indexes a page, it will be discoverable later on using Search—even after you attempt to shut down your blog. For this reason, you should make your blog so that it won’t be indexed by Google.


You can use the HTML metatag: <META NAME=“robots” CONTENT=“noindex,nofollow”/>.Paste this metatag in the <head> section of the HTML for the page you want to de-index.

, You might write a blog for only a select audience, such as friends, family, and former colleagues. If so, you should consider protecting the blog with a password.You can give it out to those who you grant permission to read it.


Realize that a trusted colleague could still share the blog material with people outside. For example, they could print off your blog postings and share them with your boss. Accordingly, you shouldn’t rely entirely on passwords to protect you.
Ideally, you should resist the temptation to share the blog with people you know in the first place., Many states have laws protecting workers who discuss politics or other topics outside of work. You should research your state’s laws to find out what is protected and what isn’t. Look online or contact a lawyer to discuss your state’s laws.


Some state laws are very expansive. For example, California law protects employees from demotion or termination for their legal off-duty activities.You can find a lawyer by visiting your local or state bar association. If you are low income, you can find nearby legal aid at the www.lsc.gov website.

, Many states afford strong protections to people who write about union drives in their workplaces. Accordingly, this is usually a safe topic to discuss on the website.However, you should still be careful not to blog about unionizing during your work hours. Instead, keep the activity for after hours.
Some state labor laws will also protect any speech about the conditions of the workplace if more than one person is discussing this issue.

, Some states, such as California, have laws protecting employees from retaliation based on their political speech. In these states, you can sue if a boss fires you for blogging about politics.Nevertheless, you should think carefully before you do.


It is fairly easy for a boss to find a pre-text for firing you. For example, they could claim your work is substandard. Can you really prove otherwise?
You also could alienate people at work based on your political beliefs. As a result, your work performance might suffer and you’ll feel less job satisfaction.

, Many laws protect employees who “blow the whistle” on their employer’s illegal conduct. However, these laws protect you when you report the violation to an appropriate government authority—not when you post on your blog. Make sure to report violations before blogging about them.Contact an attorney if you don’t know who to report violations to. You can find a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a referral. At the consultation, you can discuss the violation and what your next steps should be.

, Your company’s confidential information has a lot of value. Accordingly, you should never discuss this information on the blog, even when masking your identity. Confidential government information is also legally protected from disclosure.Depending on your job, you may violate your ethical obligations by discussing client confidences. For example, a lawyer should never discuss details about a client’s case in a blog.
If the case became public (e.g., by going to trial), then a lawyer can talk about the public information. Otherwise, tread very carefully.

In general, the hands, fingers, wrists, forearms, forehead, face, and V of the neck (or any place on the body in which skin may have come in direct contact or the dust or fumes of an allergen) are the most at risk of developing contact dermatitis, so look for symptoms on these areas first.Most often the symptoms will be isolated to a specific area of the skin. Symptoms may be immediate, or they may linger for a few days. Look for symptoms such as the following:Rash.
Itching.
Swelling.
Bumps or blisters, sometimes filled with clear fluid.
Hot or tender skin.
Lesions.
Burns.
Skin discoloration.;
, There are several predisposing factors that may make one more susceptible to work-related skin disease.Age. In general, younger workers are more inexperienced and more likely to take risks on the job site, which leaves them more prone to come into contact with harmful pathogens on the job site.

Skin type. In general, lighter skin color is more susceptible to pathogens on the job site than a darker skin color.

Pre-existing conditions. Pre-existing conditions may weaken your bodies immune system against unwanted pathogens. In addition, employees with chronic skin conditions (such as acne or rosacea) are more likely to develop skin reactions.

Extreme temperatures and humidity. Very low or high humidity and extreme heat or cold can cause chapping and dryness of the skin, thus weakening your skin’s natural barriers against pathogens.

Working conditions. A clean workplace is less likely to be contaminated with toxic or allergenic chemicals. In some industries, working conditions may expose you to chemicals, such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.

, Because work-related skin diseases are varied, each occupation carries its own risk. For example, medical professionals are more likely to develop immediate skin reactions from harmful agents such as radiation or solvents, and less likely to develop skin reactions that can take a long time to develop, such as exposure to sunlight or heat. Know the particular causes and risks associated with your profession, and the accompanying symptoms.For example, wearing rings is not advised for employees in so-called “wet work” (work that involves extensive exposure to moisture) because water and soap can collect under the rings and become a breeding ground for bacterial and fungal infections.

, Heat causes sweating, and in environments in which there is little evaporation of the sweat, chafing can occur when skin rubs against open skin. Chafing can lead to a secondary bacterial or fungal infection. These infections typically develop in the underarm area, under the breast, in the groin and between the buttocks – areas which typically trap sweat in., If exposed to cold for a long period of time, your skin can develop a reaction known as Cold Urticaria, which typically manifests in reddish, itchy welts or hives. Outdoor workers and those occupations which require swimming in cold water are particularly at risk., Prolonged exposure to moisture can lead to skin breakdown and disease as seen in Cold Urticaria. Food handlers, dishwashers, hairdressers, and those in the medical profession (who are exposed routinely to various types of moisture, such as urine or stool, perspiration, mucus, or saliva) are particularly at risk., Exposure to plants belonging to the Rhus genus (poison ivy, poison oak, etc.) can cause contact dermatitis, the most common occupational skin disease – typically manifesting in a rash at the site of exposure. The rash improves typically when the allergen is removed.Outdoor workers, including firefighters, park and highway maintenance workers and farmers are most at risk of developing contact dermatitis, a condition caused by exposure to foreign substances.Ensure that you're not exposed to ionizing radiation. Radiation dermatitis is caused by external beam ionizing radiation. It typically manifests as a burn or a tissue injury (accompanied by welts, swelling, cuts and scrapes and pain).Medical personnel such as radiation technicians, welders, and workers in the nuclear energy industry are most at risk of developing radiation dermatitis., Irritants exist in many different forms and can cause a variety of reactions. They can be classified as either strong or weak, depending upon the type of reaction elicited (either immediate or long-term).



Severe irritants. Severe skin irritants, such as strong acids and alkalis, heavy metals, oil, grease, or other strong material substances tend to cause immediate red blisters or burns. Like other causes of contact dermatitis, these symptoms can improve on removal of the allergen. Factory workers and laboratory technicians are most at risk of developing contact dermatitis caused by severe irritants.Weak irritants. Weaker irritants, such as soaps, detergents, solvents, synthetic oils, heat, and sunlight do not cause immediate skin reactions, but tend to cause skin changes over a long period of time. Pigment discoloration or skin cancer can take decades to develop in workers with prolonged exposure. Physicians, nurses, waiters, dishwashers, food handlers, and outdoor workers are most at risk of developing contact dermatitis caused by weaker skin irritants., Sunlight exposure is a common cause of work-related skin problems that can result in skin changes, such as pigment changes or skin cancer, when exposed to for a long period of time. Outdoor workers, including postal workers, landscapers, and construction workers, and long-haul drivers are most at risk of developing contact dermatitis caused by sunlight., If you are new to a work environment, you can learn a lot by watching other employees work, particularly those who have worked many years in the same industry. Observe what kind of care they take to avoid contact with allergens, or, in some cases, learn what not to do by seeing the risks they take. Before exposing yourself, you can see if their skin comes into contact with a substance; then decide for yourself if you want to modify the process, substitute a substance (if allowed), or use additional personal protective equipment., If you suspect contact dermatitis or are worried about exposure to a substance, do what you can to eliminate that substance from your work environment or minimize your contact with it. In most cases your employer should have procedures in place your contact with harmful substances, such as those put in place through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration., If you or your employer are unable to eliminate the allergen or harmful agent altogether, steps should be taken to adjust your work environment or isolate the hazard from the workers. The following are options of measures that can be taken:Technical measures. Adapting technical procedures that can isolate the agent, such as encasing the harmful agent in another substance or tunneling the harmful agent through an exhaust fan.

Organizational measures. In some workplaces, only qualified employees (or those who have shown competence to work around a specific agent) are allowed to perform specific tasks in the workplace. This minimizes the potential risk of exposure for other employees in the workplace.

Personal measures. In some cases, simply increasing the amount of personal protective equipment (known as “PPE”) that employees are required to wear can minimize exposure to the allergen. For example, a face mask can minimize an employee’s exposure to harmful vapors or fumes from a harmful agent., If you are concerned about your exposure to certain pathogens in your workplace, speak to you boss or supervisor immediately. Your boss or supervisor should be acquainted with the particular hazard, and can provide specific information and protocol regarding exposure. Workplace safety is regulated and monitored through the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA); your employer has a responsibility (and in most cases, is federally mandated) to maintain a safe and healthy workplace. Most employers in the nation come under the jurisdiction of OSHA, with a few exceptions in the mining and transportation industries and a few public employers.For more information regarding OSHA standards, see the OSHA website through the Department of Labor: https://www.osha.gov/

Mine safety is regulated through the Mine Safety and Health Administration.

, However, even protective equipment designed to protect employees from harmful agents have their shortcomings. The following steps should be taken to ensure the protective equipment has maximum efficacy:Protective equipment should be modified and sized to fit the individual employee. Equipment that does not fit an employee (either too big or too small) can leave the employee vulnerable to direct or indirect contact (fumes or vapors) of harmful agents.
Protective equipment should be worn in the way you were instructed to use it by your employer or OSHA. If it is stipulated that a face mask must be worn when working around a particular agent, for example, don’t pull it down or up. If it is uncomfortable, ask your employer to modify the size or try a different brand.
Replace protective equipment as needed or as stipulated. If a glove used to handle one substance comes in contact with another, it might cause a harmful reaction., Keep your skin healthy; healthy skin is less likely to react when it comes in contact with irritants. Cuts and scrapes (such as those caused by dry skin) can be a breeding ground for unwanted pathogens. Applying lotion or cream prior to work can help prevent cracks from dry skin and help your skin maintain its protective strength; but be careful to dry your skin thoroughly before starting work., Wash your hands frequently throughout the day, and immediately wash your hands after coming in contact with an irritant. Appropriate hand washing is key to preventing the transfer of pathogens. Proper technique is key to removing germs. Follow this procedure for effective hand-washing:Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Apply soap and lather hands by rubbing together with soap. Be sure to lather all parts of hands including fingers and scrub for at least 20 seconds (the amount of time it takes to hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice).
Rinse hands under running water.
Dry hands thoroughly. Wet hands are more likely to spread germs, so dry your hands thoroughly using a paper towel. Since regular towels are used and reused, they can be a breeding ground for pathogens.

, If you do come in contact with a harmful agent, time is key to minimizing your skin’s reaction. If you work around pathogens on a routine basis your workplace should have an exposure policy; find a copy of this policy. Have it memorized or make sure it is posted in a clear place in case of exposure. The course of action might be different depending the pathogen involved, but in most cases washing your hands with soap and water vigorously will be the first step.

, In cases of exposure, therapeutic measures (such as applying topical ointments or dressings) can provide relief, but a long-term cure depends on identification and avoidance of the harmful agent.If you are able to identify and isolate the allergen or offending agent in your workplace, avoid contact with it immediately. In most cases of contact dermatitis the symptoms should disappear after you are no longer in contact with the pathogen.If you are unsure about the cause, in most cases direct skin testing (patch or scratch) or radioallergosorbent testing may help to identify a specific trigger.Contact your doctor if:


If the symptoms persist after two weeks. In this case other causes outside your workplace should be explored, and your doctor can help you identify the cause.If you came into contact with metals such as nickel or chrome. In part because these metals are ubiquitous, they may cause a reaction that is prolonged. Your doctor can help you identify alternatives or means of protection from these metals.If the reaction to the offending agent is particularly malignant or painful (such as a lesion, cut, or burn) and may require immediate medical attention.

Adjust your chair.,
Sit up straight.,
Position your computer properly.,
Make objects accessible.,
Lift objects properly.,
Modify repetitive tasks.",How to Avoid Back Soreness or Pain at the Office1," Sitting for long periods in front of a desk or computer screen puts lots of pressure on your back and on the disks in your spine. A proper chair is key to preventing back pain. Try to get one that can be easily adjusted for height, back position, and tilt.


Adjust the chair height so that, when standing, the highest point of the seat is just below your kneecaps. Sit on the chair and put your feet on the floor, then adjust the backrest so that it fits the hollow of your back. Tilt the seat back or forward if you prefer; your knees should be slightly lower than your hips.;
, For proper sitting posture, sit up with your back straight and your shoulders back. Your buttocks should be flat on the seat, touching the back of the chair. Make sure that all of the natural curves in your back are supported by the chair-back.You should be distributing your body weight evenly between both hips. Also, consider using a rolled towel or other pad to give your back added support, if the chair does not already do so.

, If you are working on a computer, your screen should be set directly in front of you. Place the monitor about an arm’s length away, with its top roughly at the level of your eyes. You will have to bend your neck if the screen is too low or too high, which over long periods can be uncomfortable.Place the keyboard close to you. Your keyboard should be in front of you when typing, at a distance of about four to six inches from the front of the desk. Rest your wrists in that gap. Your wrists should also be straight when typing and level with the keyboard, your elbows held right below your shoulders and at your sides. A wrist-rest can help you to keep your wrists straight while typing and is quite inexpensive, about $20.Proper keyboard use can improve your posture just as it can help to prevent carpal-tunnel syndrome, a repetitive use injury of the wrists.Keep the mouse as close to you as possible, as well. You can also find mouse pads that have built-in padding to keep your wrists level.

, If you find that you frequently use certain objects like the phone, stapler, or paper clips, place these within easy reach. Avoid repeatedly stretching or twisting your body to reach them. Also, avoid phone strain. Think about investing in a headset if you are often on the phone, the use of which can strain muscles in your neck., Use safety if you often lift boxes or heavy objects at your workplace. When lifting, spread your feet wide to give yourself a wide base of support. Then, squat and lift slowly from the knees – not your back! Instead keep your back straight, neither bending nor twisting it, and hold the object as close to your body as you can, at the level of your belly-button.Get help with heavy objects. Don’t try to lift more than you can easily manage, and don’t overestimate what you can handle. If an object is heavy, ask for help from a co-worker or two to lift it. In the case of very heavy warehouse objects like pallets, you may also have the option of using lifting machines like forklifts., Any task that requires repeated movements or working in fixed positions for a long time can put you at risk of an overuse injury – this includes sitting in an office. Try to modify these tasks so that the stress on your back is lessened. For example, alternate demanding tasks with less demanding ones. If you work at a computer, make sure to limit unnecessary bending, twisting, or reaching, and that your workstation is correctly positioned."

Complete any necessary paperwork.,
Be prepared for an alternative process.",How to Apply for Work Study," Like any other type of student aid, work-study positions can be competitive and are often in short supply on college campuses. To qualify for a work-study position, you’ll need to be an American citizen. Qualification for work study also has relatively little to do with family income levels; even if you come from a higher-income family, you may still be awarded a work-study position based on academic merit or other factors.The same principle applies to individuals whose families have saved money to pay for college tuition: this does not necessarily prohibit you from receiving a work-study position.Even if you’re only attending college part-time, you may be able to qualify for a work-study position.;
, In order for the application to be processed, money to be awarded, and the information to be communicated to your college, the annual FAFSA deadline comes well in advance of the school year for which the work-study positions will be awarded. Each year, the FAFSA deadline is on or around June 30th. Individual colleges and universities may have earlier deadlines.You will need to complete a FAFSA form for every year that you need student aid. Even if you have been awarded a work-study position for one school year, you must fill out the FAFSA again for each subsequent year.

, To log on, you’ll need to either enter your name and other information (SSN and date of birth), or enter your FSA ID. The FSA ID is a unique username that you can use to identify yourself to the FSA website.If you do not already have an FSA ID, you can request one through the FSAID website.If you have previously started filling out the FAFSA form, you may continue your current application as a returning user. Otherwise, start a new application if you have never applied for financial aid before.
If you’re returning to the FAFSA form, you’ll be asked to enter your 4-digit Save Key. This is another personal identification measure. Then click “NEXT.”
If you have not logged on to the FAFSA form before, you’ll be given a 4-digit Save Key. Write this number down so that you’ll have it if you need to login to the FAFSA page again.

, Take your time going through the questions: answer every question carefully and correctly. Question #5 asks: “Are you interested in being considered for work-study?” Click the pull down arrow and select “Yes.” If you do not select “Yes” at this step, you will not be considered for a work study position.


Complete the necessary questions and then select “NEXT.”

, You can search schools by state, city, and school name, or with the federal school code. The college’s federal school code can be found easily online with a quick Google search. Remember to select the specific school you’re applying for a work-study position at. If you’re attending a large state school, it’s easy to click on the wrong university location.


Review the drop-down list of colleges and universities that accept financial aid. If you are applying for financial aid before making your decision about which college to attend, you can select up to five schools.
You must click the “ADD” button to officially select the school as a FAFSA recipient, or an Error message will appear.

, These include questions about tax returns, and you may need information provided by your parents. Remember work study is not given to everyone that applies for it. The federal government decides who gets it based on need and income. Awards are also dispersed on a first-come, first-served basis, so once you make the decision to apply for work study, fill out the FAFSA application as soon as possible.Answer the questions under the financial information tab, relating to annual income. After you complete the questions don’t forget to click “NEXT.”

, To complete the FAFSA, fill out all of the required fields, and read and agree to the legal disclaimer. Enter your FAFSA ID and password, then click “SUBMIT MY FAFSA NOW.”


Make sure you save your confirmation number. This number should also be sent to you in an email.

, You won’t be awarded financial aid, including a work-study offer, immediately after submitting your FAFSA—the application takes time to be processed. If you were approved for work study you will see “Work Study” in your Financial Aid Award on your school’s website before your next school year starts.


If you have applied for a work-study but haven’t received permission to register by August 1st, contact your school’s Financial Aid department.

, Filling out the FAFSA form and receiving work-study permission does not guarantee a job. Once you’ve been approved for work study, you’ll need to look for employment as you would for a regular job, by finding and applying for available jobs.Most universities will have a listing of work study positions on their Financial Aid web page.


If you’re struggling to find a list of open work study positions, contact your school’s Financial Aid office.
It’s best to look into these positions early—popular jobs will fill up more quickly than less desirable opportunities.
Keep in mind that the overall amount of money you can earn in a year will be set by the federal government as a result of the FAFSA process. Your hourly rate may be set by your work-study supervisor, and some positions will pay more than others., While the majority of work-study positions will be on campus, there will likely be some employment opportunities off of campus. These positions are federally required to benefit the public interest, so you may see job listings for local nonprofits and public agencies.Examples of on-campus work study positions include: administrative assistant, bus driver, research assistant, and janitorial staff/cleanup crew.
Examples of off-campus work study positions include: tutoring local elementary school children, working the reference desk in a public library, or serving as an administrative assistant at a nonprofit organization.

, Work study can be a great opportunity to find a job in a field relevant to your own academic interests—for example, your own department may be hiring an administrative or research assistant. A work-study position can prepare you for post-college employment, so it’s smart to apply for a position similar to a job you’d like after graduation.


You should always apply for more than one position, in case the first position fills up quickly. #* If you’re at a large university, there will be thousands of students applying for work-study positions. Apply for several to increase your chances of employment.

, This will be slightly different for every university, as each school’s online application process will differ. You will apply for work-study positions through your school’s Financial Aid website.


You may be asked to fill out an individual application for each work-study position, or to upload your resume to a web page from which various potential employers can access it.

, If a work-study employer accepts your application, the next step will be going in for an interview. Handle this interview as you would any other: be professional and present yourself well. Answer each question thoroughly, and view this interview as an opportunity to present yourself as a dedicated student who will use this opportunity to develop your professional interests and benefit your employer.


During the interview, you should also have the opportunity to discuss your work schedule. Figure out how many hours you can work per week, and make sure that your work schedule fits in with your academic schedule.Repeat this step as necessary. The first employer that interviews you may decide not to hire you. Alternately, if you’re invited to interview for multiple work-study positions, you may want to take as many interviews as possible and then weigh each position against the others.

, Since your funding will be coming from the Federal government, there may be extra paperwork to complete after your interview. You’ll likely need to visit your university’s HR department to fill out paperwork which will later be used for tax purposes., Colleges and universities can differ markedly in their handling of work-study application, interview, and hiring processes. At some, the process may be less formal than described in previous steps; employers may reach out and contact students directly, or the job-application process may be done in person rather than electronically.


Be ready to take advantage of opportunities that arise in your academic department or that you hear about through friends. Don’t hesitate to ask professors if they know of any open work-study positions, and ask already employed acquaintances if there are openings in their workplace.

Create a professional social media account.,
Search for HR employees' contact information.,
Contact the recruiter or hiring manager.",How to Ask if a Business Is Hiring1," Creating a professional social media account, like one on LinkedIn, can be a great way to network with people. When the time comes, you can use that network to get info about other businesses., Once you’re interested in finding out whether a specific company is hiring, you can use this type of account to search for employees who work there. It’s best to search for recruiters or hiring managers at the company, because they'll have the information you need.If you can't find the hiring manager or a recruiter specifically, look for employees at the company in the HR department. You can contact them and ask if they can point you in the right direction.

, Once you’ve found a recruiter or hiring manager, send them a short message. Briefly outline your educational and work background and then ask if there are any open positions in your field.For example, you can write something like: “Dear Mr. Smith, I am interested in working for XYZ Plumbing, and I noticed that you are the hiring manager there. I am a certified plumber and have 6 years’ experience working as plumber for ABC plumbing, where I was promoted twice. I’d be very interested in knowing if your company has any current openings and how I might apply. Thank you very much for your time.”
If you couldn't find the recruiter or hiring manager and instead only found an employee of the company, ask them if they can put you in contact with someone in HR. You can say something like ""Hi! I'm looking for any open opportunities at your company, and I was wondering if you could put me in contact with the hiring manager or recruiter."" Try not to add too much information about yourself - this can overwhelm your contact, and it's not information they need unless they're in a position to make hiring decisions.

Know how much time you're allowed.,
Learn if you're eligible for paid leave.,
Understand your rights.",How to Ask for Maternity Leave," The best way to get a feel for how your company handles maternity leave requests is by talking to other employees who have taken maternity leave. They may have tips on how to negotiate for a better package, and at the very least you'll know what kind of precedent other colleagues have set with their time off from work.Be polite and inquisitive. You may want to ask something like ""I'm expecting a child soon. I was wondering if I could ask you what your experience was like with asking for maternity leave."" Then gently bring up specifics, like ""How much time off did they offer you? Do they offer any kind of salary while you're on leave?"";
, You may have to decide between meeting with your manager and meeting with someone in human resources, if your company has an HR department.


Begin the process by first speaking with your manager, as your direct supervisor will be the one most likely to recognize your strengths and value within the company.Consider talking to someone from human resources if you believe your supervisor will not be sympathetic to your needs. However, be aware that someone working in human resources may be less flexible on company-wide policies.If you are not on good terms with your manager, you may have better luck speaking with someone from HR.Never make demands. Aim for a polite and inquisitive attitude. You may want to try saying something like, ""I recently found out I'm expecting a child. I'm very excited, but I want to know how this will affect my work life.""

, Some companies have firm guidelines in place that meet the minimum state or national requirements for providing maternity leave. Other companies have more of a loose minimum in place, with the option to negotiate for more time off or a better salary during maternity leave.Your options may depend on how family-friendly your company is, and there may even be some variance within the company from one department to another.Broach the subject as a question or a problem you're hoping to work together on. Never act demandingly or threateningly.Discuss your request in terms of an experiment for the company, rather than an exception to the rules.Use your best judgment. If other workers are being laid off and your company is downsizing, or if you and your boss do not get along well, it may be unwise to try and negotiate the terms of your maternity leave. In these cases, it's best to take whatever is offered, provided that offer meets the state or federal mandates that govern maternity leave., The requirements for how much notice you must give before your anticipated leave will vary from state to state and country to country. In some places, there may not be an explicit requirement. Other regions may have specific requirements. Talk to someone from your company's HR department, or check online for your region's department of labor (or a similar agency) to learn what's required of you.


In the UK, employees must deliver the request for maternity leave at least 21 days before the start date of the employee's leave.In the United States, employees must give at least 30 days' notice prior to the anticipated leave date.Find your country's required notice policy by searching online. You can also contact the department of labor or a similar agency.
Try to give as much notice as possible. Your employer will appreciate the extra time, as it will make it much easier to delegate your work and/or find a temporary replacement., If you're expecting a child and need to request time off for maternity leave, it's best to submit your request in writing. In fact, some employers may require that such requests be delivered in writing.This will vary from one country to another, and even from one state to another, but it's best to have a written, dated request for time off. This can help prevent any disputes from arising over when the request was made or how much time was requested. You can find some excellent sample letters at https://employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/parental-leave/how-to-apply-for-parental-leave/parental-leave-forms-and-letters/.


Use one inch margins on all sides.Choose a professional font, like Times New Roman or Arial. Use size 12 font throughout the letter.Address the letter to your immediate supervisor or HR representative, and include the full date on which the letter was written and delivered.Use professional language. Address your supervisor as Mr. or Mrs., followed by their last name. If you do not know the name of the supervisor or HR representative who will be reviewing your request, you may address the letter ""To Whom It May Concern"".
Use a colon after the salutation and a comma after the closing.Skip a line after addressing the letter.Use either block form or indented form. These are the two most common formats for business letters. Block form keeps all the text aligned along the left margin (including the closing and signature lines). Indented form indents the first line of each paragraph one-half inch from the left margin, and lines up the address, closing, and signature lines to the right of center.Be clear and concise. Make sure your letter says in no un-certain terms, ""I wish to request parental leave,"" or something similarly phrased.Specify the requested time period. Give your employer an estimated start/end date, and mention how many weeks this adds up to.Offer a certificate from your doctor or midwife that will verify that you are pregnant and specify the anticipated due date., Once again, whom you submit the request to may depend on the structure of your company and your relationship with the management at your company. Submit the request, and keep a copy for your own records.

, One way to show your employer that you are committed to the company is by offering to delegate work while you're gone. Your employer may prefer to handle such delegation, but it's possible your boss might appreciate having your input on who would work best on certain tasks.Understand that not all tasks can be delegated to others, and assign work accordingly.Choose the most skilled and capable workers to take on your work. Remember that their work on these projects may reflect poorly on you if the work is not done correctly, so be sure that you trust anyone you delegate work to.Provide clear instructions on what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by. Offer instructions if the person you're assigning work to doesn't normally work in your department.Give credit to anyone who picks up your projects while you're gone. While their work reflects on you, it's important that you acknowledge that work. Give appropriate thanks and credit where it is due., You will almost certainly be out of contact for the first couple of weeks after you give birth, but once you're back home and a bit more rested, it's important to make yourself available. Even though you're on leave and you won't actually be able to do much (if any) work from home, making yourself available for questions and contacting others for updates on how various projects are going can go a long way in proving your dedication and commitment to the company.Try to check in once every week or two. You can contact your supervisor, or reach out to anyone you've delegated tasks to. This will help ensure that any projects you've left at the office are getting completed and meeting your expectations., Finding a new nanny or daycare facility can take many weeks of research and interviews. It's important that you research your options ahead of time and make arrangements while you're on maternity leave. You do not want to put these decisions off to the last minute, or you might end up stuck with a daycare situation you don't like (or no daycare situation at all).Search online. Your state may have a list or database of regulated, approved child care providers.Depending on where you live, you may even have access county-wide referral services, such as New York State's Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (CCRRs). These agencies help you find a care provider based on your needs and the time frame you're working with.Talk to other mothers. Ask questions, and look for good recommendations.
Consider whether you will need full-time or part-time care once you return to work.Consider the location of the daycare facility, how many children will be in the daycare facility at any given time, and how much these services will cost., The terms of maternity leave vary tremendously from one country to another, and even from one state or province to another. In the UK, for example, employees are permitted up to 52 weeks of maternity leave. This is divided into 26 weeks of ""ordinary leave"" and 26 weeks of ""additional leave"".In the United States, employees who meet the eligibility requirements set forth by the Family and Medical Leave Act can take up to 12 weeks of leave in a given year.There may be federal or local guidelines in place that determine an employee's eligibility for maternity leave. In the United States, for example, employees wishing to take maternity leave must work for a company that has at least 50 employees available within a 75 mile radius to cover the work that someone on maternity leave would miss. Employees must also have been employed at the company for at least 12 consecutive months and must have accrued at least 1,250 hours of work time during the 12 months leading up to the leave period.Small businesses may not be required to provide maternity leave - for example, in the United States, most small businesses would not fall under the guidelines of the Family and Medical Leave Act. However, many small businesses choose to accommodate maternity leaves, and the Small Business Administration recommends that businesses try to offer some kind of maternity leave for valuable employees., There will be a great deal of variance on whether an employer must provide paid maternity leave to an employee. Some countries have federal laws that require employers to pay employees during maternity leave. Other countries do not have federal laws requiring paid leave, but may have state or provincial laws in place. Certain union members may also be eligible for paid leave. If you're unsure about whether you're entitled to paid leave, contact your national or regional department of labor or a similar agency.


In the UK, employees may be eligible for paid leave for up to 39 weeks of maternity leave.In the US, an employer is not required by the Family and Medical Leave Act to pay an employee while she is on maternity leave. However, three states within the US - California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island - offer paid family and medical leave., In many countries, employers may not fire an employee or refuse to hire a prospective employee due to a current or future pregnancy. However, once again there is a great deal of variance in how and where these laws apply. In the United States, for example, it is unlawful for an employer to ask a prospective employee if she is pregnant or planning on conceiving. But if the employer is a religious organization or an organization that works with young people, that employer may be allowed to terminate employees for violating the organization's guidelines or ethics codes on premarital sex.Employees who believe they were wrongfully terminated or discriminated against due to a pregnancy may be eligible to file a complaint with the Department of Labor. In the United States, employees wishing to file a complaint should call 1-866-487-9243 or visit the department's website at http://www.dol.gov/wecanhelp/howtofilecomplaint.htm.
Employees outside the United States should contact their national or regional department of labor, or a related agency.

Take regular breaks.,
Stay active.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Get a good night’s rest.",How to Avoid Back Soreness or Pain at the Office2," Change the position that you sit in throughout the day. Stand up once or twice every hour to get a drink, get fresh air, or do tasks standing up, giving your back muscles time to relax. This can keep you from becoming stiff or tense. Take frequent short breaks rather than fewer longer ones, as this is better for your back., In general, the best way to prevent and recover from back pain is to stay active. If your back hurts, but you are able to go about your daily activities, resist the urge to stay in bed or on the couch. Maintain mobility, keep the muscles in use, and, if need be, take over the counter pain medication. Long-term rest will actually set you back, weakening your back muscles and making it harder to resume your normal tasks.Be sure to include physical activity in your routine, as well. One of the biggest things you can do to prevent back pain is to keep your back and its muscles strong through regular exercise. Most governments recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, spread throughout the week, along with strength training twice a week. Some exercises will specifically strengthen your back, specifically swimming, walking, and stretches that target your core muscles., Believe it or not, many back problems start with the feet and our shoes, because they affect the way that we walk. They are like the “foundation” of a building, our body. Bad shoes, like high-heels, can cause or exacerbate lower back pain, for example. Make sure that your shoes give your feet and back ample support, particularly if your job requires you to be on your feet for much of the day. Wear shoes that have rigid heels and mid-soles, like sneakers. Insoles and shoe inserts are also helpful., Sleep will always help in the healing process. It is the same for your back issues, particularly if you use a supportive mattress. Some clinical data suggests that a medium-firm mattress – not a hard mattress – provides more back relief. Find a mattress that supports the natural curves of your spine, as well. This should help you also to avoid soreness in the morning.Another suggestion is to put a pillow under your knees. Raising your knees slightly eases pressure on your back while you sleep, in fact it as much as halves it."

Search for HR employees on the website.,
Craft a polite email.,
Attach your CV or resume.",How to Ask if a Business Is Hiring2," Most companies have websites which list their HR employees. It might take some searching to find exactly who you need to talk to, but don’t give up. Most HR departments have at least a general email address listed, and often list the email addresses of individual employees.If, despite your best efforts, you can't find the appropriate email addresses, call the company. Ask if they can give you contact information - preferably an email address - for the hiring manager or recruiter.

, Once you’ve found the email address of a recruiter or hiring manager, take some time to write a clear, polite email. You should use their title, explain who you are, and what type of position you’re looking for.For example, you could write: “Dear Ms. Johnson, I have loved shopping at Forever 18 for many years, and I have recently become interested in taking my love for the store to the next level by working there. I have five years of retail experience, including two years as a manager. Are there any current openings in your company? Thank you for your time.”

, Telling the hiring manger or recruiter you have certain qualifications is one thing. Attach your resume or CV to show your contact that you actually have those qualifications."
"
Prepare what you’ll say.,
Dress appropriately.,
Ask for the hiring manager.,
Shake hands.,
Bring your resume.",How to Ask if a Business Is Hiring3," Asking about open positions in person is a little different than asking in writing. You won’t have time to revise what you say, so you should prepare ahead of time. Practice what you’ll say, including your education level, experience, and why you’re interested in that company.You might not get an interview right away, but if you have this information prepared, it can go a long way toward impressing a hiring manager.

, You should dress for these types of encounters the same way you would if you were going in for an interview. The first impression is the most important, and you want the hiring manager to take you seriously. It also shows that you’d reflect well on their company, since you dressed appropriately just to ask if there are any openings., Hiring managers are usually not out on the floor of businesses or stores. Ask the nearest employee – or the receptionist if there is one – if you could speak to the hiring manager. If they ask why, explain that you’re interested in any open positions at the company., When the hiring manager comes out, act professionally. This means shaking hands, making eye contact, and being polite. Explain who you are, and why you’re there., The hiring manager may ask for your resume after they meet you. You should have at least one copy with you. If the hiring manager says there are no current openings, you can ask if you can leave your resume for future consideration."

Determine your eligibility under the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA).,
Give your employer written notice of your need to take leave under the FMLA.,
Provide your employer with any requested medical certification.,
Find out whether your state has an unpaid leave program.,
Determine whether your state has a pregnancy-related disability program.,
Discover whether your state offers a paid family leave program.,
Contact your employer’s human resources department for information about any maternity leave benefits that it offers.,
Determine how much leave time you are entitled to under your company’s policy.,
Look to your collective bargaining agreement for a family leave provision, if available.",How to Apply for Maternity Leave," The FMLA is a program mandated by federal law that provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave under certain circumstances. The FMLA allows employees to take leave due to pregnancy, childbirth, and/or the addition of a new child to their families. Employees must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for leave under the FMLA, as follows:Employees must have worked for their employers for the last 12 months.
Employees must have worked at least 1,250 hours in the period year to the date on which they need to begin taking leave.
Employees must work at a worksite with at least 50 employees. If the employer has less than 50 employees, it still must offer FMLA leave if it has at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius of the workplace.
In many states, employers can require employees to use their accrued paid vacation and sick leave during their FMLA leave.;
, Typically, you must give your employer 30 days of your intent to take leave under the FMLA. However, if an emergency or other circumstances occur that prevent you from giving 30 days notice, you must give your employer written notice of your need to take leave as quickly as possible.Your written notice should specify that FMLA may cover your requested leave. You also need to give your employer a description of the condition that you believe entitles you to FMLA coverage.
Once you have given notice of FMLA leave, your employer must make a determination as to whether you are entitled to FMLA leave within five days.
Your employer must also provide you with information about your rights and responsibilities under the FMLA.

, You must provide your employer with medical certification from your health-care provider, if requested, within 15 calendar days of the request. The certification must provide a complete and thorough description of the condition on which your leave request is based., Some states, like California, offer job-protected unpaid leave programs that are identical or similar to the FMLA. However, some of these programs go beyond the FMLA. Some programs, for example, might offer unpaid leave to employees who otherwise would be ineligible for leave due to the size of their employees.


Contact your state labor office for information about state leave programs. Since these programs vary from one state to the next, and may differ substantially from the FMLA, you will need to get specific information about whether you are entitled to leave under your state’s program. You can find a list of state labor offices here.

Check with your employer to see what it requires for you to take leave under your state’s program. Similar to the FMLA, your employer is likely to require you to give written notice of your intent to take leave, a description of the condition that is requiring you to take leave, and the date on which you expect your leave to begin and end. Your employer also may require you to provide medical certification.

, In some states, including California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico, individuals are entitled to unpaid short-term disability leave based on their pregnancy. While the eligibility requirements for these programs may vary, one common requirement is that an individual must actually be disabled due to pregnancy, childbirth, or other related conditions. You can find information about each state’s program by clicking on the relevant state’s name.


The duration of leave under a state short-term disability program varies widely. For instance, California law provides up to four months of leave, whereas Hawaii only provides a “reasonable” amount of leave time.
The requirements to apply for leave under this type of state short-term disability program vary, as well. Typically, you must notify your employer, preferably in writing, of your intent to take leave under the program. You also need to advise your employer of the expected time and duration of your leave. Notice should be given at least 30 days in advance, or, if that is not possible, as quickly as possible.

, Only four states offer paid maternity leave to employees. If you live in California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, or Washington, you may be entitled to paid leave to care for a new child or a pregnancy-related disability.Eligibility requirements for these state programs will vary. Generally, you need to be caring for a new child or unable to work due a disability stemming from your pregnancy.
The duration of leave under such a program usually last four to six weeks to care for a new child, and 26 to 52 weeks if you have a pregnancy-related disability.
In order to apply for this type of leave, you generally must file a claim with the state agency that administers the program. You can find more information about these programs by clicking on the state in which you live: , , , or .

, You can also look in your employee handbook for information about your employer’s policies. If your employer offers paid personal or medical leave to other employees, it also must offer leave to pregnant employees or employees who have become new parents., Some companies offer extensive paid maternity leave to their employees. Other companies allow employees to use their paid vacation and sick days for maternity leave.


It is common for employees to combine employer-provided paid leave programs with federal or state government unpaid leave program to meet their maternity leave needs.

, If you work in an unionized workplace, there is a collective bargaining agreement that governs the relationship between employees and their employer. Contact your union representative to learn more about your rights under any applicable collective bargaining agreement.

, Medication can be very helpful when reducing the pain caused by endometriosis. There are several over-the-counter pills that you can take. If your pain is severe, you can also ask your doctor to prescribe a medication that you can take on your worst days.A good over-the-counter alternative is using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDS are usually the first line of treatment for women with endometriosis. Common NSAIDs include Advil, Motrin, and Aleve. Make sure to follow the correct dosage — chronic use can lead to gastritis, ulcers in the stomach, and GI bleeding.
Discuss prescription pain medications with your doctor. Be aware that many of these medications come with side effects such as drowsiness and possible nausea.

, Your doctor may prescribe hormones to help regulate your period, therefore easing your symptoms. Popular methods of hormone therapy include oral contraceptives. When taken continuously, these pills can reduce or even stop your periods from occurring.Combined estrogen and progesterone hormonal therapy is often used to treat endometriosis. They can be used for the long-term, are relatively inexpensive, and are well tolerated. Benefits from estrogen-progesterone therapy include decreasing the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer.
Combined estrogen-progesterone therapy includes oral contraceptive pills, transdermal patches, and vaginal rings.

, Depo-Provera is one option you could ask your doctor to discuss.

, If you have a particularly severe case of endometriosis and other lines of treatment have not worked, your doctor might discuss a surgical procedure. One procedure, called excision, involves a surgeon cutting away the endometrial tissue. The success of this procedure depends on the severity of the endometriosis. Make sure to find a surgeon who has a lot of experience performing this operation.Sometimes, doctors recommend a hysterectomy. This procedure removes the uterus and the ovaries. Before deciding on this procedure, you will want to think carefully about how this will affect you if you have plans for having children in the future.

There are possibilities for short term work, as well as more permanent positions. Once you have an idea about which country you would like to work in, or even if you are undecided, you should spend some time researching the various ways to find a job abroad.


The US State Department has a list of helpful links for those interested in working abroad., One option for US citizens who are interested in working abroad is to search for positions working for the US government. There are a wide-range of professions employed by the government to work in countries across the world. The largest employers are the Defense Department, followed by the State Department.Social service organizations like the Peace Corps also provide job listings and opportunities to work abroad. Peace Corps positions are voluntary, but can give you excellent experience of working in another country.
The US Department of State has a website with information about vacancies for US citizens at the UN and other International Organizations.

, One popular way to work abroad for native English speakers is to teach English. There are many opportunities for short term and long term work in language schools and education institutes across the world, where native English speakers with sufficient training are highly sought after. The requirements will vary, but often you will need a bachelors degree as well as a qualification in teaching English., Many corporations in the United States have offices in other countries. There also may be small organizations in your area that are satellite offices for international companies. Working in an organization that has international reach can lead to an assignment in an overseas job.

Sometimes looking closer to home can reveal possibilities to work abroad that you hadn't realised were there.
If you are apply at a local company, it will be more straightforward than applying to a distant foreign firm directly., As well as the specialist sites that deal with finding jobs abroad, you shouldn't neglect the major jobs listing sites and recruitment companies. Many of the largest of these organisations will operate internationally and may advertise for posts abroad alongside domestic ones.Search some of the recruitment sites and check the listings.

, Finding a job abroad can be a difficult prospect. You have to demonstrate not only that you are a good person for the job, but that you can offer something more than the prospective local candidates who will most likely take less time to adapt to the new working environment. Because of this, and the difficulties of breaking into a foreign working culture, it is especially important that you utilise your contacts and networks as much as possible.Use online networks as well as your college alumni association to create contacts with people working in your field abroad.
Once you find people who have made the move abroad successfully, ask them for advice and guidance on how you can do the same., The language requirements will vary depending on the type of job you are interested in getting. For example, if you are working for the US government abroad you may find that the majority of people in your office are American and business is conducted solely in English. If you are applying to work in a foreign firm you will probably be expected to be able to work in the native language.


Ensure you know the expectations and can meet them before you apply for a position.
Even if you do not need to be fluent in the local language to get a job, having a command of basic phrases at the minimum will make life abroad easier.
If you are not required to speak the local language you should make it clear in your application that you are keen to learn and will take evening classes once you arrive.

, When you are ready to apply for a job abroad you need to do all the things you would do when applying for a job in your home country. This includes ensuring your resume is in good order and up to date. When you are applying for a job abroad you have to consider the specific requirements of a resume in the country you are applying to work in.


This could include your marital status and the number of children you have. You need to research the requirement in the country you are applying to.An international resume is more likely to be focussed on your cross-cultural skills and how your personality matches the employers ideal profile.In Europe a resume is called a CV or curriculum vitae.

, Applying for an overseas job is similar to applying for any job. Employers will look at your skills to make sure they meet the job requirements. If you don't have a preference for what foreign country to move to and have specialized skills, do some research to find out which countries are in need of applicants with those skills.

When writing up your resume keep in mind the culture of the place you are applying to work and try to adapt to that.
Working cultures vary hugely across the world so it's important that you can demonstrate an understanding and appreciation of the working culture in the country you are applying to work in.If the jobs was advertised in a foreign language you should generally apply in that language., If you are applying for a job abroad there is a reasonable chance that at least the initial interview will be conducted either over the phone or through Skype. If this is the case you should prepare as you would for a face to face interview. Dress up smartly to help get you into the appropriate frame of mind, and consider standing up to keep your voice sounding strong., If you are going to have an interview in the country you have applied to work in, do some research on interview customs and expectations. For example, if you have an interview in Japan you will bow deeply when you enter the room, but you wouldn't do that in any other country.In China it is not the custom to shake hands when you meet someone so do not initiate a handshake, but if someone offers you their hand follow their lead.If you are in an international business environment there may be a range of nationalities and a mix of customs so pay attention to how people interact.

If the medical situation arises unexpectedly, such as an emergency or unpredicted worsening of condition, you must inform your employer as soon as possible.When you don't give 30 days' notice because the medical condition wasn't foreseeable, your employer has the right to ask for an explanation as to why it wasn't practicable for you to give the amount of notice required by law., You don't have to ask specifically for FMLA in your first leave request, but you must at least provide enough information to make your employer aware that your request may be covered by FMLA.Any additional leave requests after the first either must mention FMLA specifically, or mention the condition that served as the basis for the first request.Within five days of your request, your employer must inform you of whether you are eligible for FMLA leave., When you request leave, your employer must provide you with information about your rights and responsibilities under FMLA.

Have the employer issue an offer of employment letter.,
File Form I-140 with USCIS.,
Determine if there is a green card available by checking the DOS visa bulletin.,
If the foreign national is present in the United States in valid immigration status, file for an “Adjustment of Status” with USCIS via Form I-485.,
If the foreign national is not present in the United States, attend an appointment at a US Embassy or Consulate abroad and obtain an immigrant visa.",How to Apply for a Green Card Through Your Employer," Labor certification must be filed with the Department of Labor (DOL) by an employer and must comply with the regulations under the PERM process. The purpose of labor certification is to prove that the employer has tested the labor market to ensure that there is no qualified, willing, and able US worker who can fill the job opening. If there is such a US citizen, then the employer cannot sponsor the employee for that particular job.


To test the labor market, the employer must recruit for the position by running various advertisements and monitoring whether there are any qualified applicants for the position. Once this is done for the time periods laid out by DOL, the employer may file the application.

All advertising and legal fees for this step must be paid by the employer, not the employee.;
, This is one of the most important parts of the process because these will be used to test the labor market. The requirements should specify what degree of education is required (Bachelor’s, Master’s, none, etc.) and how many years of experience are required.

, To adequately test the job market and ensure that your case will be approved, the applicant must be qualified for the job requirements put forward by the employer.

, The prevailing wage is the minimum wage that the employer must pay the employee once he or she receives the green card. The prevailing wage is determined by the specific job requirements, duties of the position, as well as location of the position. To determine the prevailing wage, the employer can file Form 9141 online or visit the Online Wage Library., To file the labor certification online, the employer must create an account at plc.doleta.gov. To create an account, the employer must choose a username and password, fill in the company information, and designate a contact person. If your immigration attorney will be filing the application, the employer must create a sub-account for the attorney with his or her information.


Creating an account can be done while waiting for the prevailing wage determination and before any advertisements are run. Allow extra time for this to be set up because DOL may have to verify that the employer name and information matches the federal Employer Identification Number.

, There are three mandatory forms of recruitment that an employer must run for each case:


Internal posting notice — The employer must post a notice of the job opening in a conspicuous location in the workplace. It should contain the job description, requirements, and information regarding how to apply for the job. This must be posted for at least ten business days when the employer is open for business.
Two Sunday newspaper advertisements — The employer must post an advertisement in two Sunday editions of a newspaper of general circulation in the geographic area of employment.The advertisements must generally inform applicants of the job opportunity, the basic requirements, and how to apply. It need not include a full description of the job, nor the salary. If it does include the salary, that salary must meet or be greater than the prevailing wage.
Advertisement with the state workforce agency — This should contain the job description, job requirements, and information regarding how to apply for the job. It might also need to include other information that is required by the specific state workforce agency. This must be posted for 30 calendar days.

, If the job is a professional job — defined by DOL Appendix A, found at this website — or requires at least a Bachelor’s degree, the employer must run three additional advertisements out of a possible ten methods. A list of the ten additional advertisement methods are given in the regulations at 20 CFR 656.17(e)(1)(i)(4)(ii) and can be found here.

, The regulations state that recruitment must be completed in 180 days. Additionally, the labor certification application cannot be filed less than 30 days after the last advertisement. This means that you must file the labor certification application within 180 days from the first advertisement, and more than 30 days after the last advertisement.

, For all resumes received, the employer (and not the immigration attorney) must consider whether the applicant meets the requirements as advertised in the recruitment methods above. If an applicant is not shown to be qualified by the experience and education shown on the resume, no action is needed. If an applicant appears qualified, the employer must attempt to contact the applicant to determine if there is an objective reason why the applicant is not qualified for the position. All reasons for such disqualification must be documented. When finished, complete form ETA 9089 and submit the application through the employer’s account with DOL.

, Soon after the ETA 9089 is filed, DOL will email the employer a four question survey to verify that the employer still intends to sponsor the employee for a labor certification. If DOL does not receive the response within one week, it will not accept the labor certification application.

, After the labor certification is approved, the employer must file Form I-140 with the US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). This application will prove to immigration that the labor certification has been approved by DOL, that the employee has a definite offer of employment at the sponsoring employer, and that the employer has the financial ability to pay the proffered salary.

, The employer must sign the original ETA 9089 that is certified by the DOL and include it with the I-140 application packet.

, Criteria for ability to pay can also be satisfied by one of the following:

Net income — if net income is greater than the proffered wage
Net current assets — if employer net current assets are greater than the proffered wage
Employment of the foreign national — if the employer is already paying the foreign national the proffered salary



, The letter must be printed on the employer’s official letterhead and signed by someone qualified to make hiring decisions for the company. The letter should state that the employer intends to hire the foreign national once he or she receives a green card, and should include the job position, salary, and job duties drafted earlier.

, You may be able to file Form I-140 online.Include a check for the filing fee of $580 as well as any supporting documents.

, Whether a green card is available is determined by 1) the date the labor certification was filed (known as the “Priority Date”); 2) the occupation’s “Preference Category”; and 3) the foreign national’s country of nationality. If the priority date is current for the foreign national’s preference category and country of nationality (marked by a “c”), or the priority date is after the date listed on the visa bulletin, the foreign national may apply for a green card.


A job that requires a Master’s degree or a Bachelor’s degree plus five years of experience will place the foreign national in the EB-2 preference category.
All other jobs with lesser requirements will place the foreign national in the EB-3 preference category.
The DOS visa bulletin is found here and is updated each month.

, Additionally, submit these documents or pass these requirement for continued eligibility:


Apply for a work authorization and advance parole document. Having Form I-485 pending allows the foreign national to file Form I-765 and Form I-131, respectively.
Obtain a medical exam by a civil surgeon approved by USCIS. A list of civil surgeons can be found here.
Include a check for the government filing fee of $1,070
Include a copy of your passport, visa, I-94 card, and any USCIS approval notices. Also include a copy of your birth certificate.
You may apply for a green card for your spouse and children under age 21. To do so, file a form each for your spouse and children under age 21 with their supporting documents. Include a copy of your marriage certificate.

, You will be allowed to enter the US with that visa and then will be mailed your green card a few weeks later.


Send original documents to the National Visa Center. A list of required documents will be mailed to the applicant with instructions.
File Form DS-260 online. This form and its instructions can be accessed here.

Get more sleep.,
Exercise regularly.,
Modify your diet.",How to Cope with Endometriosis Symptoms2," Making sure that you are resting enough is one of the most important things you can do to cope with endometriosis symptoms. If you aren't sleeping enough, your body will be less capable of combating pain. Try to get eight to nine hours of sleep every night.Take naps when you need to. Remember, you are dealing with chronic pain. That can really drain your energy levels. Be kind to your body and rest as needed.
If you have trouble sleeping, there are several things you can do. Make sure your room is at a cool, comfortable temperature. Try to avoid electronics for at least 1 hour before you go to bed. You can also ask your doctor about sleep aids.

, It can be very difficult to find the motivation to exercise when you are dealing with chronic pain. But studies show that moving regularly can really help decrease the severity of your symptoms. Try to get 20–30 minutes of moderate exercise several times a week.Find an activity that you enjoy. For example, if you love to swim, make that part of your regular exercise routine. If you like to be social while you sweat, look for a gym that offers lots of group classes.
Recruit a workout buddy. Exercise can be more fun if you do it with a friend. Make a standing date to go for a long walk with a good friend.
Try yoga. This method of exercise can help relieve your symptoms by helping you to feel mentally and physically better.

, Studies show that endometriosis symptoms can be more severe in women whose diets are heavy on red meat and low on leafy greens. Although the research is not yet complete, it is clear that eating a more healthy, balanced diet will certainly not make your symptoms worse. It can only help.Aim to get several servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Vitamins A, B, and C can help your overall health, which can help your symptoms. Try to eat leafy greens such as spinach or kale, which are rich in nutrients.
Limit your intake of red meat. Instead, try to incorporate fish into your diet. The research indicates that the more fat in your diet, the more estrogen your body produces. More estrogen can increase your endometriosis symptoms. So try to incorporate lean proteins into your meals. Salmon and lean cuts of pork are great options.

Contact your state labor department.,
Compare state and federal options.,
Give as much advance notice as possible.,
Request leave from your manager or human resources representative.,
Provide medical certification, if requested.",How to Apply for Medical Leave2," Many states have medical leave laws in addition to the leave provided under FMLA, and your state's labor department will have information about these benefits., State programs may be your only option if your employer isn't covered by the FMLA, or if you haven't been working for your employer long enough to be eligible.


State laws may cover smaller employers and employees who haven't worked for their employers for a full year.
Even municipalities may have law requiring medical leave. For example, San Francisco has a law requiring employers to provide paid sick leave for workers when they take time off to care for their own health or the health of a family member.Paid sick days are required by law in four states, the District of Columbia, and 18 cities nationwide.
Some states provide greater totals of time off than FMLA provides, even if you are eligible for FMLA, making state leave the better choice if you need additional time.
At least five states including California, New Jersey, and New York provide temporary disability benefits to provide some wage-replacement for workers out on unpaid medical leave for their own medical conditions.If your leave is covered under both state and federal leave laws, the leave you request will come out of your federal leave time unless you specify otherwise., Check with your state's labor department to determine how much notice you're required to give your employer to take advantage of state medical leave benefits.


If your leave is covered by both state and federal leave, the notice rule that applies is whichever provides you the most benefit. Therefore, if your state law requires less advance notice than the federal law, the state's notice requirement applies., If you've decided to use state rather than federal leave and you're eligible for both, make sure you specify in your request for leave that you wish to use state leave.

, Many state medical leave laws also allow employers to request medical certification if doubts are raised as to your need for leave. In most states this provision is similar to the FMLA certification provision."

Read over your company handbook.,
Talk to a human resources representative.,
Talk to a union representative.,
Request leave following your company's policy.",How to Apply for Medical Leave3," If your company provides for medical or family leave, there probably will be information about the benefit in your company handbook or other documents you were given when you started working.


You also may be provided an accounting of accrued sick days or vacation time on your check stub.
You may want to find out how sick and vacation time is accrued and make your own calculation, in case your employer's calculations are incorrect. For example, if you've been working for your employer 40 hours a week, and you accrue one hour of sick time for every four hours you work, you should accrue 10 hours of sick time a week. If your check stub shows less, your employer isn't calculating your time correctly and your record will need to be adjusted.

, If your employer doesn't have a dedicated human resources department, talk to whoever is in charge of payroll and personnel matters about how to go about taking your leave.


If you have paid leave built up, including vacation time, your employer may require you to use that up before you use any unpaid leave available to you under state or federal law., If you work in a unionized workplace, your collective bargaining agreement may include leave provisions.


The collective bargaining agreement governs the relationship between you and your employer, and may include leave provisions for catastrophic leave or supplemental sick leave.
In addition, your union may have a leave bank in which employees can donate their unused sick days for individuals who have used all of their leave.
Your union representative can help you determine if there are any leave provisions or other allowances that are applicable to your situation., If your company has a particular policy for requesting leave, such as requiring a certain amount of notice or the use of a certain form, find out those requirements beforehand.

Warm up first.,
Sit on the floor.,
Put your legs at 90-degree angles.,
Slowly lower your chest to your leg.,
Use the 90/90 hip stretch as a static or dynamic stretch.,
Switch and do the other side.",How to Do a 90/90 Hip Stretch1," It is important to make sure that your muscles are warm before doing any type of stretching. You can do 90/90 stretches after a run or other cardio workout, or just take about 10 minutes to warm up with some form of cardio.
, To start the 90/90 stretch, find a comfortable seat on the floor or other flat, relatively level surface. You may want to sit on an exercise mat or folded towel to cushion your sitting bones.Make sure your back is neutral and your shoulders aren't hunched. Roll your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades are tucked alongside your spine.

, To do the 90/90 hip stretch, place one leg directly in front of you with the outer thigh and outer part of the shin resting on the floor, and bend your knee at a 90-degree angle. Your front thigh should be perpendicular to your body. Extend your other leg out to your side with the inner thigh of your back leg resting on the floor, and also bend the knee at a 90-degree angle.Experiment to find the best way to get into this position. It may be easier for you to place your trailing leg first, and then your front leg.
Ideally, your legs should be perpendicular to each other. Rest your hands on the floor on either side of your front leg – one beside your knee and the other beside your foot.

, To stretch and open your hips, hinge your torso forward, keeping your back flat and neutral and your shoulders squared toward the floor. Avoid hunching your shoulders or crunching your neck.If you can drop all the way to your elbows without pain, do so. However, you should only go as low as you can evenly and without pain.
Your shoulders should be roughly parallel with the floor. Avoid leaning to one side or the other.

, Once you've folded forward, you can stay in that position and breathe deeply through the stretch, or you can immediately raise up and then fold again.If you're doing the static stretch, hold the position for between 20 and 60 seconds, breathing deeply.
For a more dynamic stretch, hinge forward and hold the stretch for three seconds, then raise up. Continue this movement for 10 repetitions.
Be careful not to bounce down into and up out of the stretch because this can easily tear the muscles of your inner groin and pelvis or compress the sciatic nerve.

, Whether you're doing the 90/90 hip stretch as a static or dynamic stretch, once you've finished on one side you need to do the other so your hips are stretched evenly.To switch sides, simply switch legs so that your front leg becomes your trailing leg and your trailing leg is in front of you.
Try not to go any more deeply into the stretch on one side than you did on the other. You want to stretch your hips as evenly and consistently as possible. If one side is more open than the other, this could lead to injury.

Read your employee handbook.,
Review collective bargaining contracts.,
Craft your own plan.,
Discuss other options with your employer.",How to Apply for Paternity Leave1," See if your company policies include the option of taking paternity leave. Keep in mind that if your employer offers any kind of maternity leave for new mothers, it is required by law to offer comparable paternity leave for new fathers.Employers must offer “parental” leave, not “maternity” or “paternity” leave. Benefits that are only available for use by one gender can give rise to discrimination lawsuits.Generally, if employers make medical leave available to other employees they must have some similar benefit available for pregnancies.Some private employers are offering paid parental leave to mothers and fathers. For example, Google provides eight weeks of paid leave, while Facebook provides 17 weeks paid.;
, If you work in a unionized workplace, then you will have a collective bargaining agreement that governs your employment. Oftentimes collective bargaining agreements have certain family leave provisions which encompass paternity-related leave.

, Use your available sick, vacation, and other leave to create your own block of time off. Federal law requires employers to allow employees to use any accrued personal leave or vacation time as parental leave, as long as they follow any other requirements of the employer’s employee benefits policy.If you plan on using any accrued leave, you must follow the notice requirements of your employer’s policy.For example, suppose you have 80 hours of accrued vacation time you want to use. Your employer requires at least one week notice to use any accrued vacation time, but requires an additional five weeks’ notice if you plan to use more than 40 hours. In this scenario, you would have to give your employer six weeks’ notice if you wanted to use all 80 hours you’d accrued.
Using available time you’ve accrued in conjunction with unpaid FMLA leave allows you to continue to have some income while you take time off to spend with your new child.

, It may be possible to combine all the various paid and unpaid leave available with a flextime arrangement that allows you to spend maximum time with your new baby while also ensuring your employer isn’t too inconvenienced by your extended absence.


Maintaining a presence at work also keeps you in good standing for possible promotions or advancement later on.

Try a supine 90/90 stretch.,
Do the 90/90 trail leg stretch.,
Do the dirty dog.,
Get in some squats and lunges.,
Add a knee drag to your planks.,
Use yoga to open your hips.",How to Do a 90/90 Hip Stretch2," If you're having difficulty with the 90/90 stretch, the supine 90/90 stretch may be a good way to ease into it. The supine 90/90 stretch also is good if you have back problems, as your back remains supported.To do the supine 90/90 stretch, you'll need an exercise mat and a wall. Like flat on your back on the mat and rest your feet against the wall. You may have to experiment with different distances from the wall to see what works because you want your knees to be at 90-degree angles.
Contract the muscles in your core so that your lower back is flat against the floor. Cross your left leg over your right so that your left knee is at a 90-degree angle with your left ankle resting on your right knee.
Grab the back of your right thigh with both hands and pull your leg gently forward until you feel a stretch. Or if you have one foot up against the wall, gently push on the knee of the raised leg. Hold the stretch for about three seconds, then release. Complete two to five repetitions, then switch and do the other side.

, The 90/90 trail leg stretch is a variation of the 90/90 stretch. This stretch allows you to work on your trail leg, the leg behind you in the 90/90 hip stretch. You'll start from the same position as the 90/90 hip stretch.Internally rotate your trail leg and twist your torso so that you are facing the knee of your trail leg. Put your hands on your chest and breathe through the stretch.
If you can't put your hands on your chest and remain stable, you can rest them on the ground behind you for support. If you can't get into this position, or feel a pinching pain in your hips, stop immediately and consult your healthcare provider.

, The dirty dog is a dynamic exercise that can work well as a warm-up to stretch and loosen your hips and prepare them for more intense exercise. You can do this exercise anywhere and don't need any special equipment.Start on the floor on all fours, with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips. Keep your spine neutral and your shoulders rolled back, and engage your core. Breathe deeply.
On an exhale, lift one knee outwards and upwards. Imagine a dog cocking its leg and you will understand where this exercise gets its name. Try to make this movement without moving any other part of your body.
Slowly lower your knee back to the floor, then repeat the action with the other side. Do 5 to 10 repetitions on each leg.

, Squats and lunges are basic exercises that may already be a part of your fitness regimen. These exercises not only help strengthen your glutes and thighs but also serve to open your hips and provide increased hip mobility.When doing squats, make sure your knees stay directly over your ankles, and you're not allowing them to pull forward over your toes. The same goes for the lead leg when you're doing lunges.

, If you already include planks as part of your exercise regimen, adding a knee drag will help strengthen your glutes and hip muscles. With stronger hips, you'll have greater mobility and be at lesser risk of injury.To start this exercise, lie face down on the floor and come up onto your toes and elbows on the floor, with your forearms straight out in front of you and your elbows directly under your shoulders. Keep your shoulders rolled back so that your shoulder blades are pulled down your back alongside your spine.
Engage your core to lift your torso and legs off the floor. Hinge at your hip and bend your right knee, pulling it forward beneath your body and crossing your shin and foot across the width of your body. Lower your pelvis so it is resting on the floor behind your shin.
Keep your weight centered and avoid shifting your weight onto the right hip. Stabilize your arms and shoulders and hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat two to four times on each side.

, If you're having difficulty with tight hips, there are numerous yoga poses specifically designed to open your hips so you have less problems with tightness and stiffness.Many of these poses and stretches are beginner-level poses that you can do at home even if you don't have any experience practicing yoga.
One fun and comforting pose is known as the ""happy baby."" Simply lie on your back on a yoga mat or blanket and pull your knees up toward your chest. Grab the outsides of your feet with your hands and pull your knees wide. Create resistance by pushing into your hands with your feet as you pull your feet down with your hands. Hold for 30 seconds or longer, breathing deeply.

Prop up your pelvis for correct posture.,
Try long sitting.,
Alter your sitting position frequently.,
Switch to a standing desk.",How to Do a 90/90 Hip Stretch3," When you're sitting in a chair, you should be sitting on the two points below your pelvis, often referred to as the ""sitting bones."" Most people sit on their tail bone, which is poor posture and can lead to limited hip mobility.If you have trouble sitting correctly, place a rolled towel or blanket behind you to prop up your pelvis so you don't put undue pressure on your hips.

, When you sit with your legs extended in front of you, it helps you work on your posture so you don't have to prop up your pelvis to rest properly on your sitting bones. If you collapse onto your tail bone when you sit, this can be a good stretch to try.Sitting on a hard floor typically is best, although you may want to sit on an exercise mat, or a folded towel, for a little cushioning.
Try long sitting with both legs extended out in front of you, as well as with one leg tucked in.

, Sitting in a chair for a long period of time is a relatively unnatural position for humans, and can cause hip mobility issues. You can help lessen the damage by sitting in different positions.A cross-legged position or a kneeling position are natural resting positions for humans, as is a squat. While you may not be able to squat in your chair, it may be possible for you to get into one of the other positions as you work.
Another position that may not be possible in your chair, but that you can do in the floor, is side sitting. One leg is externally rotated and the other is internally rotated, so that you have one foot on the opposite thigh with the other foot trailing behind you. If you try side sitting, switch legs periodically so both hips get the benefit of this position.

, Sitting for long periods of time weakens the muscles in your legs and hips. If you have a desk job but you want to maintain hip mobility, spending time standing while you work rather than sitting in a chair all day may be your best option.It isn't necessary to invest in an expensive standing work station to stand while you work. You can simply put your computer on a stack of hardcover books, a sturdy box, or a milk crate. If you use a laptop, make sure it's able to ventilate properly.

Find out if your state offers paternity leave.,
Find out if your state offers paid leave.,
Calculate how to use any available state benefits.,
Notify your boss.,
File a claim, if seeking paid benefits.,
Assist with adjustments for your absence.",How to Apply for Paternity Leave2," Several states offer job-protected unpaid leave programs that are similar to the federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The state programs may be identical to the FMLA but will provide coverage to individuals who are otherwise ineligible for the FMLA because of the federal law’s requirements about employer size., Some states also offer paid leave for new parents.At present, only three states do: California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Washington passed a bill but has never implemented it.California became the first state to offer paid leave to both parents, when a 2002 state law provided up to six weeks paid leave. New Jersey offers six weeks as well, and Rhode Island provides four weeks., In some states you can use the state benefits in addition to federal or employer benefits, but in others paid state time replaces FMLA unpaid time.


In New Jersey, for example, paid leave runs concurrently with any FMLA time. Because the state offers up to six weeks of paid leave, you would be left with a maximum of six weeks of FMLA leave if you chose to take all six weeks of paid leave., Check the applicable law in your state to determine if any particular notice is required. Regardless, try to let your employer and coworkers know early so they have ample time to figure out how to cover for your absence.


It is always a good idea to notify your boss in writing. Keep a copy of the note or letter that you send.

, In states that offer paid benefits, you must submit a claim with the agency responsible for administering the benefits.


In California, you will file a claim by contacting the Employment Development Department. You can file a claim online or by downloading the form from the department website.
In New Jersey, you should contact the Division of Temporary Disability Insurance. You may get an application by calling (609) 292-7060 or by visiting this website.
In Rhode Island, you can apply for Temporary Caregiver Insurance by calling (401) 462-8420 or by downloading this form.

Confirm you are personally eligible.,
Give your boss as much advance notice as possible.,
Make plans to cover for your absence.,
Offer to work part-time or flex-time.",How to Apply for Paternity Leave3," The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires employers to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave to new mothers and fathers.The law applies to government agencies and private companies that employ at least 50 people within a 75-mile radius., Even if your employer is covered under the federal law, not all employees qualify. To qualify:


You must have worked for your employer for at least 12 months. This 12 months doesn’t need to be consecutive, but your employer doesn’t have to count any time you weren’t working towards your 12 months.For example, suppose you worked for Joe’s Bubblegum Factory for three months, then took a break for four months. After that time you returned for six months, then asked for parental leave. You’ve only worked for Joe for nine months, so you aren’t eligible for FMLA.
During the 12 months prior to the start of your leave, you need to have worked at least 1,250 hours or about 25 hours a week.New parents can use FMLA leave at any time within a year of their child’s arrival.FMLA leave is available not only for a birth, but also for an adoption or for the placement of a foster child., The FMLA requires you to provide at least 30 days’ notice.However, it’s in your best interest to inform your supervisors and coworkers as soon as possible, especially if you plan an extended absence.Within five days, your employer must inform you whether you are eligible.Your employer also must provide you with information about your FMLA rights and responsibilities. Your employer may also request a medical certification.
If certification is requested, then you have 15 calendar days to provide it. If asked for medical certification, then your health-care provide is responsible for providing complete and sufficient information about the underlying reason you need to take FMLA leave.In this situation, you will need proof of the birth or child placement.

, It is customary to leave your coworkers with as much information as they will need to stay on top of your job while you are away. Complete as much as you can before you take your leave. Also provide detailed information for those who will be taking over your work.


If necessary, inform clients of your leave and introduce them to the people who will be handling their account in your absence.
Consider making yourself available over the phone or via email on a limited basis during your leave, especially for any emergencies.

, Because FMLA leave is unpaid, it might cause you too much financial strain to take it all at once. However, with your employer’s permission, you can use the time intermittently.


You may work out something with your employer where you work half days, or only work three or four days a week. These options give you more time to spend with your new baby.Other flexible options include coming in later, working a few additional hours in the evening, or working from home.

Determine when you have the most energy.,
Consider your daily schedule.,
Determine your exercise goals.,
Factor in the location of your exercise routine.,
Experiment with both morning and evening workouts.",How to Determine the Best Time to Exercise1," Do you struggle to get out of the bed in the morning or do you wake up energized and ready to go? Are you a night owl and never get to bed before midnight?Once you establish what your sleep tendencies are, you will have a better idea of when your body is most inclined to exercise.


If you are not a morning person, do not schedule an early morning workout. You are more likely to hit the snooze button instead of getting a workout in.
Sacrificing sleep to get a workout in can result in poorer performance and make it difficult to develop a consistent routine.;
, When are you the busiest? When do you tend to schedule your most important tasks? Try to fit in your exercise before or at least around these events if possible. Some people would prefer to get it out of the way first thing, while others prefer to put it off until the end of the day when they are all caught up.


If you tend to have a lot of activities after work, you may want to exercise in the morning.
If your mornings are hectic and you have trouble making it out of the door on time, an evening workout may be best.
An afternoon workout may be good if you have time on your lunch break and do not want to sacrifice your evening or morning time.

, Are you trying to lose weight? Are you trying to improve your performance? Are trying to develop a consistent exercise routine? If you are trying to develop a routine, you may want to exercise in the morning. People who exercise in the morning are more consistent. You may not feel like exercising after a long day of work, errands, or being out on the town.If you are trying to improve your performance, afternoon or evening exercise may be best. You may experience less fatigue, quicker reaction times, and more strength and flexibility in the evening.If you are trying to lose weight, you may want to exercise in the morning before you have eaten. When you exercise in a fasted state, your body is more likely to use fat instead of carbohydrates for energy., Your house provides the most flexible time options if you own fitness equipment, but if you have a gym down the street or along the route home from work, that will make it more convenient to squeeze in a workout.


If you have an onsite gym at your job or school, afternoon and evening workouts may be most convenient for you.
Fitness DVDs and videos are other convenient at-home options.

, Start by working out at different times of the day to see how you feel and find the time that works best with your schedule. Keep an exercise log to help you evaluate each time. Ask yourself some questions such as:.


How did I feel?
Did I have trouble falling asleep?
Am I tired throughout the day?
Do I perform better in the morning or at night?
Do I feel more energized? Am I sluggish?

Keep in mind that, if you make a bad move (swing the wrong way, drop the ball, etc.),
Remember, if you're playing a game with many players (soccer, football, hockey), try to stay where the ball isn't going to be.,
Pick one specific skill that you can be good at to add value to your team.,
Get to know the coach of your team to get the inside scoop on the best way to blend.,
Compensate for your lack of athleticism with qualities such as strength, speed, agility and flexibility.,
Learn from others thru observation, coaching, watching games and reading books.,
Laugh at your mistakes!,
Ignore someone, if they make fun of you.,
Have fun!",How to Deal with Limited Athletic Ability," you could always say you were doing a different type of move. Call it the ""Northern Side Swing Grip"" or ""The Left-Right Winged Pass"". These names can make you seem that you know the sport.;
, Avoid being a goalie. Stay on the outsides.

, For example even a mediocre shooter could focus on Free Throws and become a high percentage free throw shooter just by focusing on shooting free throws and learning a few techniques. Pick a skill that can be repeated in much the same way each time.

, Admit to the coach that you are not that skilled (they already know this, remember!) but explain to them that it is important to you to get better.

,


Develop the basic and easy to achieve attributes such as strength, speed, agility and flexibility.
Maintain these attributes in the off-season, and during the season, as they will vanish if you do not. Although technique and experience are longer lasting qualities, a good athlete must have an edge and be totally developed. Decrease your reaction time in your sport by increasing your strength and speed.
Do not be misled by labels. Improving these simple qualities involve technique. For example, when lifting a heavy weight notice how important it is to use your leg and back muscles. Apply this insight to a more complex, athletic movement and use your legs and back to throw, swing or hit. In another example, when practicing for speed, if you truly love your sport that you are practicing for, you will be thinking how to apply this speed work to your sport. Develop in your speed work time sprints and speed drills for your sport.
Maintain your priority. If your priority is your sport, develop these helpful attributes so they will not interfere with your regular sports session. Start a modest supplemental program, strive to keep learning and progressively improve on these attributes. If doing extra work after your sport, do them after. Do not lift weights and run sprints before your sport.

, Learn in a few day what might take you a few months to learn thru experience. The learning process is great, however do not try to reinvent the wheel.. it has already be invented.

, If you mess up, just laugh and move on. You'll be making something bigger of it then it really is, if you act embarrassed.

, It's very mean for someone to make fun of you, but if you just ignore it, they'll know it doesn't bother you, and stop.

, If you just can't seem to enjoy yourself, maybe this sport isn't right for you.

Fran is 3 rounds of 21, 15, and 9 repetitions of 95lb thrusters and pull-ups for time. A thruster is completed with the bar in the front squat position in the sanding position.
Start by squatting down (below parallel), move to a standing position and push the bar overhead.
Return the bar to the front squat position and repeat. A pullup starts at a dead-hang from the bar and finishes with the chin breaking the plane of the bar.
Do this as fast as possible and record your time. Fran tests lactic acid buffering and sprint capacity. This is the staple test.;
,


Get on a rower and row as fast an efficient as possible. Efficient rows engage all muscles in the core, legs, back, shoulders, and arms through full pulls.
An efficient pull starts with the rower bar depressed, legs bent at a 25 degree angle and back slightly bent forward. The pull should end with legs fully extended and straight, back bent backwards at an angle of at least 110 degrees, and rower bar near the chest. This tests cardio vascular endurance and VO2 max.

,


A deadlift starts with the bar on the ground, feet slightly wider than shoulder width, knees bent slightly, back straight, head bent at a 45 degree angle, and hands gripping the bar outside of the knees.
The deadlift ends with legs and back straight, bar around hip height, and hips fully extended out.
If you are not comfortable attempting a 1 rep max, a calculated 1 rep max may be used using a 3 or 5 rep max.

Adjust your sleep schedule.",How to Determine the Best Time to Exercise2," Morning workouts are associated with lower blood pressure, better quality sleep,higher energy levels throughout the day, and increased mental alertness; however, you will have to wake up earlier than usual and may have low energy if you do not eat before you work out.If you plan to exercise at a gym, there will be fewer people in the gym if you go in the morning.People who exercise in the morning also tend to follow the workout with a healthy breakfast and plenty of water. This could set you up for a great start to the day., Workout clothes are usually comfortable. Sleeping in them can motivate you to exercise as soon as you wake up. If you do not want to sleep in your clothes, have your outfit laid out so you can roll out of bed and get dressed.


If you are exercising at a gym and plan to get dressed there, pack your gym bag the night before so you can just grab your bag and head out the door.

, Try waking up 30 to 60 minutes earlier than usual to fit in a workout. You may need to go to sleep a little earlier to accommodate your new wake up time. If you are exercising at a gym, consider your travel time to your gym as well.


Allow an extra five or 10 minutes for your warm up.Your body temperature is lower in the morning. If you do not warm up your body, you are more likely to get injured.If you typically do not eat in the morning, add in some extra time for breakfast. Your body needs food to recover from exercise.

Pay attention to how well you sleep.,
Adjust your meal time.,
Do not sacrifice sleep.",How to Determine the Best Time to Exercise3," If you are focusing on increasing muscle strength and muscle size, an evening workout may be best.You have eaten throughout the day so your body has plenty of fuel and your muscles are warm.On the other hand, evening workouts can be easy to brush off. If you have a lot of evening commitments or are usually fatigued at the end of the day, it will be hard to find time the time or energy to exercise.You are less likely to get injured during evening exercise because your muscles and joints have been working all day.If you plan to exercise at a gym or outside, know what time your gym closes and how much daylight you will have in the evening.

, Evening exercise helps some people fall asleep while it gives others an energy boost. Evening strength training in particular may help you fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.On the other hand, high-intensity training may cause you to be more alert and have trouble falling asleep.


If you find that you have trouble going to sleep at night, yoga or stretching exercises can help you relax.You may save your evening workouts for low-intensity exercises (i.e. walking, yoga, stretching) and do more high-intensity workouts (i.e. running, cycling, interval training) in the morning.

, It takes your body two to three hours to digest a meal and absorb nutrients. Eat a snack before your workout and have dinner when you are finished. If you want to eat dinner first, eat earlier than you typically would.Foods such as white rice, pasta, bread, and potatoes encourage sleep. Eat them at least one hour before you plan to go to bed. If you plan to go to bed at 11:00 pm, you need to eat before 10:00 pm. Eating turkey and/or pumpkin seeds can also help you sleep.

, Try to finish your workout about two hours before it is time for you to go to bed. This will give your body time for you to wind down. For example, if you plan to go to bed at 11:00 pm, be finished working out by 9:00 pm.


Your melatonin (i.e. hormone that makes you sleepy) levels peak around 10:00 pm. Your workout performance and form may suffer if you are tired and exercising this late.Sleep is just as important as exercise and helps your body recover after exercise."

, These may also be referred to as ""clinics"". This way, you can compete with people of various levels and playing styles, while possible gaining a friend to practice or train with. Check your local area and online to see if there are any offered that match your skill level and needs.

, These tend to be more expensive than group lessons. But if your sport relies heavily on individual performance (like tennis, wrestling, boxing, weight-lifting), then it may be worth it to consider getting a private coach once or twice a month to focus primarily on you.

, These athletes tend to be very skilled at their sports and are entertaining to watch. If you're a college student, watch college athletes in person. Student-tickets, especially for less popular sports, tend to be cheaper than regular tickets and maybe even free. You may learn some tricks, strategies, and techniques to improve your own game.

, This can be done by leaving your phone camera on at a fixed angle while you play. By doing so, you can review your game later and pinpoint any errors you make. If you know someone that's skilled in the game,  you can ask for their input on what you're doing wrong or what you can do better. If not, try YouTube.

, While training for your main sport, consider leisurely playing another sport at the same time or off-season. For example, running can really help with sports that require endurance such as Ultimate Frisbee and soccer. Plus, it prevents stress on the same group of muscles that occurs by focusing on one too much.

, These are for college students who want to compete against other schools without the commitment of varsity sports. Usually, it's student-run, with tryouts and practices. To see if your school offers a club team in your sport, check the your university's website or the Association sites. If not, start a chapter at your college.


Major areas club sports compete through include USTA Tennis on Campus, National Club Football Association (NCFA), USA Ultimate for Ultimate Frisbee, National Collegiate Dodgeball Association, National Club Softball Association (NCSA), National Club Baseball Association (NCBA) Volleyball through NCVF; Soccer, Flag Football through NIRSA.

, In leagues, teams play against other teams of similar skill levels. Depending on their performance, a league may compete at local, regional, and even national championships. For certain sports, like tennis, individual players can move up and down ranks and levels depending on their individual performance, independent of their team's performance. This is a great option for those who want to play with a team competitively.

, By doing so, you are keeping yourself active in your sport, playing against new people of various playing styles, and opening up chances to find practice partner.

, Most college freshman gain weight due to the excess of food options available, not having parental guidance on their intake, and not being as active as they were in high school. Avoid this fate by watching what you eat through apps like myFitnesspal or getting a Fitbit. Also, add some healthy options to your plate.

, Keeping fit helps you perform better in your sport.


For a professional gym training program specific for your sport, consider using apps such as Volt (Volt Athletics) or Fitivity. Or, if you want to save money, research which exercises are best for your sport and make your own workout.
Consider taking TRX circuit or XTrain classes, which are strength and conditioning workouts that are sometimes tailored toward team-specific sports

, Don't overtrain. Just like how your body needs sleep to replenish its lost energy, your body and muscles needs rest also.

, It is easy to become dehydrated when you are exercising. Therefore, drink water.

, Combine a healthy mixture of carbohydrates and proteins in your diet. The right kinds of carbohydrates will give your body energy to burn, and protein can help build muscles and repair tissue."

Since they sell used equipment, they might not always have certain items in stock.;
, Join a Facebook group for your area that alerts its members of upcoming yard sales. There are also websites, such as YardSaleSearch.com, that help people advertise their yard sales and find yard sales in their areas., Craigslist has a special section for sporting goods. Filter your results so that you are only seeing results in your general area. If you don’t see what you want immediately, keep checking back every few days. Sellers are constantly adding new ads to Craigslist. There is also a way to filter your search results on eBay so that you only see sellers in your area. Looking for people selling equipment in your area will make it easier to pick up the equipment and avoid expensive shipping costs.

Read user reviews. Make sure that the equipment has not been recalled or criticized for being unsafe. See how long users say the equipment lasts. For example, if one user says that a treadmill completely stopped running after five years, reconsider buying that same treadmill if it’s four years old.

, Many individual sellers may not give you a warranty or guarantee for their used fitness equipment.

Reconsider buying from a place or person who has sold faulty exercise equipment in the past, according to reviews.

, In order to make sure that you get a good price for your exercise equipment, you should research the particular piece of equipment you’re trying to buy. Before you purchase any equipment, research the following aspects of your equipment.


How much it cost when it was new. Make sure that you are getting a significant discount that makes a used piece of equipment worth buying.
How much it costs on other websites. If you can find a better price at another retailer, ask yourself if you found the best price. If your price is way lower than the price at other retailers, make sure that the quality of the equipment is top notch.
If your seller is willing to negotiate the price. One benefit of using a seller from a place like eBay or Craigslist is that the seller might be willing to negotiate the price with you.

, Higher quality equipment may age better than lower quality equipment. If you spend a little more money and get a “brand name” piece of fitness equipment, it could save you money in the long run. Look for a piece of fitness that would have been top of the line in its prime., Make a list of questions beforehand to ask when you inspect the equipment or before you even go to look at it. Here’s a list of questions you might want to ask:


Does the machine run?
How long have you had this?
How often has it been used?
Why are you selling it?
Is it missing any parts?
Does it require any maintenance?
How much did you pay for it? In what year?
Where did you get it?

, Turn on and try out every piece of equipment before you buy it. If a treadmill or a stationary bike has an emergency stop button, make sure that it works.Try a variety of speeds on treadmills and weights on other fitness equipment. Unplug and plug everything on every piece of equipment.

, Make sure that there are no frayed wires, rusty gears, or excessively worn pieces of the equipment you’re buying. Gentle wear and tear is okay, but keep an eye out for anything that looks as though it’s about to break. If anything needs to be replaced, see how much the replacement would cost and if it would need professional maintenance., Go to your local gym and try out all the fitness equipment there. When you are buying fitness equipment used, you will want to know how it compares to other fitness equipment. Using high-quality equipment can help you determine the quality of the used equipment you want to purchase. Try cardio equipment, strength equipment, and free weights.Make a list of your favorite machines to use.

, Think about why you want to buy this equipment. Are you trying to lose weight? Do you want to strengthen your arms and shoulders? Or do you have another goal entirely? Make a list of everything you want in your home gym. You may just want an elliptical, or perhaps you want dumbbells and a yoga mat, too. What you want to buy depends on your specific workout style and fitness goals., Measure the space in your home that you’ve chosen to designate for your fitness equipment. Look up the measurements of the equipment you would like to buy. Mark out the spaces for this equipment in your home by putting masking tape on the floor. Take length, width, and height of the equipment into account., Depending on where you buy your fitness equipment, the equipment itself might not have a warranty. Therefore, if it breaks, you will have no free way of fixing it. Some fitness equipment, though, will last almost forever. Free weights, kettlebells, and punching bags will last for a long time. Something electric like a treadmill, however, will be useless if broken. Consider buying fitness equipment that is long-lasting and not electric.

Find something that everybody in the household likes.,
Make a plan.,
Ensure that there is adequate rest provided.,
Take action once your plan is finished and keep on working.",How to Develop a Basic Exercise Routine for Home Workouts That Suit the Whole Family," Although this can be hard, it is suggested that you do the following to make this work:


Sit down with the whole family. Make a list of exercises you all genuinely enjoy doing. You like running? Great! You like walking distances and remaining clean? Cool! Rather get covered in sweat and feel super duper accomplished? Amazing!
Make a list of things you are not willing to do, too. Push-ups? Eek! Squats? Yikes!
If part of your family is into leg raises and the other half loathes it, but is totally up for crunches, then divide in two or more groups. Try to do, for example, ab exercises, at the same time. One group can do what they are comfortable with and the other can do theirs. Different exercises can mean the same results, peeps! There is a large spectrum of them you can easily find on the internet.;
, Consider the following when putting this plan together:


When does everybody have time? Do you like to work out in the morning, afternoon or evening? Which days would suit for you all? Plan, plan, plan!
Start with stretches (you can find great techniques online) and then do some light cardio. Running or quick walking, in your place or around the neighborhood (such as a park), are good options, but there are many more.
Is it smart to do crunches after leg raises? Not really! Your abs will ache from the previous work-out, especially in the beginning. Find a balance. Try to schedule in, for example; abs first, leg exercises, then arms, glutes next and then your back. Think about what will feel good for all of you.

, Giving your body rest and good care is one of the most important things when it comes to being in shape and healthy. If your family consists of more generation, which it most likely does, it is necessary to adapt and attune. Older people, the little children and persons with little stamina, will need more breaks than the others. If you want to do this together, you're going to need to find a compromise on this.

, Just having an amazingly developed work-out plan hanging somewhere around the house, but never doing anything with it won't help any of you. For this step, it is important to know if your family is actually willing to participate in this. Are you ready to absolutely go for it? Are all of you? If the answer is yes, start as soon as possible and don't quit until you feel it's time to move on to something else (do not expect this to be within two or three months).

Make sure sure the gear fits properly.,
Buy gear that’s designed for specific sports and positions.,
Get advice from a coach or medical professional.,
Take hygiene into account when choosing between new and used items.,
Consider the level of experience of the sport or league.,
Go with gently used gear if you are young athlete.,
Avoid buying used items if any wear will compromise its function.,
Ask a coach or someone with lots of experience about reputable sellers.,
Save money by considering your timing.,
Inspect used items for wear and tear.,
Shop for deals online with caution.",How to Choose Between New and Used Sports Gear," Whether you’re purchasing new or used equipment, proper fit is among the most important considerations. Improper or ill-fitting equipment is one of the most common causes of sports-related injury. Always make safety a priority when choosing gear and avoid purchasing a cheaper item that fits poorly just to cut cost.If you’re buying equipment for your young athlete, make sure they know how to correctly wear their gear in addition to making sure it fits well. Do your best to instill in them the importance of safety, and remind them that they must put on their protective gear before playing their sport.;
, Making sure your gear is specifically designed for your activity and position will reduce your risk of injury and improve your performance. Whether purchasing new or used equipment, familiarize yourself with your sport’s recommended protective gear and know what distinguishes it from examples of similar gear.For example, know the difference between a helmet designed for American football and one meant for baseball. If you’re playing baseball, know the difference between a helmet and mask designed for a catcher and one meant for batting.
Don’t make any big investments if you’re not sure you or your child will be playing a specific position. For example, if it’s not set in stone that your teen will be the goalie on an ice hockey team, don’t spend hundreds of dollars on goalie pads and a stick., When in doubt about proper fit and design, always consult a coach or trainer for a tutorial on how to wear gear and what a proper fit is. For kids and adults alike, it’s also wise to get a checkup before signing up for any sports.A doctor will tell you how safe a particular sport is, whether you’re a growing child or an adult with potential medical problems.
You can also ask your doctor or coach for opinions on where to safely cut costs by buying used gear for your specific sport.

, Sometimes buying new gear is an obvious matter of safety and hygiene. It’s best to buy items like mouth guards, protective cups, and jockstraps new. While not necessarily a hygiene or safety concern, buying used leotards, skin-tight thermal gear, and other form-fitting attire is a matter of personal comfort.Always wash used attire before wearing. Be sure to inspect garments for stains and rips that could compromise function or aesthetics.

, You don’t have to invest in expensive new equipment if your activity’s experience level doesn’t require it. If you’re playing flag football with friends on the weekends, don’t go all out and purchase tackle football gear. If your child is playing in an instructional volleyball league, they won’t need high quality knee pads designed for professionals.On the other hand, if you or your child is competing at a high level, it might be worth investing in quality gear to improve performance and reduce the risk of injury.

, Buying new gear can cost thousands of dollars, especially if your sport of choice is costly or if you play a different sport each season. You or your parent can cut your budget in half by purchasing used items, particularly those that will need to be replaced regularly due to wear or fit.Try to cut your budget by buying used items that don’t make any difference when it comes to safety. For example, a new baseball or softball glove can run $200, but you can find a suitable used one for a fraction of that price., Some items must be purchased new because any wear at all will create significant hazards. For example, if you’re a climber, it’s fine to buy used climbing shoes, but you’d never want to buy used ropes or slings. If you’re suspended from a sheer cliff face, you wouldn’t want an old nylon rope to be the only thing between you and a nasty fall.Finding a good seller will help you avoid purchasing items that shouldn’t be sold used. A reputable consignment or second-hand shop won’t accept items that are unsafe to resell.

, Doing a bit of research before buying used gear will guarantee that you’re getting a deal without sacrificing function or safety. Ask your coach or trainer if they know of a good secondhand seller. If you’re the parent of a young athlete, talk to their coach or other parents about the best local options to buy used items.

, While buying new gear in-season gives you a greater selection, shopping at the end of a retail season can land great deals. When shopping around consignment and secondhand shops, however, remember that most locations will only accept and sell season-specific gear. If you’re shopping for winter sports gear in August, you’re less likely to find used items at a good consignment shop., Check zippers and seams for obvious signs of wear and tear, especially if they need to be waterproof or warm in order to function properly. If an item smells bad, don’t buy it. Check carefully for small cracks, abrasions, or other easy to miss flaws that might develop into a more significant issue given a little time. Look for obvious discoloration to gauge how old an item might be., Online marketplaces and Craigslist can offer great deals, but avoid purchasing anything without a bit of research. If you make arrangements online to purchase from a local seller, make sure to inspect items before finalizing the deal. If you’re shopping on an online marketplace, check the seller’s credentials and feedback.Look for items online that are well-photographed. Avoid buying gear from sellers who offer no images.
Steer clear from sellers if they have any negative reviews from past customers. Be wary of sellers who have no feedback available.

Be aware that your child’s pair of feet may not be the same in size.,
Have your child wear socks when you measure his foot.,
Determine your child’s foot shape.",How to Buy Athletic Shoes for Kids1," Make sure to measure your child’s feet when he is standing, as the bones, muscles, and tissues in his body will actually compress his feet, making them larger when he puts weight on them.To measure your child’s feet you can:

Use a tape measure.



 


Have your child stand on a piece of paper. Trace around his foot using a pencil. Measure this traced image and then compare the length to an online shoe size chart.






Remember to measure your child’s foot at the end of the day. After a day spent walking around, your child’s feet will have naturally expanded. Because of this, you need to by shoes that will still fit after a day of active play.;
, Measure both of your child’s feet because most people tend to have one foot that is larger than the other. Once you have determined which foot is bigger, make sure to use that foot as a reference for which size shoe you should get.


The difference will most likely not be large enough that you need to get two different sized shoes.

, These should be the socks or style of sock that your child wears most often. Because your child wears socks when he wears shoes, it is important to factor that added padding in when determining the properly sized shoe.


Remember to bring a pair of socks to the shoe store when you go to buy shoes so that your child can try the shoes on with the socks he normally wears.

, You can identify your child’s foot shape by doing the “wet test” method. Wet your child’s feet with water and then have him stand on a piece of paper. Look to see if your child has a medium, flat, or high arch (the arch is the area that will be dry in the center of your child’s foot, as the arch should float off of the paper). Consider this when picking out shoes for your child.

Low arched feet or flat feet. Feet of this type need shoes that can control the motion. You need to get shoes that have rigid heel counters. Shoes with more foam in the middle are helpful.






High arched feet. Feet of this type are quite rigid. So you need to wear shoes that are meant for running. Get shoes that can absorb the shock of running. You need shoes that are quite flexible and have thick mid-soles.






Neutral feet. Feet of this type can use almost any kind of shoe.







"
"

Have the salesperson measure your child’s feet.,
Make sure your child can wiggle his toes inside the shoes.,
Ask your child to walk around the store to see if he can move comfortably in the shoes.,

You should also consider heading to a specialized shoe store if your child needs a particular kind of athletic shoe, or if your child has flat feet.


Look for reputable shoe brands. Buy from well known brands. Make sure that the shoe is sturdy enough to withstand rough usage.

, While you have measured your child’s foot, it is also important to have this measurement confirmed by a salesperson who specializes in shoes.


Depending on your child’s shoe size and needs, the salesperson may also be able to direct you to a specific style or brand of shoe.

, Once your child has put the shoe on, there are several ways that you can make sure your child’s toes have enough room. First of all, your child’s toes should not be squished inside the shoes; he should be able to move them freely. Other include:


There should be ample space that is as thick as your index finger between the biggest toe and the end of the shoe.
Take a look at the heel. It should be stable and sturdy. It should not be able to move in and out of the heel counter.
While your child is wearing the shoe, make sure that your child’s foot does not slide back and forth inside.

, Let him walk, jump, and run. If your notice your child’s heel slipping out of the back, or he is not able to move as easily as normal, you should try a different size of shoe.

, While your child might not be able to describe the feeling of the shoes perfectly, listen for words like ‘too tight’, ‘squishing’ or ‘ouch’. These are indicators that the shoes are not a good fit.


Uncomfortable shoes can lead to having bunions, calluses, corns, hammer toes, ingrown toenails, etc.

Assess the available soccer cleats.,
Look for extra cushioning in running shoes.,
Make sure volleyball shoes have a rubber sole.,
Look for sturdy tennis shoes.,
Find basketball shoes that can cushion your child’s feet when they jump.",How to Buy Athletic Shoes for Kids3," Soccer shoes, or cleats, should allow your child to run, change direction, and kick easily.

Indoor soccer shoes should be flat and made with a non-marking rubber sole.






Outdoor soccer shoes should provide traction on grassy surfaces.







, Running shoes need to have extra cushioning to promote forward movement, such as running and walking, as well as to prevent sprains, shin splints, and stress fractures. Shoes differ from basic running activities to long-distance running, depending on your child’s sports preference. Look for:


A shock-absorbing sole
A supportive arch
Firm heel support
A reasonably flexible forefoot

, This gum rubber sole helps kids to keep from sliding around on the gym floor. A slip could lead to a sprained ankle.

, Tennis shoes should be flatter and sturdier than other shoes to allow kids to move from side to side more efficiently. At the same time, they need to provide stability and flexibility for moving forward and backward.


Keep in mind that you should select the tennis shoe based on the surface your child will be playing on, be it hard court, grass, or clay. There are some shoes designed to handle any surface.

, Look for shoes that cushion and stabilize to help your child jump, and land well, when needed.

Train.,
Carry on.,
Be self sufficient.,

Become the strongest.",How to Channel Anger With Exercise," Was it your fault or someone else's? Identify the harmful causes of being too angry. Anger is an important part of health; when used being properly such as anger motivates you when your studying, it motivates you when you're down. But when used in physical response, it is dangerous and can ruin the person from within so never try to respond physically. When you're exercising, anger can give you that boost you need.;
, Do not think you can go straight into training, you need have the correct form of exercise and some kind of routine. Eating a healthy diet too will benefit your body and make you stronger. So try doing research on that.

, When you have the basics down, decide which exercises to do, such as isolation exercises or compound exercises. Compound exercises are good because they help to grow more muscle then isolation exercises. This is where the anger part comes in. If you normally you do 10 reps, remember when you got beaten up, you wanted to be stronger and got angry that you were not strong enough. When you recall thoughts that made you angry, it urges you onto doing more than 10 reps.

, Be a fighter and carry on, after the outburst of energy, you feel giving up saying you can never achieve but you're wrong, you can. You can decide your own faith, no one can decide it for you. Ask yourself ""Do I really want to be strong? If I do, why am I giving up, I should be carrying on!"".

Try to do your own work without interrupting others as some people take advantage of this later on (but not all) so try to mind your own business. Remember how you will feel when you keep asking for help and annoying those around you, you don't want to be rejected so try to do your own work and be kind, thoughtful and honest.

, Running with soothing music on to help you can give you the extra edge as you want to do well but it also calms you down when you're listening to music.

, Using your determination, try to become the strongest as you will find out that generally people make more friends with strong people, but do not use your strength to hurt someone, protect someone with your strength.

, Straight-cut skirts are tighter and will cling to the form of your body. They have slits on the sides to provide extra mobility. A-line skirts are loose and do not cling to your body. Pleated skirts are the traditional design.

, Avoid any skirt without a flat waist otherwise you may experience discomfort while on the court.

, For maximum comfort and mobility, you will want a tennis skirt made from a light and durable material that can breathe, such as polyester or spandex.

Talk to your doctor.,
Calculate your heart rate.,
Get a fitness tracker or heart rate monitor.,
Try the talk test.",How to Burn Maximum Calories While Playing Pokémon GO1," If you are unsure about how to calculate your heart rate or find your fat-burn zone, consider talking to your doctor. They will be able to help you determine the appropriate amount of exercise. This is particularly important if you suffer from a medical condition.


Make sure that raising your heart rate does not aggravate an existing medical condition.;
, Calculating your heart rate will help you maximize the number of calories that you burn while playing Pokémon GO. First, you will want to subtract your age from 220. This will give you your maximum heart rate. To maximize fat burn, you will want your heart rate to be about 60 to 70 percent of this max. You will then multiply your maximum heart rate by .6 and .7. This will give you your fat-burn zone.You can monitor your fat-burn zone while you exercise by putting your fingers on your neck and counting your heartbeats.
If you are 30, your maximum heart rate would be 190 and your fat-burn zone would be 114 to 133 beats per minute. Staying between 60 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate will ensure that you are burning as many calories as you can.

, Because calculating your own heart rate and fat-burn zone can be difficult, particularly while you exercise, you may want to consider purchasing a fitness tracker or heart rate monitor. These electronic devices will keep track of your heart rate for you and allow you to focus on catching Pokémon. Some fitness trackers will even calculate your fat-burn zone and let you know if you are in it while exercising.Fitbit and Garmin both make trackers that monitor your heart rate.
There are many fitness trackers that you can wear on your wrist. You can also purchase heart rate monitors that you can wear on your chest, which tend to be more accurate.

, This is the easiest, yet least accurate, way to determine your fat-burn zone. The talk test figures out your fat-burn zone based on how winded you get during exercise. After about 15 minutes of moderate exercise, try to carry on a conversation. If you are able to talk easily, you are not working out hard enough. However, if it is too difficult to talk, you are exercising too strenuously. If you are in the fat-burn zone, you should be able to speak a short sentence comfortably.This test works best if you are exercising with someone else. However, you can also talk to yourself if need be.

Style. The different styles of jock can range from more boxer shorts-esque designs to a scanty, thong-like briefs.







Pouch type. The differences in pouch type aren't always obvious, and many focus on a specific feature, like comfort or package presentation. Some types include original, snug, and contour., The size listed on your jockstrap will only pertain to the waistband size. The cup will either be a separate part, or listed separated on the jockstrap packaging. Cups should hold your genitals completely, comfortably, and snugly. Leg straps should be tight enough to prevent twisting. Many brands of jock make use of brand-particular size ranges, so be sure to check the size range. In most cases, though, you can expect:Small sizes to range between 20 and 26 in (50.8 and 66 cm).
Medium sizes to range between 26 and 32 in (66 and 81.3 cm).
Large sizes to range between 32 and 38 in (81.3 and 96.5 cm).
XL sizes to range between 38 and 44 in (96.5 and 111.8 cm).
Cups generally have four sizes also: peewee (ages 5-7), youth (ages 8-12), teen (13-15) and adult (age 16 and above)., Everyone's body is different, and it's possible that a jockstrap might not be comfortable for you If this is the case for you, the athletic brief is an excellent substitute that's more similar to conventional underwear.


Not all athletic briefs come with cups. If you are playing a sport that requires a groin protector, be sure you purchase a pair that comes with a cup.

, Though a protective cup is sometimes required for certain activities, cups can chafe, cause heat to build up more than usual, and can sometimes be uncomfortably bulky. Activities like track and field, basketball, rollerblading, and so on, are better suited to cup-less jocks., Projectiles, like balls, pucks, and so on, can pick up a great deal of speed. These projectiles can become deadly to the more delicate parts of your body, especially your genitals. Wear a jockstrap with a cup for sports like:


Baseball
Football
Hockey
Soccer
Rugby, Cups are made out of hard plastic or metal, and have small holes in the cup material for ventilation. For low contact activities where you still want some protection, you might use a soft cup or flex cup, which are more comfortable. Depending on the jockstrap you buy, you'll likely have two styles of cup to choose from:


The traditional protective cup is an upside down pear shaped, hollow, plastic cover. This style is ideal for most genital sizes and shapes.






The banana cup has a longer up-and-down shape than the traditional cup. This style is most suitable for larger genitalia, especially genitals that are longer than average.







, The more layers of undergarment you wear, the more support you'll receive. Athletes will often wear more than one pair of undergarment for precisely this purpose. For example, for extra support you might:


Wear a pair of compression shorts under your jockstrap and a cup too, if necessary.






Wear a pair of snug, but still comfortable, briefs or athletic trunks underneath your jockstrap., Children, not having gone through puberty yet, will not need as much space in their protective cup. Children can also be more prone to clothing irritation or discomfort, like what might be experienced with a cup. A narrow cup will be less bulky and more comfortable., There are many examples of specialized jockstraps, and one of the best examples of this comes from hockey. Because hockey players wear so much padding to keep warm and protect themselves from damaging hockey pucks, hockey jocks often have special clips or garters to help hold up socks and keep your gear tight to your body. Two common other varieties of jock include.


Swim jocks, which generally have a narrower waistband than traditional kinds of jockstrap.






Windproof jocks, which include a layer of cloth or fabric to provide additional protection against wind and cold in winter sports."

Be mindful of your surroundings.,
Focus on your goals.,
Use exercise to improve your confidence.,
Expand your social network through exercise.,
Channel stressful emotions into exercise.",How to Boost Your Mood Through Exercise1," Being mindful during an exercise routine has been shown to increase your sense of satisfaction with the exercise.This may help to boost your mood, so try to practice mindfulness the next time you work out. Pay attention to the physical sensations of your body and your surroundings as you exercise.


How do your muscles feel when you move them? Do they feel warm? Sore? Powerful?
What can you see, hear, and smell in your environment? For example, you might see a large tall tree ahead of you next to the road you are running on. You might hear the sounds of the music playing in your headphones, or the sounds of a city. You might notice the scent of fresh rain or flowers if you are outside, or an air freshener if you are in a gym.
Stay present throughout your exercise routine. Avoid dwelling on anything that makes you feel anxious or unhappy. Focus on your physical sensations and your surroundings instead.
You can also try to focus on your breathing while you exercise. You might even try to coordinate your breathing with your physical movements. This will help you to stay focused on your workout.;
, Narrowing your focus to your goals during exercise may also help to improve your experience.You may get more enjoyment out of your exercise session by focusing on what you want to accomplish with your exercise, rather than letting your mind wander.


For example, you might focus on your goal to lose 10 pounds, reflect on how much progress you have made, and think about how the exercise you are doing right now will get you closer to this goal. Doing this may help you to feel more positive and motivated during and after your workout.

, Studies have shown that exercise can improve your feeling of self-worth and your self-esteem. Feeling confident about your physical appearance can help you feel confident mentally and emotionally.You can also gain confidence by meeting your fitness goals, even if they are small or gradual. Achieving even one or two fitness goals a month can help you feel accomplished and motivate you to feel proud of yourself.

, Exercise can also help you meet others and socialize with new people. You may meet new friends at the gym or in a fitness class. You may also meet others on your running route or while you are working out in a public space.


You may also feel more comfortable meeting people when you are exercising as it may be easier to connect and chat when you have fitness in common.

, You can also process any stressful emotions you are having by exercising and working out. Rather than keep these intense emotions to yourself, you can try channeling them into productive actions like working out. Studies have shown that exercising regularly can help reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression."

Select a date for your annual player draft.",How to Bet on Sports," Point spreads help to balance out the odds of each team winning. When people bet on point spreads, they usually talk about (+3.5), (-7.5), (+4), etc. This is how many points are added or subtracted from a team's final score. Take, for example, the Chicago Bears (+5) and the Green Bay Packers (-5) are playing each other this Sunday. The Bears are less likely to win, so 5 points are added to their final score.In this example, the Packers will have to beat the Bears by at least 6 points for people who bet on them to win. If the Packers beat the Bears by 5 points or less, people who bet on the Packers to cover the spread will lose money.
The basic premise is that you need your betting team to either cover the spread, or underperform. In the same example, if you think the Packers will win but won't cover the spread, put money down on them to do so. If the Packers win by less than 5 points, you will win money.
If teams wind up meeting the spread (not under or over) than you neither win or lose money. In the same example, if the Packers beat the Bears by exactly 5 points, no one wins or loses. When point spreads are (+7.5), (-4.5), (-8.5), (+1.5), etc. they are much more dangerous bets. This is because teams don't score half points, so you will either win or lose.;
, This is a very simple method. You are betting on who will win the game outright. If you think the Chicago Cubs will beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, you will bet on them, and vice versa. The key here is to look at the point spread of the game. If the Chicago Cubs are given a large point spread (-5) then they are seen as more likely to win. If the spreads are pretty even (-0.5)(+0.5) then the game is largely seen as a 50/50 matchup.Look at the point spread first before you move onto the money spread. If the point spread seems way too high (-8.5) it is best to place your money down on the point spread.
If the point spreads are fairly even (-1)(+1) then move on to the money spread. You will be much more likely to win covering a tight money spread.
If there is inclement weather, that also is a heavy factor in money spreads. Snow, rain, sleet, fog, etc. can rapidly even the playing field between the two teams, and therefore even up the point spread. The worse the weather, the more random the outcome, and therefore the more money you should put down on the money spread.

, Totals is commonly referred to as the over/under. This is where the betting organization will give you a number (9), (4), (10), (175), etc. The number they give you represents the total number of points scored by both teams combined. You have to place a bet as to whether or not the teams combined will score below or above that number.Take for example the Los Angeles Lakers playing against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The total over/under will be 215. You have to bet whether the Lakers and Thunder will score combined over or under 215 points.
Factor in different circumstances. If superstars are hurt on both teams, and the over/under seems pretty high, you might place your bets on ""under."" If superstars are playing lights-out of late, and the over/under seems too low, you might place your bets on ""over.""

, Beside every point spread, money spread, and total (over/under) is a number in decimal form. Decimal odds are always written as positive numbers, never negative. For example, next to the New England Patriots point spread (-8.5) is a decimal figure of 2.798. Then imagine that you bet 0.1 bitcoins (BTC) on the the Patriots point spread that week on an online website. Multiply the bitcoins you bet by the decimal figure, and that is how many bitcoins you will win, if you betted correctly.So for this example, 0.1 X 2.798 is 0.2798. This would most likely be rounded up to 0.28 bitcoins on most websites. You will earn 0.28 bitcoins if you bet correctly.
It is important to remember that decimal odds include your initial stake. So, for this example, you will not get 0.28 plus your initial stake. The stake is already included in the 0.28 bitcoin winnings.
Bitcoins are a form of specialized online currency.

, Next to every decimal odds number is either a positive or negative number in parentheses. If the number is positive, this is how much much money you will make on a standard 100 bitcoin stake win. For example, American odds are (+170) for the money spread on the Miami Marlins this week. This means that for every 100 bitcoin stake, you will receive 170 bitcoins back. If you put up 0.1 bitcoins as your stake, you will get 0.17 bitcoins back.The great thing about American odds is that you get your initial stake back. So if you bet 1 bitcoin, and receive 2 bitcoins as your winnings, you will get 3 bitcoins back in total.
If the American odds number is negative, this is how many bitcoins you have to produce as your initial stake in order to get 100 bitcoins back. So if the odds are (-105) you will have to produce at least 105 bitcoins as your initial stake in order to get 100 bitcoins back.
Bitcoins are a form of online currency.

, A sportsbook is basically a place where you can go and place bets on sports games. Online sportsbooks are very convenient, but are overrun with spam websites, advertisements, etc. It is important to find a site which is safe, like Bovada or Bet365. Generally speaking, if you type into Google ""online sportsbooks"" the first few options have the most hits, and are reliable.If you notice that the site you are on is overrun with ads, begging you for money, try a different sportsbook. Advertisements are quick and easy ways for spammers to try and take your money.
Stay away from sites which don't allow you to browse their site until you give a credit card number upfront. It is never safe to give out your personal identification information to a site which you have not scouted out yet.

, You want to make sure that the sportsbooks have the sports you want to bet on. Some online sites only specialize in one or two sports. Check out the terms and conditions of the site. Don't skim over them as they contain valuable information, including what they are liable for, and whether they can be sued.Check to see whether the site requires you to put money up front. It is important that you know the exact amount, and whether you are ever eligible to get that money back.
Find where the sportsbook has posted the minimum and maximum withdrawal/deposit limits. You will need to know how much money you can receive every day, and how much you can place as a stake.
Use the sites resource section to find frequently asked questions, and how to contact them. You will want to put their number in your phone in case of emergencies if you join their site.

, If you do not like gambling online, Nevada is the only state in the country where sports gambling is legal. If you are planning a trip to Vegas, you will need to find a casino that has a sportsbook. These can usually be found in phone books (Yellow Pages) or online with full descriptions.You will need to decide whether you want a sportsbook with a lot of people, or a more quiet one. Remember, Vegas is a very popular destination, so you will not be able to free yourself from everyone. However, there are some more expensive sportsbooks which offer more private rooms with 10-15 people in them.
Look on their websites to find out what kind of furnishing they have (couches, chairs, etc.), what food they serve, and what types of drinks they offer. These are rather small things in the big picture, but when you bet you want to be as comfortable as possible.
Another important thing to look for is how many, and how big are there TV's? When you go to a sportsbook you will need a ton of TV's to watch at once, especially if you are betting on multiple games in multiple different sports.

, Local bookies are numerous throughout the United States, and can almost always be found at sports bars. If you know of numerous people who use him/her as their bookie, chances are they are safe and trustworthy. You can do any of the traditional bets you can do at sportsbooks. Bookies gather together pools of money from multiple gamblers and then disperse the money once the games are over.Because sports gambling is illegal everywhere except Nevada, you need to scout out your bookie carefully. They could be an undercover policeman. Go to the bar a few times and watch the 'bookie' work. Ask your friends and family about their experiences working with him.
Make sure your bookie pays you on time. Sometimes bookies can be passive when it comes to their clients. Tell your bookie up front that you want your money on time, every week. Make it a point of order to always meet him at the same location and time after every game.
Only bet very small amounts at first with him in order to build trust. Once you know he will deliver every week, you can up the amount that you bet.

, There are such things such as proposition bets, which are basically random bets on coin tosses, the weather in a game, etc. However, if you plan on doing some serious gambling on games, you will need to know your stuff. Remember, especially online, there are tons of gamblers who do years of research.Familiarize yourself with one sport at a time. You do not want to bet on every sport you love. Really dive into the stats on the sports organization's website or on sportsbook site.
Keep track of the outside factors which come into play with sports, such as weather, injuries, ""revenge,"" etc.

, As you win a few times and build up your confidence, you can gradually increase the amounts you bet. This is important for managing your bankroll wisely. You want to make profits overtime, as winning a huge amount once is fairly rare. As long as you are consistently winning more than you are losing, and only placing small bets at a time, you will have much better odds overall at making a profit.Never gamble away money you need to pay bills. Keeping the electricity and water running are much more important than sports gambling.
Use money you have left over from normal expenses. This means money leftover after you have payed bills, put away money into your savings account, and bought groceries for the week!
Plan ahead of time. Save a little bit of money each week until you have a nest egg to gamble with. For example, if you plan on betting on the next football season, save a year in advance. this way if you lose the first few times you will still have money to fall back on.

, Fantasy sports is traditionally not seen as gambling, and therefore hasn't been regulated as such. However, you are giving an initial stake, and using your skills to win a return on your investment. To recruit members, first ask your family if they wish to join.Post sheets on bulletin boards at your job, with black spaces left for names and phone numbers. These sheets should identify who is running the league (your name), where the league will be located, and how much money you need for an initial stake.
You can also post online at your social sites like Facebook and Twitter, asking for members to join your league.
If you would rather join a league, there are plenty of reputable sites online such as ESPN, and other official sports sites which offer fantasy leagues. You might also look for friends or family who have started their own.

, You will first need to decide what the official entry fee will be. The fees will go into one pot and will be given to the winner at the end of the football year. Some teams cough up 100 dollars a piece, while others find it fun to have a free league (bragging rights). After you agree to the fee, each player has to come up with an official team name.Be creative with the team names. As long as the other members approve it is fine. If you are playing with random players, you might want a more politically correct name which won't offend.
The commissioner of the league (you) will approve the names. Then, as a group, come up with a league name if you wish.

, The first thing you need to decide as a group is how many fantasy points a player gets for each action they take. This includes touchdowns, yardage, incompletions, dropped catches, made field goals, etc. (if you are doing a football fantasy league) You will need to set up a playoff system. Determine how many teams can make the playoffs and which NFL weeks the playoff games will be played.Another important rule is setting up a waiver wire. The waiver wire is basically how many free agents a team can add, the selection order, etc.
Create a system where you can trade players. If the trade is clearly one-sided, you should have a process of vetoing the trade deal as well.

, You can do this one of two ways. First, you can calculate statistics the old fashioned way, using a pencil, paper, and a calculator. Look at the local sports page, use your fantasy point charts you created earlier, and add your points up. This takes very long however to do by hand, so it is recommended that you use a hosting site.Hosting sites basically calculate the fantasy score of each player every week. Instead of having to add the points yourself, they already have the job done for you. This way you can focus on the fun of fantasy sports, and not the downsides.
ESPN, NBA, MLB, NFL, Yahoo!, etc. all have fantasy scores written on their websites.

, The weekend before your sport begins is usually the best time to host a player draft. This is where you will all get together, write down all the players in your sport on one big board, and slowly draft them over the course of a few hours. You will want to bring a computer or smartphone with you, as you will need to use a hosting site to choose the best available players.As a host of draft night, make your friends feel at home. Typically the living room is used as the best place to draft players.
This is a great time to make a feast. Cook hotdogs, hamburgers, chili; have potato chips and pretzels; have three or four types of soda ready. The atmosphere should feel like you are at a tailgate party.
Once your players are drafted, you are ready to begin fantasy sports. Wait each week to see how your team does. Start and sit players based on their performances. Trade players for that final playoff push.

Walk in the fat-burn zone for 30 to 50 minutes.,
Jog while you look for Pokémon.,
Run between gyms or PokéStops.,
Do some push-ups and sit-ups each time that you stop.,
Ride your bike.",How to Burn Maximum Calories While Playing Pokémon GO2," Once you have determined your fat-burn zone, try to stay in it for at least 30 to 50 minutes. This will help you burn fat while you walk around looking for Pokémon. In order to focus on playing Pokémon GO, you may want to use a fitness tracker so that you are not distracted by checking your pulse.


The longer that you walk around, the more calories that you will burn. If you want to see the health benefits of playing Pokémon GO, try to play for at least 45 minutes.For example, if you weigh 156 lbs (71 kg), you will burn about 176 calories if you walk for about 40 minutes.Depending on your age, weight and gender, the number of calories you will burn while walking will vary.

, Another easy way to increase your heart rate and get into the fat-burn zone is to jog around while you play Pokémon GO. Instead of walking while you play the game, try lightly running as your search for Pokémon, visit gyms and go to PokéStops.Try jogging for at least thirty minutes.
Be sure to watch where you are going if you decide to jog and play Pokémon GO. Try not to get too distracted and run into someone or something.

, You can also use Pokémon GO to practice interval training. During this exercise, you do multiple short sprints. This will get your heart rate up and push it into the fat-burn zone. Consider running hard between gyms and PokéStops while you play, and then catch your breath once you get to where you are going.Depending on where you live, there may be less than a quarter of a mile (1/2 km) between PokéStops, which is ideal for interval running.
You can also decide to sprint for a certain amount of time, and then walk for a set amount of time. For example, you might sprint for two minutes and then walk for thirty seconds.

, Strength training can also help you maximize the number of calories that you burn while playing Pokémon GO. You can incorporate strengthen training into the game by doing some push-ups and sit-ups every time you stop at a PokéStop or a gym. Consider doing three sets of five push-ups at first and gradually increase the number every few weeks.If you are running intervals, do a set of pushups and sit-ups between each sprint.

, If you want to cover a lot of ground quickly and burn some calories, you might want to ride your bike. Consider cycling between PokéStops and gyms. This will allow you to cover a larger area and get in some good exercise. You can ride to a certain area, walk around looking for Pokémon and then bike somewhere else.Do not look at your phone while you ride your bike. If you are distracted, you can wreck and hurt yourself and others. While you ride your bike, put your phone away. Try to stay safe while playing Pokémon GO.

Play with someone else.,
Go to new places.,
Log your Pokémon and your exercise.",How to Burn Maximum Calories While Playing Pokémon GO3," Although you can play Pokémon GO on your own, the experience will likely be more fun if you play with someone else. It will also be easier to work out while you play if you have someone who is willing to exercise with you. Find a friend or family member who is willing to run or walk with you while you play Pokémon GO. They will help keep you motivated to play and workout.Ask a potential Pokémon buddy to play by saying something like “Would you want to play Pokémon with me?” or “Want to work out and play Pokémon?”

, Because different types of Pokémon appear in different places, you will want to be sure to try out new locations. For example, water-type Pokémon tend to appear around bodies of water like lakes, streams, and rivers. Visiting different locations may also help keep you motivated about exercising.You can look for Pokémon in your neighborhood or go to a local park.
You can also go hiking and find Pokémon in your local nature preserve.

, This will help you stay motivate and meet your goals. Keeping track of the Pokémon that you have caught and the amount of time that you have spent working out or the pounds that you have lost will allow you to monitor your progress, which can be highly motivating. If you are losing weight and catching Pokémon, you will want to keep playing the game.You can keep track of things like how much you exercised each day or how much weight you lost each week.
Although the game keeps track of what Pokémon you currently have, you may want to keep an overall tally of what types and how many Pokémon you have caught. This may be particularly important once you reach the max number you can carry and have to start trading your Pokémon with Professor Willow.

Join a gym or set up a home gym.,
Include cardio exercise.,
Try interval training.,
Commit to a weekly exercise class.,
Work with a trainer.",How to Boost Your Mood Through Exercise2," To set yourself up for a structured exercise program, you may consider joining a gym that is in your home area or close to your workplace. Look for a gym that will suit your budget and your exercise needs. Joining a gym will give you access to exercise equipment and exercise classes. You may also feel you will be more likely to exercise if you have a specific place or area for exercise that is not in your home.


If you cannot afford to join a gym or just prefer not to join a gym, you can do equipment-free workouts or you can buy some basic gym equipment. Designate an area of your home for exercise so you have a specific space where you can work out.
If you decide to buy exercise equipment, then buy a set of free weights and an exercise ball to start. Over time, you can also invest in an exercise bench and an exercise band for other exercises at home.

, Doing cardio exercises like running, jogging, or biking can all help to boost your mood and fight off feelings of depression or anxiety. Try to do 30 minutes of intense cardio exercise a day.You may go for a 30 minute run in the morning or later in the day as part of a structured exercise program. You may also warm up with 30 minutes of cardio exercise at the gym before moving on to other exercises.

, You can add interval training to your structured exercise program to push yourself and get fit. Interval training is when you perform bursts of intense physical activity, followed by intervals of lighter physical activity. Interval training can be a good way to get in shape and challenge your body with different levels of physical activity. You may create your own interval training program or use an existing interval training program that you find online or by talking with a professional trainer.For example, you may do interval training when you go running where you sprint for one minute, followed by two minutes of running at a regular speed. Or you may alternate between running at a high speed for two minutes and walking fast for two minutes.
You can also do interval training where you do several different exercises at various speeds. For example, you may run on a treadmill for five minutes, followed by three sets of push-ups. Then, you may run on the treadmill for five minutes, followed by three sets of sit ups.

, You may find it easier to exercise on a regular basis by taking an exercise class once a week or several times a week. You may commit to a weekly exercise class with a friend at your gym or take a class on your own. Having a set time for a fitness class every week can help you channel any stress or anxiety you may be feeling into exercise on a consistent basis.Many people find aerobics classes and dance classes to be a fun way to exercise and burn calories. You may also try a yoga class for a more calming, relaxing workout.

, Working with a professional fitness trainer can help you get the most out of your exercise program and ensure you are exercising safely. You may request a trainer at a gym or arrange for a trainer to visit you at home.Sessions with a trainer can be expensive so you may decide to only do a few training sessions at a time. You may ask for tips from the trainer and work with them to create a custom exercise plan.

You may also take the bus to work or school and get off a few stops early so you can walk the rest of the way.You may also try to get into the habit of biking to school or work on a daily basis. If you cannot bike every day you may try biking once or twice a week so you are doing some physical activity during the week.
If you have to drive to work, you can try parking further away and walking to the office. This will allow you to still get some exercise in at the start and end of your day.

, Doing work that requires physical movement, such as doing laundry, cleaning the house, or running papers up and down several floors in the office, can allow you to get a little workout in your day. Try to work on your feet, rather than sit down all the time.You may opt to do housework once a day to get a little physical activity or add tasks that force you to get up and move around at work.
Rather than opt for the elevator or the escalators at work or school, go for the stairs. Taking the stairs once or twice a day can allow you to add some physical activity to your day and get you moving.

, You can also add physical activity to your routine by doing quick, easy exercises throughout the day.

Determine your young athlete's favorite healthy foods.,
When you shop, look for the favorite items in bulk or on sale.,
If time is a factor — and it is for most busy sports families — cook several extra portions and freeze in meal-size packets or plan to consume a couple of times over the following few days.,
If your athlete drinks milk, consider purchasing whole milk.,
For snacks on the go, use transportable fruit, granola, trail mix, or meat jerky.,
Keep in mind that the more variety in the diet, the healthier it will be.,
Avoid processed ""combination"" foods.,
Cook the items your athlete likes simply.",How to Buy Healthy Foods for Young Athletes," Keep in mind that they should consume plenty of protein each day, as well as fresh vegetables and fruits and complex carbohydrates. Settle on some of the favorites as staples (i.e. chicken, tuna, broccoli, green beans and rice).;
, Use your freezer to store excess meats, fruits and vegetables. Purchase fruits and vegetables in season and freeze (or even dehydrate) them for later use. Even strawberries, peaches and blueberries can be delicious in smoothies or with yogurt after they are frozen. Also purchase items in larger sizes. A 25-lb bag of rice or pasta can save money per pound and will be used up more quickly than you might think. If you worry about pests, store in a plastic bin.    Purchase the most natural, highest quality food you can obtain or afford. If grass-fed meat and butter are not in your budget, go for good quality, natural options. Organic fruits and vegetables are best, but know which ones are most highly contaminated and therefore most important to buy organic.

, A vacuum sealer can be helpful for freezing items.

, The extra fat is actually valuable for the developing brain.

, Other snacks might include raw carrots with hummus or healthy dairy dip, peanut butter on celery, pretzels or hard-boiled eggs.

, Do not hesitate to try new things and encourage your athlete to explore different foods. Simple herbs and spices can also add flavor if some things taste bland, and many have health benefits as well.

, These usually contain hidden sugars, artificial sweeteners or unnecessary or harmful preservative ingredients. Breakfast cereals are generally over-processed, so if these are a must, look for those with lower sugar content and some portion of whole grains. Granola is simple to make and can be delicious and more nutritious than store-bought cereals.

, You can make enough for several meals at once and freeze or refrigerate extras, which saves on cost as well as time. For example, cook a whole chicken and vary the presentation over several meals to maximize one effort.

The hand you predominantly used in writing and drawing will often be how you identify which handedness you have, as it is the most socially relevant, apparent, and distinctive activity impacted by handedness.,
Look to see if the number of times you used each hand is equivalent or very close in number.",How to Determine Your Dominant Hand," A stylus, a pencil, a pen, even a chopstick (with its similar approximate shape) will do. Make a note of which hand felt most comfortable holding the object.;
, Write a sentence using one hand on a pad. Once finished, write the same sentence using your other hand. Make a note of which hand you were using when you wrote the clearer version of the sentence.


When choosing a sentence to write, use copy that you haven’t written before.
Remember that people are often forced to choose a specific hand to write with when young so you may naturally prefer one hand but use your other hand for writing if that is the way you were taught.

, Pick a hand and draw a circle, a square, and a triangle. Draw the same shapes with your other hand. Compare your drawings, and make a note of which hand produced clearer lines and more accurate shapes.

, Find several objects and place them directly in front of you. Pick it up, without consciously choosing a hand. This step will likely require several repeats over a period of time to erase accidental bias. Take note of which hand was used more frequently.

, Try bringing food to your mouth with an eating utensil, alternating using each hand. Make a note of which hand you use to bring food to your mouth most successfully, and if that preference changes depending on which utensils you are using (fork and knife, chopsticks, fork, spoon). Since most utensils do not have a hand-bias and are simple to operate, you will want to repeat this test until a preference is clear.

, Make sure it is a relatively easy figure to draw, but that still requires some fine motor skills to fill in within the lines. Make a copy of the drawing and color each with a different hand, aiming to stay within the lines. Make note of which hand you felt the most ease with.

, Using scissors designed for right or left-handed people will skew your results and you should seek out a proper pair of scissors. Cut shapes such as circles and triangles and squares with each hand and compare. , At either a target or a catcher, throw the ball and determine how effective each arm is at aiming and speed. If you have a catcher, when the ball is returned, make note of which hand you catch with. You will want to repeat several tosses to determine your accuracy and speed, as well as which hand works best at catching.

, Tally the number of times you used each hand in writing and drawing. Do the same for other manual activities, and take a total.

, Your other activities will give you an impression of your overall left or right-handedness. Which hand you identify as your dominant intuitively is likely to be your overall dominant hand, even if you write with the opposite hand. , If so, you are likely mixed-handed. You are truly ambidextrous if there was little to no difficulty or change in outcome from changing hands in the other activities. Standards of what defines being left or right handed are subjective, and it is not as simple as favoring a majority of tasks with one hand. "

See if you're taller than most of the girls you know.,
See if you have a hard time finding clothes that fit you.,
See if everyone around you asks if you play basketball or volleyball.,
See if you're taller than 5'6"".,
See if you're just hitting puberty earlier than other people.,
See if you can never blend in when you're in a crowd.,
See if you never have enough legroom.,
See if you tower over most of the guys your age.,
See if you feel guilty for always blocking everyone's view when you go to a concert or the movies.,
Remember that tall is beautiful.,
Don't slouch.,
Don't worry about being taller than the guys.,
Remember that the grass is always greener on the other side.",How to Determine if You Are a Tall Girl," If you're standing around a group of your friends and you're towering over them, then yeah, you're tall. Check out a photo of you and your friends and see where you stack up -- if you're a head above the rest of your friends, then yep, you're probably tall. But remember that it also depends on who you hang out with -- you won't look so tall if you're hanging out with members of the volleyball team instead of regular girls.;
, If you regularly have a hard time finding pants that fit you because they are always too short, then yeah, you're tall. You may even hear your girlfriends complaining about always having to hem their pants because they are too long and may wonder what the heck they are talking about. You may also have a hard time finding shirts that don't look like belly shirts when you put them on.


As for shorts, if you're tall, then it may be hard for you to find shorts that cover much of your legs; if your school has a dress code where your fingertips have to reach the bottom of your shorts, it may be nearly impossible for you to find a pair of shorts that is long enough.

, If everyone around you asks if you play these ""tall girl"" sports, then it may be a sign that you are taller than average. This can be annoying if you don't actually play those sports -- or any sports at all! People love to assume things about others because of their looks, and you shouldn't get too discouraged by this.

, Though this measurement can change depending on what country you're from, in general, if you're taller than this, you can be considered tall.

, In general, girls hit puberty between the ages of 8-13, and boys hit puberty between the ages of 9-15. This means that, if you feel tall but you're only 11, you may just be developing faster than a lot of your girl friends, and may be taller than the boys around you, who will take a bit longer to catch up. If you're still in the midst of puberty and many of your friends haven't hit puberty yet, then don't worry -- in a year or two, you'll be surprised by how quickly you stop feeling like ""the tall girl.""

, If you're in a room full of people, and your friends can spot you right away from across the crowded space, then yeah, it may be because you're so tall that you stand out easily. There's nothing wrong with that -- who says that standing out is a bad thing?

, Whether you're sitting on a plane or in the passenger seat of your friend's car, if you always feel like you have to move your legs to one side, recline the seat, or just contort your body to get your feet on the ground, then you may be a tall girl.

, If those middle school or high school dances are awkward because any guy you dance with is just short enough to be eye-level with your chest when it's time to sway to a slow song, then yeah, you're a tall girl. But don't be discouraged -- there's a good chance that a lot of the guys you know haven't stopped growing yet.

, You can't help being tall. But still, you find yourself feeling guilty whenever you go to a concert or the movies, because you just know that the person behind you can't see a thing. There's not much you can do about it -- except slouch in your seat. If this sounds like you, then you're probably a tall girl.

, And hey, so is being short. Don't think that being tall means you have to be gangly, awkward, or unappealing. Plenty of beautiful women are tall, and they know how to own their tall look by not shying away from attention. Don't think that being tall makes you somehow inadequate or unappealing to guys. Here are some tall female celebrities, just to show you that you're not alone: Gwyneth Paltrow (5'9""), Jordin Sparks (5'9""), Charlize Theron (5'10""), Taylor Swift (5'10""), Famke Janssen (6""), and Maria Sharapova (6'2"")., You may think that slouching will make you look shorter, and while this is literally true, it will actually call more attention to the fact that you're not happy with your height. So stand tall and proud and don't worry about towering over the people around you -- they should be the ones wishing they were as tall as you!

, Sure, guys may be intimidated by you because you're so tall, but that doesn't mean you can't talk to them or show them how awesome you are. Don't think that you have no chance with a guy just because he's shorter than you. If you find a guy you like, get to know him and you'll see that height is just a number.

, You may be feeling miserable because you feel like you're taller than all of your friends and that all of your shorts are too short, but your short friend may hate having to stand on her tip-toes to talk to people or having to hem all of her jeans by half a foot so that they'll fit her. You may not want to be tall, but plenty of girls would die to be in your shoes! Whether you're tall or short, it's all about embracing who you are instead of wishing you were someone else.

Assess your needs.,
Use a referral service.,
Get references.,
Research your potential life coach.,
Schedule an interview and a sample session.",How to Choose the Right Life Coach,"


Life coaches base their practices on a particular subject area such as business, relationships, grief, mid-life issues, etc. Decide what you need life coaching for. If you are having problems with your spouse or children, you don't want to choose a personal life coach whose focus is on weight loss. Understand that hiring a life coach is a personal investment that can be costly. The hourly fee for a life coach can run from $50 to $400 or more per 1 hour session.
Knowing the direction you want to take in life, and having some idea of what your goals are, will help you in choosing the life coach that can guide you in developing strategies to accomplish your goals. A life coach can help you if you feel stuck in a certain area of your life; help you stay motivated and help you to pursue a dream you have carried for a long time, but never took the steps to make it happen.
A personal life coach is not a counselor or a therapist. Life coaches work with emotionally healthy, high-functioning people who need support to achieve goals they cannot get from the people in their lives. A life coach does not treat mental illness.;
,


Many life coach certification programs and professional organizations, like the International Coach Federation, offer a referral service on their websites. Most referral databases can be searched by location and area of specialty. A referral service will also inform you if the life coach is certified.

,


Ask family and friends or associates for a reference. Be sure to get a reference from a person who has actually been coached by the person they are referring you to. Ask questions about the life coach's personality, the area the coach specializes in and the emotional support the coach provides.

,


Once you have identified a life coach you think you would like to work with, explore his or her website or blog. Find out if the coach is a certified life coach and what area of coaching he or she specializes in. Try to determine if you share the coach's perspective on life in general and in pursuing goals. Compare the information you gather from the life coach's online presence with any information you have gained from personal references or a referral service.

,


Meet with the life coach and ask questions that may not have been answered during your research. Ask about the hourly fee and if the coach requires a commitment to attend a minimum number of sessions. Question the coach about his or her life coach training and the type of continued education he or she participates in. Verify the coach's specialty and discuss the format of a regular session.
If the coach offers a free session, schedule one to determine if the coach is a good match. During the session, consider the following questions: Do you feel comfortable with the coach? Is this someone you think you can trust? Do you get the impression that the coach will hold you accountable for accomplishing your goals?

If one of your friends has on an outfit you really like, you can ask them where they got it.,
Write down all of your unique interests and tastes.,
Ask yourself who you want to be.,
Think about what kind of clothing you would wear as this person.,
Look in your closet and see what you already have.,
Go shopping.,
Wear it with confidence.,
Create an inspirational scrapbook or portfolio of clothes or styles you like.",How to Choose Your Style," Look around you and notice what friends, family, movie stars, musicians etc. are wearing. Ask yourself what you like/don't like about their personal style and make note of the things you would like to add to your own style.;
, Discover your personality, interests, likes and dislikes. You probably already know if you prefer rock music or country, blue jeans or pencil skirts but have you ever really thought about each of your tastes and what that means to your personal style? Make a list, either mentally or on a piece of paper of all your unique interests and tastes and circle a few that you would like to convey.

, After you've discovered your tastes, you'll probably have a better idea of what you want to be. However, make sure that it is something you really want and have the personality for and not just something you think is cool. For example, do you want people to see you as an artist, or an athlete, a romantic or a rocker?

, You can use the internet to do some research on what kind of clothing others of your style like to wear. Write down the styles you like as well as your favourite colours and general clothing items. Unless you want to be really hardcore, you don't need to buy everything super sporty or really artsy. Feel free to splash in other items and colours that you like as well-that will make it more unique anyway.

, Perhaps you actually have a whole collection of berets that would suit your Bohemian or Artist look. Maybe your closet is full of jeans that you could rip up for your vintage style. It's always best to start at home before spending a bunch of money on new clothing.

, You don't have to go anywhere fancy - the thrift store will do! Of course, you probably want to get a few new things but depending on your budget, buying a whole new wardrobe from the mall could be pretty expensive. While shopping, look for things that grab your eye and suit your new style.

, Start showing off your new style by wearing it. It may be hard at first to make new outfits or, if your style is extremely unique, to wear it out but the sooner you do this step, the sooner you will have your own style.

, A good place to find clothing advertisements are in magazines, especially fashion ones. Looking at these can give you ideas of what you would like to wear, and clothes to buy to help establish your personal sense of style.

Thrift shops and garage sales are great places to piece up vanities at decent prices. Don't worry about the color; you can always repaint it!
Can't find anything? Get two sets of drawers that are the same height, and place them 2 to 3 feet (60.96 to 91.44 centimeters) apart. Place a matching tabletop over them and secure with industrial-strength glue.;
, If you bought a piece of furniture at a thrift shop of garage sale, it might need a fresh coat of paint. You can repaint an old vanity using interior paint or spray paint following these easy steps:Take the vanity apart and take the pieces outside or into a well-ventilated area.
Lightly sand the vanity down and wipe the dust off with a damp cloth.
Apply a coat of primer and wait for it to dry.
Apply 2 to 3 coats of paint. Wait at least 20 minutes before applying each coat.
Take the pieces back inside and re-assemble the vanity. Add new knobs, if desired.

, You can use glass, Plexiglas/acrylic, or even mirror.Make sure that it is the right size for your table, or have a framing shop trim it down for you.

, A simple, cushioned stool would be ideal, but an upholstered chair or stool will be the most luxurious.You can also use a simple chair if you don't care for fancy tings. If the chair does not have a cushion, but you want it to be more comfortable, you can always buy a small cushion for it.

Avoid revealing clothing.,
Match your skin tone to your clothing.,
Adapt Kate's casual look.,
Create Kate's hairstyle.",How to Copy Kate Middleton's Style," Kate Middleton never wears anything too low-cut or revealing these days. She is also very careful about the length of her clothing and avoids wearing anything that is too short.



Knee-length is a good option.;
, When Kate and William announced their engagement, Kate wore an absolutely beautiful dress by Isaac. The dress shown in the image here is of a similar colour. This is actually by Gucci, in a colour perfect for Kate who has got beautiful skin tone and stunning glossy brown locks always blow dried to perfection, so the colour really brings out her beauty. Aim to do the same with your own appearance.


Obviously, you can (and should) wear whichever colour you like, the one that suits you best. But you have to bear in mind, if dressing like Kate, she doesn’t ever wear anything over the top. It’s always simple, classic and sophisticated, and she always looks amazing everywhere she goes. So avoid the hot pinks and crazy patterns!

, Kate also has a casual look, so she’s never afraid to wear a pair of skinny jeans and just a casual blouse or jumper (sweater) from Topshop and she also loves other High Street brands. She’s been seen several times in various dresses and as soon as she’s seen wearing them, everybody wants to buy them.


If you do see Kate wearing something from a High Street store, make sure you get there fast because everyone else will be doing it as well.
If you’re going to try to get Kate Middleton’s style, get some nice colours such as in electric blue, an almost purple colour that she’s often seen wearing.

Women have started asking for the ""Kate"" from her usual hairstylist, Richard Ward Hair & Metrospa in London.But if you can't make it to that salon, take along a photo of Kate's hair and ask your hairdresser to imitate the style.


Keep your hair long and keep the colour as natural as possible. if you must dye it, only dye one shade lighter, and ask for a dye that increases the glossy appearance of your hair.
Keep the hair in excellent condition with quality shampoos, conditioners, and regular cuts and styling.

Go for fluorescent lights with a white hue if you must use an artificial light source.",How to Create Your Own Vanity2," Avoid getting a mirror with a thin, delicate frame, as it won't hold up well to being hunt. The mirror can be any shape: round, oval, square, or rectangular. If you are using a bathroom counter, then you likely don't need another mirror.


If you don't like the color of your mirror's frame, paint it! Take the mirror out or mask it off with painter's tape first, however.
If you can't find a mirror that you like, use a picture frame instead. Replace the glass with a piece of mirror instead.
If you'd like a girlish touch, consider a vintage, oval mirror with an ornate frame. Paint it white, ivory, or a soft pink or blue., Sit down in your chair at least 1 foot (30.48 centimeters) away from where the mirror will be. Take note of where your eye level is, then stand up.

Not all of the steps in this section are mandatory. Use them as ideas to get your imagination flowing.

, You can also get a metal cake stand and paint it any color you wish using glossy spray paint. If you can't find one, you can make one using these simple steps:Glue a glass candlestick down on top of a glass plate. Use an epoxy or industrial-strength glue.
Glue a smaller, matching plate on top of the candlestick.
Repeat with a smaller candlestick and plate for another tier.
Spray paint, if desired, and let it dry before using it.

, Choose trays that are small; your items should be able to fill the tray without much space left over. Metal trays will look the most elegant, but you can also use plastic or glass ones as well. Make sure that they match your vanity!If you are using a wooden try, consider decoupaging vintage or Victorian themed pictures onto it.

, Fill the bottom of the larger containers with glass gems, and use them to store your makeup brushes. They will help hold the brushes upright.


You don't have to keep the jar lids. If you do decide to keep them, consider painting them a bright color to make them look more interesting., You can use a color that matches the inside of the drawer, or you could use a contrasting color.

Consider draping something above your mirror for a mire girlish touch.,
Keep your vanity tidy and leave out only your statement pieces.",How to Create Your Own Vanity4," By now, your vanity is finished, but you could always make it look more cozy and personalized by adding some final touches to it. There are lots of ways in which to decorate a vanity. This section will give you ideas for a few of those ways.


Not all of the steps in this section are necessary. Use the ones you like for inspiration.

, They can be real or fake.You could even use flower garlands instead! Choose a pretty vase that matches your vanity and place it in the corner, close to the wall. Add the flowers and spread them out a little to make the bouquet appear fuller. If you are using a garland, hand it above the mirror.


For a rustic look, fill the bottom of a mason jar with glass gems, then add the flowers. You can tie a ribbon around the middle of the jar for a pop of color.

, Choose a candle that looks or smells nice (both is a bonus) and set it down on a pretty plate or charger. Set the candle down close to the mirror, where it will reflect when lit.Consider changing the candles out with the seasons. Use floral scented ones for the spring, fruity for the summer, and spicy for the fall or winter.
You don't have to light the candle at all. If you do, remember not to leave it unattended.

, This is not completely necessary, but it can make your vanity look more interesting.You can use photographs or paintings. Make sure that the frames you use go well with the mirror. To avoid competition and clutter, choose simpler, thinner frames.

, You can use a string of pretty lights, tulle, or even a flower garland. If you are using Christmas lights, go for the kind that have a white cable; green will look too Christmas-y. If you are using tulle, tie some pretty ribbon in the middle and at each corner before it drapes down the side of the mirror. This will give it a fancier, curtained look.

, Keep everything else safely stored away. While not quite decorating, keeping your vanity clean will make it look nicer. A messy, cluttered vanity won't look very pretty. Keep everything in its place and stored away. Your vanity should only have decorative items and organizers on display, so tuck those hairbrushes and eye shadow pans away!

Look for compression styles for intense activities.,
Buy fitted leggings for yoga.,
Get a looser fit if you need freedom of movement.,
Decide when you're going to work out.,
Identify where you plan to wear your workout leggings the most.,
Consider the longevity of the fabric.,
Check reviews on brands.,
List additional features you'd prefer.,
Locate stores with a wide variety.,
Prioritize fit and comfort over size.,
Move around in the fitting room.,
Assess the fit from all angles.",How to Choose Workout Leggings," Compression fabrics are tightly woven to help increase the circulation in your legs. If you're engaging in an intense workout such as running or kickboxing, they can help reduce your soreness following your workout.Compression leggings tend to be more expensive, so unless you're engaging in high-intensity activities they may not be necessary.
However, they have an added benefit of making your legs look taut, your muscles more defined. So if money is no object, you may prefer them for this reason alone.;
, You don't necessarily need a compression-style legging if you're going to be wearing them mainly for yoga, and you may find compression leggings a hindrance. You do, however, need to choose a fitted style that won't interfere with your poses.Remember that in yoga, you may very well be bending over with your butt in the air, so before buying leggings, make sure you can bend over completely without exposing more than you want, and make sure the back of the leggings aren't sheer when stretched over your backside.
Wearing fitted leggings also will allow your yoga instructor to check your form, which they may be unable to do if you're wearing looser clothing that conceals the position of your body.
Additionally, many yoga poses require you to balance one foot on the other leg, or grip parts of your leg. This can be difficult if you're wearing loose clothing.
While your yoga leggings should be fitted, they shouldn't be tight or constricting. Pick breathable fabric and an elastic waist that allows you to breathe deeply and doesn't pinch.

, If you're going to be wearing your workout leggings when lifting weights, hiking, climbing, or other activities where your freedom of movement is paramount, a relaxed fit will be an asset.Looser fitting leggings will allow you to move comfortably without worrying about a possible ""wardrobe malfunction.""
For activities that might involve abrupt movements, you don't want your leggings to get in the way or restrict your range.
Looser fits also may be more flattering for these kinds of activities. Keep in mind ""relaxed"" or ""loose"" doesn't necessarily mean ""baggy."" Pants that are too big and don't fit properly can trip you up and cause significant problems.

, The time of day you plan to work out may impact the types of fabric you choose, as well as the weight of the fabric. If you exercise outdoors, the time of year also may be a factor.The time of day can affect the colors you choose if you intend to run or exercise outside. If you're out when there's not much light, you'll want to wear lighter colors or leggings that have reflective stripes or patches.
You also want to avoid wearing black, which can heat you up, if you're going to be working out in the middle of the day with the sun beating down on you.
If you live in a climate where it is cold for a good portion of the year but you still jog or exercise outside, you need a fabric in a heavier weight that will wick moisture away from your body.
On the other hand, if you exercise outside in a warmer climate, you need light, breathable fabric that won't add a lot of weight to your skin.
Breathable, lightweight fabrics also are important if you exercise outside in a humid climate, or if you're doing activities such as hot yoga that take place in a warmer, more humid location.

, You're going to choose different leggings if you plan only to wear them at the gym than you would choose if you know you'll also wear them elsewhere.If you plan to wear your leggings out in public or to run errands as well as to the gym, you'll likely want a more versatile, subtle design such as a solid, neutral color.
However, if you're just going to be at the gym, you may not mind large, loud logos and crazy patterns.
Your preferences for the thickness of the fabric and the overall fit also may change if you plan on wearing your leggings out in public. What passes in the gym or yoga studio might not be a good choice for work or dinner out.

, The longevity of a garment can affect not only the type of fabric you choose but also how much money you spend on a particular garment. Regardless of the brand, certain fabrics simply hold up better over time.You'll also want to consider how often you need to launder your leggings and how convenient it is o wash them.


Cotton is soft and moderately breathable, but it has a tendency to stretch out and lose its shape over time. Bright colors also may fade.
Synthetic fabrics such as nylon or spandex will retain their shape and may have important moisture-wicking properties. They are quick-drying and generally can be washed in a machine (though you should try to wash them with other synthetic fabrics). The fabric also will pill over time, however, and sweat will actually smell more pungent on synthetic fibers.Look at the care instructions on the label of the pants before you buy them and consider how often you'll need to wash them. If you perspire a lot, your leggings might need frequent laundering. Some fabrics fare better washed by hand, or in cold water and hung to dry. Some fabrics handle bacteria better and can tolerate sitting in a laundry basket for a few days and others will need rinsed right after use. Check to make sure they won’t shrink in the dryer, or fade in the wash. Specialty dying on some leggings requires hand washing with delicate soap not detergent.

, If you're thinking about investing in name brand or designer workout leggings, take some time to go online and look at reviews of the product from experts as well as other consumers.Look at the background and any other information you can find about the person writing the review.
Prioritize reviews by professionals or avid practitioners who are pursuing the same activities for which you want the leggings.
Take anonymous reviews with a grain of salt. If there are a significant number of them that have the same complaint, you may want to take that into consideration; however, keep in mind that anybody can write an anonymous review for any reason.

, Workout leggings have a number of features that may or may not be important to you, depending on when, where, and how you plan on wearing your leggings.It's worth thinking about features before you go shopping, because many of these extras also increase the price of workout leggings. You don't want to pay for features you don't need and aren't going to use.
For example, some leggings come with pockets for your keys. If you only work out at the gym and keep your keys in a locked gym locker, chances are you're never going to use those pockets.
However, if you run at a neighborhood park and have to drive to the location, having a pocket for your keys would be a tremendous asset.
Similarly, reflective stripes or patches probably aren't going to be necessary to you unless you plan on running outside in low light – either early in the morning or in the evening.

, If it's your first time buying workout leggings, you typically will save time and effort by going to a store in person rather than trying to order your workout leggings online.Typically the best place to start is a large department store, a discount store, or a sporting goods chain.
You may be able to find workout leggings cheaper online, but you don't have the benefit of being able to try them on immediately.
Even if a website offers free returns, you'll still have to make the effort to repackage your purchase and take it to the post office or shipping service and you will often have to pay return shipping fees. Then you may have to wait a week or more before your money is refunded.

, The size on the label won't necessarily correspond with the sizes you wear in regular clothing. Typically exercise clothing runs smaller, but regardless you should be focusing on how the leggings fit, not the number on the tag.If the leggings pinch or pull anywhere, or if you find you have to adjust them frequently, they aren't going to be good for you to wear when exercising.
Ideally, your workout leggings should virtually disappear from your mind from the moment you put them on. If you're thinking or worrying about your leggings, you're not focused on your workout.
Pay attention to seams as well. If you can feel a seam digging into your skin, it may have a negative impact on your performance.

, Part of fit is understanding how the leggings are going to move with you and what's going to happen when you stretch and bend. Make movements similar to those you'll make in your exercises to get a general idea of fit and comfort.Doing deep bends and leg lifts can help you determine how the fabric will move with you. If you're flexible enough, doing a split will give you a good indication of whether the leggings will be constricting on your upper legs and hips.
As you move, take note of whether you feel the need to pull your leggings up or adjust them. Keep in mind that if you're spending all your time adjusting your clothing, you're probably not going to get a very good workout.
If the leggings feel tight or uncomfortable after doing a few moves in a fitting room, they probably will give you even more trouble when you're deep into a 20- or 30-minute routine.

, Most fitting rooms come equipped with multiple mirrors that allow you to view the garment from all sides. Check carefully to make sure you're comfortable with how the leggings fit in different positions.It's natural for your leggings to move a little as you move; however, if you do a deep bend and your leggings slide down to expose half of your rear, you probably need to go up a size or two.
On the other hand, if the fabric pools at your joints when you move in them, they may be too large.

Do a deep clean with tea tree oil.,
Use coconut oil.,
Try an eyebrow serum.",How to Clean Your Eyebrows2," Your eyebrows usually do not need more than a basic wash every now and then.

Determine if you're a good candidate for treatment.,
Understand how your medical history impacts the procedure.,
Make an appointment for a consultation.,
Inquire about the fees for the procedure.,
Consider ablative laser resurfacing.,
Consider non-ablative laser resurfacing.,
Consider fractional laser treatment.,
Prepare for the procedure.,
Know what to expect from the procedure.,
Recover from resurfacing.",How to Choose Laser Skin Resurfacing," Decide if your skin type can be effectively treated by laser resurfacing. Keep in mind that laser skin resurfacing is not a permanent cure for skin problems. Still, it can set the clock back—the treatment’s good effects can last for several years.


Of patients surveyed thirty months after receiving skin resurfacing, seventy-five percent were pleased with the results.Pigmentation in darker skin lends itself to absorbing more heat from the laser and is prone to side effects such as blistering or discoloration.Skin imperfections that are minor do not warrant laser skin resurfacing. Other less substantial treatments are appropriate for minor skin problems.
Resurfacing is good for minor wrinkles and lines and scarring from acne. However, active acne can present problems in tolerating the process.
Liver spots, sun-damaged skin, aging skin and some birth marks are problems that can be addressed by the laser procedure.If you scar easily, you’re not a good candidate for laser resurfacing of large areas of skin.;
, Your medical background might affect your ability to tolerate the procedure. It could be a factor in how well the procedure works for you.


Skin that is not oily is less likely to scar after the procedure.
The procedure is best performed on patients who don’t have current medical problems such as a connective skin disorder.
If you’re on medication, speak to your doctor. People who are on medications that can cause complications for the procedure might not be good candidates.
Acne elevates the risk of infection. So even though acne can be treated by the procedure, it also can pose problems.Tell your doctor if you smoke. Smoking can prolong recovery from the procedure., Select a surgeon based on education and experience. Look for a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. There will be a fee for the consultation. Discuss with your doctor/dermatologist what to expect in terms of the aesthetic improvements to your skin and the recovery period.


Be prepared to discuss your medical history including allergies, surgeries and medications.
Tell your dermatologist if you’re at risk for cold sores or blisters around your mouth.
Discuss past skin treatments that you’ve received.
Request a look at photographs of patients who had skin problems similar to yours that were treated by laser skin resurfacing.
Ask about the possibility of scarring.
Ask your doctor to clarify the risks involved in the procedure., Fees will vary in accordance with where you’re having the procedure done. Be aware that medical insurance does not usually cover this type of cosmetic surgery.


The average cost of laser skin resurfacing is about two thousand three hundred dollars.
There are some cases when insurance might apply, such as for taking out pre-cancerous growths.
Inquire about financing. There may be a payment plan offered by your physician., Ablative lasers deliver strong bursts of light that peel away layers of skin. The ablative laser process is more invasive than non-ablative laser skin resurfacing.


The effects of ablative skin resurfacing are more dramatic than with other resurfacing methods and can last for many years.Ablative laser resurfacing works well on aged skin, deep wrinkling, acne and chickenpox scars.After the procedure the skin will be raw and could ooze and crust. The skin is “wounded” and pain will be present.
You’ll need ice packs to reduce swelling and an over-the-counter pain killer.
It will take one or two weeks for new skin to cover the resurfaced areas.
The risks and side effects from ablative resurfacing include redness and swelling of skin, changes in the color of the skin, acne and infection., Non-ablative resurfacing is gentler than ablative. It's a non-wounding procedure which targets tissue that's underneath the skin. This process doesn't injure the skin; it stimulates a healing process which creates new skin. Its effects are not as dramatic as the ablative process.


Non-ablative laser resurfacing is effective for mild skin problems including moderate wrinkling and stretch marks.
You may need ice packs to reduce the redness and swelling of skin, but the swelling is temporary and not as painful as with the ablative procedure.The results of the non-ablative procedure are not immediately noticeable. The improvements to your skin will become visible over a period of several months.
This treatment may have to be repeated several times to wholly address the skin problem.
The risks of the non-ablative procedure include some swelling and redness of skin and a potential for infection. Darker pigmented skin may become temporarily darker., Fractional lasers focus light on very small areas of the skin. This technique could be thought of as a hybrid between the ablative/non-ablative treatments. It works with the outer layer of skin and the layer beneath and stimulates the formation of collagen.


Wrinkling skin, lines in the skin and pigmentation problems can be treated with fractional laser skin resurfacing. The treatment is appropriate for neck, hand and chest areas.
Fractional laser treatment is accompanied by some pain. A topical anesthetic may be administered.A cooling device may be used during the procedure to help reduce pain.
The treatment process will require subsequent treatments, four to five, and the results will be gradually apparent.
The risks and side effects from this process include the possibility of infection, and some swelling and peeling of skin. Most patients tolerate this process well., Many doctors think of this procedure as a type of surgery. It’s not as invasive as conventional surgery, but still requires preparation. Laser skin resurfacing can also have a fairly lengthy recovery process depending on which laser treatment you select.You may be told to refrain from taking medications prior to the procedure.
The doctor may ask you not to take vitamin E.
You may be given special creams to apply to your skin a few weeks before the resurfacing.
An antiviral medication may be prescribed if you’ve suffered from herpes.
Your doctor will advise you to refrain from excessive sun exposure.
Smokers will have to stop two weeks before the resurfacing date, as smoking extends the healing period.Line up someone who can drive you home from the treatment facility and stay with you on the night of the procedure., The procedure will most likely be performed in the physician's office. It also could be performed in a hospital or ambulatory facility. Laser skin resurfacing is an outpatient procedure.The doctor may provide you with eye shields before the procedure begins.
Your heart, blood pressure and pulse may be monitored during the procedure.
Small areas of skin are numbed with a local anesthetic .
If larger areas of skin are being resurfaced, you might receive a general anesthetic .
The time range for the treatment is between 35 minutes and 2 hours, depending on how much of the skin is being resurfaced., The skin resurfacing treatment is an outpatient procedure.Directly after the procedure you'll be taken to a recovery room and monitored. Once you get home, the recovery time will depend on which of the three resurfacing processes you choose.The recovery time for non-ablative laser skin resurfacing is minimal. For the most part, patients can resume work directly after the process.Fractional laser skin resurfacing also has a short recovery period with some swelling for 2-3 days after the process.Ablative laser skin resurfacing has a longer recovery period of about 2-4 weeks. The skin will feel sunburned and require ointment.
Ablative treatment will require several follow-up appointments with your physician."

Keep leather items out of the sun.,
Keep the items in a cool, dry place when not in use.,
Keep leather away from abrasives that can scuff or cut it.,
Add moisture to your leather.",How to Care for Leather1," The sun will dry the leather out and cause it to become brittle. Once your leather has become brittle it will become to crack and deteriorate.;
, Mildew can deteriorate leather if it is allowed to grow on it. Don’t leave your items in a humid or wet basement – this could promote the growth of mildew.


Don’t keep your leather in plastic either. Removing all air supply from the leather is bad for the material., Once leather has been damaged, there is no way to repair it. Keep in mind that you can only prevent this to a degree, so don’t obsess over it. Try not to leave your leather on a gravel driveway, for example. However, throughout the lifespan of your leather something is bound to happen to it.

Distinguish between introversion and anti-social behavior.,
Distinguish between introversion and being ""shy."",
Pay attention to what excites you.,
Look beyond the dichotomy.,
Pursue solitary hobbies.,
Try staying in on Friday night.,
Speak less.,
Focus on one-on-one relationships.,
Make your living space comfortable.,
Pursue a career and interests that require fewer interactions.,
Focus on one task at a time.,
Dig deeper.,
Take on solo responsibilities and work alone.",How to Become an Introvert," There are a lot of misconceptions about what being introverted means, and it's not an ""anti-social"" behavior. Introverts are regenerated and energized by spending time alone, and often prefer solitude to group activities, which many introverts find emotionally taxing.


Anti-social personality disorder is more akin to psychopathy or sociopathy, and refers to an inability to empathize or emotionally connect with others. Truly anti-social people are often ego-driven and superficially charming in ways that correspond more with a traditional view of extroversion.There is nothing wrong with introversion, and although many self-help books and get-rich guides suggest that extroversion is the key to happiness and wealth, there's no evidence to suggest that one personality trait is more productive or successful than the other.Both personality types can be creative and productive in the right working environment.;
, While many introverts may be said to be ""shy"" in public, this isn't necessarily the case, and it's important to learn the difference. Introversion is not a measure of shyness, just as extroversion means more than ""being outgoing.""


Shyness refers to a fear of speaking out in group situations and failing to communicate with others, and a preference for solitude based on this fear.
Introverts prefer solitude because working alone is more stimulating than working with others, and social interactions may be more taxing than exciting for the introvert. Introverts aren't necessarily ""scared"" to interact with others, they are just unenthusiastic about it.

, Are you energized by the thought of spending time alone? Would you rather work on a project alone, or collaborate with others? In a group situation, would it drive you crazy to not contribute your thoughts, or would you rather save your opinions for a side conversation?


Generally speaking, you don't ""become"" an introvert by changing your behaviors, because there's little point in spending more time alone if you don't enjoy it, or it doesn't stimulate you creatively.
Pay attention to your own tendencies and foster them. If you think you're extroverted, there's no reason to try to change yourself. Instead, give yourself a more social work environment to be productive.

, A person doesn't have to be clearly in one or the other ""camp."" Ambiversion is a term used to describe people who move comfortably between the two ends of the personality spectrum, and a great many people actually score somewhere in the 50/50 range on personality tests.Try taking a Myers-Briggs personality test to learn more about how you score in the personality department, and what this might tell you about how to foster your traits and give yourself the best chance for success, given your unique qualities and desires.

, If you want to get a feel for what the life of the introvert is like, explore hobbies that require you to be alone to pursue them, or are greatly improved by the solitary experience. Introverted hobbies might include things like:


Gardening
Reading and writing creatively
Painting
Golf
Playing an instrument
Hiking

, If you want to take a little step toward creating a more introverted space for yourself, try staying in next Friday night, instead of going out. Introverts are often exhausted by social interactions, much preferring to spend an evening relaxing with a good book than by hitting the town or heading to a party. If you want to see whether this agrees with you, try it out.


Do you ever secretly hope your friends will cancel plans, so you can stay in and catch up on Netflix? Do you sometimes regret saying yes to party invites? These are good indications of introversion.

, Introverts aren't the chattiest people in the room. To behave in a more introverted way, try remaining mostly silent in your next group interaction, letting others talk more than you do. Ask questions to get others talking, but try to keep things focused on others and less on yourself.


Speaking less doesn't mean disengaging entirely. Practice listening more than you speak, and reflect before you respond to others statements to stay engaged in things without constantly talking.
Are you ever embarrassed when a group's attention shifts to you? This is a good indication of introversion. If you secretly love the spotlight, that's more of an extroverted trait.

, Introverts aren't isolated loners who are unable to communicate with people, they're just exhausted by the work of socializing, and prefer solo reflection. It's much more common for introverts to enjoy having deep, meaningful conversations with friends one-on-one, instead of going out with a big group.


If you're not a big fan of parties, it's still good to try to make an effort at keeping up your friendships with regular one-on-one hangouts, to avoid seeming distant or cold. Let your good friends know you just prefer solo hang-outs.
Do you cringe at the idea of small talking at dinner parties? Good indication of introversion.

, If you're going to be spending more time alone, it's a good idea to make your living space a sanctuary. Make it the kind of place you'd prefer to spend time. Whether you want candles, incense, and your favorite books around, or a mini fridge and a record player all at arms' length from your favorite sitting chair, organize your space with your comfort in mind.


Check out this article for tips on organizing your room.

, The less time you've got to spend around others, the more introverted your existence will become by necessity. If you think you benefit from living a more introverted lifestyle, try to pursue interests, jobs, and hobbies that will allow you to live that way and work at your most productive.The following jobs are all good for introverts:


Computer programming
Writing and editing
Research scientists
Court reporters
Archival work or library science

, Extroverts are multi-takers, while introverts prefer diving into one task and seeing it through to completion. try to prioritize your time to keep focused on each thing you need to do before you move on to the next., Introverts generally dislike small talk, preferring to dig deeper and have more serious, intellectual, or hard-hitting conversations. This also applies to the type of work and creative projects introverts like to take on.


Next time you're working on a project for work or school, don't be satisfied with merely doing ""enough,"" or with doing what's expected of you. Go above and beyond. Put your own creative twist on the project, putting some extra effort into it.

, Introverts prefer working alone instead of working with others on group projects. If you often value the help of others, try taking on a project all by yourself next time and seeing if you can't do it without extra help. This might help increase your confidence and allow you to rely on yourself more in the future, even if it's necessary to work with others in some cases.Get what you can from collaborations. Often, you'll have to work with others, and introverts shouldn't reject the talents and abilities of others, just because they prefer working alone. Learn to negotiate group projects without controlling them, taking the help offered and delegating separate tasks, so you can also have some alone time.

Be self-sufficient. The less you need to ask for help, the less you'll have to rely on the help of others.

Decide upon which type of hair salon you would like to visit.,
Look in the phone book or online for hair salons.,
Ask the hair salon receptionist for a menu of the salon's services.,
Check out the cleanliness of the hair salon.,
Consider how receptive the staff are.,
Take a look at the staff.,
Take a quick look at the range of the hair care products.,
Take a look at the quality of other people's hair and hairstyles.,
Book a first appointment with a hair salon you think might be good.,
Expect a full consultation before anything is done to your hair.,
Assess the stylist's competency.,
Consider how the stylist makes you feel.,
Be honest about your final assessment after the appointment.",How to Choose a Hair Salon," Decide whether you would like to visit a hairdresser or a barber.


Ask friends or family for recommendations.;
, Check the addresses, to see which hair salons are local to you. It's worth trying local salons first, for if you find one you love that is close to you, it removes the stress of having to add travel as a consideration whenever visiting the salon. It won't always work out but it's worth at least looking.


Go to your local shopping mall or plaza, and check out what kind of salons they have there.
Don't presume that just because a hair salon has a fancy central business district street address that it must be automatically the best place to go to. Sometimes such a place can be snooty and overpriced while the local one might be spot on in affordable pricing and filled with lovely and caring stylists.

, Look at the prices of the various services, and compare them with the prices of some of the other salons that you have been to. Consider your own determination of what is reasonable by way of prices in the salon. If you don't think they're reasonable, then that salon won't work for you at all. On the other hand, if they are reasonable, you can try the place out.


Ask about special deals and customer loyalty programs. Many good stylists will offer some sort of regular customer deal that can end up with free treatments, haircuts or styling if you attend regularly over a period of time.

, Take a look at the presentation of the place. The whole place should be clean and tidy. Notice how the brushes and combs are kept clean. Look at the bench tops and floor to determine how often these are wiped and swept. Check the neatness and cleanliness of the staff aprons. See how clean the sinks are.

, As soon as you walk in, there should be a staff at the reception. Do they greet you warmly? Is someone available to assist you fairly quickly? Or, are you made to wait a long time or rudely waved to sit down until someone is free? Each of the ways in which you're treated upon arriving is an indication of how the salon is run as a whole and provides you with notice of what to expect by way of service.


How comfortable does the place make you feel upon entering? Trust that initial reaction.

, The staff should be respectful and present themselves smartly. This counts for uniform (not scruffy) and personality. They should meet the standards of professionalism, should be friendly, and nice to talk to.

, A hair salon should use professional products only (that means not products you'd find in the pharmacy). The products should be new, clean (not dusty) and obviously getting a good turnover. Check the prices as well; are you going to be able to afford the products if you want them?

, Study the quality of customers' hair as soon as they walk out the hair salon. Don't judge it when it has gone a day or two, as not all customers have the ability to keep their hair looking good. It all depends on what products they use to maintain the look, how long they leave the colour (if coloured) etc.

, This isn't a firm decision, it's a trial. If this place doesn't turn out the way you'd like it, you can go somewhere else next time. If you're unsure about the service, don't ask for the complicated styling options first; try something easy to begin with, to allow you to gauge the manner of the stylists and their competence. For example, begin with just a shampoo and style. It's a great way to ""interview"" a stylist without the commitment of a haircut. If you trust them after that, you can book another appointment for the full haircut and color, etc.


Give the hair salon a quick ring. The member of staff answering should answer with ""good morning/afternoon"", mention the name of the salon, and ask how they can help you. They should be professional, not use slang words, be friendly, and pleasant. But most of all - they should be polite and have good manners.

, This should include filling out a card with details about yourself, your preferences and the like. A stylist should always conduct a thorough consultation. Questions may include likes and dislikes with current hairstyles, showing you images and respectfully dealing with any images you've brought along.

, Does the stylist actually know what they're talking about? For example, if you ask what hairstyle would suit your face shape, does the stylist actually know how to match face shape to haircut or do you have the impression that the stylist is just making it up or simply going along with you by agreeing the latest celebrity trend would look good on you? You want honest assessments that truly work out for you, not someone just after money or moving you along quickly. You also want competence, not someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about.


Do you ""click"" with the stylist? Sometimes you might need to change stylists within the same salon, perhaps one that is more senior and knowledgeable or one with whom you feel a better connection. Don't be afraid to ask for this switch, they understand that customers have different needs and likes.

, A good stylist won't spend time pointing out your imperfections and try to push hair care products on you from the moment you start. A good stylist will aim to accept your hair's limitations, work with those realistically and will do their best to make you feel good about yourself, not worse. Things to watch out for include:


In what way does the stylist point out how ""thin, lank, weak, terrible, etc."" your hair is? It might be a fact and you're probably well aware of it but going on about it for five minutes will only make you feel worse. If they mention it politely and provide a quick, positive solution, then that's a sign they're not going to keep harping on about it.
Does the stylist make statements about your hair that are patently untrue, in order to sell you store products to ""fix"" it? In this case, be wary. What happens when you insist you already use decent products at home? If the stylist grimaces and suggests that your choices aren't working, that's just rude.
Is the stylist considerate of your scalp, face and body in general? Some stylists are gentle and careful, others poke combs, scissors and equipment into your head and pull hair, or use overly hot water on your scalp, all without apologizing or even noticing. What happens if you ask the stylist to be more careful? Does he or she respond or just lapse back into hurting you again? This goes toward the conscientiousness and considerateness of the stylist and salon as a whole.
How much undivided attention do you get? Does the stylist stay with you or keep running off to attend to other clients? If they do so, are they polite about it or are you made to wait far too long? Consider how you feel about this.

, Did you feel comfortable? Are you happy with the results? Was the stylist receptive to your requests? Was the whole service in line with your expectations? If the answers are predominantly yes, then you've found a great hair stylist for the coming months or maybe even years. If not, select another salon and keep looking until you find the one that works for you.

Refrain from touching your face.,
Don't lick your lips.,
Don't rub your eyes.,
Leave pimples alone!",How to Break Bad Beauty Habits1," You use your hands every day, touching all sorts of things. Whatever you touch is spread to your face, so be sure that you wash your hands whenever necessary.


If you have developed a habit of touching your face, avoid any temptation. If you have an itch, for example, use the inside of your clothes instead—just be sure they are clean!;
, The drying saliva ultimately causes chapped lips. Lip balm and regular water consumption will remedy chapped lips.


To stop your lips from peeling and cracking for good, spread a thick layer of petroleum jelly on your lips every night before you go to bed (Vaseline is a good choice). This is really helpful (especially for those who sleep with the air-conditioning on at night) as petroleum jelly locks in the moisture that's in your lips and keeps your lips from drying out.
You can also exfoliate your lips. Rub fine sugar on your lips in gentle, circular motions once a week. Leave it on for about two minutes, and then wash it off. It's best to do this at night right before you apply the petroleum jelly.

, Skin around your eyes is very delicate and thin, so rubbing your eyes can cause inflammation, and in severe cases pink eye. Use a tissue or the tip of your finger to relieve any irritation gently—ensure cleanliness.

, Pimples are clogged pores filled with bacteria, so touching them will irritate your skin and may scar your face.


Over-the-counter products could work, but the best way to clear pimples without the synthetics is to dab a small amount of tea tree oil over the pimple once every day. This can greatly reduce inflammation; thus, making the pimple less noticeable.
If you habitually sleep in cold temperatures, turn down the temperature a few notches every day, or until you get used to the accruing temperatures. If you still need the cold, remember to slap on body lotion every night and wear socks on your feet every other day before sleeping.

Check the results of a study, after years of hard work, which found that a rare red/brown seaweed called Ecklonia cava is special:They tested more than 400 red and brown seaweeds, looking for a specific type of molecular structure with superior antioxidant properties.,
Caveat: water soluble antioxidants work primarily outside of your cells.,
Help your brain with Seanol easily crosses the blood/brain barrier because it is ""40 percent fat soluble"" and gives your brain antioxidant protection because it does penetrate the blood/brain barrier into your brain.,
Retain Seanol in your body as much as 12 hours: This is because it is oil soluble, as research suggests that it also gives you longer protection because of that distinct benefit.,
Compare water soluble antioxidants which pass through your body in about 30 minutes: Then they are expelled in your urine.,
Read about rare sea plants from which Seanol is extracted that originate in 100 feet (30.5 m) of pure, nutrient-rich waters of Jeju Island off the coast of Korea.",How to Benefit from Ecklonia Cava Antioxidant Seanol1," And, Dr. Stephen T. Sinatra said it: ""Helps boost alpha waves, which are associated with mental focus and acuity (reduces drowsiness)

, The ocean waters off its shores are one of the few places in the world where this prized red/brown seaweed grows: Ecklonia cava are laden with the most powerful antioxidants on earth, with an ORAC score as much as 100 times greater than any land-based antioxidants. Called Seanol it is a highly valued antioxidant in Korea, Japan and other Asian countries since it has begun to be produced and marketed. It starts with the unique molecular structure of Seanol that allows it to “trap” far more free radicals than any land-based antioxidant, Seanol, which contains two types of powerful antioxidants:"

Keep the leather clean.,
Use a damp cloth.,
Do not use any soaps or cleansers.,
Dry your leather slowly.",How to Care for Leather2," Try to brush your leather down with a damp cloth at least once a week. If you are diligent about doing a quick clean of your leather then you won’t have to worry about deep cleaning later on, which is much more difficult.


If dirt particles get into the leather they can cause serious abrasion from the inside. , Start by brushing off any dirt of grime from the leather with your hand, then switch to a damp cloth.

, These types of chemicals can remove the natural oils in the leather used to preserve the material. Chemical soaps will cause the leather to dry out, crack, and begin to deteriorate. Stick with water.

, For example, if you have a leather motorcycle jacket and you are forced to drive in the rain you may have to live with it being wet for a little while. You shouldn’t put your leather by a fire, out in the sun, or near a heater to dry it off like you would with cotton or cloth. Dry your leather in room temperature by letting it sit.


Drying leather quickly will change its chemical structure, causing it to become brittle and crack.

Shine polished leather.,
Keep suede leather dry.,
Rub suede to clean it.,
Consider sending the suede to a professional cleaner.,
Store suede in the dark.",How to Care for Leather3," Caring for polished leather is a little different than other types of leather. You'll need a dry rag, a can of shoe polish, and a shoe brush. Brush off debris using the brush, then add a nickel sized dollop of shoe polish to your rag. Rug the polish over the shoe and then use the brush again to give the shoe a little elbow grease.


Buff out the rest of the polish with the rag. It should shine by the time you're done with it., If you have an article of suede leather that gets very wet you should try to blot out as much water as possible using a paper towel. Like other types of leather, you should never apply heat.If you have a hat or a pair of shoes that got wet you should stuff them full of paper towels while they dry. An even better option would be some sort of mold about the size of you head or foot. This will keep the leather from shrinking and becoming misshapen as it dries., Rub the suede with a dry bath towel rather than using water to bring up the shaggy nap of the leather. You can also use a pencil eraser lightly to rub out small stains from the suede.


If you're wearing suede shoes try brushing them lightly with a wire brush or a fingernail file., You can irreparably damage suede if you don't treat it delicately enough or use an unapproved cleaner. If your suede item is very valuable to you it might be worth it to invest in a professional cleaning.

, Make sure that the dark place you leave your suede in isn't moist, because removing mildew from suede is incredibly difficult. Transport your suede in a pillow caseinstead of a plastic bag so it can receive sufficient airflow.

Use fabric-covered hair bands to tie your hair.,
Avoid heated cosmetics.,
Don't wash your hair every day.",How to Break Bad Beauty Habits2," Plain rubber bands tear and split your hair.

, Using heat severely dries your hair, which can cause split ends or frizz.


Air-dry your hair whenever possible.
Before using any heated cosmetics, you should apply heat-protection serum to your hair. Heat-protection serum will not only protect your hair cuticles, but it can also give your hair a healthy shine.

Use a nibble inhibitor.,
Cover your nails.,
Distract yourself.,
Make your nails look pretty.,
Keep your nails healthy.",How to Break Bad Beauty Habits3," Apply some yucky tasting nibble inhibitor on your nails at least once a day.


Now when you bite your nails, it will taste nasty and you'll think twice about doing it again. Over time, using a nibble inhibitor can help you to break your nail biting habit for good.
If you don't want to splurge on a specific nibble inhibitor product, try applying some hand sanitizer or cream that doesn't taste so good instead. However, you will need to apply this quite frequently.

, Covering up your nails can provide a physical barrier between your teeth and your fingertips, preventing you from biting.



Wear gloves. If the weather is cold, wearing gloves is a great way to hide your nails while also staying warm and stylish.

Wrap your fingers in adhesive bandages. If your nails are covered this way, you won't be able to get to them! This is a good technique for when you're sitting at home in the evenings, or in bed at night.

, Try to find new activities to replace your nail biting habit when you're feeling nervous or bored. For example:


Try chewing sugarless gum every time you want to bite your nails. This will give your mouth something else to do -- and will taste much better!
Find something to play with like a coin or ball of putty -- this will keep your hands busy and away from your mouth! This is a good technique for in the car or while watching TV.
Eat or drink something. Try carrying around a bottle of water or a bag of carrots sticks - then whenever you feel the urge to bite, you can simply take a drink or nibble on a carrot instead.

, Another way to prevent yourself from biting is to give yourself a beautiful manicure -- your nails will look so pretty, you'll hate to ruin them by biting!


Choose bold colors like dark pink and red, where it will look very obvious if the nails have been bitten or chipped.

, Keeping your nails in good condition will make them stronger and prettier-looking, making them less prone to breakage and more difficult to break. Follow these tips for healthier nails:


Eat a healthy diet. A diet rich in nutrients, vitamins and minerals such as calcium, magnesium and fatty acids is beneficial for nails. Try eating lots of eggs, oily fish, fruit, leafy green vegetables and nuts. You could also try taking a supplement for healthy hair, skin and nails.







Keep your nails short. Keeping your nails cut short will prevent them from breaking and from becoming too long or weak. It will also minimize your temptation to bite them. How often you need to cut your nails varies from person to person, but for most people it will be somewhere around every one or two weeks.







Apply nail and cuticle creams. Dry, dehydrated nails are more prone to brittleness and breakage, so keep your talons in tip-top shape by massaging a little nail cream into each individual fingertip every night. Rubbing some cuticle oil on your cuticles can also work wonders.

See how Seanol has much more availability of polyphenols and phlorotannins the land based molecular structures of ""two to four connected rings"": antioxidants found in many land-based products such as berries, tea leaves, grapes, pomegranates, fruits and vegetables -- and these rings are critical because they “trap” free radicals.,
Smash: Notice, Seanol has ""eight rings""!,
Look into the ability of a food, vitamin or extract to absorb harmful free radicals, thereby rendering them harmless, is measured by the ""Oxygen Radical Absorbent Capacity"" (ORAC) score.,

Trans-resveratrol from red grapes has only ""two-ring"" molecular structure.

Green tea has a ""four-ring"" molecular structure.;
, This allows it to trap far more free radicals than any other antioxidant, as it has this complex molecule, and it can form the same polyphenols and phlorotannins, but in the more sophisticated molecular structure compared., The higher the ORAC score, the better, as foods and natural substances with high ORAC scores may protect your cells and tissues from oxidative damage.

Seanol has an ORAC value of a whopping 8,368, far superior to green tea, red wine’s resveratrol and many fruits and vegetables.

Seanol has over 10 times more ORAC value than an orange. You’d have to eat 7 or 8 oranges a day to get the same ORAC value as one serving of Seanol.


ORAC Value of Seanol for 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) for food items:

In a study for every 100,000 Islanders living on Okinawa, there are 457 people over 100 years old.",How to Benefit from Ecklonia Cava Antioxidant Seanol3," Compare than to just 10 people over 100 years for every 100,000 Americans. Scientists have studied the Okinawans and attribute their long lives to hard work, clean air, and diet—which, you guessed it, includes a lot of seaweed. The Okinawans, like many Japanese and Asians, love their seaweed, and eat it as part of many meals. The Japanese, overall, live longer than any other people on earth, with an average lifespan of 79.4 years for men and 86.5 years for women? And among the Japanese, the Okinawans live the longest.Mahinda Seneviratne and Soo-Hyun Kim, report that it showed “significant activities in all antioxidant assays...activities that were superior to those of a commercial synthetic and natural antioxidant tests.” Scientific research also documents that Ecklonia cava has shown “higher scavenging activities” toward free radicals, as this “super antioxidant” penetrates your cells more effectively."

, For sight you usually want to have some type of goggles. Preferably binoculars make sure they aren't too big and have a moderate zoom capability. You may also possibly want them to have night vision as well. If you are doing something serious such as getting something or spy on another person you may want to use a camera that has a feed to a computer or another device where you can view it. Remember sight is one of the things people use the most in order to get the advantage. If you want to go overkill than you can by binoculars with IR capabilities.

Work hard.,
Eat well.,
Find yourself a talent.,
Be yourself.,
Remember that what constitutes ""ideal"" is a matter of opinion.",How to Be the Ideal Girl," This is probably the most vital part of the process. Believe it or not, no matter how bad you feel about yourself, you are not alone. So many girls, especially during, feel depressed or in competition with others. Take a look at yourself. What are your best personal features? Maybe you are the top in your class: Do people tease you about that? Just think that in ten years time, you will be in a successful, well-paid job! Maybe you're bigger than your friends: Don't feel you have to diet, just choose clothes that suit you, get enough exercise, and smile...anyway, most people first notice your smile before anything else.;
, Don't allow other people to tell you what to feel. If you're happy, go ahead and smile. If you're angry, give 'em a scowl. And if you're sad, cry, weep, or just stay calm. Be yourself.

Do not chew gum in school/libraries/in interviews/at work. There is nothing worse than gum falling out of your mouth at an important moment.

, You don't need to fork out on expensive gym memberships. You can run around the block, cycle to the local shop on errands, or get off the bus a stop early. Every little thing helps. Also, the fresh air works wonders on conditions such as acne! Bonus!

, Stand up. Place your left foot in a direct vertical line downwards from your shoulder. Place your right foot's heel at the arch of your left foot, and turn out about 20*. See? Easy elegance. This not only makes you appear more poised and glamorous, but it also makes your legs seem slimmer! When walking, look straight ahead, with your shoulders down and comfortably back. Imagine a wire coming from your head to the sky which you must not bend or move. There! The perfect posture. When sitting, try not to slouch. If you can, sit all the way back on your chair, with your feet on the floor, and your back on the back of the seat. If you often come home feeling tight and sore around your neck and shoulders, take time to lie flat on the floor and stretch. Then lie upside-down on the sofa with your head pointing towards the ground. This will help elongate the spine and help to relieve the aches. Keep in mind, though, that sometimes it's okay to relax, lean, or slouch. Good posture is generally good for your long term health, but do it because you want to and it fits the mood, not because you think other people want you to look that way.

, What do you love doing? If you're a beach bum at heart, try to swim as much as possible, and get to the beach whenever you can. Just add mates and plenty of sun cream and you have a great day. Or perhaps you're an avid shopaholic. To avoid wasting all your money, feel free to go shopping and impulse buy -- but keep the receipts, leave all tags on, hang them up in your room. A week later, if you wish you hadn't bought them, then you can simply return them!

, If you like to dress up, go for it. If you just want to be comfortable, that's okay to. The ideal girl is the one who chooses clothes that are appropriate to a situation and her mood, and not to what others tell her.

, Choose people who understand you, who listen to you, and who you connect with. Friends (and more than friends) are what make you happy and successful, not jewelry or other accessories.

, The truth is that most skin issues are either genetic, are temporary (almost everyone has problems with their skin as a teenager), or are caused by things like the food you eat, where you live, and what you do.

, Look however you want, and be proud of it. An ideal girl spends more time on her mind, her friendships, and her spirit than on her looks.

, Whether you're at college, middle school or sixth form, getting grades is massively important. Working hard earlier on makes life easier later on when it comes to finding a job, paying the bills, or attracting the man of your dreams. Organize your schoolwork and get useful apps. If your school mates are giving you a hard time for being clever, tell them to shut up Being a well paid business woman is much cooler than working in McDonald's for your whole life.

, Do not starve yourself to lose weight. Being healthy doesn't mean eating less, it just means eating more of the right foods and less of the wrong foods. Make sure you get a lot of protein in your diet - meat tends to have lots of protein. Your body also needs the vitamins and fibers from other foods such as fruit. An example of a healthy diet change is eating whole grain or black bean pasta instead of normal pasta. More protein, less carbs! Also, make sure that you drink enough water a day. If you begin to feel hungry, have a glass of water before eating. Often, you will feel hungry if you're actually thirsty!

, Try learning a musical instrument, like the saxophone. Join a local music group; not only are these a great way to improve your skill, but it's a great way to make like minded friends and guys! Or maybe you could learn a language; you can travel all over the world and communicate with locals, making your stay so much more fun. You can also meet lots of people that you wouldn't ordinarily meet through a language! You may be really good at sports so join a dance class or soccer class. Why not give it a go? It's easier than you may think! Just think of all the hot Italians/Spaniards/French guys you could meet!

, Don't ever change yourself to meet the pressures of your peers. If someone gives you criticism, just think: 'Do I trust the person?' 'Do I value their advice?' 'Do they have a point?'. After saying yes to all these questions, consider taking action on the criticism. If the answers are no, just brush them off...they're probably jealous anyway! Finally, never change for a guy. If he doesn't appreciate you for how you really are, he will never love you as truly as you want. Keep your eyes open for that perfect guy, you never know, he could be hiding in the least likely place!

, Your idea of ""ideal"" might be very different from somebody else's. So, you should try to be what you think is ideal -- not what somebody else tells you is ideal.

, Make sure to have a scout mission to map out the area or placement to where your going to do it. Get a good know about of the whole area and if you need to design a floor plan. Make sure to remember or list anything that may obstruct your path or cause problems. Also map out various escape routes in case something goes wrong or you need to get out. Remember a good spy is as good as his wits.

, If you type and write properly try to write sloppy and poorly also typing slowly.

, One of the mains things to do is to wait until they are moving to mask your own sound, if you can move stealthily like listed above

, Use the walls and other furnishings to move without being detected easily. If you can map a route that is rather abandoned and large you should be able to get place to place. Remember mask your sounds, use the scenery and think with common sense.

Know which casual items can double as “stylish.” Remember: some casual clothes, like cargo shorts, always come across as just that--casual--no matter what other fancy items you might wear with them.,
Develop a discerning eye.,
Choose the right material.,
Wear more than one layer.,
Use contrast to make your outfit pop.",How to Be Stylish While Being Casual1," Learn which items are safe to choose from. Clothes that are safe to pick from include:Men: blazers; button-down shirts; t-shirts; nice jeans; chinos; tailored shorts; casual sneakers; boat shoes; loafers, brogues; boots; dress shoes.

Women: wrap dresses; summer dresses; nice jeans; linen pants; tank tops; fitted tops; sneakers; flats; boots; low heels; sandals.;
, Aim to strike the perfect balance between casual and stylish. Imagine two extremes: a fancy ‘60’s cocktail party and a rough-and-tumble day at the beach. When picking items to wear, imagine wearing them to both occasions. Aim for an outfit that would look slightly too relaxed and casual to fit in with the cast of Mad Men, but too nice to risk scuffing up outdoors.


When in doubt, err on the side of fitting in more with the cocktail party folks than the beach bums., Avoid clothes made from fabrics that wrinkle easily, like cotton, rayon, and silk. Remember: you want to look casual but stylish, so you still want to look sharp. So unless you’re able to change outfits throughout the day, stick to fabrics like:Cashmere
DenimKnit
Leather
Lyocell
Polyester
Wool

, Rest assured: you don’t need a whole collection of individually stunning garments to impress people visually. Instead, create a more interesting look by simply layering the clothes you do have. Make them work as a team for a “sum-is-greater-than-its-parts” effect. For instance, you can layer:A vest or sweater over dress shirts.
A blazer or light jacket over a t-shirt.Tasteful bras and bralettes under any tops or dresses that offer a glimpse underneath.Stockings, tights, or leggings under skirts and dresses.

, Catch people’s attention by avoiding a totally uniform appearance. Vary your look by adding one or two touches that will either stand out from the rest or juxtapose other elements. For example:If, say, you dress all in black, wear a pair of white shoes (or a belt, or a tie, or all three).
Pair a skinny pair of pants with a loose-fitting top.Wear a tighter top or jacket with a billowy skirt or dress.Pair dark bottoms with light tops, and/or dark tops with light bottoms."

Inquire about opportunities at local service organizations.,
Check bulletin boards.,
Find a local Red Cross chapter.",How to Find Volunteer Opportunities1," If you are a student, your own school is the best place to start when looking for volunteer work. Visit the guidance counselor or ask a teacher about any opportunities they might be able to direct you towards.

If you are in college, try the office for student involvement. There are likely a good amount of student organizations based around volunteer work that you could look into or get information from.
Find out about using your volunteering to get academic credit. Some college programs incorporate volunteer work into the normal curriculum, but there is a chance that other programs might offer a way to earn credit hours through volunteering. If you are a junior or senior in high school, you might be able to work volunteering into your school schedule. See your academic advisor or guidance counselor.;
, They might be looking for ongoing volunteers or need help with special events. Your local Chamber of Commerce would be a great place to start when looking for locally-based volunteer opportunities.


Even if there are no specific programs that exist through the city itself, they still might be able to direct you to organizations or groups that need help from volunteers nearby.

, Little League teams are often looking for help from older kids, teenagers, college students, and parents. Visit your local sports complex for a practice schedule, and to get contact information for coaches and leaders.There may be summer camps that are looking for young people or parents to volunteer to help with the kids while they attend camp. If you are looking for an opportunity geared more towards outdoor activities like sports or camp, try an internet search for summer camps in your area and contact the directors.

, Churches, synagogues, or mosques in the area might need volunteers for a myriad of different projects, including after school care and Sunday school. They can also help you find volunteer opportunities with other groups and organizations they serve.


For example, the United Methodist Church has an online database of volunteer opportunities that you can search and find something local. But, simply driving up to a nearby place of worship and asking about opportunities might be just as effective.

, The Rotary, Lions Club or United Way have many chapters across the US. Try contacting these organizations and inquiring about what volunteer work they might need help with in the near future, and how you might go about becoming involved.


The Lions Club is a great place to seek different types of volunteering opportunities. Head to their website, find a club near you, and see a calendar of events. They help with everything from serving the community to disaster relief.

, Local stores, restaurants, and recreation centers might have bulletin boards advertising for volunteer opportunities in the area. Check these places, or just keep your eye out while you’re out around town for these kinds of advertisements or posts.


You can also get on the phone and call local youth groups, organizations, and health clubs to see if they might have any suggestions or opportunities for you.

, Use the search feature on their website to locate the chapter closest to you, and follow the procedure for signing up to volunteer. They have a small questionnaire you can fill out that will match you with ideal volunteer opportunities through the organization.\


Most of the Red Cross’s work is done by volunteers, so contributing to this organization will really have an impact on your local community. If there has been any kind of natural disaster nearby, the Red Cross can connect you with projects and teams helping those affected by it, as well.

Read about the different learning types.,
Try visual learning.,
Experiment with auditory learning.,
Learn through words.,
Use movement to learn.,
Investigate logic.,
Learn with others.,
Practice solitary learning.",How to Find Your Learning Style1," In order to figure out your learning style, it is important to understand the difference between the types of learners. There are many books and websites that you can use to research the topic.Head to your local library and ask the reference librarian. Or ask the guidance counselor at your school for some information.Most people acknowledge that there are seven different learning styles that are common: visual, auditory, verbal, physical, logical, social and solitary. People often associate with several of these styles.
Ask the guidance counselor at your school for some information. This person should be familiar with all of the styles.;
, After you do some research, start experimenting with different learning styles. It can be useful to try a new method of learning to figure out which one is your style. You can start with visual learning, which means that you learn by using pictures and other images.Ask yourself if you rely on images to help you understand key topics. For example, when you are reading your Biology text, do you find the diagrams more helpful than the written content?
Try adding more images into the topic you are learning. If you are studying for a history test, make a chart that illustrates the key topics. If this is helpful, you may be a visual learner.
Visual learners are often very instinctual. You might find yourself exiting an elevator and knowing exactly which way to turn.

, Aural, or auditory, means you learn effectively through sound and music. If you are not sure if this applies to you, spend some time adding sound to your study sessions. You could begin by reading select passages of your textbook out loud.If you need to hear something out loud in order to fully grasp the concept, you may be an auditory learner. Experiment by repeating key concepts to a classmate to see if hearing the material is useful to you.
Do you find yourself talking while you read? That indicates auditory learning. Another clue that you are an auditory learner is if you often find yourself annoyed by pictures and the written word.
During your next study session make up some rhymes to help you remember the material. For example, ""President Carter would never barter with the Soviets."" If this seems helpful, you are likely an auditory learner.

, Verbal learners are most comfortable with words, both spoken and written. If you are an avid reader, you are likely comfortable with verbal learning. Reading is one of the most effective ways for you to retain information.


Ask yourself if you are most comfortable listening to a spoken lecture or presentation. Verbal learners often resist group projects or activities.
When you study, do you make written outlines of the material? This is an indication that verbal learning is your preference.
Common phrases said by verbal learners are ""Tell me word for word"" and ""Let's talk later."" You will also likely say things like, ""In other words"".

, Physical learning is another common type of learning style. Physical learners rely on their hands, sense of touch, and physical activity. Movement is key to retaining information for physical learners.If the thought of sitting through a lecture makes you nervous, you might learn better through physical activity. Do you fidget a lot? That is another sign.
To find out whether you are a physical learner, try adding some movement to your routine. Try standing up while reading.
Use as many physical objects as possible. Try making flashcards so that you can physically flip through the information.

, Another learning style that you can experiment with is logical learning. Logical learners are puzzle solvers who prefer to use reasoning and systems to find answers. People who are good at math are often logical learners.To determine whether you are a logical learner, try rearranging the way you think about material. Look at each individual part instead of just the whole picture.
For example, if you are studying World War II, don't just think about who won the war. Spend time thinking about why and how.
Making connections is one of the keys to logical learning. If it is your natural instinct to draw clear lines between different topics, you are likely a logical learner.

, Some people learn best when they are interacting with other people. Social learners learn best in groups or with at least one other person. If you prefer to work with others, you may be a social learner.Does the prospect of a group project make you excited? Do you dread studying by yourself? You likely lean towards social learning.
To figure out whether social learning works for you, try forming a study group. Ask one or more classmates to join you after class to work through the material together.
If other people often ask you for help with material, that is another indication that you are a social learner. People will notice that you like to discuss what you are learning.

, Another common type of learning style is known as solitary learning. Solitary learners work best independently. If you are most effective without the help of others, you may be partial to this style.Do you enjoy spending time reflecting on a topic? That is an indication that you are a solitary learner.
Instead of trying to just memorize information, solitary learners like to sit back and take time to think about each aspect of the content.
Solitary learners often like to make plans ahead of time. They also typically make individual goals for most aspects of life.

Fill your closet with neutrals.,
Use accents.,
Be sure to match colors that aren’t neutral.",How to Be Stylish While Being Casual2," Make things easy for yourself when you’re trying to pair one piece of clothing with another. Buy lots of clothing in neutral colors so just about everything you own will match each other.Perfectly neutral colors include white, black, and gray.More earthy tones include camel, cream, brown, gold, navy blue, olive, and silver.

, If you have a favorite color that you want to be known for, buy several articles in different shades. Or, if you’re less picky, buy a variety of bolder colors. Then perk your otherwise neutral outfits up with one of these articles, like wearing a bold red shirt with navy blue jeans and a black leather jacket.In addition to clothes, you can also accent your outfits with accessories like:Ties
Belts
Jewelry
Suspenders
Purses and bags

, If you find neutrals too boring, go ahead and dress in something bolder. Just make sure one element of your outfit doesn’t clash with another. Be aware that even though you personally like two different colors, people are hardwired to look for harmony in colors.When you assemble an outfit, start with one article as your base color and pair other items that match.

"
"
Stick to simple garments.,
Avoid clothes that need to be dry-cleaned.,
Don’t rely on belts.,
Forget high heels.",How to Be Stylish While Being Casual3," If you need to make your clothes last, check out their construction before you buy them. Keep in mind that any extra little add-on (like unnecessary buttons, sequins, or silkscreens) is just one more thing that might fall off or fall apart. Don’t get stuck with, say, a t-shirt that looked stylish on the rack but now looks like a hand-me-down because the silkscreen flaked off! Put it back on the rack and pick out a simpler item instead.”Simple” doesn’t have to mean “plain.” Remember: a pair of black-and-white striped pants isn’t constructed any differently than a pair of solid black pants! If you want a little more jazz in your clothes, look for items made with different prints and materials.

, If budget is an issue, check the care label for each item while shopping. Only buy clothes that say, “Machine Wash.” If the care label tells you that the item needs to be dry-cleaned, put it back. Bear in mind that dry-cleaning is often pricey, so get the most wear out of your purchases by sticking to items that you can afford to wash regularly.Give your machine-wash clothes a longer life by only using cold water to wash them. Then dry them in a machine with low heat, or simply let them air-dry.

, There are exceptions to every rule, but beware: a cheap belt often looks cheap. Don’t spoil your casual-chic look by holding up those stunning pants with a dinky-looking belt! Only buy pants that stay up just fine on their own, even if you already have a good, quality belt at home (just in case it gets lost or ruined).If you do need a belt for pants, don’t worry about it. You’re aiming for stylish but casual, so keeping your shirt untucked is a perfect way to hide it.If you like to wear loose dresses and draw attention to your waist at the same time, wear a more form-fitting top or jacket instead of a belt.

, Obviously, high heels are pretty chic, but if you are going for a more casual look, look for something else. Get more for your money with a pair of shoes that is perfectly stylish and a bit more versatile. Instead of high heels, shop for an eye-catching pair of flats, low heels, or sneakers."

Before going to school, you must act.,
You must be passionate about acting and know what you want.,
You must have money, the best schools are expensive.,
Consider enlisting in a conservatory, where you can learn acting skills.,
Do you want to go to a large school or a small one?,
Consider taking classes run by agents, acting teachers, actors and directors.,
For the shorter term, take workshops and seminars in voice, movement, ballet, tap, make up, scene work, direction, etc.

,
For most, location is the main key to selecting an acting school.,
Check out the rankings of a schools on the world scale to determine the best ones.,
Choose the best by going through the reviews of the centers and its testimonials.",How to Find the Best Acting School,"


Get a role in school musicals or in a community theater production. Act as much as you can; you must get experience. Acting is not something that you will do someday; it must already be a part of your life.
Act for pay if possible. Get an agent.
After progressing beyond the beginning level of acting, you must view your acting as a business - show business. Take a marketing class or read about marketing and view yourself as a product. Be realistic about your capabilities and market yourself accordingly.;
, Acting is an activity people like to do because they equate it with fame and money in that order. However, this field is one of the hardest areas to break into; 90% of professional actors are unemployed at any given time.

, You should have made good grades and high SAT scores in high school.

, You could take courses in singing, dancing, fencing, make-up, juggling, voice control, etc.

, In a large school, the multi-talented and aggressive students will be favored by the teachers and you will be relegated to servant status if you are meek. However, a small school might not look as good on a resume, or might have fewer opportunities or resources.


Do comprehensive research to increase your chances to get into the best field.
Don't to pay thousands of dollars to get a degree or diploma that is mostly considered useless, though.
Check the credentials of the institution for longevity and for whether it meets your criteria.

, You must have connections in this business. Your teachers can help springboard you into a career.

,,


Go to any university in your area and look up the performing arts teachers' experience and credentials. Do you want to learn with those people?
Go in for an acting center that has the best alumnus.
The best option can also be identified and chosen on the basis of the center’s reputation, its faculty, focus of the center, method of training, classes offered, length of studies, performance opportunities, preparation for the marketplace and the total cost.
Shop around, know what to expect from the training, interview teachers and ask lots of questions before choosing the acting school.

,


You can even choose from the top ten institutions in that list, yet there is no best school.
Read the comments that the organization has received.
Consider the elite ones; they will give you an excellent education. Carnegie Mellon, New York University and Yale have great acting programs, and you will have a well rounded education that will help when you don't have an acting job

, The few acting centers worldwide vary and finding the best acting group is not a herculean task.


Know or list the requirements you are looking for.
Choose the institution which can give you a goal to help you succeed in this industry that is full of opportunities.

Determine whether you work better with other people or on your own.,
Consider the amount of time you are willing to commit.,
Evaluate your skills.,
Identify what you are passionate about.,
Determine what you would like to get out of the experience.",How to Find Volunteer Opportunities3," Even if you tend to work better apart from a group, there are still ways for you to volunteer your time and skills. Before looking for volunteer opportunities, decide how much you would like to interact with others while volunteering. This will determine what sort of volunteer opportunities you should pursue.


If you like groups, you can join one of the efforts through your local United Way or even through your school. If you work better on your own, you can try things like making some fundraising phone calls for a charity, or volunteering for a crisis helpline from home.

, If you are not currently working and you're willing to take on 20 to 30 volunteer hours per week, you might have more opportunities than if you can donate only an hour or 2 every month. On the other hand, if you want something to do just once, or a few times a month, there are still plenty of ways to get involved.If you are a student, make sure you take your own personal obligations into consideration when determining what kind of time you can commit to volunteer work. Try to avoid overcommitting yourself, and then having to back out of things last minute.

, Think about what you have to offer, both practically and emotionally. By determining what skills you would like to put to use, you can narrow down volunteer opportunities to the ones that would best fit you.Don’t focus strictly on “practical” skills you might have, such as your specializations or education. Think about what else you have to offer, including patience, compassion, an ear for listening, a sense of humor, working out problems, and even things like arts and crafts.
Finding a volunteer opportunity that matches your specific skills will help you and your community get more from the work you do.

, If there is a specific cause you are interested in, look for opportunities in that field. For example, you might love the arts or animals or helping elderly people or children with disabilities. Maybe you want to volunteer with an organization that has something to do with your college major, or with a cause you have experience with already.

, Just like volunteer work can help your community, it can help you as well. The act of volunteering is emotionally rewarding, and can also help you build a strong resume or curriculum vitae when applying to college or graduate school.Volunteering is a great way to get a better look at a specific field or organization. You can learn a lot in the process, so you can use volunteering as a way to help you get a better understanding of a certain career path.
Everyone can benefit from the feeling of their skills, time, and personal qualities being valued and needed by others. Volunteering can offer a sense of personal accomplishment and value.

Take a self-assessment.,
Reflect on your experiences.,
Talk to an instructor.,
Put your findings to the test.",How to Find Your Learning Style2," After you experiment with different learning styles, you can spend some time clarifying which style is best for you. This is a fast and simple way to determine your learning style. Many reputable websites offer online quizzes that will analyze your learning style based on your responses. Search the web for a reputable site, and take the quiz.Avoid sites that appear to be overtly selling a product. Look for a site such as HowToStudy.com that focuses on educational resources.
Start the quiz. Be prepared to answer questions such as ""What kind of book would you like to read for fun?"" or ""What are you most likely to do when waiting in line?""
Most assessments are multiple-choice. They generally take between 5 and 20 minutes to complete.
Remember that there are no right or wrong answers. Everyone learns a little differently, and that is ok.

, The results of your self-assessment can give you a good idea of which learning style applies to you. However, it is important to take some time to think about your personal preferences. Think back on some of your most memorable learning experiences.Maybe you vividly remember learning about the Civil War in elementary school. Was it because your teacher asked you to build a model of a canon? That might mean you are a physical learner.
Perhaps high school English was your favorite class. Did it really make an impression when your teacher read Shakespeare aloud? You might be more of a verbal learner.
Take what you know about yourself and combine it with the results of your self-assessment quiz. This should give you a good indication of your learning style.

, It can be helpful to get some additional feedback to determine your learning style. Talk to one of your current or past teachers. Ask if the instructor has some time to talk to you about your education.Prepare some questions to ask. Try saying something such as, ""Do you have any particular observations about the way I learn?""
You can also ask, ""Did you ever notice a topic or skill that I seemed to struggle with?""
Ask the teacher for tips about how to improve your quality of learning. Talk to more than one person if possible.

, Once you start to understand your learning style, you can tailor your educational experiences so that you can learn more quickly and easily. For example, if you believe that you are a visual learner, seek out images and pictures when first approaching a new topic.As you get to know yourself better, you'll figure out the best way for you to access and remember information.


Maybe you are having trouble understanding the chapter you're reading in your biology textbook. If the paragraph on photosynthesis just doesn't make sense, try searching for online images. A chart or illustration might help cement the information.
If you are an auditory learner, it can be hard to succeed in largely verbal subjects such as English. Try having a friend read aloud some passages to you of ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""
Perhaps you are trying to teach yourself a new skill, like knitting. If you are a physical learner, don't spend too much time becoming frustrated by reading a description of how to knit. Instead, pick up the needles and start learning with your hands.

Visit the school.,
Contact the teacher directly.,
Ask your child!",How to Find Your Child's School Grades2," Once there, ask the school secretaries how the school will distribute grades for the current academic year. Also, ask the school administration what your responsibilities are when your receive grades. This way, you will be well informed about when you will receive grades and what to do with them once you have them.

, Teachers will be well informed about how grades are distributed and when they will be distributed. Teachers are easily contacted by email, and you can find email addresses in the school handbook or on the school website. It is also possible to reach a teacher by phone by calling the school and asking for your child's teacher. Your child's teacher will be able to guide you through the process of finding your child's grades.

, Your child can be a great point of contact for discovering what is going on in their school. They should be well informed as to when and how they will be receiving their grades. In fact, many elementary and high schools will send your child's grades home with them on specific dates.


Some schools require that parents sign the report card to prove that the child has shown them to you. In others, report cards will be mailed home at the end of terms.
You will be able to find the dates that grades are sent home in the school handbook.

Determine whether the substance in question is elemental.,
Determine whether the substance in question is an ion.,
For metallic ions, know that multiple oxidation numbers are possible.,
Assign an oxidation number of -2 to oxygen (with exceptions).,
Assign an oxidation number of +1 to hydrogen (with exceptions).,
Fluorine always has an oxidation number of -1.,
Set the oxidation numbers in a compound equal to a compound's charge.,
Find atoms without oxidation number rules.,
Find the known oxidation number for the other elements in the compound.,
Multiply the number of each atom by its oxidation number.,
Add the results together.,
Calculate the unknown oxidation number based on the compound's charge.",How to Find Oxidation Numbers," Free, uncombined elemental atoms always have an oxidation number of 0. This is true both for atoms whose elemental form is composed of a lone atom, as well as atoms whose elemental form is diatomic or polyatomic.


For example, Al(s) and Cl2 both have oxidation numbers of 0 because they are in their uncombined elemental forms.
Note that Sulfur's elemental form, S8, or octasulfur, though irregular, also has an oxidation number of 0.;
, Ions have oxidation numbers equal to their charge. This is true both for ions that are not bound to any other elements as well as for ions that form part of an ionic compound.


For instance, the ion Cl- has an oxidation number of -1.
The Cl ion still has an oxidation number of -1 when it's part of the compound NaCl. Because the Na ion, by definition, has a charge of +1, we know that the Cl ion has a charge of -1, so its oxidation number is still -1.

, Many metallic elements can have more than one charge. For instance, the metal Iron (Fe) can be an ion with a charge of either +2 or +3.Metallic ions' charges (and thus oxidation numbers) can be determined either in relation to the charges of other atoms in the compound they are a part of, or, when written in text, by roman numeral notation (as in the sentence, ""The iron(III) ion has a charge of +3."").


For example, let's examine a compound containing the metallic aluminum ion. The compound AlCl3 has an overall charge of 0. Because we know that Cl- ions have a charge of -1 and there are 3 Cl- ions in the compound, the Al ion must have a charge of +3 so that the overall charge of all the ions adds to 0. Thus, Al's oxidation number is +3.

, In almost all cases, oxygen atoms have oxidation numbers of -2. There are a few exceptions to this rule:


When oxygen is in its elemental state (O2), its oxidation number is 0, as is the case for all elemental atoms.
When oxygen is part of a peroxide, its oxidation number is -1. Peroxides are a class of compounds that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond (or the peroxide anion O2-2). For instance, in the molecule H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), oxygen has an oxidation number (and a charge) of -1.Also when oxygen is part of a superoxide its oxidation number is -0.5
When oxygen is bound to fluorine, its oxidation number is +2. See Fluorine rule below for more info.In (O2F2) it is +1.

, Like oxygen, hydrogen's oxidation number is subject to exceptional cases. Generally, Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 (unless, as above, it's in its elemental form, H2). However, in the case of special compounds called hydrides, hydrogen has an oxidation number of -1.


For instance, in H2O, we know that hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 because oxygen has a charge of -2 and we need 2 +1 charges to make the compound's charges add up to zero. However, in sodium hydride, NaH, hydrogen has an oxidation number of -1 because the Na ion has a charge of +1 and, for the compound's total charge to equal zero, hydrogen's charge (and thus oxidation number) must equal -1.

, As noted above, the oxidation numbers of certain elements can vary for several factors (metal ions, oxygen atoms in peroxides, etc.) Fluorine, however, has an oxidation number of -1, which never changes. This is because fluorine is the most electronegative element - in other words, it is the element least-likely to give up any of its own electrons and most-likely to take another atom's. Therefore, its charge doesn't change.

, The oxidation numbers of all the atoms in a compound must add up to the charge of that compound. For example, if a compound has no charge, the oxidation numbers of each of its atoms must add up to zero; if the compound is a polyatomic ion with a charge of -1, the oxidation numbers must add up to -1, etc.


This is a good way to check your work - if the oxidation in your compounds don't add up to the charge of your compound, you know that you have assigned one or more incorrectly.

, Some atoms don't have specific rules about the oxidation numbers they can have. If your atom doesn't appear in the rules above and you're unsure what its charge is (for instance, if it's part of a larger compound and thus its individual charge is not shown), you can find the atom's oxidation number by process of elimination. First, you'll determine the oxidation of every other atom in the compound, then you'll simply solve for the unknown based on the overall charge of the compound.


For example, in the compound Na2SO4, the charge of Sulfur (S) is unknown - it's not in its elemental form, so it's not 0, but that's all we know. This is a good candidate for this method of algebraic oxidation number determination.

, Using the rules for oxidation number assignment, assign oxidation numbers to the other atoms in the compound. Be on the lookout for any exceptional cases for O, H, etc.


In Na2SO4, we know, based on our set of rules, that the Na ion has a charge (and thus oxidation number) of +1 and that the oxygen atoms have oxidation numbers of -2.

, Now that we know the oxidation number of all of our atoms except for the unknown one, we need to account for the fact that some of these atoms may appear more than once. Multiply each atom's numeric coefficient (written in subscript after the atom's chemical symbol in the compound) by its oxidation number.


In Na2SO4, we know there are 2 Na atoms and 4 O atoms. We would multiply 2 × +1, the oxidation number of Na, to get an answer of 2, and we would multiply 4 × -2 , the oxidation number of O, to get an answer of -8.

, Adding the results of your multiplications together gives the compound's current oxidation number without taking into account the oxidation number of your unknown atom.


In our Na2SO4 example, we would add 2 to -8 to get -6.

, You now have everything you need to find your unknown oxidation number using simple algebra. Set an equation that has your answer from the previous step plus the unknown oxidation number equal to the compound's overall charge. In other words: (Sum of known oxidation numbers) + (unknown oxidation number you are solving for) = (charge of the compound).


In our Na2SO4 example, we would solve as follows:

(Sum of known oxidation numbers) + (unknown oxidation number you are solving for) = (charge of the compound)
-6 + S = 0
S = 0 + 6
S = 6. S has an oxidation number of 6 in Na2SO4.

Study more effectively.,
Combine learning styles.,
Use your senses.,
Know your strengths.,
Learn more efficiently.,
Gain confidence.,
Enhance your performance.",How to Find Your Learning Style3," Knowing your learning style can help you retain information in a more effective manner. If you choose the best way for your brain to learn, you will pick up on concepts more quickly. Arrange your study sessions around your learning style.If you are a social learner, form a study group. Ask classmates to join you at a set time and location each week to work together.
Social learners learn best in group settings outside of school, too. For example, a social learner would do best to take a group cooking class rather than reading a cook book.
If you are a solitary learner, plan your study sessions for times when you know you will be alone. If necessary, work out a schedule with your roommates or family members to ensure you'll have the alone time that you need.

, Most people learn best by using a combination of learning styles. Don't be afraid to use different methods to approach one topic or lesson. Combining learning styles can really accelerate the rate at which you learn. Use different methods to take notes. If a skill seems like it is best recalled with words, just paraphrase the lecture. But if a picture would help, don't hesitate to draw a diagram in your notes to help you process the information.
If you are a verbal learner, you probably rely mostly on words. Sometimes, it can be helpful to use an alternate style.
For example, if you are trying to learn to play the piano, you will definitely want to listen to recordings and practice getting a feel for the keys.

, Once you have identified your learning style, you can begin using all of your senses to increase your knowledge. For example, if you are an auditory learner, you will learn to value your hearing. Try using a tape recorder to record lessons instead of just writing things down.Physical learners learn best when moving. Try mentally reviewing your vocabulary list while going for a job.
You could also benefit from standing up when reading or writing. Physical learners retain more information when not sitting still.
If you are a visual learner, try drawing a picture of any concept you want to master. You can also post sticky notes around your house with information. Seeing information regularly is key for you.

, When you are trying to grasp a new concept, look for the most effective way to convey the information to your brain. Choose a method that fits your learning style. Don't be afraid to utilize more than one method.If you are a solitary learner, find a quiet place to study. You can try a library or a coffee shop that isn't very busy.
Challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone. Supplement your solitary learning style by asking questions or comparing notes with a classmate.
It's important to play to your strengths, but it's also a good idea to flex your mental muscles. You should occasionally try to switch up your method of learning.

, Once you have identified your learning style, you will likely see a change in your mental capabilities. It will likely take you less time to learn a new concept. You will also likely retain information better.If you adapt your habits to fit your learning style, you will eventually have to spend less time studying each topic. This doesn't mean you will spend less time learning--it just means you can learn more information in less time.

, If you feel more comfortable learning new skills or information, you will be more confident. Confident learners tend to learn more quickly and effectively. You will be more likely to seek out new information.Confident learners are more likely to speak up and ask questions. This is a great way to add to your knowledge base.

, Knowing your learning style can help outside of school, too. Use your knowledge to help improve your job performance. You will be able to become more productive and increase your value to your employer.Maybe you are a visual learner. If your job is in sales, make sure to track your output using charts and graphs. You'll be able to easier spot trends and ways to improve.
If you are an auditory learner, ask your boss if she minds if you record your performance review. You can listen to the feedback again later and better absorb the information.

Think about the link between emotions and expressions.,
Learn to read happiness.,
Identify sadness.,
Learn to read contempt.,
Identify disgust.,
Watch for surprise.,
Notice fear.,
Identify anger.,
Watch for a macro expression.,
Notice a microexpression.,
Start looking for these expressions in others.,
Confirm your observations carefully.,
Be patient.,
Don’t assume someone is lying.,
Look for definite signs of lying.,
Keep in mind cultural differences.",How to Easily Read Faces and Facial Expressions," Charles Darwin (1872) was the first to suggest that the facial expressions of certain emotions were universal. Studies in his time were inconclusive; however, research continued on the subject, and in the 1960s Silvan Tomkins conducted the first study demonstrating that facial expressions are in fact reliably associated certain emotional states.Studies have shown that when emotions are spontaneously aroused, congenitally blind individuals produce the same facial expressions as sighted individuals do. In addition, facial expressions considered to be universal in humans have also been observed in non-human primates, particularly chimpanzees.;
, A face expressing happiness or joy will feature a smile (corners of the mouth drawn up and back) with some teeth exposed, and a wrinkle runs from the outer nose to the outer corners of the lip. The cheeks are raised, and the lower eyelids are tense or wrinkled. The narrowing of the eyelids causes “crow’s feet” wrinkles at the outer corners of the eyes.


A face that is smiling but does not involve the muscles in the eyes indicates a fake smile or polite smile that is not actual happiness or joy., A face showing sadness has the eyebrows drawn in and up, the skin below the eyebrows is triangulated with the inner corner up, and the corners of the lips are turned down. The jaw comes up and the bottom lip pouts out.


Studies show that this emotion is the hardest expression to fake., A face showing contempt, or hate, has one corner of the mouth rising, like a sort of half-smile which is actually a sneer., A disgusted face has the eyebrows downcast, but the lower eyelid raised (causing the eyes to narrow), the cheeks are raised and the nose is scrunched. The upper lip is also raised or curled upward., A surprised face features the eyebrows raised up and curved. The skin below the brow is stretched and there are horizontal wrinkles across the forehead. The eyelids are so wide open that the whites are showing above and/or below the pupils. The jaw is dropped and teeth are slightly parted, but there’s no stretching or tension of the mouth., A face showing fear has raised eyebrows that are usually more flat, not curved. There are wrinkles in the forehead in the center between the brows, not across. The upper eyelids are raised, but lower eyelids are tense and drawn up, usually causing whites to show in the upper eye but not lower. The lips are usually tensed or drawn back, the mouth may be open and nostrils may be flared., An angry face will show eyebrows that are lowered and drawn together, eyes staring hard or bulging, with vertical lines appearing between the brows and the lower eyelids tensed. Nostrils may be flared, and the mouth is either firmly pressed together with the lips drawn down at the corners, or in a square shape as if shouting. Also, the lower jaw juts out., A macro expression is when we make a face that goes along with a certain feeling and it lasts anywhere between .5 and 4 seconds, and usually involves the entire face.


These types of expressions are made when we are alone, or with close family or friends. They last longer than “microexpressions” because we are comfortable in our surroundings and don’t feel the need to conceal our emotions.
Macroexpressions are relatively easy to see if you know what to look for in a person., A microexpression is a shortened version of an emotional facial expression. They go on and off the face in a fraction of a second, sometimes 1/30 of a second. They happen so fast that if you blink you can miss them.


Microexpressions are usually the sign of concealed emotions. Sometimes the emotions are not necessarily being concealed, they are just rapidly processed.
Research suggests that micro expressions happen because facial expressions cannot be completely voluntarily controlled, even if the person is trying to control their emotions. There are two neural pathways in the brain that mediates facial expressions, and they enter into a type of “tug of war” over the face when someone is in an intensely emotional situation but is trying to conceal their feelings., Being able to read facial expressions benefits people in many different professions, especially those who work with the public, such as health professionals, teachers, researchers, and business people, as well as anyone interested in improving their personal relationships.


When having a conversation with someone, see if you can first establish a baseline in their face. The baseline is their normal facial muscle activity when feeling little or no emotion. Then, throughout the course of the conversation, look for macro- or microexpressions and see how well these fit with what the person is saying., Keep in mind that being able to read facial expressions does not automatically reveal what caused the emotion, only that the emotion may be occurring.


Don’t assume and ask questions based on your assumption. You could ask, “Would you like to talk more about that?” if you suspect that someone is concealing their emotions.
Asking “Are you angry?” or “Are you sad?” to someone you don’t know very well or someone you have a professional relationship with may be too intrusive, and could upset or aggravate the person. You should be sure that someone feels very comfortable with you before asking direct questions about their emotions.
If you do know someone well, it may be fun and helpful to ask directly about their feelings if you suspect a certain emotion. It could be a kind of game. You should communicate with them first that you’re learning about reading facial expressions and it would be helpful for you to practice with them sometimes., Being able to read facial expressions doesn’t give you authority over someone’s feelings, and you should not assume you know exactly how they are feeling without some more communication.


For instance, you would not want to give someone bad news, like that they did not get a promotion that they were hoping for, and then ask directly, “Are you angry?” because you saw an angry microexpression. Saying, “I’m open to talking more about this anytime you’d like to” would be a much better response if you suspect that they are angry.
Give people time to express their feelings when they are ready to. People have many different ways of communicating. Just because you believe someone is feeling a certain way, does not mean they are necessarily ready to discuss it with you., If someones’s microexpression contradicts what they are saying, it is possible that they are lying. People do tend to get emotional when lying for a variety of reasons: fear of getting caught, shame, or even enjoyment in lying about something they want to get away with.


Unless you are a professional trained in being able to detect lying, such as a law enforcement agent, assuming that someone is lying and then acting on that assumption may damage your relationship with that person.
People who work in law enforcement, such as FBI and CIA agents, often spend years in training to learn to read people’s body language; not only their facial expressions but also their voice, gestures, gaze, and postures. Always use caution when reading facial expressions unless you are a professional., While you can’t rely on facial expressions alone to know for sure that someone is lying, there are some other signs that are mostly proven to signify lying, and if you notice them along with inconsistent facial expressions, then someone may be hiding the truth. The other signs are:


a sudden jerk or tilt of the head,
increased shallow breathing,
extreme rigidness,
repetitiveness (repeating certain words or phrases)
over-compensating (giving too much information)
covering the mouth or other vulnerable areas such as the throat, chest, or abdomen
shuffling of the feet
difficulty in speaking
abnormal eye contact – either complete lack of it, rapid blinking, or extended eye contact with no blinking,
pointing, While facial expressions have been deemed the “universal language of emotion,” different cultures may actually interpret happy, sad, and angry facial expression in unique ways.


According to studies, Asian cultures rely more on the eyes when interpreting a facial expression, but Western cultures rely more on the eyebrows and mouth. This can sometimes lead to missed cues or misinterpreted signals during cross-cultural communication. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Asian cultures actually associate different fundamental emotions, such as pride and shame, with certain expressions instead of the seven major Western emotions."

It can also help you learn how to write better creatively. If you want to keep learning over the summer, make yourself a writing schedule and stick to it. You can also try keeping a journal.Try to write in an area where you want to improve. If you want to be a better poet, write poetry. If you want to write fiction, work on a book of fiction.
Try to set goals for yourself. You could strive to, say, write for two hours a day or write a set number of words each day.
If you're not interested in creative writing, journaling can help. You can journal ideas for projects or carry a notebook with you. Jot down anything that strikes your curiosity. For example, you may see something interesting on television about science. Write this down so you can learn more about it later.;
, During the school year, you're inside learning about academics. During the summer, why not learn some more hands-on skills? These could come in handy down the road for a job or other opportunity.You can try to learn something like cooking, how to fix things, electrical work, or automotive repair.
Try to get a summer job that will teach you a hands-on skill. You could, for example, work at a car repair store and learn about fixing cars.

, You can learn new skills from a summer camp without having to go to summer school. If there's a topic you want to know more about, see if you can find an affordable summer camp to attend that focuses on that area.For example, maybe you're interested in math and science. Try to do something like space camp.
If you're interested in writing, see if there's a writing or art camp you can attend over the summer to hone those skills.

Even if you don't find classes, you can join, say, a knitting or sewing club. This can help you learn as well. You can look for classes in a local community center or go online on sites like MeetUp.

, If you want to learn over the summer, honestly assess yourself. Think about your strengths and weaknesses so you know where you could improve. This will help you create a plan for learning over the summer.During the school year, where do you think there's room for improvement? Maybe you are excellent at math and science, but sometimes struggle with history. Maybe you're great at science courses like biology, but tend to struggle with chemistry.
Identify a few key areas where you could use to improve. Focus your energies on those courses over the summer.

, Read about current events online to keep up with modern concerns like climate change. You can take the summer as an opportunity to become more aware of world events. Start reading newspapers or magazines.


There are many news websites, like the Huffington Post and CNN's website, that publish news online. You can also start watching the news.
If your parents subscribe to any magazines, like Newsweek, read these.

, You can do your own research to learn. Think about topics you're unfamiliar with and would like to know more about. Use the internet and a library to expand your knowledge.Buy a book or read an article online about something that interests you. Maybe you want to know more about a certain president or the history of a foreign country. Research this over the summer, as if you were researching a school project.

, Reading is one of the best ways to learn over the summer. At the beginning of the summer, draft a reading list. Make a list of books that you have been meaning to read for a while and add them to your list.You can focus on literary books. Try adding some of the classics as well as contemporary novels that are getting very good reviews.
You can also focus on more academic texts. Maybe you want to learn more about World War II. Try reading a few books on the subject over the summer.

, The summer can be a great time to expand your vocabulary. Work on learning a new vocabulary term each day. You can sign up for a phone app that sends you new words every day.There is an app you can use, created by Dictionary.com, that send you a new word each day to learn.You can also jot down any words you don't know that you encounter when reading. You can look these up later, expanding your vocabulary.

, You can find many courses provided online for free.

Network!",How to Earn an MBA While Working," Tell your boss about your plans to pursue an MBA. Although the choice is ultimately up to you, your employer will appreciate it if you keep them in the loop about your plans. There may be a big project coming up that will take up a lot of your time. In that case, you should consider waiting to pursue your MBA.Frame the topic in terms of the benefit to the company. Consider saying something like, “I want to be become more efficient in my workflow and I think an MBA can make me an even better asset to the company.”Try to assuage any fears that going back to school will make you a less effective employee. Tell your boss how you plan to implement what you learn at school into your work at the company.;
, Many companies value people with MBAs. Getting an MBA will give you additional knowledge and skills that many employers will reward.You can raise the topic by asking about recent job postings you’ve seen within the company. For example, you might approach your boss and say, “I noticed a management position posted and I think I have many of the tools that would make me an effective manager. Would getting an MBA make more competitive for the position?”, Some companies put so much value in MBAs that they are willing to reimburse employees for the cost of getting the degree. Most employers who offer this benefit are quite large, but it doesn’t hurt to ask your smaller company too; they may offer smaller grants or other incentives.Start by reading the employee handbook. If your company offers tuition reimbursement it will probably be mentioned in the handbook.Network with other MBAs in your company. They may have information about tuition reimbursement and how to approach the issue with your boss.
Approach your boss with a specific plan. Instead of saying, “I’m wondering if you’ll reimburse my MBA tuition,” write out the specific costs involved in getting the degree and present them to your boss. That way, you can say, “The average tuition for the schools I’m interested in is $100,000 and I expect an additional $5,000 for books and other expenses.”

, Pursuing an MBA while working full-time is a big undertaking. You’ll be using most of your free time to study. It’s important to let those close to you know about your decision so they can adjust their own schedules if need be.A part-time MBA takes between two-to-three years to complete. Make sure your friends and family understand the commitment involved before you jump into pursuing an MBA.If your friends and family are concerned about missing out on time with you, you can consider pursuing your MBA online. This will still be a lot of work, but you won’t have to be away from home as much., Even if you need to stay in one city for work, there may be many schools that offer part-time MBA programs in your area. An MBA from a prestigious school may give you more opportunities, but you should carefully consider factors such as cost, distance, and time to complete the program.Go online to the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). They maintain a list of accredited MBA programs. This list includes schools that offer part-time MBA programs and lists schools that offer part-time online programs.Reach out to the schools you’re interested in. Most schools have welcoming admissions departments that provide information sessions and one-on-one tours. Tell them you’re interested in part-time MBA programs and ask whether classes in the part-time program are scheduled in the evenings or on weekends, or both.Talk to other students and alumni from the part-time MBA programs you’re interested in. Often times, students and alumni will give you the most unbiased information about the school. This is a good opportunity to ask about how much time students spend in class and studying and what opportunities opened up for alumni after they received their MBA.

, Many business schools have both in-person programs and online programs. Research both types of programs and decide which one will work best for you.Part-time online MBA programs are usually a bit cheaper and offer more flexibility. You’ll be able to watch recorded lectures from home on your own schedule instead of having to show up to class at a specific time. However, since you’ll rarely be on campus you may miss out on some of the resources the business school has to offer.
Part-time in-person MBA programs require you to attend classes on a regular schedule. The classes are held in the evenings and/or on weekends to accommodate working students. Since you’ll be on campus often, you’ll have the opportunity to network with your professors and other students. However, taking the traditional path means you’ll have to spend more time away from home.

, Fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and look for other financial aid. The FAFSA is required if you want to get loans from the federal government to cover your tuition. It’s always a good idea to fill it out even if you think you won’t need it. If other funding sources fall through you may end up needing federal loans after all.Your employer may be willing to reimburse you for tuition. This should be the first place you look for financial aid.Every business school has resources that will help you identify funding sources. Check with each school where you plan to apply.
Go online to http://www.gograd.org/financial-aid/scholarships/mba/ to find a list of scholarships available for MBA students.

, The GMAT is required to for admission to most MBA programs. It tests your analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skill.Consider studying for the test on your own. There are dozens of self-guided GMAT prep programs available. These programs consist of a series of books or online study guides that help you master the topics that will be on the GMAT. If you’re good at studying and learning on your own, this is your best option.
Consider enrolling in a GMAT course. GMAT courses are taught by business schools professors and other professionals. They give you a more in-depth and intensive prep experience. If you learn better in a classroom atmosphere and cost is not an issue, this is your best option.
Whichever study option you choose, you should set aside at least one month to study for the exam. If you can only devote a few hours to studying each week, you should spend more than a month studying for the test. Use your evenings and weekends to study for the test. This will be good practice for the study schedule you'll use as a part-time MBA student.Register for the GMAT online at www.mba.com and pay the $250 registration fee. The test is offered in hundreds of cities around the world.
Don’t forget to request the day of the test off from work. Since you’ve already talked to your boss about getting an MBA this shouldn’t be a tough sell.

, Most schools will ask for your GMAT score, college transcripts, work experience, a cover letter or essay, and recommendation letters.


Most schools charge an application fee. Fees range from $10 to $250 depending on the school.If you can, get letters of recommendation from people who are affiliated with the school in some way. For example, if your boss is an alumni you should get a letter of recommendation from them.

, Decide what you want to achieve before you get started in the program. If you’ll be working sixty hours a week while also attending school, it might be a bad idea to aim for being #1 in your class.Don’t use your undergrad experience as a barometer. As an undergrad you were likely able to devote your full attention to school. Don’t expect to get the same grades (at least right away) in your MBA program while working full time.Pay attention to the competition but don’t let it get to you. Everyone else in your part-time MBA program likely has similar goals: they want to move up in their careers as well. This is a self-selected group of high achievers so you should expect the competition to be tough. Try to remember that you’re there to learn skills and develop a network, not necessarily to be the best in the class.

, Pursuing an MBA while working full-time is an ambitious challenge. You’ll need to juggle work, school, and family responsibilities. You should understand how much time you’ll be devoting to each before you jump in.Use a planner. Whether digital or paper, a planner is essential to navigating through an MBA while working. Use the planner to write in test days, due dates for both school and work assignments, and other important dates.
Use a “to do” list with specific tasks. It feels good to scratch things off your “to do” list, and doing so will help keep you on track. If your list says something like “study,” it’s hard to know when you’ve completed the task. Instead, write something like, “study Chapter Two of the Business Skills 101 text and make flash cards.”Schedule big study blocks. As a part-time MBA student working full time, you’ll need to use whatever time you have to study. However, you should also schedule study blocks into your planner every week. If you’re a morning person, plan to wake up early and study; if you’re a night owl, schedule your study blocks for nighttime.Figure out what you can cut out. You may need to cut back on time at the gym, social activities, or other things in your life., It’s easy to get burned out while pursuing an MBA and working full-time. You should schedule days off ahead of time. That way, you can look forward to your planned days off and not feel guilty when you take them.

, Studying hard is important for success in your MBA. Studying smart means using the best strategies to study effectively and efficiently.Instead of heading to a restaurant for lunch, pack one and study in your office during your lunch hour.
Keep your study materials with you whenever you can. If you have unexpected downtime, you’ll always be prepared to hit the books.
Many schools have tutors that can help you with your work. If you’re having trouble understanding a concept you should reach out to a tutor.

, Remember that you’re getting an MBA to improve your marketability. If you start slacking off at work or missing days, the negative impression of your boss could offset any gains from having an MBA.If you start to feel overwhelmed, talk to your school first. They have resources to help you manage your time and your stress.
If worst comes to worst and you feel like you’re going to miss a work deadline, talk to your boss. It’s better to let your employer know beforehand that you’ll be late with a project than to have to explain yourself later.

, Aside from the degree itself, business schools offer a whole host of resources for budding businesspeople. You should keep up-to-date on events at your school so you don’t miss out on any opportunities.Attend professional talks at your school. Most business schools will have stars in the field of business or professors of business come to the school through the year to give talks. Attending these talks is a great way to learn about specific industries and to meet other people who are enthusiastic about an area of business.Go to job fairs. Business schools host job fairs several times a year. If you’re looking for a new job this is a great opportunity to meet employers and do interviews. Even if you’re not looking for a new job at the moment, attending a job fair will give you allow you to see what businesses are hiring and network with professionals in your area.

, Your coursework will give you new knowledge and skills. Using these skills at your full-time job will be good practice and it will also go a long way towards convincing your employer that you are someone worth keeping around.When you encounter a new problem at work, try thinking of it as a case study from your coursework. This will put you in a frame of mind to apply your new knowledge to a real-world situation.
If your boss puts in you a team, use the teamwork skills you’ve learned through you MBA program to effectively manage the group.

, Networking is one of the most important skills for a businessperson. You should use your school’s alumni network to reach out to others in your field.Most business schools have a department specifically devoted to helping students build their network. Find out where this department is located and talk to staff there about developing your business network.
Talk to other MBAs in your company about networking opportunities. Since you’re part of the “MBA crowd” now, there will probably be more opportunities for you to expand your network inside and outside your company.

Recognise a proper system.,
Know the meaning of branches.",How to Draw Root Locus of a System1," System comes between these two. input goes into the system, then becomes altered and then goes out as the desired output. A system is built to create such a desired alteration for the output.;
, Input goes into it as an arrow and output comes out of it as an arrow.


Whatever system does to the input is called the system function.






Before performing that function a system always does one of the three things to its input,

This Root Locus is called 180° Root Locus.
Simply reduces that input. In this case we say the coefficient of amplification is less than one (0 < K < 1).
Simply keep it at the same value. In this case we say the coefficient of amplification is equal to one (K = 1).
Simply increase it. In this case we say the coefficient of amplification is greater than one (K > 1).


Before performing that function a system might make the input inverted, upside-down, and after that it always does one of the three things to its input,

This Root Locus is called 0° Root Locus.
Simply reduces that inverted input. In this case we say the coefficient of amplification is greater than minus one ( – 1 < K < 0).
Simply keep it at the same value. In this case we say the coefficient of amplification is equal to minus one (K = – 1).
Simply increases it. In this case we say the coefficient of amplification is less than minus one (K < – 1).


K is called gain of the system.
A system with the feedback has a path from output into the input and participate and share something from the output into the input.







,
Relation of output to input is described as the multiplication of input X(s) by the system function G(s) to result the output Y(s). That is, Y(s) = G(s)X(s).

,, Please note that inside the cross (X) there is a plus (+) sign for the input and a minus (–) sign for the feedback.
Output comes and through a feedback path goes to change the input. When output Y(s) comes out of the feedback it becomes Y(s) times H(s) (that is, Y(s)H(s)) and becomes subtracted from the input X(s).
Therefore, actually X(s) –Y(s)H(s) goes into the system. X(s) –Y(s)H(s) goes into the system and becomes multiplied by the system function and comes out as (X(s) –Y(s)H(s))G(s). Hence, the output Y(s) is actually,Y(s) = (X(s) –Y(s)H(s))G(s)

,,


Transfer function as in Equation 2 is known as the Closed Loop Transfer Function.

Product G(s)H(s) in Equation 2 is known as the Open Loop Transfer Function.


, This equation is called the Characteristic Equation of the system.

, All the functions discussed, even each of X(s) or Y(s) themselves, are complex rational functions of the complex variable s.

, For example H(s) = n(s) / d(s).

,,, Frequently in the feedback loop, the feedback function is unit; that is, H(s) = 1.

,, It is correct that now this G(s) is not the same as previous G(s) as its gain K has been removed from it, but it is convenient still to use the same notation for it, as if we had a K block and a G(s) block from the beginning.

,, You like to know when this denominator becomes zero, or approaches zero when gain of the system, K, as a parameter changes. You are interested to inspect 1 + KG(s) = 0. Or G(s) = – 1 / K. Assume K > 0 and then figure out by symmetry what happens if K < 0. For a comprehensive understanding, even the trivial case K = 0 should also be discussed.

, Consequently, note that |G(s)| = 1 / K and /G(s) = 180°q; where, q is an odd integer. This symbol /___ shows the angle of a complex function.

,, This is one hurdle in drawing the Root Locus. Anyway, for now, it is assumed that such a factorisation is known. Thus, for a polynomial of degree n we have n complex roots r i
, The characteristic equation turns to be s + K = 0. Changing K from 0 upward changes s from 0 to – ∞ downward.

, From high school you had questions such as to determine a parameter β such that a quadratic equation x2 + x + β = 0 has two equal roots; such or similar questions. That was a basic Root Locus problem parametrized with β. You knew you should calculate discriminant and put it equal to zero to meet the prescribed condition : Δ = 1 - 4β = 0 and hence β = 1 / 4.

, Instead of discriminant, the characteristic function will be investigated; that is 1 + K (1 / s(s + 1) = 0. A manipulation of this equation concludes to the s2 + s + K = 0.

,, You have two real roots s = 0 and s = – 1, since characteristic equation is s2 + s = 0.

,, Discriminant will be negative. You have two imaginary roots as complex conjugate to each other. But the real value of both roots remain the same and equal to – 1 / 2. Increasing K has no effect whatever on this; only imaginary parts will become larger. The Root Locus is drawn in heavy lines.


There are two roots for this quadratic polynomial and definitely they join in one point on the real line for certain value of parameter K that makes discriminant equal to zero and creates a repeated root.
The portion of the real line between these two roots is part of the Root Locus
This point is called σ-point or branching point of the asymptotes of the Root Locus.
Up to this value of K system damps without overshoot-undershoot (does not quiver before stopping).
At K = 1 / 4 system damps critically.
After that, increasing K only increases the imaginary part of the created conjugate roots.
That makes the branching of the root locus perpendicular to real line.
Theoretically, all along this line system damps but with tremors. Practically, increasing gain can make the system unstable. Tremors might become so persistent that trigger unwanted frequencies in the system which in turn rapture the system beyond its material strength. For example, small cracks reach to catastrophic points or dynamic fatigue work it out. Always designers devise for prevention of unlimited increase of K.

, Any arbitrary point in the complex plane can be shown by a vector, which has a length and an angle with respect to the real line.


– r is the root of s + r = 0


s is said to be the test point for evaluating – r.
Any selection of s over the real line is called a real-line evaluation of – r.

,


On the real line you are confined in the intervals. An integral has just two end points to be evaluated.
On the complex plane you cannot roam everywhere. In contrast, you have to select a region to confine your evaluations. Even that is too much. You confine your evaluations only to be done on a certain curve or certain (usually simple) paths.

, It is a vector from the tip of s1 to the tip of r.

, Ask which part of the real line falls on the root locus when the gain k varies from zero to plus infinity.


Select any point on the real line if the number of the real roots (zeros and poles) at the right hand side of that root is an odd number (1, 3, 5, ...) then that portion of the real line is also on the Root Locus.






In the simple Integrator all points on the negative part of the real line have only one root at the right side. Hence, all the negative real line is on the Root Locus.
In the Motor Control System only those points of the real line between s = 0 and s = – 1 have odd number of roots at the right side. Hence, only the portion between s = 0 and s = – 1 is on the Root Locus.

, Remove gain K wherever it is, as a separate parameter and write the characteristic equation as 1 + K F(s) = 0, where F(s) is a rational function; that is, F(s) = N(s) / D(s). Both N(s) and D(s) are polynomials.


Roots of N(s), that is, zeros of F(s) is polynomial of degree m.
Roots of D(s), that is, poles of F(s) is polynomial of degree n.
Characteristic function for the simple Integrator is 1 + K / s = 0.


F(s) = 1 / s.


Characteristic function for the Motor Control System is 1 + K / s (1 + s) = 0.


F(s) = 1 / s (1 + s).



, In a proper system m < n. number of zeros are strictly less than number of poles. That is, system does not kick back or tolerates infinite transitions.

, Branches are paths that roots of the characteristic function create when the value of the gain K varies from zero to infinity. Each value of K gives a new characteristic function with different roots.


If you want to put different values of K into the characteristic equation and solve the polynomials to get the roots either you have to use a computer or use graphical methods such as the Root Locus to sketch the solutions.

"
Do some background research.,
Open your review with a compelling hook.,
Describe 3-5 dishes that you sampled, not all of them.,
Use big, colorful adjectives when writing.,
Think about a restaurant's intentions, not just your personal preferences.,
Write a mixture of pros and cons.,
Make a recommendation.,
Fill in the essential details of the restaurant in the beginning or end of the review.",How to Write a Food Review1," Once you've had your meal and taken your notes, take a little time to see what the restaurant's history is. These kind of details are a great way to add some color to your review. For example, you might find that the head chef trained in France or used to work at another well-loved restaurant in the area, and you can use these connections to make people interested in the food.


Start by reading the restaurant's website. Look up the owner and executive chef to get an idea of their training, style, and past ventures.;
, The first sentence of the review should make people want to read more. Remember, you are giving them a reason to either spend their money at this restaurant or skip ahead to another spot, but you're also trying to get them to read your writing. Some tips for a good hook include:


Promise a story or surprise, such as ""it may have taken a while to get to my mouth, but I've found the best paella on the planet."" Make sure, however, that you deliver on the promise later!
Give an interesting, tangential fact, like ""Chef Zurlo only started cooking 2 years ago, yet she's quickly risen through the ranks to operate Oakland's best new bagel shop.""
Describe a particularly captivating or compelling part of the ambiance, good or bad, like a great view or a funny smell from the kitchen.

, No one wants to read a laundry list of foods, so pick the foods that made the greatest impression on you (good or bad) and focus your writing on these dishes. Don't just say if they were good or bad. Strive to give details and reasons, naming each specific dish. As an outline, you should try and talk about the following three things in every food review:Presentation: How'd the dish look when it arrived, and how did it make you feel? Excited? Hungry? Like royalty? Like you were in your family's kitchen again?

Taste: The big, obvious one, but that is only because it is so important. Use descriptive language, metaphor, and simile to put your reader in your shoes, or mouth. Name spices or flavors when you can.

Texture:This usually includes cooking process as well. Did it melt in your mouth? Was it still hot when it arrived? Was it juicy and tender or tough and brittle? Were their multiple textures (such as something soft with a crunchy crust), and did they work well together?

, Remember that, above all, you're selling the experience here, not just the food. Feel free to get poetic with your writing in places, using 1-2 well-placed adjectives to let the reader know exactly what they should expect at the restaurant. You can think of it, in some ways, as the short story of your trip -- give details and colorful additions that make the restaurant stand out and feel unique.


This includes the atmosphere, the surface, and the location. The more specific details, the better. Try for one good detail about every interaction/part of the restaurant.

, A good food review is about helping other people find the restaurant, not just a platform to tell everyone your likes and dislikes. For example, if you go to a restaurant with retro art on the walls and rollerskating dancers, it is not fair to judge the restaurant for specializing in burgers and fries instead of oysters. A good reviewer is as unbiased as possible, evaluating the restaurant as a whole.


What kind of atmosphere are they going for here? Do they pull it off?
How do your preferences match the restaurants? If you hate seafood, but that is the restaurant's specialty, you may want to tone down the negative reviews of the salmon or tell your readers that you aren't generally a fan of fish., Unless it is either the very best restaurant you've ever eaten at or the very worst, it is not fair to write a review that is either all good or all bad. Try and give your audience the complete picture. This ultimately allows the reader to make their own decision based on your advice, which seems much more reasonable when it considers both the pros and cons.


""While my servers were incredibly kind and accommodating, it doesn't change the fact that the food was a bit cold when it came out.""
""Head chef Mathew Tucci has designed an amazing menu, and it's a shame that he only has 10 tables to serve to in his small little restaurant.""

, Ultimately, people want your advice on the food. What to order, what to skip, and what restaurants to go to depending on their mood. You should feel free to suggest certain dishes, recommending that someone should skip dessert, or mention if it seems like a great place to take a date. These make your review compelling and useful.


If there is little of merit in the restaurant and you firmly believe is should be avoided, feel free to write a negative review. However, you should usually try a restaurant a second time, making sure that you didn't try out a fluke of a dish, before attacking it., This is where you put in the average cost of a meal, the reservations time, and the address. You could also add a rating, such 3 out of 4 stars, if you wanted. Many reviewers put this at the very end of the article, in it's own separate paragraph, but some also put it at the top, on a separate column on the side, or worked into one of the first paragraphs.

, Number of branches of Root Locus is the same as the number of roots of D(s); that is, number of poles of F(s).


Simple Integrator has one pole. It has one branch.
Motor Control System has two poles one at s = 0 and the other at s = – 1. It has two branches.

, When K varies from zero to infinity branches of Root Locus could asymptotically approach to infinity.


All these asymptotes intersect at a point on the real line.
Point of intersection is called the σ-point.
Calculate the σ-point from,






Add all the poles then subtract from it the result of addition of all the zeros. Now divide the result by the difference of the number of poles and number of zeros.

Sigma point for the Simple Integrator is σ = 0

Sigma point for the Motor Control is σ = (0 – 1) / 2 = – 1 / 2



Do not confuse asymptotes with the branches. Asymptotes take branches to the infinity.
Remember that straight line branches are their own asymptotes if they move to infinity.

, In all cases that m < n a value of s →∞ makes F(s) → 0. This is called a zero at infinity.

, But you know that F(s) becomes infinity at its own poles. Therefore, branches of root Locus always begin from poles, where at the same time K is zero.

Simply get the conclusion that there are always n branches rising (originating) from the n poles of F(s).

, m branches end to the m zeros. Remaining n – m branches goes to infinity which is considered as zeros at infinity., Third rule determines angles of asymptotes that lead branches of the Root Locus. It is equal to 180° / (n – m).

Use symmetry to draw all asymptotes.

, This is called the angle of departure of the branch from the pole. Use this relation. Let's study what is each factor,



J : is the index of the pole under investigation. You like to calculate departure angle of that specific pole.

φJ : is the angle of departure from pole J.

pJ : is the complex value of the pole under investigation.

i : roams among the number of zeros from first zero ( i = 1) to m-th zero (i = m).

pJ – zi : is the evaluation of pJ at zi.

k : roams among the number of poles from first pole ( k = 1) to n-th pole (k = n).


k = J apparently has been forbidden to participate. But, even not, has no meaning; it results pJ – pJ = 0; with nought participation.



pJ – pk : is the evaluation of pJ at pk.

arg : shows that you are calculating smallest angle of the vector insides the brackets with respect to the real axis.

q : is an odd integer. Most of the time just q = 1 is enough.

, You like to know the angle of departure from a certain pole, then,


determine angle of each zero evaluated by that pole; add them together.
Determine angle of each pole evaluated by that pole; add them together.
Subtract the two from each other.
Add 180° to the result (sometimes you have to add – 180° or even 540° or – 540°).

, This is called angle of arrival of branch into a zero. Use this relation to calculate it. Let's study what is each factor,



J : is the index of the zero under investigation. You like to calculate arrival angle of that specific zero.

ɸJ : is the angle of arrival into the zero J.

zJ : is the complex value of the zero under investigation.

k : roams among the number of poles from first pole ( k = 1) to n-th pole (k = n).

zJ – pk : is the evaluation of zJ at pk.

i : roams among the number of zeros from first zero ( i = 1) to m-th zero (i = m).


i = J apparently has been forbidden to participate. But, even not, has no meaning; it results zJ – zJ = 0; with nought participation.



zJ – zi : is the evaluation of zJ at zi.

arg : shows that you are calculating smallest angle of the vector insides the brackets with respect to the real axis.

q : is an odd integer. Most of the time just q = 180° is enough.

, You like to know the angle of arrival at a certain zero, then,


determine angle of each pole evaluated by that zero; add them together.
Determine angle of each zero evaluated by that zero; add them together.
Subtract the two from each other.
Add 180° to the result (sometimes you have to add – 180° or even 540° or – 540°).

, Branches leaving poles without having a zero to arrive at, will approach infinity at the sides of asymptote guardians., Remains few speculated points to make the sketch more realistic. These are done by evaluation of test point or using basic calculator (gone are the days when you had to use the painful slide rules). The best points to find and the most worrying points, too, are points of ""cross-over"" of the Locus on the imaginary axes. These are the points that make the system oscillatory and then into the right half of complex plane the system becomes non-damping and unstable."
"
Avoid telling staff members that you are a food critic or reviewer.,
Make some notes of the restaurant's logistics.,
Describe the atmosphere and ambiance when you walked in.,
Make some notes on the service.,
Order from a wide swath of the menu.",How to Write a Food Review2," You want to get the same experience as any other patron, as many restaurants will give you special treatment that may change your review if they know you're a critic. Instead of telling them you are there to review their food, simply head inside and take a table, acting like any other customer. The Association of Food Journalists even suggest that you avoid large culinary events (grand openings, staff parties, etc.) so you don't risk being approached by chefs looking for a good review.


If you are an established reviewer you should make reservations under a different name.
You should still bring a notebook or small recorder with you to take notes, though you can also take them on your phone. To write a great review, you should be taking notes.

, Did you need a reservation, and how far in advance was it set up? Where is the restaurant, and what is the neighborhood like? How was the parking? These facts will make up a very small part of your review, but this information is essential to help potential customers find the perfect restaurant for their night., Give your reader a feel for your experience. Does the wait staff treat you like family or an old friend, or is the place elegant and classy? What is the dress code like? What kind of atmosphere is in the restaurant? Be creative in the description -- a good food review is not just about the menu, it is about the entire experience.


Do the decorations create an appealing ambiance?
How are people enjoying their meals? At large, talkative tables or many small, intimate dates?

, Avoid thing like, ""the service was good/bad."" You want specifics. The best way to get them is by asking questions. While you don't want to pester people, a good waitstaff will know what foods go well together, if there are any allergens in the dish, and the basic presentation of the dish. Most importantly, a good waitstaff is there when you need it -- when water glasses get low, when a fork is dropped, and when you're ready to order your next course.

, You will not be able to eat everything on the menu. You should, however, touch as many sections of it as you can. Be sure to get a drink, an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert to get a sense of the kitchen's full capabilities. If you can, come with a group of people and have everyone order something different (beef/fish, the soup/salad, sauteed/simmered) to get a good idea how the kitchen handles the entire restaurant.


As a food reviewer, you need to try everything you can to get a good idea of the restaurant.
What you order is, of course, a matter of personal preference. However, asking the servers for recommendations is a great way to see what the kitchen and staff are proudest off. Most servers have tasted everything on the menu with the chef's guidance, so they should be able to help you order and determine what you're eating.

"
"
Note the presentation of the dish.,
Enjoy your first few bites.,
Write down your initial impressions with specific detail.,
Sample the individual parts of the meal.,
Sample everything on the table.,
Make specific notes as you eat.,
Ask questions as they arise.",How to Write a Food Review3," As soon as the food reaches your table, make some notes on the appearance. Is it clean and beautiful or messy and tired? Remember, a food review is about the experience, not just the taste, so you need to capture all of these details.


If you are at a restaurant that allows it, try and snap a quick picture with your phone. This will make it much easier to write about the appearance later.

, Savor the first few bites, sampling everything on the plate before writing anything else down. Eat slowly and enjoy the meal before trying to get too critical.


Make sure you eat the dish the way it was intended first-- don't pick out any ingredients or try things separately until later.

, Use adjectives and clear language when making your notes. ""I liked the use of rosemary"" is not as helpful as ""the rosemary crust was light and herbal and perfect complemented the soft, fluffy potatoes."" That said, this is just the time to take notes, so don't worry about getting the language perfect.


Writing down specific details now about why you liked/disliked a dish will make your writing much, much easier later.

, This is where you start to get into the specifics of a good food review. Try each part of the meal separately, checking for the following criteria:



Texture. How does the food feel in your mouth? Again, be specific, as there is a variety of textures, all of which can be good or bad.

Spices: Are the spices consistent throughout the meal? Can you tell what some of the spices are?

Complexity: A hard one to describe, complexity is a measure of the variety of flavors in a food. A good cook doesn't just go for ""lemon-flavored"" or ""garlic & pepper,"" they go for a nuanced, unique taste to their food. Do the individual parts of the dish come together to make something new or better than the sum of their parts?

, If you're with other people, make sure you taste their dishes as well and make a couple of quick notes. This is the best way to get a full idea of the menu and the restaurants strengths and weaknesses.


Be sure to write down the exact name of each dish for later reference. Your reader will want to know what to order or avoid.

, A good review is rooted in fact, so make sure you're armed with facts. Of course, all food reviewing is inherently subjective, but that doesn't mean should only comment on what you liked and didn't like. It might be easiest to make your notes after you finish the course or as you eat, depending on your company. Either way, you should not rely on your memory to remember everything -- true food critics write notes., If you're curious what was in a sauce, how something was prepared, or where certain high-profile foods (meats, expensive cheeses, etc.) came from, feel free to ask. At high-class restaurants the waitstaff is trained to know about the food they serve, so they should be happy to give you an answer."

Purchase packages of dry ice.,
Get the right quality material for packing.,
Add a layer of Styrofoam to the box.,
Take precautions when handling dry ice.,
Pack the box.,
Add the correct addresses.,
Mark the package correctly.,
Get a Class 9 label.,
Complete the required paperwork at a local post office.,
Consider the shipping durations.,
Add extra labels for international shipments.,
Prepare for extra costs due to regulations.",How to Ship Foods with Dry Ice," Before you can pack materials using dry ice, you'll have to purchase some. You can buy packages of dry ice at most butcher shops and grocery stores. Some UPS stores or FedEx stores may sell dry ice., Once you've obtained dry ice, you need material to pack it safely. Dry ice releases carbon dioxide, which can be hazardous if released through the package rupturing. A rupture can be caused by pressure pushed down on a package during shipments. Therefore, the material you use should allows the release of some pressure.You can use good quality fiberboard, also known as corrugated cardboard, which you can purchase online or at a local hardware store. You can also use plastic or wooden boxes to ship with dry ice.
Do not use steel drums or jerrycans to ship dry ice.

, It's a good idea to layer the box with Styrofoam. Some even advise mailing the box in a Styrofoam cooler, which you would then place inside another container. Make sure the Styrofoam you use is at least 2 inches thick in length.

, When packing your container with packages of dry ice, use gloves. Dry ice is very cold and cause serious burns if it comes into contact with bare skin., Wrap the food in plastic wrap or place in paper bags prior to packing. You want to make sure the food and dry ice are packed together tightly. Use newspaper or cellulose to make sure it's packed tight. This provides extra insulation, keeping your perishables fresh. If you're using a Styrofoam cooler, do not seal it completely as this can prevent the package from releasing pressure.Packs of dry ice should be on the bottom, followed by food items. You should alternate between dry ice and food items, filling in excess gaps with bubble wrap and newspaper, until the box is full., You will need to label the box for shipping. As with any other container, you will need to put your address as well as the address of the recipient. You can write this directly on the box, or get adhesive labels at a local post office where you can write the address and return address down., Dry ice is considered hazardous material, so it needs to be marked properly prior to shipment. At the post office, make sure you ask that the following labels be attached to your box:You will need a label that says ""Dry Ice"" or ""Carbon Dioxide Solid.""
You will need a label that reads UN 1845, which also indicates the package contains hazardous materials.
You will need a label indicating the net worth of dry ice in your container. Make sure you know how much dry ice you used during packing. Packages of dry ice will have their weight written on the label.

, As dry ice is considered hazardous, it needs what is called a Class 9 label. This is a label, which you receive at the post office, that indicates the package contains dry ice.


You can receive a label free of charge at most post offices. You can also call the FedEx company to have a label shipped to you for free by calling 1-800-463-3339.
Make sure you put the Class 9 label on the same side of the package that contains the UN 1845 label.

, When shipping with dry ice, certain paperwork is required. You usually include basic information, like your name and address, and do not need to bring in any special materials to fill out paperwork. At the post office, you'll be presented with the proper forms.You may have to fill out what is called a shipper's declaration. This is a slip that includes basic information about yourself and the recipient. You will also need to put in some numbers indicating what hazardous material you are shipping. The worker at the post office should be able to help you with the form., When shipping with dry ice, you want to make sure the dry ice will preserve perishables for the proper amount of time. Overnight shipping is usually best, especially when shipping items like meat. However, if meat is vacuum packed, 2 day shipping may be sufficient. Unless you know temperatures outside will be below freezing, do not opt for anything over 2 day shipping., When it comes to international shipment, there will be additional labels to fill out. Be prepared to fill out such labels at the post office. For some international shipments, a passport may be required. Before purchasing dry ice to ship, call your post office and ask if the country you're shipping to has any regulations against dry ice.

, If you're planning on shipping with dry ice, be prepared for extra costs. As you'll likely have to pay for overnight or two day shipping, costs can get steep. You also may have to pay added fees for shipping hazardous materials. Call your local post office to ask for a price estimate to make sure shipping with dry ice is within your budget."

Take into consideration the type of recipe you will be making; e.g.,
Be sure that you are making the proper adjustments when the substitution is not 1 for 1.

",How to Substitute Sweeteners With Agave Nectar," batter, dough, liquid, etc. The best substitutions are sauces, syrups, some drinks, desserts, and salad dressings. Mostly because of their liquid states.


Liquid Sweeteners






Honey - Substitute 1 for 1, like replace a cup of honey with a cup of agave syrup.
Maple Syrup - Substitute 1 for 1, like replace a cup of maple syrup with a cup of agave syrup.
Brown Rice Syrup - When you replace a cup of brown rice syrup, use 1/2 to 1/3 as much agave, and increase other liquids in the recipe by up to 1/2 a cup.
Corn Syrup - When you replace a cup of light corn syrup, be sure to use 1/2 as much agave, and increase other liquids in the recipe by up to 1/3 of a cup. Like corn syrup, agave nectar will not crystallize.


Granulated Sweeteners

White Granulated Sugar - For each cup of white sugar that you are replacing, use 2/3 of a cup of agave and reduce other liquids by 1/4 to 1/3 cup. This substitution will also work for Demerara Sugar, Turbinado Sugar, Evaporated Cane Juice, or Sucanat.
Brown Sugar - For each cup of brown sugar replaced, use 2/3 of a cup of agave and reduce other liquids by 1/4 cup. Because the moisture content of Brown Sugar is higher than that of white sugar, liquids may not have to be reduced as much when substituting agave nectar.

, When shipping food such as poultry, meat or fish, place an additional ice pack on top of the container.

, Place the container with the cold pack inside the box.

, You can add packing peanuts before placing the container inside the shipping box when there is too much room on either side of the box. When the item has a snug fit, use Styrofoam packaging sleeves instead.

Use pure stevia drops.,
Add flavored stevia to beverages.,
Try pure stevia extract powder.,
Bake with stevia.,
Read all labels and avoid additives.,
Mask the aftertaste.",How to Use Stevia1," Perhaps the most popular way to use stevia is in its liquid form. A few drops of stevia can be used to replace 1-2 teaspoons of white sugar. Use stevia drops in drinks (hot or cold), sauces, salad dressings, or soups.Stevia can have a bit of a bitter and/or licorice-y aftertaste. Experiment with the number of drops you need to gain optimal sweetness with minimal aftertaste.;
, Stevia drops are also available in flavored varieties, such as lemon-lime or root beer. Add a few drops of flavored stevia to sparkling water for a low-calorie alternative to soda.Read the labels of flavored stevia options.
Avoid flavored stevia that contains aspartame or other chemical sugar replacements.

, Another popular way to use stevia is in its pure powder form. This refined stevia looks similar to sugar, and can be used anywhere you would normally use powdered sweetener. Stevia extract powder is more potent than sugar, however. Use half (or less than half) of the amount of stevia as you normally would for sugar.Stevia extract powder can be used in drinks (hot or cold), on cereal, or in recipes.
It can be purchased in large containers, or in individual packets you can take along with you.
Look for pure stevia powder. Read all labels and avoid stevia powder with additives.

, Stevia extract powder can be used to replace sugar in baking. When you bake with stevia, you’ll want to use 1/2 the amount of sugar you would normally use (or even less). This means you will need to add more bulk (such as flour) and liquid (such as milk, applesauce, or butter) to account for this difference.When you are just starting out, it is best to seek out stevia-based baking recipes.
Although stevia can replicate the sweetness of sugar, it will not caramelize.

, Many packaged stevia products contain additional additives--such as sucrose or aspartame--to mask this. These additives are often artificial, and (unlike pure stevia) can have negative effect on your blood sugar.Be sure to read all labels on your stevia products, and seek out products that contain pure refined stevia.

, Stevia can have a licorice-y aftertaste, which some find bitter. Rather than using stevia that contains artificial additives (intended to mask the taste), you can add a small squirt of agave nectar (which has a low glycemic index), lemon juice, or lime juice to help mask this bitterness."

Purchase and install a walk-in cooling unit.,
Purchase an industrial freezer.,
Purchase a refrigerated line station and supplemental refrigeration units.",How to Set Up a Commercial Kitchen1," A walk-in cooling unit is a cold storage room designed to maintain the standard refrigeration temperature of 28 to 40 degrees (-2 to 4 ℃). Although some small food service operations may not require a walk-in cooler, the majority of commercial operations will. Walk-in coolers can be custom built to fit any location. Speak to several HVAC contractors and refrigeration specialists to get the best bid.;
, Commercial kitchen operations typically require freezer space. Commercial freezer units are usually categorized by the number of doors. Purchase a single, double or triple-door freezer, depending on the size and scope of your food service operation.

, Adequate refrigeration is a necessity in the commercial kitchen. Food service workers need to keep prepared foods cool prior to preparation and service. A refrigerated line station will be required for the majority of commercial operations.

Use stevia leaves to sweeten tea.,
Create dry leaf powder.,
Make stevia syrup.",How to Use Stevia2," If you have access to a fresh stevia plant (or if you have grown your own), you can use fresh stevia leaves as a sweetener. This helps you to eliminate the presence of additives and save money. To sweeten a cup of hot tea, simply remove 1-4 small leaves from your plant and place them in hot water with your tea bag. Remove the leaves after several minutes.Although it has been used around the world for thousands of years, unrefined stevia leaf has not been approved as a food additive by the FDA. Before using stevia leaf in your food or drink, it is best to consult your doctor.

, You have two options for drying your stevia leaves. You can either pluck 8 or more leaves from your plant and place them between 2 paper towels, or simply remove an entire stevia stalk and hang it upside down. In either case, leave your stevia leaves in a cool, dry place for a few days. Then grind the dry leaves using a mortar and pestle.Use this green powder to sweeten drinks, breakfast cereal, or curries.
1 teaspoon of this stevia powder is equal to approximately 10 teaspoons of sugar.
This pure form of stevia will have a licorice-y or slightly bitter aftertaste.

, Once you have stevia dry leaf powder, you can use this to make a stevia syrup. Boil 2 cups of distilled water and add 1 teaspoon of dry leaf powder. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the water is the consistency of syrup. Use a cheesecloth to strain out the powder.Store your stevia syrup in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.
Use this syrup in cold drinks, fruit salads, or sauces.
Remember that this sweetener will be more potent.

Reinvent the sauce.",How to Use Leftovers," The sooner you refrigerate or freeze your leftovers, the long they'll last and the safer they'll be.


As a general rule, you should plan on refrigerating your leftovers within two hours after they finish cooking. In particularly hot weather, shorten this amount of time to one hour.If you plan on refrigerating your leftovers, you should allow them to cool down in the refrigerator rather than cooling them at room temperature. On the other hand, if you plan to freeze your leftovers, give them time to cool at room temperature before transferring them to the freezer.;
, Ideally, the food should be stored in shallow plastic containers or freezer-safe plastic bags. Any container you use should also have an airtight lid.


Food cools more rapidly in shallow containers than it can in deep containers, making it safer to consume later.
Air can cause leftovers to spoil more quickly, but the use of an airtight lid or seal will keep food fresher for longer.
Separating the food into smaller containers will also make it safer to reheat since most food should only be reheated once.

, Packing too many containers of food into a small space can prevent cool air from circulating properly and cause the food to spoil faster.Your leftovers should remain at a temperature between 35 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius). It's a good idea to periodically check the inside temperature of your refrigerator to make sure that it runs within this range.

, Most properly refrigerated leftovers will remain safe for two to five days, but any leftover you're suspicious about should be thrown out instead of reused.


Do a ""sniff test"" on all leftover food you plan to use. Open the container and smell the food inside. If the odor is unusual, throw it away.
You should also inspect the food for mold or other visible signs of decay.

, Most meats can be stored in the refrigerator for two to three days.Place the meat in an airtight, food-safe container or bag before refrigerating it. Whole cooked poultry, pork, and beef can be stored for two days, but ground meats usually last for three days.
Most cooked meat can also be frozen. Place the meat in freezer-safe plastic bags, label the bag with the current date, and freeze until ready to use. Poultry and ground meats usually stay safe for three months, but red meat should be used within one month. Cooked fish should not be refrozen.

, Meat can usually be reheated in the microwave, in the oven, or on the stove. You should only reheat meat once, however, and it must be reheated to in internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).


Red meat, poultry, pork, and ground meats usually reheat without a problem no matter which method you use.
Seafood has a tendency to dry out when reheated at high temperatures, however, so it's best to avoid the microwave and use the oven. Use a low temperature and reheat the fish for 15 minutes or so.

, Cooked meat, poultry, and fish can usually be cut into bite-sized pieces and added to stir-fries, casseroles, and similar one-dish meals. These dishes are also a good way to use leftover grains and vegetables.


Hot one-dish meals worth considering include stir-fries, risottos, curries, casseroles, pot pies, and soups.
Alternatively, you can cut up cold meat and toss it into a salad.

, Large portions of leftover meat can be cut into slices or shredded. You can then pile it between two pieces of bread and enjoy it as a sandwich.


This works especially well with leftover roasts, whole turkeys, whole chickens, and meatloaf, but it may also work with smaller portions of meat and poultry.
If standard sandwich bread isn't sturdy enough, you may need to use buns or toasted bread.

, Ground meats and flaked fish can be added to sauces used for pasta and other meals.


Mix the meat into any standard pasta sauce to make it heartier.
Another creative option would be to mix the meat into other gravies and sauces used for vegetables, chili bases, and soup bases.

, Cooked grains, starches, and baked goods should usually be placed in airtight containers and stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.


Even though all leftovers should be kept in airtight containers, it is especially important to keep leftover cake, bread, and other baked goods well-sealed. Consider wrapping bakery in cling wrap before placing it into an airtight bag or container.
Bakery can also be frozen for up to three months.

, Many leftover grains and starches have a tendency to dry out when reheated, especially when done at a high heat.


If you plan on microwaving rice, quinoa, or other grains, sprinkle the grains with water before doing so. The microwave will dry out the extra water you just added before going after the moisture contained in the grains.
When using leftover grains, pasta, and potatoes with a sauce or other liquid, consider mixing the sauce and grain first before reheating it. In most instances, it should be safe to reheat the saucy grain/starch on the stove or in the microwave.

, Cooked cereals can enhance bread doughs and muffin doughs.You can make multigrain breads by grinding down the grains and kneading them evenly into the dough.
Alternatively, you can sprinkle the grains over the bread dough immediately before baking it to create a healthy and crunchy topping.

, Cooked grains, pastas, and potatoes can easily be combined with meats and vegetables to create ""one pot"" or ""one dish"" meals.


Nearly any leftover starch or grain can be mixed into casseroles and soups.
Leftover rice and quinoa can be used as filling for tortillas. Rice can also be fried with various vegetables and enjoyed as ""fried rice,"" and both rice and pasta can be used in stir-fries.

, Leftover bread that's starting to go stale can be toasted and used dry. Just make sure that no mold has started to develop before using it.


Bake leftover bread in the oven at a low temperature, keeping it there just long enough for the bread to become crispy but not burnt.
You can sprinkle the bread with butter and garlic to create makeshift garlic bread, or butter and cinnamon-sugar for a simple snack.
Plain toasted bread can be cut into cubes and used as croutons.

, Baked goods that are dry and beyond saving can be crushed into crumbs or crumbled and reassembled accordingly.


Dry bread can be turned into breadcrumbs, and these crumbs can be used as breading or filler for fresh meat dishes.
Crumbled cake can be mixed with buttercream to create cake pops. Similarly, crumbled bread can be used for bread pudding or French toast casseroles.

, Most cooked vegetables and fruits can be stored in the refrigerator for four to five days.


Even if a particular vegetable or fruit was stored at room temperature before you cooked it, you should store leftovers in the refrigerator after they've been cooked.
Most cooked produce tends to get soggy when frozen and thawed, so refrigerator your produce leftovers will be a better option.

, Most leftover produce can be reused either chilled or warmed. The best option will depend upon the specific way you reuse it.


Fruit tends to be delicate, so most fruits will fall apart once they're reheated.
Vegetables are much easier to reheat. The microwave is the easiest option, but you can also reheat them in the oven or on the stove.

, Use a vegetable masher or blender to liquify your leftover vegetables, then use the end product to enhance other liquid-based dishes.


Blended vegetables can be added to soup stock, chip dip, hummus, or chili.
Blended fruits can be added to fruit-based sauces and smoothies.

, Consider adding your leftover vegetables to warm and cold one-dish meals.


Warm dishes include casseroles, stir-fries, soups, pizza, and omelets. Since the vegetables have already been cooked, add them to the dish during the last few minutes of cooking so that they can be reheated without becoming soggy.
You can also add many cold vegetables to salads.

, Fruit-based leftovers can be used to enhance otherwise simple desserts.


For instance, you can gently reheat the fruit and spread it over pound cake or ice cream.
Some fruits can also be added directly to the batter of cakes, muffins, cookies, breads, or other baked goods prior to baking.

, All leftover sauces should be stored in shallow, airtight containers and kept in the refrigerator. Homemade sauces should usually be used within two or three days.


If the sauce contains meat or came into contact with meat, it is especially important to use it within the two to three day time limit.
Commercially prepared sauces should be kept according to label instructions. In most cases, you'll need to use the sauce within one to two weeks after opening the container. Any commercial sauce actually used as part of another dish should be treated as a homemade sauce and used within three to four days.

, Most sauces can be reheated on the stove or in your microwave. Make sure that the sauce is reheated thoroughly either way.


Stir the sauce to distribute the heat evenly. If you don't do this, some parts may remain cold while others could become too hot.
Also note that some sauces are easier to reheat than others. Sauces and gravies thickened with cornstarch or flour may become lumpy when reheated in the microwave, so when possible, consider reheating these sauces on the stove.

, Sauces and gravies contain a range of ingredients, so mixing them into another dish can add a lot of flavor.


Consider mixing the sauce into other liquid-based dishes, like soups and chilies.
You can also add the sauce to otherwise dry ingredients. For instance, leftover gravy can be treated as a condiment for sandwiches. Leftover sauces can be tossed with plain rice or pasta for a simple side dish.

, If you're feeling bold, mix together two separate sauces to create something entirely new. You can then add this new sauce to foods in the same way you'd use the old sauces.


Experiment with different combinations that seem appealing to you. You might blend together a cheese-based sauce with a tomato-based sauce, or try blending together a cream sauce with a hot sauce.
When you do experiment, you may want to taste-test the newly created sauce before adding it to other food, just in case you're not satisfied with the results.

, Another way to transform an old sauce into something new would be to enhance it with new seasonings or ingredients.


Stick with ingredients that coordinate well with the flavor profile as the original sauce. You could try adding red pepper or chopped chili peppers to a bland meat sauce, for instance, but you may not want to add a poultry seasoning blend to a sauce containing ground beef or chili powder.

Consider your budget.,
Begin planning your buffet table in advance.,
Choose a spot with plenty of space.,
Arrange the room for the best flow.,
Plan a separate table for beverages.,
Plan traffic flow.,
Think about the difficulties you’ve experienced with past buffets.,
Have a nice presentation.,
Place the plates at the start of the line.,
Put silverware at the end of the table.,
Make labels.,
Provide a balanced meal.,
Plan the food according to the season.,
Choose six to eight items.,
Line up the food according to temperature.,
Arrange the food strategically.,
Add decorations.",How to Set Up a Buffet," Decide how much you want to spend altogether, including food, silverware, plates, and drinks. Reduce the amount you want to spend by 15%. Try to spend 85% percent of the full amount. The extra 15% allows you some extra money for unexpected costs and things like taxes, tips, and potential emergencies.Keep track of what you’re spending by keeping all of the receipts spent on the buffet together.;
, This is so that you are not making last minute decisions and preparations. Gather all of your serving dishes together the night before the event and place them on the table. Attach sticky notes to remind you which food goes in which dish., Choose a room with a lot of potential open space. Ten square feet is an ideal amount of room to fit all guests comfortably with room for getting food and mingling. Eight square feet allows for some seating, seven and a half square feet can be comfortable for smaller crowds, and six square feet should be the minimum amount of room that you designate for the buffet.It is also a choice to have seating in an entirely separate room.

, Begin with clearing the room you plan to use for your event. Make sure all clutter and excess furniture and/or decorations are put away. Place the serving table in the middle of the room. This allows guests access to the food from both sides of the buffet table and will keep the line moving quickly.


An eight-foot table will hold enough food for twenty to thirty people. You will need to put multiple tables together if you are having more people than that over.

, By situating the beverage table away from the food table, you give your guests a chance to choose their food and put the plates down before pouring a drink. This minimizes the potential for spills. This is another way to ensure that your guests can maneuver the lines with ease., Designate an entrance and exit to the buffet. You can do this by simply letting people know as they walk up to the table, or by making a sign for each end of the table. Leave plenty of space in front of and on the sides of the table, just in case people decide to pause for a moment. This reduces the chance of crowding.Keep the types of food as separated as possible. For example, keep dessert far from the first course of the meal.

, Consider what was annoying or difficult the last time you went to a buffet. Perhaps you needed to set your plate down for a moment, but didn’t have enough room. Leave enough extra space on the table for people to set things down momentarily. This will prevent spills and accidents. Think about what you would have liked during a buffet and plan your table around that idea.Leave toothpicks or little spoons next to the dishes for your guests to have the option of trying food before putting it on their plates.

, Think about what type of plates, cups, utensils, containers, and tablecloth you would like to use for your table. You don’t have to use your fine china, but a table is more appetizing if the set up looks nice. It’s okay to use plastic silverware, plates, and cups, as long as it is all new and clean. Don’t put your food out in greasy, cardboard boxes. Instead, use plastic or metal containers. You will also need a tablecloth. An expensive tablecloth will potentially get ruined by the mess, but look for one that adds cheer to the table.Decide on a color or a theme when putting out everything on the table. This will bring the look of the table together and make the meal look more appealing.

, Your guests can’t access the food well without first having plates available. If you are planning an event with a lot of people, it is a good idea to set up a buffet with two or three stacks of plates of about ten plates each. You don't, however, want to pile the plates too high, or they will be in danger of tipping over.Put condiments near the type of food they belong with.

, Finish the table with the utensils and napkins. A common mistake made by many hosts when planning an event is to place utensils and napkins at the front of the table. It can be cumbersome to try to hold on to knives, forks, spoons and linens along with a plate while your guests are trying to serve themselves.Make sure you put out all types of silverware that will be needed. For example, don’t forget spoons if there will be soup.

, Prepare labels for each dish ahead of time. This can be on small pieces of paper, sticky notes, or cardboard. Put the labels next to each dish once all of the food is out on the table. This will allow guests to know what the dish is before they put it on their plate, which helps eliminate a lot of uneaten and thrown away food.Make sure the labels are written in bold, large, and clear writing that all guests will be able to read with ease.

, Plan a meal with a salad, protein, vegetable, starch, carbohydrate and dessert, unless you are throwing a cocktail party. Buffet meals can feel scattered and uneven. Sometimes there are too many appetizers, side dishes, or main plates. Planning a balanced meal will help you avoid this problem. If you are having a cocktail party, it is okay to only serve a variety of appetizers and desserts.You can rarely go wrong by including a vegetable and fruit tray.
Make sure to put out a vegetarian option.

, The type of food we eat for meals often changes with the seasons. During summer, it feels tiring to eat a heavy meal filled with potatoes and meats. While during the winter, a light salad and lean fish may feel too light.Fruits that contain a lot of water are great for summer buffets, like watermelon.
Rich foods, like cheesy mash potatoes, are good for winter meals.

, You don’t want to have too few or too many items to choose from. Too few items can leave some guests without food or choice if they don’t like everything you’ve served. Too many choices may cause a more convoluted line with too much leftover food. Six to eight items is a good amount to give every one enough choices. The serving size depends on the amount of people you are expecting.You can send out a list of ideas for dishes and ask for feedback a week or two before the buffet.

, The first stop on the food line should be the hot foods. You want the guests to get to these first before they cool down too much. This way, your guests won't be dining on cold main courses when they find their seats. The cold foods should be at the end of the table. If possible, it is best to choose room temperature.Put out chafing dishes to keep foods hot, and ice platters to keep food cold.

, Put the cheapest and the food you have the most of at the beginning of the table. Put the most expensive and scarce food at the end of the table. It is a good idea to set it up this way because the food at the beginning of the table typically goes the fastest.Consider switching foods during the course of the buffet. If the carrots aren’t being eaten enough, switch them out with a food that is going fast.

, Once the table is set up, add decorations to amp up the appeal of the table. Don’t choose anything that will get in the way or block people. Large candles on candlesticks may not be a good idea, but placing small ribbons or bows around the table won’t get in the way of anyone reaching for food.If you’re having a buffet for a holiday, choose decorations that correspond with that holiday. Saint Patrick’s Day decorations could be green, white, and gold. A Fourth of July buffet can be decked out in red, white, and blue.

, You can do this by, if the item is small enough, putting it under your armpit, and walking nonchalantly to your room. If your parents or somebody else is awake and you walk by them, don't walk funny. That might give it away. If it's a bigger item, hold it in purse or jacket, or whatever you have that's available, so that you or anyone else are able to see the item.

, Do not simply toss them in an innocent cardboard box. This doesn't work, and if you leave the box open, you're done for.

, If you're going to stay up for a while, don't eat it very fast. You want to make it last.

If you plan ahead, you will leave yourself plenty of time to cook every course. When creating your menu, choose one or two items that will be prepared fresh and cook the others in advance.


Soups, pasta sauces, gravies, and bread can be cooked and stored the day before before the meal.
Choose recipes that use different cooking equipment. For example, if all of your recipes are made in the oven, you may run out of time to cook everything.;
, This will give you lots of time to prepare the food without feeling rushed when your guests arrive.The way you set your table will depend on how many courses you planned. For example:


Set down a placemat and a charger plate at every chair. The charger plate will stay in place until the dessert course is served.
Place the dessert utensils horizontally above the charger plate.
Set the utensils in the order they will be used. Silverware that will be used first goes on the outside, and those that will be used last are next to the plate.
Goblets and wine glasses are set near the top-right corner of the placemat.
Desserts plates and coffee cups are usually brought in after the other courses are finished., Cold dishes such as salads or gazpachos can be covered in plastic wrap and stored in your refrigerator. Warm dishes can be covered with foil and placed in the oven to stay warm. Make sure your oven is set to the lowest temperature.Most ovens have a “warm” setting. This setting will keep your food warm without burning it.

, Catering a full meal can be expensive. However, if you hire someone else to cook, clean, and serve the meal, you will be able to enjoy your evening with your guests instead of slaving in the kitchen.If you can’t afford to hire full service catering, ask local catering companies if they have service-only packages. You will cook the food but waiters will come to your house and serve the meal.

, A full course meal can have anywhere from three to twenty courses. However, most modern hosts and hostesses limit themselves to six courses.If you do too many, you might not have time to prepare everything properly or spend time with your guests. Remember that each course will require its own plate or bowl and silverware. Make sure you have enough of each to serve your courses.


A three-course meal usually has an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.
A four course meal might include a soup, an appetizer, a main course, and dessert.
A five course meal can include a soup, an appetizer, a salad, a main course, and a dessert.
A six course meal usually includes an amuse-bouche, a soup, an appetizer, a salad, a main course, and a dessert.
A seven course meal includes an amuse-bouche, a soup, an appetizer, a salad, a main course, a dessert, and a mignardise with coffee or tea.

, This course is usually presented before the soup or appetizer and is served on small appetizer plates. These dishes consist of one or two savory bites of food that can give a hint of flavors to come.Popular amuse-bouche dishes include:


Creamy deviled eggs


Herb-infused cream cheese spread onto a slice of toasted crostini
Slices of roasted peaches on small wedges of creamy brie, This course is usually served before the appetizer or in place of an appetizer. This dish is served in a small soup bowl and eaten with a rounded soup spoon. Your soup choice may vary by season. For example:


In the summer, consider serving a cold gazpacho soup.

In the winter, serve a warm, creamy lobster bisque.


, This course is referred to as the entrée in many parts of Europe as it introduces the main courses in a meal. These dishes are usually served on small appetizer plates and feature small cuts of meat, seasonal vegetables, starches, and sauces.For example:


Serve a few pieces of fried ravioli with a side of marinara sauce.
Bake button mushrooms stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning.
Give your guests a few miniature crab cakes with tartar sauce., In some parts of Europe, the salad course is served after the main course. However, it is becoming more and more common to serve the salad first.Salad courses usually feature seasonal vegetables with a flavorful dressing. Common choices include:


Fresh, simple garden salads with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a tart vinaigrette
Tangy Greek salads with olives, lettuce, red onions, and feta cheese
A sweet and sour Southeast Asian papaya salad


, The main course is served on a dinner plate. This course is usually a combination of baked, fried, or roasted protein with a seasonal vegetable side dish and bread.If you serve bread, make sure to provide a bread dish and butter knife in the top-left corner of the placemat. Main courses include:


Hearty pasta dishes topped with chicken, fish, or veal cutlets
A thick slice of tender roast with potatoes, carrots, and onions

Grilled pork tenderloin medallions with a side of creamed spinach


, The dessert course is served on a small appetizer plate with a dedicated dessert spoon or fork. This course usually consists of a slice of cake, pie, or other sweet dish and a glass of dessert wine. However, some people prefer to serve cheese and crackers instead of dessert.For example:


Make a cheese board with a variety of soft and hard cheeses, such as brie, gouda, and blue cheese. Serve the cheese board with warm, toasted crackers.Serve a small slice of velvety chocolate cake and a glass of sweet port wine.
Give your guests a tart, sweet lemon bar and a glass of dry white wine.

, A mignardise is a tiny, bite-sized dessert that is served with tea or coffee.This course signifies the end of the meal. Common mignardises include:


Small decorated squares of cake, called Petit Fours
Miniature buttery madeleine biscuits

Bite-sized French macarons


, Once all of the guests are finished eating, gather up the dirty dishes, leaving the charger and any unused silverware.Serve the next course immediately by placing the prepared dish directly onto the charger.


Plan for a little bit of prep time in the kitchen between courses to arrange the food on the plates.
The charger stays on the table until dessert is served.

, When serving a full course meal, most hosts or hostesses provide goblets of water and a glass of wine. If you have room, consider serving drinks family-style by placing pitchers of water and bottles of wine on the table, allowing the guests to serve themselves. This will save you time and let you relax during each course.


If you don’t want pitchers or wine bottles on the table, you will need to refill guests’ glasses yourself.
If you have hired wait staff, they will refill the guests’ drinks for you.

, Once the dessert course is ready, clear away any bread plates, main course plates, silverware, and the charger. Leave the dessert silverware at the top of the placemat on the table.This will give your guests room to stretch out while they enjoy dessert and digest their meal.


Some people also like to offer dessert wine, port, brandy, or scotch during this course.

Examine what you’ve been eating.,
Consider ingredients or food you’ve always wanted to try (but were afraid to).,
Remove the “ho hum” from typical salads, sandwiches and soups.,
Create lunches the night/week beforehand so you can grab and go.",How to Spice Up Lunches at Home," Find that you feel exhausted and in need of a nap after lunch or do your lunches leave you wanting, needing something else?


Identify foods that you love and make you feel good. Have that “go to” food you like to eat for lunch but find that it’s become a little too ordinary? You can still have your turkey (or spinach or lentils) for lunch but kick it up a notch. List everything you love to eat for lunch in order to enhance the menu.
Eliminate any food that make you feel sluggish or possibly interfere with your day. Perhaps you love a heavy pasta dish, but you find that it makes you want to nap after eating it.
Make a list of staple lunches that you can’t live without. Perhaps you love certain dishes just the way they are. Make a list of those special lunches you would love to devour at least once a week so you don't forget to incorporate them into your culinary repertoire.;
, Whether you’ve been thinking about using a little turmeric in your lentils or thought that having salmon in the afternoon might be a good idea, now is the time to try those offbeat ingredients/foods to spice up lunchtime.


Search recipes that blend your usual foods with the new ingredient. However only consider recipes that can be assembled and prepared within 15 minutes or less. If you work from home, you won’t want to spend your time cooking when you could be eating and/or working.
Investigate how the food/ingredient is typically prepared. If the new food requires a lot of prep-work, you may want to investigate ways to prepare the food the evening before or if possible, purchase it already prepared.

, Enhancing the typical lunch is easy and may only mean that you substitute one ingredient for another. Try different approaches and seasonings to design the ideal lunch.


Ditch plain old lettuce and create salads using canned black beans, olive oil, defrosted corn and quinoa.
Gazpacho soup can be made ahead of time and chilled for quick and easy access. In addition to its tangy goodness, gazpacho soup is packed with low calorie, highly potent nutrients which include garlic, red pepper, tomato and onion.
Wrap up your sandwiches. Reduce calories by using a low calorie wrap bread or lettuce leaves to engulf your sandwich. Instead of plain old PB&J, consider shrimp salad, pre-prepared hummus and taboleh or fresh sliced turkey and Swiss.

, You may not have time to cook but crave something home cooked mid day. You can have your cooked lunch and eat it too with a little planning a few days ahead of time.


Cook on Sunday and freeze lunches for the week. You can have a gourmet lunch ready for consumption in minutes with a little planning ahead of time.
Make large quantities of one dish for easy access. A large pasta salad or even several grilled chicken breasts to top a spinach salad can help.
Design theme lunches. Mexican on Wednesday and Middle Eastern on Thursday. Don’t forget about having fun with food and celebrate other cultures by exploring different types of spices and sauces.

If desired, apply the mop every 45 minutes evenly across the ribs.








,
When the meat in the center of the ribs is white and the juices run clear, not pink, the cooking is done.








",How to Cook BBQ Ribs," barbecue ribs essentially come in two varieties. Spare ribs are fattier and take longer to cook. Baby back ribs are leaner and cook faster.






;
, The rub is a spice mixture that you rub on the rib rack to give it flavor. A typical rub for a 2 lb rack of ribs might consist of:









1 tablespoon (5 ml) cumin
1 tablespoon (15 ml) paprika
1 tablespoon (15 ml) garlic powder
1 tablespoon (15 ml) onion powder
1 tablespoon (15 ml) chili powder
1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown sugar
2 tablespoons (30 ml) kosher salt
1 teaspoon (5 ml) cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon (5 ml) black pepper
1 teaspoon (5 ml) white pepper

, A mop or baste is the liquid sauce that you coat the ribs with to keep them juicy and flavorful while they are cooking. Some people prefer dry ribs, without a mop.








, Ribs will usually come with a large membrane on the back, non-meat side of the rack. Most people trim the membrane and discard it because it is hard to chew and prevents the rub from covering the entire rack. Coat the ribs evenly with olive oil or vegetable oil (optional). Apply the rub generously onto the meat so that the front and back of the rack are completely covered.








, For baby back ribs, cook at the same temperature for 3-4 hours. Place the ribs on the grill so that they are not directly over the heat source.

, Place them on a surface that can be easily disinfected. Choose plastic or a large platter over a wood cutting board.








, Pick up the membrane and remove it slowly. Place it in the trash can when you are finished.








, Mix the rub in advance of using it on the meat and place it in a bowl. With most recipes, you will wait to apply barbecue sauce until after the ribs have been cooked.









You may choose to use a simple dusting of salt and pepper. This will bring the flavor of the meat out, but it will not take on the traditional barbecue flavors.
You can also choose to create a traditional barbecue rub containing 1 tbsp. (8.1g) of chili powder, 2 tbsp. (13.8g) of smoked paprika, 2 tbsp. (23.6g) of brown sugar, 2 tsp. (6.2g) of garlic powder and 1/2 to 1 tsp. (3 to 6g) of salt and pepper. You can adjust the amounts of each according to your preferences.

, Make sure to rub it evenly on both sides.








,









For a richer flavor, place the spiced ribs on a cookie sheet and cover them in plastic wrap. Place the tray of ribs in the refrigerator overnight.

, The cooking method will differ slightly based on the use of a charcoal grill or a gas grill. Charcoal grills give the meat a smoky flavor, but they take longer to cook.









If you are using a charcoal grill, light the charcoal on 1 side of the pit or barbecue. Let it smolder for at least 30 minutes before starting to cook the ribs. You will want to cook the ribs over indirect heat. Place a drip pan underneath the area where the ribs will cook. Fill it with several inches of water. Place the ribs on the side of the grill that is opposite the charcoal. Cook them for 1.5 to 2 hours, with the meatiest portion downward. Turn the ribs occasionally.
If you are using a gas grill, you can ignite one side of the grill and leave the other to cook the ribs. Place the ribs on the side that is not ignited. Grill the ribs for 30 to 45 minutes on each side.
If your ribs are too large to cook indirectly on either a charcoal or gas grill, wrap them in heavy duty aluminum foil. Place them on the grill over direct heat for 30 minutes on each side for a gas grill and 30 to 45 minutes each side for a charcoal grill. Remove them from the foil packets and place them directly on the grate for approximately 5 to 10 minutes on each side.
You can soak wood chips in water and place them on the charcoal, if you want the meat to take on a hickory, or similar, flavor.

,, Allow the ribs to rest for 10 minutes.

Place the fountain in a large plastic bag.,
Disassemble and clean the fountain.",How to Use a Chocolate Fountain," Use warm soapy water to get rid of any dirt or dust that the parts may have accumulated while in the box. Allow the parts to air-dry.;
, The fountain you purchase will come with instructions on how to do this for your specific model. For any model, the tube should stand straight from the base. If your auger tube has multiple parts, you will first need to lock these together to create a longer tube.Some parts may already be assembled depending on the brand of fountain that you buy.

, Slide the largest tier down the auger first, locking it into place, then slide the second-largest tier, and so forth.


Slide your tiers face-down so that they don't trap and hold your chocolate as it runs down the fountain.
Some fountains will already come with the tiers attached to the auger tube.

, The auger looks like a corkscrew and is what drives the chocolate up the fountain. Slide the auger down the center of the auger tube and twist it clockwise into the base until you feel a light resistance - this means your auger is locked and ready to use.

, The crown secures the auger from the top end and is the finishing touch on your fountain.

, Plug it into the electricity and run the machine without chocolate to ensure that you’ve got a fully functioning fountain. Don’t turn on the heat.

, You can use any sort of chocolate in your fountain. However, a couverture chocolate, which is of higher quality and contains 32-39% cocoa butter, can taste better and look silkier when running in the fountain.If you decide to use any other sort of chocolate, add 1 cup of vegetable or canola oil per 5 pounds (2.3kg) of chocolate to soften the texture., Melt the chocolate either in a microwave (for at least three minutes) or with a double-boiler. After the chocolate has melted, place it in tubs inside a plastic or Styrofoam cooler so as to insulate it from the outside and keep it warm and liquid.Melt the chocolate only a couple of hours before your event so that it will remain warm and liquid.

, You can now turn your chocolate fountain on. The chocolate will travel up the central column and run down the sides into the base of the fountain. Once it’s in the basin, it will be pulled up the central column once more and the cycle will repeat.Follow the instructions in the manual that came with your fountain to know just how much chocolate you should be pouring.

, Chocolate fountains tend to be the main attraction at any snack bar, so place the fountain in the middle of the table for the best effect. The table should be sturdy and close to a wall with an electrical plug.


Tape the electrical cord to the ground so your guests won’t trip over it.
Place the table far away from the dance floor or from any areas with swinging doors or air conditioning ducts. If possible, refrain from using your fountain outdoors. You want your chocolate to stay warm and for the fountain not to tip over., Dipping food in a chocolate fountain can get messy fast! Chocolate will drip and splash. Prevent any incidents by placing a tablecloth on your table. Choose a tablecloth in a dark color so that chocolate drips don’t show.

, Snacks that go well with melted chocolate include pretzels, cut-up pieces of pound cake, and meringues.


Make sure your snacks are in bite-size pieces so it’s easier for guests to dip their servings in the chocolate.

, Bananas, strawberries, dried apricot, maraschino cherries, grapes, and pineapple are all perfect accompaniments to dip in your chocolate fountain.You can also serve more exotic fruits such as star fruit, dragon fruit, or coconut chunks. These also pair well with melted chocolate.
Dry your washed fruit so that the chocolate will adhere more easily.

, You should plan to have enough skewers and plates for each of your guests. Place these near the snacks and fruit so that people can help themselves in a clean, germ-free way.


Place a small garbage can near the table so that guests can throw away their dirty places and used skewers.

, Poke a snack or a piece of fruit with a skewer or toothpick and bring it up to the fountain. Place the food under the running chocolate, covering just the food and not the toothpick or skewer. Rotate the skewer or toothpick so that your entire snack or piece of fruit gets covered in chocolate. Enjoy!


The chocolate will drip from the snack or fruit, so place a plate under the dipped item to keep your clothes from getting spots!

, Food can fall into the chocolate basin, where the chocolate is heated, and jam your fountain. If this happens, turn off and unplug the fountain immediately, retrieve the snack or piece of fruit, and plug the fountain back in.Ask for a volunteer to “guard” the fountain. This person can ask people not to double-dip their snacks as well as turn the fountain off if they notice that an item has fallen into the basin., You can do this with a simple washcloth or with paper towels. Pour excess chocolate into the garbage can.


If your chocolate cools, it will harden, making the task of cleaning the fountain an arduous one. If the chocolate has hardened, turn the heating element on to re-melt the chocolate. Use a hair dryer to hurry the melting by aiming the warm air to the tiers and auger tube., Double-bag the fountain, if possible. The fountain will still have chocolate inside, so carry it home this way to avoid a mess.

, If the fountain has dishwasher-proof pieces, remove these, clean them in warm soapy water, and place them in the dishwasher. Scrub any pieces you cannot wash in the dishwasher with a soft sponge and soapy water.The motor and the pump should never be placed in the dishwasher. These are electrical hazards.Check your owner's manual for specific instructions on how to most efficiently wash your chocolate fountain.

Redirect yourself.,
Find a pet or a loved one.,
Remind yourself of reasons to avoid chocolate.,
Make resisting temptation a game.,
Reward yourself.",How to Resist Chocolate1," Treat your brain’s craving for chocolate like you would treat a toddler who keeps demanding ice cream. Instead of putting effort into battling your urge, find something else to do instead.


Being active will help your brain move on. Try taking a walk, or if you’re at work and can’t leave the building, even walking up and down stairs can reset your thinking.
Talk to friends. Start texting or messaging someone online. Typing will keep your hands – and your brain – occupied, making it hard to give in and eat that chocolate.;
, Giving and getting hugs also makes you feel better. Instead of the dopamine rush you get from chocolate, hugging can give you a rush of oxycotin, which also makes you feel better without the regret of chocolate., Chocolate is high in fat, high in calories, and high in sugar. It tastes good when you give into it, but it won’t feel good in the long run. Treat yourself right. Your health will thank you if you avoid it.Chocolate does actually make you feel better – it gives you a rush of dopamine. But that good feeling only lasts three minutes., See how long you can go. Wait five minutes. Then up the time to ten minutes. Postpone the urge, and if it’s not out of hunger, you might find that it dissipates the longer you wait, or you may get busy doing something else and forget about the urge altogether.


Each time you give in and eat it, your brain will make stronger connections telling you that you should have it. The more you resist that temptation, the weaker that connection becomes., You may have gotten used to making chocolate your treat after a long day at work or a difficult experience, but think of other things that make you feel better. Why not take a bath, get a new book at the library, or play a video game? You can change your rewards based on how you feel, or you may find one that works perfectly for you every time.

Don’t shop when your resistance is low.,
Hide it.,
Chew gum.,
Tell people.",How to Resist Chocolate2," You probably know not to shop when you’re hungry. You also shouldn’t shop when you’re depressed or stressed. Your ability to resist comfort food like chocolate will be lower when you’re emotional.


If you have to go to the grocery store when you think you might not be to resist the chocolate-buying urge, avoid the candy aisle and the bakery.

, You might have a family that isn’t willing to give up chocolate, or you may need it in your house for another reason. When you can’t get rid of it, make it easier to eat something else instead. Don’t keep chocolate accessible. If you need to have it nearby, hide it away, freeze it, or do whatever makes it more of an effort for you to get to it. The harder you have to work, the more you’ll consider if you need it.

, Sometimes mint can help you get over the urge for chocolate. Chewing can also make you feel like you’re eating something.

, It’s hard to get support from friends and family if they don’t know what’s going on. Let them help you instead of damage your resolve. It may take some reminders to get them to remember that you’re avoiding it, but once they catch on, they should support you.


You might say that you’ve decided to stop eating chocolate, and give them the reason why. “I’m giving up chocolate to help with my weight loss” or “to reduce the sugar I eat” or even “because it’s Lent.”

Plan ahead.,
Opt for a healthy dessert.,
Eat carob.,
Try some dark chocolate.,
Load up your refrigerator with fruits or vegetables.,
Indulge on special occasions.",How to Resist Chocolate3," If you have any get-togethers with friends or family that include desserts, offer to bring something that isn’t chocolate-based to share. When you’re going out to eat, check the menu ahead of time. Planning out what you’ll eat can keep you from giving in at the last minute.

, Chocolate is a standard go-to for desserts, but that doesn’t mean you have to do without dessert. Instead, think of dessert options that are healthier, or at least ones that don’t have chocolate in them. You might choose to opt for a cheese plate, or if you need something sweet, go for a fruit sorbet.

, Carob doesn’t have quite the same crave-appeal as chocolate, but it does still have a creamy taste and the look of chocolate. It’s made from carob tree pods, and can be used as a natural sweetener. Many health food stores and even aisles in the grocery stores have carob snacks and treats., Dark chocolate can be good for you, in small doses. There is evidence that it can help you avoid strokes and might even improve your skin. You will want to limit the amount you eat, but if you need to give in, a small piece of dark chocolate is a good option., Having healthy food easily accessible will make it easier to fill up on it. You can choose items that are easy to eat without preparation, such as baby carrots, grapes, or apples, or you can buy more prep-intensive items, like pineapple. For the more prep-intensive fruits and veggies, prepare them as soon as you get them home so that you won’t have to do anything but grab a bowl from the refrigerator.

, You might find it impossible to remove all chocolate from your life, but that’s okay. Moderation is key. Special occasions are a chance to give in a bit. Just limit your intake – if you get chocolates for a holiday, like Valentine’s Day, find other people that aren’t avoiding chocolate. Keep a few pieces for yourself, but give the rest to them. They’ll probably thank you, and you can feel good about passing it along instead of giving in to your urge.

Decide between chips, chunks, and logs.,

Add a water pan.,
Work with dry wood only.,
Add your wood.,
Let the wood burn until it produces smoke.,
Cook your meat at the proper temperature.,
Avoid lifting the lid.,
Check the meat for a smoke ring.,
Make sure the meat is at a safe temperature.",How to Mesquite Grill," Grilling wood is generally sold as chips, chunks, and logs. Pick an appropriate wood type depending on the type of grilling you're doing and the size of your grill.Chips have a relatively short burn time, so only use them as a last resort if other sources of mesquite are not available.
Chunks are fist-size pieces of wood and work well for those in the city with smaller grills. They last a lot longer than chips, although they take longer to ignite.
Logs are full pieces of wood. If you have a barbecue pit, logs can work for you. However, logs are more suited for things like campfire and chunks can work just as well for grilling in a barbecue pit.;
, If you can't find wood sources other than chips, chips require soaking with water before use. This can help chips burn for longer. Before using your chips, soak them in a covered bath of water for 30 minutes before use., A smoker box is a device that holds the wood chips while you grill. It holds the chips on top of the top of the grill gates so they can ignite and smoke. If you don't have a smoker box, purchase one at a department store or online before attempting to grill with wood.If you're using a charcoal grill, a smoker box is not necessary.

, A water pan is a small tinfoil bowl that helps create a moist environment for smoking that helps meat cook.To use a water pan, fill the pan with hot water. Set it either under your meat or over your fire when you start grilling., Unless you're using chips, your wood should be dry before you begin the burning process. Wood that you purchased should be dry prior to grilling. However, if you have freshly cut mesquite, it will take more energy to burn.As fresh cut wood can take over a year to dry, it's best to work with store bought wood for mesquite grilling., To start the burning process, you will have to add the wood to the grill. Get the coals burning and then place your wood directly on top of the coals.If you're using an electric grill, set your wood in the smoker box placed over the grill gates.

, Do not add the meat right away. In order to capture the mesquite's flavor, let it burn. Wait until the flames have diminished and the wood is producing a steady stream of smoke.With chips, the wood will burn out and produce smoke almost immediately. However, with chunks, the process can take up to five minutes.

, Place your meat on the grill and then cover your grill. As the meat cooks, monitor the temperature by placing a meat thermometer on top of your grill. Your meat should cook between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (about 107 to 121 degrees Celsius).If the grill becomes too warm or too hot, adjust as necessary. For a grill that's too warm, close the vents. This will reduce the oxygen level and then reduce the temperature. For a grill that's too cold, open the vents to increase oxygen flow.

, For the most part, simply let your meat grill. As you near the end of cooking time, which varies depending on the type of meat you're cooking, it's okay to peek to make sure the meat's not burning. However, as long as the temperature is stable and the meat is in the beginning or middle of cooking, leave the lid on. Lifting the lid too often can can cause the coals to burn out too quickly. , Once your meat is done cooking, look for a smoke ring. The smoke ring is a light layer of pink just underneath the surface of the meat. This does not indicate the meat is not cooked through. It occurs due to a chemical reaction between the smoke and meat and is a sign your meat has barbecued properly., After removing your meat from the grill, use a meat thermometer to make sure your meat is cooked through. Meat that is not hot enough should be cooked longer to avoid the risk of foodborne illnesses.Meats like beef, veal, and lamb should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (about 63 degrees Celsius).
Poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (about 74 degrees Fahrenheit).
Pork and ham should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (about 63 degrees Celsius).
Fin fish should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (about 63 degrees Celsius) and shellfish should be cooked until the shells open.

White Chocolate. White chocolate is made with different ingredients than regular chocolate. It is made from the white pulp inside of a Cocoa Bean called Cocoa Butter. Some think it has more of a sweeter taste, and isn't as strong as regular chocolate. Go to a local grocery store and read the ingredients carefully! White chocolate is a bit more expensive than regular chocolate, because there is less pulp in a Cocoa Bean, therefore the price must be raised. The replacement is usually sugar, corn syrup, chocolate flavoring etc. Eat white chocolate properly by taking small pieces and slowly chew, enjoying the sensual flavor of a genuine white chocolate bar.

Milk Chocolate is your standard chocolate, used to coat candy-bars and for use as chocolate chips. However, if you look, it is available in a variety of formulations, from mixes so soft and sweet they are practically white chocolate, to vintages that might be called a dark chocolate by some.

Mexican Chocolate does not taste like normal chocolate. It's very hard, and has more of a spicy-sweet taste. It is parted into thick, round ""disks,"" a gourmet term for the specially shaped chocolate. To cut Mexican Chocolate, take a sharp knife and start at the middle, sawing back and forth until the piece is cut. The pieces should be cut into triangles.

German Chocolate. German Chocolate is a type of dark chocolate, but it's sweeter than your typical bitter-sweet dark chocolate. It was created by Sam German, which is a reason why people get it mixed up as a chocolate from the country Germany. You can find in a popular cake called German Chocolate Cake. Top it on your favorite ice cream for an extra sweet delight!

Dark Chocolate. Set apart by it's high cocoa (and thus low sugar and fat) content, dark chocolate is not very sweet - indeed, sometimes bitter - but it exhibits the flavor and complexity of the beans very powerfully. Eat it slowly, and in small portions; not only does it take a while to properly melt on the palate, it is very rich and filling. There is some evidence that, in small amounts, the antioxidants in dark chocolate may outweigh the damage wrought by the sugar and fat .

Cocoa Bean Nibs are minimally processed cocoa beans; they have simply been fermented and hulled, not ground or mixed with other ingredients.

Unusual Flavored Chocolates. There are all sorts of flavors just waiting for you to try! Rose petals, lavender, margarita flavoring, and so much more is now available in different chocolates! You'd be surprised how many tastes good!

Chocolate Syrup is used for a variety of things. Milk, ice cream, recipes of all kinds! Serve it as an enhancer, not a replacement.

Enjoy.",How to Smoke Ribs," Food safety is important when cooking raw meat, so find a fresh pink rack of ribs at your local grocery store. Many people choose to smoke with St. Louis style (spare) ribs, which come from near the belly on the pig.They are substantial and tasty — very easy to cook. If you like, you can also select baby-back ribs, which come from the back side, near the loin.


Since baby back ribs are a little less substantial, they're harder to smoke while still keeping them juicy and tender. Adjust this recipe if you do decide to use baby back ribs; the cooking time will lower significantly.;
, With a fingernail or a knife, work your way under the light membrane on the back of the ribs. Grab a hold of the loosened membrane with a paper towel and pry it from the ribs. Much of it should come off in one fell swoop. Discard.

, With a sharp knife, remove any excess fat that's still clinging to your ribs. Although a little fat is fine and will probably render off during the cooking process, eating a chewy hunk of fat when you're expecting a tender morsel of meat is not the most pleasant experience. A little bit of extra preparation during this step will make the eating experience a lot nicer in the end.

, A dry rub is a spice mix that coats the rack of ribs and provides complementary flavor to the meat's natural taste. Dry rubs can be made any number of ways (dehydration, spice-mixing, etc.) and using any number of recipes.Explore different recipes and variations to suit your own tastes, or use this very basic dry rubas a springboard for your own invention:


1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup paprika
3 tablespoons black pepper
3 tablespoons coarse salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoon celery seeds
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Don't be stingy with your dry rub. Even if you're planning on smothering your ribs with a wet sauce later on in the cooking process, it helps to have the ribs nice and coated early on in the process, when the bulk of the cooking happens. Use 1-2 tablespoons of dry rub at least per pound of meat.

, After applying the rub, let the meat start to soak up some of the delicious spices you've acquainted it with. (Meat, meet spice; spice, meet meat.) This does two things in particular:


It allows the dry rub to start penetrating the meat, permeating it with flavor.
It allows for a juicier rack of ribs. When salt hits meat, it brings moisture out to the surface. If you apply your rub and cook right away, the moisture brought out to the surface will leave your precious pork. If you apply your rub and let the meat rest, however, the moisture journeys back into the meat through a process called osmosis.This process produces consistently juicier meat.

, If you have a smoker, heat it to about 225° F (107° C) along the cooking surface, and validate it with a standard cooking thermometer. It may be hotter in the core of the fire, but ensure that the surface is set as close to 225° as possible.


To get your fire going, you may use charcoal and any sort of a variety of wood. Some people prefer different types of wood for different types of flavor, so find what works for you.

, Use a gas grill set on 225° F as your improvised smoker. First, set a pan of water 3/4 full underneath the grate on which you'll be cooking your ribs. This helps with cooking and helps keep the temperature down.Next, make a smoker pouch by wrapping wood chips in aluminum foil and then puncturing the foil several times with a knife to let the smoke escape. Place this at the bottom of the grill but not directly underneath the ribs.


Remember to soak your wood chips for at least 30 minutes prior to creating your smoker pouch. Wet chips will release their signature smoke better and longer than dried-out chips.
Choose from any number of wood chips for smoking. Choose from among applewood, cedar, hickory, maple, mesquite, oak, pecan, and many more., It normally takes about 6 hours to fully smoke a rack of ribs, so if you want to just smoke them, leave them in there for about 6 hours, giving them a liquid spray (apple juice, beer, even water) about every hour. Otherwise, this is only the first step of the process. During these first 3 hours, what you're really trying to do is imbue your meat with some smoky flavor and get the cooking process started.

, You can use any store-bough barbecue sauce you'd like, or you can decide to make your own. Whatever you decide, slather the barbecue sauce onto the meat-side of your ribs generously.

, Many people choose to add beer to their ribs — flavorful beer, not light or watery beer — but if you don't want to use beer, you can also add a bit of apple juice instead.


Seal up the ribs and the accompanying liquid as airtight as possible while still leaving room for the meat to breathe. Ideally, you don't want moisture leaking out of your aluminum foil enclosure, so make sure it's wrapped securely.

, This part of the cooking process begins to break down the collagen present in the ribs, leaving you with ribs that are fall-off-the-bone delicious.

, Check on the ribs after 30 minutes, though they may need longer. (Remember though, you can always cook meat longer, but you can't take doneness away.) This final stint in the oven will firm your ribs up and should leave them ready to be devoured.

, Enjoy your ribs next to some corn on the cob and coleslaw for a heart dish that screams summer.

Separate the pump housing - Most pumps have either a large metal clamp ring or a series of nuts and bolts the hold the pump housing to the motor plate.,
Expose the Impeller - Remove the screws from the impeller cover (diffuser).Remove the impeller cover (diffuser).,
At this stage it is very important to inspect the impeller for damage since you have the pool pump open.,
An impeller can show signs of heat damage and be melted or the leading edge of the impeller fins could be pock marked if the impeller has been exposed to cavitation.,
Remove the Impeller - You will need to stop the motor shaft from turning while you rotate the impeller counter-clockwise to remove it.,
Remove the seal plate - Remove the (seal plate) from the motor to gain access to the motor shaft.,
Remove the old seal assembly - Using a pair of channel-locks, pull off the old pump spring seal from the motor shaft.,
Clean and prepare to replace the seal - Lightly wipe off the motor shaft and the seal plate.,
Install the new seal assembly - Note: NEVER touch the FACE of the ceramic with anything metallic or greasy, because you could destroy the integrity of the pump seal.,
Replace the Impeller - Using the Vice grip method mentioned previously, hold the motor shaft to prevent rotation, and then screw on the impeller.,
Replace the Diffuser - Now realign the diffuser, and tighten the screws.,
Re assemble the pump and motor - Inspect and lube the large seal plate o-ring for cracks or damage.",How to Replace a Swimming Pool Pump Seal," Using a socket or crescent wrench, remove the nut that is securing clamp together or loosen and remove the series of nuts and bolts. Some banded pumps have a hand knob instead of a nut holding the clamp together. Slide back the half of the pump assembly with the motor attached. Try to place the pump on a suitable work surface. Note: You can either leave the electrical conduit intact while doing this procedure or if you require more space you can disconnect the wires form the motor. Be sure the POWER IS OFF and note the wiring so you reattach the wires the same way!;
, Be sure not to lose any of the screws!








, The impeller is one of the more likely pump components to develop wear or damage and inspection at this stage can save you the headache of needing to open and repair the pump a second time in the future.

, Replace the impeller if it shows any signs of damage.








, The use of vice grips to hold the shaft is never recommended. Instead, remove the cap from the center of the motor on the end opposite the shaft, and use a screwdriver or open-end wrench to prevent the shaft from turning. Unscrew and remove the impeller.








, Usually there will be 4 bolts that hold the seal plate to the motor. You will need to remove the impeller before you can remove the seal plate.








, Inside the center of the seal plate is the ceramic part of the pump seal. Be careful not to damage the plastic of the seal plate. You can also push it out from behind instead, using a screwdriver knock out the old ceramic seal. Note: Be sure the rubber ring seat is removed with the ceramic portion also.








, Inspect the seal plate for damage, cracks, melted or out of round will cause the pump to leak even with a new seal. Carefully inspect the impeller for cracks or breaks.

, Press the ceramic part of the seal into the seal plate... using clean fingers to get it seated. (The rubber part towards the seal plate, the white ceramic facing away from the motor.)Slide the spring seal part over the motor shaft. Push it past the threads.( Black carbon face of the spring side needs to make contact with the white ceramic side).Do NOT LUBRICATE this seal with anything besides water! If you do, then it could end up slipping against the impeller, and eventually overheat, destroying the seal.








, HAND TIGHT. The rotation of the pump motor will keep it tight.








, Ensure that the impeller does not touch or interfere with the diffuser, by rotating it with you finger.








, If it's flattened or stretched out, it may need to be replaced. Be sure the clamp is 'around' the outside rim on both sides of the seal plate and the pump housing. This can be a little tricky to get aligned. Tighten the retaining band with a wrench or socket, or if your pump has a knob, use your hand to tighten it. If you pump uses nuts and blots reassemble and tighten.

Prepare yourself for the experience.,
Familiarize yourself with your tools.,
Use a napkin to take hold of your escargot, if necessary.,
Pull the meat free of the shell.,
Dip your escargot in the sauce provided.,
Pair your escargot with a white wine.",How to Eat Escargot1," If you are the type that is somewhat squeamish about eating exotic foods, it may help to remind yourself that escargot has long been considered a delicacy. Each snail is prepared according to specific, time tested methods. Edible snails are generally:


Raised on a rich diet of clean, nutritious food, like cereals, fruits, and leaves.
Purified before preparation through several days of fasting.
Fed with flour post-fast to enrich flavor.
Prepared for consumption.;
, When the escargot is served, especially if it is served as an appetizer, you should receive a plate, snail tongs, and snail forks. The plate your escargot will be served on should have several indentations, in which the escargot are placed after cooking.

, In the event that you are not provided snail tongs, as is the case at some restaurants, you should grasp the escargot by its shell with a napkin.Then hold the shell over your plate and prepare to extract the meat.

, Now that you've grasped your escargot with either your snail tongs or your napkin, you should take your snail fork and insert it into the mouth of the shell. You should be able to see a small piece of meat inside the shell.Pierce the meat with your fork and pull or twist firmly until you feel the it come loose. Then you should pull the meat from the shell.

, Some restaurants may have deeper escargot trays and may have liberally doused the tray with sauce instead of providing you with a separate sauce dish. With the meat still on your fork, dip it into the sauce provided.As you eat your escargot, note the similar texture it has to other mollusks, such as clams and mussels.
Different from sea-dwelling mollusks, snails lack a briny flavor, which allows the herbs and spices used in its preparation to shine through.

, Most traditional butter and garlic preparations of escargot pair best with white wines.Crisp wines with mineral accents are good options. Some wines recommended by experts include:


Sauvignon Blanc
Riesling
Chardonnay (unoaked recommended)"

Have a broad perspective.,
Search for the right restaurant.,
Inquire about your prospective escargot dish.,
Order your new variety of escargot.,
Emphasize taste with a suitable wine.,
Sample provided sauces.",How to Eat Escargot2," You may think that eating snails is strange, you may think of eating snails as highbrow, whichever case, people have been eating snails since the prehistoric era.Over the years and cultures, methods besides the traditional drawn butter, indented plate preparation have come into existence.


The people of Ghana frequently use young snails in sauces. Larger, fully matured snails are used in soups and for kebabs.
Nigerian escargot is oftentimes made into a kind of pepper soup., If you're ready to move onto a new and possibly more delicious method of snail preparation, you may have to do some research. While snail eating globally is fairly common, you may have to visit a fancy restaurant in your hometown to find the new preparation of escargot that you seek.

, Not all species of snail are edible, though this isn't something you should have to worry about if dining at an upscale restaurant. Some species of snail, however, are more suitable for certain dishes or have an uncommon flavor profile. You might ask your server about:


Why the escargot dish is seasoned the way it is.
What the natural flavor profile of the escargot snail is.
Where the snail originates and how it is eaten in its home country.
If there are suitable wine pairings that would go well with the dish.

, Some differences will seem slight or may even be unnoticeable to a novice escargot eater. You might have different species of snail to choose from, each of which may have unique flavors, like spicy escargot, or special features, such as above average size. You might also try:


Escargot prepared on kebab
Escargot sauces
Escargot soups
Grilled escargot
Fried escargot, The subtle flavors in wine often compliment some kinds of food, and escargot is no different.Keep in mind that the wine most suitable for your particular escargot dish will not only depend on how it is prepared but also your personal palette. Some wines recommended by experts include:


Pinot noir
Sauvignon Blanc
Riesling
Chardonnay (unoaked recommended), The chef who created your escargot dish probably did so while paying careful attention to texture and flavor. The sauces provided with your dish are likely intended to bring out these various aspects, creating a more nuanced culinary experience.

Review the rules of the barbecue cook-off.,
Learn about the backgrounds of the cook-off judges.,
Participate in Internet discussion groups about barbecue.,
Obtain items as required for the barbecue cook-off.,
Use meat that is high in quality.,
Develop a unique flavor for your barbecue.,
Develop a sauce or glaze that is not extremely messy.,
Display your barbecue in an appetizing and clean manner.,
Keep your food warm or hot.",How to Win a Barbecue Cook Off," To qualify for winning the cook-off, you must follow and adhere to all the contest rules. For example, if the rules prohibit you from using lighter fluid on the coals within your grill, start the grill using newspaper and matches instead.


Obtain a copy of the rules by consulting with the panel of judges for the cook-off or by visiting the website for the cook-off.;
, This practice may help you determine the flavors of and cooking methods for preparation of your meat. For example, if you are participating in a cook-off in the city of Memphis, but your judges are from Kansas City, they may prefer sweeter Kansas City-style flavors as opposed to Memphis-style flavors rich in vinegar.


Read the short summaries or biographies about the panel of judges in your cook-off rules, brochure, or from the cook-off website.
Introduce yourself to the judges far in advance before the cook-off, if possible, to determine the background and experience of each judge.

, Engaging in forums and discussions about barbecue may give you new, additional tips and ideas for unique and flavorful barbecue dishes.


Perform an Internet search using keywords such as ""barbecue forums"" or ""barbecue discussions"" to locate online barbecue communities.

, Depending on the competition rules, you may be required to purchase a fire extinguisher or sanitation supplies for your booth at the cook-off.

, High-quality meat is considered to be fresh and either all-natural or organic, and in most cases may taste better than pre-packaged meat found in many grocery stores.


Consult with farmers in your local area or region who can provide you with fresh meat, or order high-quality meat from farmers in other regions.
Visit grocers who specialize in all-natural or organic products to purchase your meat for the barbecue.

, Barbecue cook-offs often judge participants on their ability to produce a new, unique barbecue flavor.


Try combinations of different sauces, dry spices, and cooking methods to develop a unique flavor based on the rules of your cook-off. For example, if the cook-off allows you to use either cherry wood or hickory wood in your grill, experiment using both types of wood to determine which produces the better flavor.

, Most cook-off judges prefer barbecue dishes in which the sauce does not retain a watery or runny consistency.


Create a glaze that sticks to the meat without dripping or add small amounts of honey, or dehydrated honey, to your flavor in order to decrease your chances of a mess.

, Judges will rank your food according to how appetizing the dish appears, and may also inspect the area in which you are preparing your barbecue for cleanliness.


Use paper towels to wipe up sauce spills from counters and sauce streaks from the edges and sides of boxes or containers.
If you place toothpicks in your meat, use neutral, wood colors instead of colored toothpicks. The dye on colored toothpicks may transfer onto the meat when the toothpick is pulled out.

, Warm or hot barbecue may taste better to the judges and give the impression that the food is fresh; whereas cold food may give the impression that the prepared food is less fresh.


Cook the meat shortly before the judges' taste test or use a chafing dish to keep the barbecue warm after cooking.

Fillet and de-bone whole fish before eating it.,
Eat fish fillets and steaks with a fork and knife.,
Don't eat the shell, vein, tail, or head on shrimp or prawns.,
Eat crab and lobster directly from the shell with a fork.,
Use a fork or shell to pull the flesh away from clams and mussels.",How to Eat Fish1," If the fish is being served whole, you'll want to cut the head off first, just behind the gills. Next, hold the body with your fork, and use your knife to the belly open, starting at the head and ending at the tail. Pull open the body, and remove the backbone. You can do this by placing the tip of your knife under the spine, then lifting it out with your fork.If you can't remove the bones, simply eat around them. Don't flip the fish over to eat the flesh from the other side of the bones. This is bad etiquette. Instead, use your fork to lift the bone up and pull the flesh away.;
, Most fish fillets will be de-boned, but you will still want to be careful. If you bite into a bone, simply pull it out of your mouth with your fingers, and set it down onto the side of your plate.


Some people like to eat the skin of their fish. Other people like to peel it away first using a fork and knife.

, If you ordered pasta, likely the shrimp and prawns will already come peeled and deveined. If you ordered them as a dish, they may come whole. In this case, you'll need to the pull off the head and tail, then the shell. Be sure to pull out the black thread along the back and discard it before eating the shrimp or prawn.To eat a peeled and headless prawn or shrimp: grip it by the tail, bite the body off, and discard the tail.
When peeling shrimp, it is easiest to start from the underside of the body, where the legs are.

, Crack the claws and legs with special cracker, then pull meat out with fork or pick.Some restaurants will also offer to serve the meat already extracted from the shell for you.

, When eating a bowl of clams or mussels, see if you can find an intact shell, then use it to grip and pull the fleshy bits from the shells. You can also use a fork instead, if you'd like."

For something classic, pair fish and seafood with pasta or spaghetti.,
For something easy, pair fish, especially fried fish, with potatoes.You can also pair fish fried in breadcrumbs with fries/chips for a typical ""fish and chips"" pairing.

,
For something refreshing or simple, pair fish and seafood with salads or steamed vegetables.,
Try fish with brown rice or quinoa for extra fiber.,
Pair lean, flaky fish with zesty, refreshing white wines.,
Pair medium-textured flakey fish with medium-bodied white wines.,
Pair firm, meaty fish with rich, flavorful white wines, and some red and rosé wines.,
Pair salty, strongly flavored fish with mostly red wines.",How to Eat Fish2," Seafood, such as shrimp or scallops, go especially well with spaghetti. Tuna goes well with alfredo sauce and pasta.

,, Caesar salad goes well with pasta and shrimp or scallops, and bean salad is great when paired with tilapia. Steamed vegetables are also an excellent choice. You don't have to worry about adding any fancy sauces or oils.A little bit of seasoning, such as salt and pepper, will be plenty.

, Quinoa is full of fiber, iron, magnesium, phosphorous, potassium, and vitamin B. It goes well with just about any type of fish. Brown rice is an excellent source of fiber, and goes well with salmon, especially miso-glazed salmon., Delicate fish, such as sea bass, flounder, sole, and tilapia, need a delicate white wine for balance. Consider white wines from the South of France, Greece, or Portugal. Lean, flaky will also go well with wines like Champagne, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, and Sauvignon Blanc., Consider wines that are rich in aromas, or aged in oak. Fish like trout, catfish, cod, and halibut go well with wines like Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Pinot Gris., Fish like salmon, mackerel, mahi mahi, shark, swordfish, or tuna have a firm texture, almost like steak. They go best with rich wines, such as: Chardonnay, Dry Rosé, Sauvignon Vert, and vintage Champagne. They also go well with Pinot, such as White Pinot Noir and Pinot d’Alsace., Fish like anchovies, sardine, herring, and mackerel need a strong wine, but will also go well with Champagne. Consider any of the following wines: Champagne, Dry Rosé, Pinot Noir, and any Greek red wines."

Eat sushi with a pair of chopsticks.,
Always dip nigiri sushi fish-side-down into the soy sauce.,
Consider serving a bowl of Miso soup before the sushi.,
Be mindful of the pickled ginger and wasabi.,
Save the sake for before or after the meal.,
Enjoy sushi with a cup of green tea.",How to Eat Fish3," You can eat it at sushi bars, or you can prepare it yourself. If you choose to prepare it yourself, make sure that you buy sushi-grade raw fish, as the standard fish sold at the super market may not be fresh or flavorful enough.

, You can eat nigiri sushi with your fingers, but sashimi should only be eaten with chopsticks. Nigiri sushi looks like little pieces of fish served in little bricks made of rice. Sashimi is thin slices of raw fish.


Try to eat nigiri sushi in one bite. This may be more challenging in Western countries, where nigiri is usually made larger.

, Never dip it rice-first into the soy sauce. The rice will soak up too much sauce, and it may fall apart. The last thing you'd want is a bunch of rice grains in your soy sauce.

, Miso soup complements the delicate flavor of sushi well. It is usually drunk straight from the bowl.

, Use pickled ginger as a palate cleanser between bites of sushi; don't eat it all in one bite. Also, don't mix wasabi into the soy sauce. The chef will already have placed what he feels to be the right amount into the sushi before serving it. If you want that extra spice, slip a little bit of wasabi under the sushi with the tip of your chopstick., If you must enjoy your sake with your meal, consider pairing it with sashimi instead of nigiri. Both sake and nigiri are rice-based. Many people feel that this will create a poor balance., It works well with both nigiri and sashimi type sushi."

Use a long, dark-colored hose to fill up your pool.,
Make sure the hose is in direct sunlight.When filling your pool, make sure the hose gets full sun exposure to absorb as much energy as possible.,
Fill the pool slowly with a thin hose.A thinner stream of water will heat more quickly when filling your pool.",How to Use Solar Energy to Heat a Pool1," The longer it takes for water to make its way through the hose and into your pool, the warmer that water will be. While fifty feet of hose is generally sufficient, additional length means the water will have even more time to warm up. The added surface area of the hose collects more heat, as well. If you use a dark-colored hose, the water can get even warmer because dark colors absorb more solar energy.A black rubber hose is ideal and relatively inexpensive. You can also use a black garden irrigation pipe, because it’s thin walls allow for a faster heat transfer. While it is inexpensive, it will also kink easily.
Both of these are available in most home supply stores.;
, Point the hose directly towards the sun or mount your hose on a board that can be angled toward the sun for even more exposure.


You may want to consider mounting the hose on a board and attach it to a sun-facing roof. This is not recommended unless you have a suitable low roof, such a shed, or are skilled at working at roof height.

, Use a hose that is ⅝ or ½ inch in diameter to slowly fill the pool. Try keeping the stream around half an inch in diameter to allow it to take in heat while still filling the pool at a decent rate.


Always fill up your pool on a sunny day to take the most advantage of the sun’s energy.

Test the pool water's pH level with test strips.,
Check the chemical levels one to two times per week.,
Aim for a pH level of 7.4 to 7.8.. Test strips change color when exposed to water.,
Calculate the number of gallons (liters) in your pool.,
Figure out how much soda ash you need.,
Buy the soda ash at a pool store or order it online.,
Leave the pool filter on while you add the soda ash.,
Get a five gallon (19 liter) bucket and fill it with water.,
Measure the soda ash into the bucket of water.,
Pour the soda ash water around the pool.,
Check the pH of the water after one hour.,
Add more soda ash as needed.",How to Raise pH in Pool," Get pH testing strips at your local pool store, big-box store, or order them online. Follow the product’s instructions, which are typically dipping the strip into the water and checking its color against the range listed on the product.Some pH test kits require you to fill a small tube with pool water and add drops which change color based on the pH.;
, Record the pH level in a small notebook to track the change over time. The pH of your pool changes frequently due to many causes. This is why it's important to check often. Write the pH down in a notebook to track it as it changes over time., The color corresponds to the pH level. Match the color to the package and you’ll find the current pH level. The ideal pH level for a pool is between 7.4 and 7.8. Determine how many points you need to raise the pH.

For example, the color of your test strip might show the yellow of a banana. According to your product, this means the pH level is 7.2. You’d want to raise the pH by a minimum of .2 and a maximum of .6.

, If you already know how many gallons (liters) your pool holds, use that number. If you need to figure out the number of gallons (liters), you’ll multiply the volume by a multiplier based on the shape of the pool. Use a measuring tape.For a rectangular pool, the formula is length X width X average depth X 7.5. If your pool has a deep end and a shallow end, measure the depth of each, add them, and divide by two to figure out the average depth.
For a round pool, the formula is diameter X diameter X average depth X 5.9. If part of the pool is deeper, take the shallow depth plus the deeper depth and divide the number by two.
For abnormally shaped pools, adjust these formulas to figure the gallons (liters) in each section, or ask a pool expert for an estimate on how many gallons (liters) your pool holds.

, Use about six ounces (170 g) of soda ash to raise 10,000 gallons (37854 liters) of water by .2 pH points. Start with this figure as a guide, and add more soda ash later if you need to raise the pH by more.For example, you test the pH of the water and it shows 7.2. You want to raise it to 7.6. Your pool holds exactly 10,000 gallons (37854 liters) of water. Use 12 ounces (340 g) of soda ash for the first round.

, Soda ash may be labeled by many different manufacturer names. Look at the ingredients of the product and make sure sodium carbonate is the active ingredient. If you aren’t sure what to buy, ask an employee which products contain soda ash.


If you don’t have a pool store near you, check at a water treatment store, hardware store, or big-box store like Walmart.

, Soda ash works best when it can circulate throughout the pool. To make sure this happens, run the pool filter on its regular circulation setting. If you’ve turned the filter off to clean the pool, turn it back on., You don’t want to throw the soda ash directly into the pool because it won’t mix in evenly enough. Instead, dissolve it into water and spread that into the pool. If you don't have a five gallon bucket, any bucket will work. Mix the soda ash into at least one gallon (3.8 L) of water.

It's important to fill the bucket first and add the soda ash second.

, Measure out the soda ash you need based on the amounts described above. Use a basic kitchen measuring cup or a scale to measure out the amount you need. Pour the soda ash into the bucket of water.Remember, don't put the soda ash into the bucket before the water.

, For in-ground pools, walk around the perimeter, slowly pouring the water from the bucket into the pool. For above ground pools, pour it around the edge of the pool as best you can.

If you want, use an old plastic cup to scoop water out of the bucket and toss a cupful at a time into the pool.

, Give the soda ash time to circulate throughout the pool and alter the pH of the water. After one hour, grab another test strip and dip it into the water. See if the pH is in the range you need it to be.

, You generally don’t want to add more than one pound (454 g) total of soda ash per 10,000 gallons (37854 liters) of water. If you add more than that, the water starts to become cloudy.If the pH isn’t where you want it to be, check it in a day or two and add more soda ash in the quantities you already figured.

Use a solar blanket.Solar blankets are pool covers designed to soak up solar energy and transfer it directly into the water.,
Use solar rings.These clear, inflatable disks float on the surface of your pool and heat the water.,
Mount solar panels on the roof of your home.These panels collect heat from the sun to warm pool water.,
Install a solar heating system.These systems include a solar collector, a filter, a pump and a flow control valve.",How to Use Solar Energy to Heat a Pool2," These covers can help increase water temperature by about 5°F for every 12 hours of coverage.Solar blankets also insulate the surface of your pool, which prevents the heat from escaping. A transparent or nearly transparent solar blanket works best.Just like a regular pool cover, solar blankets also minimize water evaporation, which conserves energy.
They also prevent debris from getting into your pool and minimize the amount of chemicals needed to treat the water., One ring transfers up to 21,000 BTU a day. A ring is generally 59 inches in diameter, so buy enough rings to cover approximately 80% of your pool. Rings will generally last five years and cost up to twenty dollars each. However, considering that they don’t use any electricity, this is a moderate cost.


Another advantage of solar rings is that they are easy to remove and disassemble for winter storage.
Rings can be left on your pool while the cover is being used.

, They are easy to install and quite durable in all climates. You can get glazed or unglazed solar collectors. The unglazed panels are less expensive but also slightly less effective in producing heat.


However, the unglazed versions are efficient as long as you don’t want to use your pool when temperatures are below freezing.If you live in a warm, sunny climate, these panels are an ideal solution.

, Water is pumped through the filter and then through the collector, which heats it before returning it to the pool. They are an excellent solution, but expensive. A solar heating system will cost between $3,000 and $4,000 to buy and install.


The system should last up to seven years.
They are generally more effective than gas and heat pump heaters. They tend last longer, too.

Maintain your pool.The pump and circulation systems must be kept in good condition to get the most out of your solar collectors.,
Watch the water temperature.,
Use a solar blanket whenever the pool isn’t in use.",How to Use Solar Energy to Heat a Pool3," Routinely check to make sure the filter is effectively cleaning debris from your pool. Keep the drain systems clear of debris to allow the water to flow freely and easily. Check the pump frequently to confirm water is circulating properly.


Use pool water test kits to maintain the proper pH and chlorine levels.
When chemicals need to be added, do it as far from the collector intake pipes as possible.

, The correct range for recreational use is 82-84°F and 78-80°F for more active swimming. If your temperatures are far above that, you are probably wasting energy. Buy a pool thermometer to help you monitor the temperature and reduce the pump speed when the water becomes too hot., Evaporation is responsible for the greatest loss of energy in pools. To prevent energy from being lost, keep the solar cover on the pool whenever it isn’t in use. The solar blanket will continue to collect energy from the sun and heat the water, while also preventing the heat from escaping.Pool covers block debris from entering the pool, which will reduce the pool’s cleaning time and chemical consumption.

Determine what type of chlorine you should use.,
Use cyanuric acid with caution.,
If you choose to avoid cyanuric acid, look for calcium hypochlorite (solid) or sodium hypochlorite (liquid).,
Add the chlorine to your swimming pool.,
Never simply dump chlorine tablets or sticks into your swimming pool or place them in the skimmer basket of your swimming pool (though there are certain brands made that only dissolve when water is flowing over them).,
Shock the pool weekly.,
Follow up the next morning with a maintenance dose of algaecide.,
Maintain a proper pH level.,
If pH is high, add a small amount of muriatic acid and retest the water after about 6 hours of continuous filtration, readjusting pH as needed.,
If swimmers are having a problem with ""burning eyes,” high or low pH is probably to blame, not high chlorine.

,
Test the water at least two times per week to ensure balance.,
Put chlorine tablets in a pool floating chlorine feeder.,
Add shock (3 lbs) weekly at night.

,
Test the water again for the pH level.,
Add algaecide the next morning.

,
Test the pool balance twice a week.

,
Adjust the alkalinity first, then the bromine or chlorine, then the pH.

",How to Properly Maintain Swimming Pool Water Chemistry," Chlorine, which kills bacteria, algae, and microorganisms, is available in bottles, 3-inch tablets, 1-inch tablets, sticks, and a granular form; however, upon inspecting the labels, you will see that the active ingredient is exactly the same in all of them. Despite the wide range of prices, the only real difference you may find is the concentration of the active ingredients. The active ingredient in 3-inch tablets, 1-inch tablets, and sticks is called ""Trichlor"" (or Trichloro-S-Triazinetrione), and the active ingredient in granular chlorine is called ""Dichlor"" (or Sodium Dichloro-S-Triazinetrione).


The most common (and therefore the least expensive) form of chlorine is 3-inch tablets, which are slow-dissolving and require less maintenance. Chlorine sticks are larger and dissolve even slower than 3-inch tablets but are not as popular. 1-inch chlorine tablets dissolve more quickly than 3-inch tablets or chlorine sticks and are better suited to above-ground swimming pools, small in-ground swimming pools, and spas. Look for a concentration of 90% Trichloro-S-Triazinetrione in chlorine tablets or sticks.






Note that cheap, ""big box"" slow tabs and sticks tend to have binders and fillers that keep the tablet together. You will notice the difference as they dissolve: cheap tabs and sticks tend to crumble or fall apart within 2 to 3 days as opposed to gradually dissolving and maintaining their shape.






Granular chlorine works just as well as the tablets and sticks mentioned above; however, inorganic chlorine such as calcium hypochlorite must be pre-dissolved in a bucket of water before adding to a swimming pool. It must also be added to the swimming pool almost every day. Other types of organic chlorine (Sodium Dichloro) or inorganic Lithium Hypochlorite do not need pre-dissolving. These allow very precise control over the chlorine level of the swimming pool but require daily testing and addition of the chemical. Look for a concentration of 56% to 62% Sodium Dichloro-S-Triazinetrione in granular chlorine.





;
, Cyanuric acid (CYA, also called isocyanuric acid) is found in dichlor / trichlor tablets. Although cyanuric acid is a stabilizing ingredient in chlorine that prevents it from being destroyed by the sun, http://www.poolmanual.com/manual/cyanuric.html it does so at the cost of reducing the effectiveness (ORP, or oxidation reduction potential) of the chlorine. If you do use cyanuric acid, be sure to test the levels. If the levels are too high, the chlorine will completely lose its sanitizing ability.


Certain new studies are showing that CYA really needs to be maintained at a level no higher than 40 ppm allowing chlorine to perform optimally (high levels of CYA contribute to TDS or Total Dissolved Solids which ""interfere"" with chlorine activity)., You should also make an extra effort to test your pH; these two chemicals contain strong bases and will raise pH if used in sufficient quantity. Using liquid chlorine will also help you continue sanitizing your pool without adding to your Cyanuric Acid levels. Cyanuric Acid = Stabilizer. Stabilized chlorine (tablets and granular) will contain high levels of Cyanuric Acid.

, Floating chlorine feeders and automatic chemical feeders, available from any pool supply distributor, slowly dissolve 1- and 3-inch chlorine tablets or chlorine sticks into your pool water. Automatic chlorine feeders are a great help to properly maintaining your swimming pool. Chemical feeders slowly meter out precise amounts of chlorine into your pool water automatically, and offer very precise control over the amount of chlorine being added to the swimming pool. If a feeder is adjusted properly, you may not have to worry about your chlorine level for a week or more.

, If a chlorine tablet is dissolving in your skimmer basket, all of the water passing through your pool plumbing and circulation system will carry a high level of chlorine. This high concentration of chlorine (which gives the water a very low pH) slowly eats at the inside of the circulation system and can cause premature failure of your pool pump and filter components.

, As it works to clean your pool, chlorine binds to other chemicals like ammonia and nitrogen, which not only render it effectively inactive, but also create an irritant that can cause skin conditions like jock itch. To eliminate combined chlorine, apply an occasional dose of shock treatment.

, Algaecides are surfactants that work on pool surfaces to prevent algae from growing.

, This can be just as important as having chlorine in the pool at all. The pH level in your pool should be about the same as the pH level of human tears, 7.2, though in the range of 7.2 - 7.6 is optimal. Chlorine is about 10 times more effective at sanitizing your water when the pH is at 7.2 rather than at a high ph level of say 8.2. pH can best be measured with a drop-type test kit versus a test strip, which can be easily misread.


Most often you'll find the pH level is high; the best way to lower pH is by slowly pouring ""muriatic acid"" (AKA Hydrochloric acid) directly into the deep end of the pool while the pool pump is on and the water is circulating. However, granular acid (pH minus or decreaser) is safer to use alternative than muriatic acid.







, This will prevent ""bouncing"". If you have a true pH bounce problem, that is typically due to a low total alkalinity issue; once properly adjusted, the pH should maintain itself well over a period of 1 to 3 weeks depending on rain, use, etc.

,, Maintain your pool chlorine (FAC or free available chlorine - the good kind) level at 1-3 ppm at all times and you are guaranteed an easy and low-maintenance swimming season.

,


Test strips will indicate what else is needed.

,, The goal is pH 7.2.

Acquire your smoker.,
Cure your smoker before you use it to cook.,
Buy your wood chips or charcoal.,
Find a safe place to put your smoker outdoors where it will not be a fire or health risk.,
Find a dry rub or marinade recipe for your smoked meat.,
Apply the rub or marinade to your meat.

,
Place the meat in a plastic or glass container.,
Fill your smoker with fuel.,
Insert the wood chips, if you are using them.,
Start your fire.,
Aim for a temperature between 180 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit (82 to 135 degrees Celsius).,
Insert the meat on a rack or on multiple smoking racks.

,
Check on the meat only 1 to 2 times per smoking session.,
Smoke approximately 1 to 1.5 hours for each lb.,
Rotate the meat every 2 to 3 hours.

,
Mop some marinade on the meat each time before you turn it.

,
Check on the meat at least 1 hour before it is scheduled to be done.,
Remove the meat when you have checked it and it looks done.",How to Use a Smoker," Electric, charcoal, gas and water are popular types of smokers that are used with everything from jerky to turkeys.


Electric and gas smokers will generally cook meat slightly faster than the other types.
Assemble your smoker if you have just purchased it. Pay careful attention to the fire box and the air vents. These are essential parts of the smoker, which can result in fire or ruined meat if broken.;
,


You will need to start a fire in the fire box. Get it up to a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) and then turn it down to 225 (107 degrees Celsius) to smoke for several hours. You will remove contaminants and have a layer of seasoning in the smoker.

, Wood chips are generally used with a smoker to create the smoke flavor, and they come in varieties like oak, alder, cherry, hickory and apple.


Make sure the wood you choose is free of any chemicals. This is true of charcoal smoking as well, since the fumes from the chemicals will go directly on your meat. It is a good idea to begin with pre-soaked chips, instead of making your own.

, You will want it to be outside away from strong winds.

, Mix it up a day before you plan to smoke.

,, Store it in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 1 day.
, This can be charcoal, a propane gas tank or simply the electrical plug.

, Make sure that you have more nearby to restock the smoking chamber.


If you are using a gas smoker, you will want to place the chips inside a foil packet. Poke holes in the top of the packet 6 or more times. Place the packet very close to the heat so that it will produce smoke.
If you are using a water smoker, you can place fresh herbs in the water to give the meat extra flavor.

, You will need to ensure air can get around the wood or charcoal, so open up the air vents wide. Then, let it heat for at least 20 to 30 minutes.


While your fire will reach high temperatures of 400 degrees at the beginning, you will want it to cool down to a lower temperature. After 30 minutes, turn the air vents nearly closed to discourage fire and encourage smoldering coals or wood.

, The temperature should be adjusted according to the type of smoker, the type of meat and the size of the meat pieces.


For example, fish should be smoked at a lower heat than beef. A large pork shoulder can use a higher heat than small pieces of beef jerky.
Electric and gas smokers tend to cook hotter, so turn the heat down to a lower setting.

,, You will need to check on the fuel and wood chips to replace them.


Remember that each time you open the smoker, you will let heat escape.

, (0.45kg) of meat.


If you believe your smoker cooks at a hotter temperature, you will want to aim for 1 hour per lb. You can also cook longer at a lower temperature.

,,, It is better to under-cook than overcook, because you can always reinsert the meat into the smoker and cook it more.


Overcooking is common with small off-set home smokers.

, Remember that some woods can give meat a redder color, so it will be harder to tell when it is cooked.

For sinks, tubs, showers, and other basins, fill the basin with 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of water, or enough to submerge the cup of the plunger.For drains that are only partially clogged and still draining slowly, add a bit more water to compensate for what will be lost to drainage.;
, For clogged toilets that are full of water, use a bucket to remove half the water from the bowl. This will give you enough water to create a proper vacuum seal without having so much water that it'll spray and splash everywhere when you plunge.
/images/thumb/2/27/Use-a-Plunger-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-2-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/2/27/Use-a-Plunger-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-2-Version-2.jpg









For toilets that are empty, fill the bowl halfway with water from a nearby tap., Most sinks and bathtubs have overflow holes that allow water to drain out if the basin fills with too much water. Soak a wet rag with water, and wring out the excess. Stuff the rag into the overflow hole to prevent air from getting in.
/images/thumb/d/d0/Use-a-Plunger-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-3-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d0/Use-a-Plunger-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-3-Version-2.jpg









Overflow holes in bathtubs and sinks allow air into the pipes, and this will prevent you from forming a proper vacuum seal with the drain, meaning you won’t be able to plunge out the clog., The plumbing lines in your house are all connected, so air in one pipe can prevent you from forming a proper seal with a clogged drain. To prevent this, stuff wet rags into other nearby sink, tub, and shower drains.
/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-a-Plunger-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-4-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/6/6b/Use-a-Plunger-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-4-Version-3.jpg









For instance, if you have to unclog the toilet in the bathroom, plug the drains in the shower and sink as well. If you have to unclog the sink drain, plug the drain in the shower., There are two styles of plungers, and each one is suitable for different types of drains. The flange plunger has an extra flap attached to the inside of the cup that makes it ideal for toilets. A plain cup plunger doesn’t have this extra rubber flap, and is best for creating seals with drain openings in:Sinks
Bathtubs
Showers

, For sinks, tubs, and showers, place the cup plunger into the bowl or basin so that the cup of the plunger is submerged in the water. For a toilet, pull the flange out from inside the plunger and submerge it in the toilet bowl.
/images/thumb/a/ac/Use-a-Plunger-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-6-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/a/ac/Use-a-Plunger-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-6-Version-3.jpg









The cup on either plunger should be fully or at least mostly covered by water., When you insert the plunger into the water, the cup will likely trap air inside, and this will reduce the pressure created when you plunge. You need lots of force to remove a clog, and air trapped in the cup will stop this from happening. To burp the air from the plunger:Rest the cup on the bottom of the basin or bowl
Tilt the cup to one side
Allow the air bubbles to escape
With the cup tilted, plunge once or twice to push air from the cup

, In a sink or tub, right the plunger so the cup is flush with the bottom of the basin. Position the plunger over the drain hole. In a toilet, insert the flange into the drain opening in the bottom of the toilet. For toilets and basins, hold the plunger vertically.
/images/thumb/a/a0/Use-a-Plunger-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-8-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a0/Use-a-Plunger-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-8-Version-3.jpg









Holding the plunger vertically over the drain opening will ensure that you form a proper seal when you start to plunge., Hold the handle of the plunger with both hands. For the first plunge, gently press straight down on the handle so the cup forms a seal with the drain opening. Pull up on the handle and start plunging by pulling up and pushing down on the handle in a vertical fashion. Don’t tilt or angle the plunger, or you'll break the seal./images/thumb/5/56/Use-a-Plunger-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-9-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/5/56/Use-a-Plunger-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-9-Version-3.jpg









Continue plunging like this for about 20 seconds. As you pull up and down on the handle, the suction will push pressure in and out of the drain and dislodge the clog.

, After 20 seconds of plunging, pull up on the plunger handle and lift it off the drain hole. Some debris might come up from the drain when you release the plunger, and it’s important to remove this from the sink or bowl before it drains back down.
/images/thumb/8/89/Use-a-Plunger-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-10-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/8/89/Use-a-Plunger-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-10-Version-3.jpg









Put on a pair of gloves and pick up the debris. Throw the debris in the garbage.

, Add more water to the basin if necessary. Repeat the burping and sealing steps, and plunge for another 20 seconds.After this time, pull the plunger away. Remove any debris that comes up from the drain.
/images/thumb/b/b1/Use-a-Plunger-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-11-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b1/Use-a-Plunger-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-11-Version-3.jpg









It’s especially important to plunge a toilet twice, because you want to be sure the clog has been removed before you try flushing.

, Once you’ve removed debris from the second plunge, flush the toilet or rinse out the sink, tub, or shower with clean water. The toilet should flush normally, and the sink should drain properly.Stay close so you can turn off the water if the clog hasn’t been removed.


In case water starts backing up in the toilet bowl, shut off the water by turning the valve beside the toilet to the right (clockwise).
For a sink, simply turn off the taps if the water doesn’t drain properly.
Try plunging again if the clog hasn’t been removed. You can also try a drain snake, or call a plumber.

, You should always keep your plungers clean and dry, because moisture and cleaning products can cause the cup to crack or rip. If this happens, you will have to buy a new plunger next time you have a clog.

To clean a cup plunger, fill a bucket with hot water and add some liquid dish detergent. Swish the plunger around in the water. Remove the plunger, rinse it with clean water, and lay it on a rag to dry.
To clean a flange plunger, rinse the plunger in the clean toilet bowl. Flush the toilet. Add a few drops of liquid dish detergent and a capful of chlorine bleach to the water. Swish the plunger around in the water. Remove the plunger, let it drip dry for a minute, and then lay it on a rag to dry with the flange out., Drains are only meant to handle water, so putting food down the drain can lead to clogs. This includes, scraps coffee grounds, grease, bones, and even bread crumbs and rice, which will expand in the drain as they absorb water. All food and scraps should go in the composter, green bin, or garbage.
/images/thumb/c/c2/Use-a-Plunger-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Use-a-Plunger-Step-14-Version-3.jpg

Grease will cool and coat the walls of your pipes, narrowing the passage and causing clogs.
Instead of pouring grease down the drain, transfer it to an old can or milk carton. Let it congeal and then compost it or throw it in the garbage., Similarly, your toilet drains are only meant to handle water, small amounts of paper waste, and some soft organic matter. You should never use your toilets to dispose of any garbage or waste. Not only does this waste water, but it can also lead to clogs. Never flush:Medical supplies like adhesive bandages or gauze
Cotton swabs, balls, or pads
Cosmetics and lotions
Wrappers and packaging
Diapers and wipes

, Every week, remove the stoppers from the drains and pull up any debris that’s caught on the stopper. Throw the debris in the garbage rather than washing it down the sink. For shower drains, pick hair and soap scum from the drain covers. Clean out the inside of all drains every two weeks:

With baking soda: Pour ½ cup (110 g) of baking soda down the drain, followed by enough white vinegar to make the soda foam. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, and then pour 2 quarts (1.9 L) of boiling water down the drain.With enzymes: Run some hot water down the drain to preheat the pipes. Spray five to ten sprays of enzyme cleaner down the drain. Let the cleaner sit overnight. In the morning, run hot water to flush the drains., Mesh screens are a great way to trap food, hair, and other debris before it gets into your drains. You can install these in showers, tubs, and kitchen and bathroom sinks.Clean the screens every one to two days to keep water flowing properly down the drain.

Understand ""chlorine smell"" and stinging eyes.,
Use a pool test kit.,
Remove chlorine sources.,
Uncover outdoor pools.,
Swim while chlorine levels are still at safe levels.,
Replace some of the pool water.,
Test regularly.",How to Lower Chlorine in a Pool1," Many people think that a chemical smell or stinging eyes are signs of chlorine. In fact, these usually show up after chlorine has broken down into other chemicals. The right response is usually to raise chlorine with a shock treatment.Better yet, use a test kit to get an accurate read of the chlorine, as described below.;
, If you haven't already, test the chlorine levels using a test kit from a pool supply store.Make sure the test kit measures both free available chlorine (FAC) and total chlorine.As a general rule, free available chlorine (FAC) should be between 1 and 3 ppm.Total chlorine should be no more than 0.2 ppm higher than FAC. Your local health codes may have different requirements.If your pool also uses ozone or UV disinfection, FAC can be reduced as low as 0.5 ppm., If the chlorine levels are only slightly high (about 4–5ppm), chemicals are usually not necessary. Just stop adding chlorine to the pool, and the problem will likely solve itself.To stop adding chlorine, turn off the chlorinator, chlorine feeder, or salt water chlorine generator; take the chlorine tablet out of the pool skimmer; or remove the chlorine floater. If you are not sure which system the pool uses, ask the manager or owner.

, Ultraviolet light from the sun rapidly breaks down chlorine. A single cloudless afternoon can remove 90% of your pool's chlorine, as long as you have removed all chlorine sources.Ultraviolet lamps are not usually a good replacement for this step. See the UV method below for more information.

, Swimming helps lower chlorine, but only try this if chlorine is at slightly high (4 ppm). Experts disagree on how much chlorine is dangerous to swimmers. Public pools often shut down at 10ppm, while some pools use a 5ppm limit to be extra safe.Do not swim if your pool test had additional unexpected results, such as the wrong pH or alkalinity.
Do not swim if you smell a strong ""chlorine"" smell (and the chlorine test gave high results). This smell is actually from irritating substances called chloramines.Chlorine affects the lungs. It is more dangerous in poorly ventilated areas, and if the swimmers have breathing problems., This is an expensive, slow option, but it will dilute the chlorine. Drain and replace about ⅓ to ½ of the pool. After refilling, your pool may take a long time to return to normal chlorine levels and pH.If you have a filter has a backwash option, this is the fastest way to (partially) drain your pool.

, Repeat the pool test once or twice a day, or every couple hours if the pool is still in use. If chlorine levels do not decrease within a couple days, try one of the methods below.


See Tips below for guidelines on other test results, such as pH or cyanuric acid. If your test results fall outside these guidelines and do not correct themselves soon, you may need to hire a professional.

Sanitize pool equipment and toys.,
Maintain the right chemical balance.,
Brush, vacuum, and filter the pool regularly.",How to Treat Algae in a Swimming Pool," One of the main causes of algae growing in a pool is if the pH of the water gets too high, because this prevents the chlorine from killing the algae. Collect some water from the pool and test the pH levels with a test kit.


To lower the pH, add some muriatic acid or sodium bisulphate. To increase the pH, add sodium carbonate.The ideal pH for pool water is between 7.2 and 7.6.;
, The best way to get rid of green algae is with a combination of shocking and algaecide, which is why it’s so important to balance the pH level of the water first. The intensity of the shock will depend on how much algae there is:For light green algae, double shock the pool by adding 2 pounds (907 g) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water
For dark green algae, triple shock the pool by adding 3 pounds (1.36 kg) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water
For black-green algae, quadruple shock the pool by adding 4 pounds (1.81 kg) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water

, Once you’ve shocked the pool, follow up by adding an algaecide. Make sure the algaecide you use has at least 30 percent of the active ingredient. Follow the manufacturer’s directions to determine how much to add based on the size of your pool. After adding the algaecide, let it sit for about 24 hours.


An ammonia-based algaecide will be cheaper and should work with a basic green algae bloom.
Copper-based algaecides are more expensive, but they're also more effective, especially if you have other types of algae in your pool as well., After 24 hours with algaecide in the pool, the water should be nice and clear again. To make sure you remove all the dead algae from the sides and bottom of the pool, brush the entire surface of the pool.


Brush slowly and thoroughly to ensure you cover every inch of the pool’s surface. This will prevent the algae from blooming again., Once all the algae are dead and have been brushed off the surface of the pool, you can vacuum them out of the water. Be slow and methodical when you vacuum, making sure you remove all the dead algae from the pool.


Set the filter to the waste setting if you're using it to vacuum the pool., Algae can hide in a number of places in your pool, including the filter. To prevent another bloom, clean and backwash the filter to remove any leftover algae. Wash the cartridge to dislodge any algae, and backwash the filter:Turn off the pump and turn the valve to “backwash”
Turn the pump on and run the filter until the water runs clear
Turn the pump off and set it to “rinse”
Run the pump for a minute
Turn the pump off and return the filter to its normal setting
Turn the pump back on

, When the pH of pool water gets too high, it prevents chlorine from being effective, meaning it can't prevent or treat an algae bloom. Add pool water to a test kit and test the pH of the water.


Lower the pH by adding muriatic acid or sodium bisulphate. Increase the pH by adding sodium carbonate.Test the water again after treating it. The ideal pH is between 7.2 and 7.6.

, Black algae especially are very resistant to shocking and algaecide, so you must brush the algae before treating the pool. Brushing breaks up the protective slime layer that grows on the outside of the algae.


Brush the bottom and sides of the pool thoroughly and vigorously to break through the algae’s protective layer., Like green algae, the best course of action to treat mustard and black algae is to add shock and algaecide. Immediately after brushing, triple shock the pool by adding 3 pounds (1.36 kg) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water.


During the shocking and algaecide treatments, leave the pump and filter running all the time., For mustard and black algae, it’s important to use copper-based algaecides. Ammonia-based ones will not be effective against these types of algae. Use an algaecide with at least 30 percent active ingredient, and you may want to go as high as 60 percent.After adding the algaecide, let it sit overnight.

, Continue brushing the entire surface of the pool every day for the next seven days. This will make sure the algae’s protective layer gets penetrated with shock and algaecide, which will ensure the treatment is effective., After three to four days of daily brushing, shock the pool a second time with a regular shock quantity. Add 1 pound (454 g) of shock per 10,000 gallons (37,854 L) of water. This will guarantee the chlorine has enough strength to kill the algae.After shocking the pool again, continue brushing daily for the next three or four days, or until the algae is gone.

, Once the algae are dead, vacuum the pool thoroughly to remove all the dead plant matter. When the pool has been vacuumed and the water is clear, clean the filter. Rinse the cartridge, backwash the filter, and clean the filter with filter cleaner., Algae can actually hide away and grow on things like swim suits and towels. To prevent your clothes from re-infecting the pool, wash all your bathing suits and towels in a washing machine.


When the garments and towels are dry, dry them in the dryer to kill any leftover algae., Wipe down all your toys, floats, and cleaning equipment with a non-bleach disinfectant. This will kill any algae that’s hiding out on these items, and prevent the algae from blooming again. Items to clean include:Vacuum
Brushes
Noodles
Floats
Balls and water sport equipment

, Test and adjust your pool’s levels on a regular basis to maintain the right levels. Chlorine, pH, and alkalinity should be tested twice a week during pool season.The ideal pool pH is between 7.2 and 7.6
The ideal chlorine level is between 1.0 and 2.0 parts per million
The ideal alkalinity is between 80 and 120 parts per million

, A well-maintained pool with good filtration and circulation is much less likely to get algae than one that’s not cleaned regularly, that isn't filtered properly, and that doesn’t have good water circulation.The pump and filter should run between eight and 12 hours a day during pool season.
Brush and vacuum the pool every two days.
Clean and sanitize pool equipment and toys every one to two weeks.

Identify the cutting edge.,
Position the can on a flat, stable surface.,
Open the arms of the can opener.,
Place the cutter on the top of the can.",How to Use a Manual Can Opener1," Generally, the cutter mechanism of the manual can opener features a sharp tip to puncture of the can lid. You may see a curved or hooked point. It usually sits at the apex of the two long ""arms"" that you use to open and close the device. It should be situated alongside the handle, the axle, and the serrated wheel that will bite into the rim of the can lid., Don't hold the can in the air. A stable base provides a force of resistance against the bottom of the can. This will give you added leverage for piercing the can lid. When you hold the can in the air, you also place yourself at a greater risk of cutting yourself or spilling the contents.

, Spread them as wide as they will go. This will allow you to fit the opener against the can in the correct starting position., Make sure that the puncturing point rests on the lip of the can lid. This should align the serrated cutting wheel with the edge of the can. Check that the rotating handle faces the outside of the can.

Balance the pool chemistry.,
Make sure the filter is working properly.,
Scrub the sides and bottom of your swimming pool.,
Treat the pool with pool shock.,
Treat the pool with algaecide when chlorine has fallen below 5.0.,
Prevent pressure buildup in your filter by cleaning it often to remove the dead algae.,
Vacuum up the dead algae left behind in your swimming pool.,
Run the filter until the algae is gone.,
Re-check chemical levels with your swimming pool test kit.",How to Get Rid of Green Water in a Swimming Pool," Use a chemical test kit to test the chlorine and pH levels and determine the extent of the problem. When chlorine levels drop below 1 ppm, it can cause algae to grow in the pool, turning the pool water green. When this happens it is necessary to ""shock"" the water with chemicals to kill the algae and return the pool to normal chlorine levels.


Proper pool maintenance, including having working filters and making sure your pool's chlorine and pH levels remain steady, can prevent algae from growing in the first place.
Algae is constantly growing, so letting your pool sit without maintenance for even a few extra days might create a green pool water situation.;
, Before treating the pool, balance the pH by adding either an acid or a base to bring the level to just around 7.8. This is at the high end of the range you would normally want in your pool, but that's necessary when you're treating it for algae. Here's how to balance the pH:


Turn on your pump so the chemicals will circulate throughout the pool.
Correct the pH level by either increasing the pH with sodium carbonate or decreasing it with sodium bisulfate.

, Clean out any leaves, sticks, and other debris that may be clogging the filter. Backwash the filter if necessary and make sure it is working well before you add chemicals to the pool to kill the algae. Set the filter to run 24 hours per day so it filters out all the algae during the cleaning process.

, Use your pool brush to scrub the pool well before adding any chemicals to the water. Algae clings to pool surfaces, but scrubbing will remove it. Scrubbing also helps to break the algae up, allowing chemicals to work faster.


Scrub especially well in areas where you can see algae buildup. Try to break it all up so that the pool gets thoroughly clean.
If you have a vinyl pool, use a nylon scrub brush. Wire brushes might damage vinyl pools, but may be used on plaster pools safely.

, Pool shock has high levels of chlorine that wipe out the algae and sanitize the pool. Choose a powerful shock with around 70% available chlorine, which is enough to handle tough algae and bacteria. Follow the directions on the shock package to make sure you use the proper amount for the water in your pool.


If you have a high amount of algae in your pool, you may have to treat it more than once to keep the algae from continuing to bloom.
The water might look cloudy or dirty when you add the shock, but as the water runs through the filter it will begin to clean up.

, Allow the algaecide to work in your swimming pool for at least a 24-hour period.

, When algae dies, it will fall to the pool floor or float in the pool water. It will also lose its green color.

, Use your brush to clean the bottom and sides of the pool again, then vacuum up all the dead algae. If there are a lot of dead particles and you're having trouble vacuuming them, you can add a flocculent to help the algae bind together and make it easier to vacuum., Your swimming pool water should be crystal clear after treatment. If the algae seems to be coming back, go through the shocking and treating process again until it's all cleared away.

, All chemical levels should be in the normal range.

Understand the basic function of the engine.,
Become familiar with how compression works.,
Diagnosing problems: If you have a compression problem, the engine won't run (in 99% of cases).",How to Understand Compression and Power Systems in Small Engines," The engine is an air pump. The more air, the more power.;
, The engine has a stroke, which is the travel of the piston up and down the cylinder. The amount of room in that cylinder is described in terms of cubic inches (or centimeters) with the piston at the bottom of the cylinder. For example, a 351 Ford has 350 cubic inches. The compression ratio is a comparison of the volume (with the piston at the bottom) and the space left with the piston at the top of its stroke. Most lawnmowers are low compression engines, with ratios of 8:1 or less. This is why they run well on cheap gas (87 octane).

, The best indicator of low compression is the engine pulling through too easily. If you hit the starter and the engine spins like crazy (unusually fast), you will need to check the compression with a tester. This is a simple air gauge that screws into the spark plug hole and traps the air inside as the piston runs up and down. If you're getting less than 80 psi, you've got a problem. The most common causes are a blown head gasket, or a stuck or bent valve.

There are different types of hammers for different projects, including:



Claw hammer.,
Check the hammer before use.,
Get a firm grip on the handle.,
Hold the hammer at the end of the handle.,
Hit your surface squarely with the hammer.,
Use your whole arm and elbow.,
Place your work against a hard surface.,
Work in a natural position.,
Check before you swing.,
Practice.",How to Use a Hammer Safely," This is suitable for pounding in nails; the claw part is suitable for pulling nails out. This hammer is more commonly used for woodworking and has a “T” shape, with the head on one side and a “claw” on the other side. It is in the house. See image above.

Ball peen hammer (hardened). This is suitable for driving a chisel or a punch. This is more commonly used for metalworking and has no claw. It has a rounded metallic head.

Mallet. This is also often referred to as a rubber hammer. It is a fairly common type of hammer. It is suitable for delicate work as it has a softer head than most hammers.

Upholstery hammer. This is suitable for upholstery projects; one end is usually magnetic to help with tacks used in furniture.
Blocking Hammer"" used for auto body work; not suitable for driving nails;
, Look for firm attachment of the head to the handle. Also check for splinters, loose wrapping, or other defects in the handle. If the hammer has any defects or is wobbly, do not use it. Not only will it require more energy to use but it is an accident waiting to happen.








, This will ensure that you don’t lose your hold on the hammer and have it flying out of your hand.

, Beginners are often more comfortable holding the hammer handle midway. It is more energy efficient to grip the handle firmly at the end, but hold it a bit higher up while you are learning if that feels most comfortable and secure for you. With practice, you will become more proficient at holding the hammer towards the end, affording yourself more leverage.








, Avoid banging a hammer sideways. Hit only with the head of the hammer and do not use the handle or the side of the hammer.








, As well as maintaining a good grip, it is important to rely on the strength of your whole arm and elbow and not just rely on your wrist and hand to pound the hammer with. Most importantly, keep a straight wrist and allow the weight of the hammer itself to do the pounding, not your arm.








, Do not try to do hammering work on carpet or other soft surfaces, since it requires more energy.








, Beginners, children and the less proficient should hammer at waist height for the greatest ease. If you cannot move your work, keep your position as neutral and as natural as you can.








, Keep your workspace clear of other objects and check that nobody is standing behind you or too near you when you use the hammer. You need plenty of space to swing the hammer without catching your arm or the hammer on another person or object.

, Good hammering technique comes from trial and error. You will develop your own technique over time that feels the most comfortable and works best for your projects.

Purchase a chlorine neutralizer from a pool supply store.,
Close the pool.,
Follow safety precautions.,
Calculate how much you need.,
Add the neutralizer in small doses.,
Wait while testing frequently.,
Raise the pH if necessary.",How to Lower Chlorine in a Pool2," Ask an employee for help if you are not sure what to choose. Do not use chemicals from other sources. The chemicals sold at the pool supply store are at a specific concentration intended for pools.


Sodium thiosulfate is probably the most common chlorine neutralizer, but requires care when handling.
Hydrogen peroxide is often the cheapest option, and breaks down into harmless substances. However, this is much less effective if your pool's pH is below 7.0., Never add chemicals to a pool while swimmers are using it. If other people have access to the pool, put up clear warning signs.

, Many pool chemicals can cause injury if they come into contact with lungs, eyes, or skin. Review this safety checklist before you continue:Read the product label carefully for safe handling instructions. Follow all recommendations for safety equipment, and review emergency protocols.
Store pool chemicals in a well-ventilated storage area, away from sunlight, heat, and moisture. Do not store acids and chlorine near each other. Do not store dry chemicals next to or underneath liquids.
Only have one chemical container open at a time. Close the container and return it to storage before opening another.

, Always follow product instructions to determine how to add it to the pool, and how much to use. Many chemicals are available in different forms and in different concentrations, so a general guide cannot cover every option.



Generally, when adding sodium thiosulfate, allow for about 0.5 ounces (15mL) per 1,000 gallons (3,800L) water.If you're treating a public pool, go with a more accurate measurement. 2.6 ounces (77mL) sodium thiosulfate will lower chlorine by 1 ppm in 10,000 gallons (37,900L) of water.A pool store employee or an online pool chlorine lowering calculator can help you with this formula.

, Adding too much of the neutralizer can cause major problems: your chlorine can drop to zero, and the unused neutralizer will remain in the pool to destroy the next batch of chlorine as well. Use ⅓ or ½ as much as you calculated.

, Give the pool time to adjust according to label instructions. Test frequently and do not enter the pool until parameters are back to normal. If your measurements stabilize but chlorine is still too high, add another small dose of neutralizer.


If your circulation system is slower than average, you may have to wait longer for the neutralizer to take effect.

, These chemicals usually lower the pH of the pool. Be prepared to raise the pH once chlorine is back to normal. The pH value should be between 7.2 and 7.8, and ideally as close to 7.5 as you can get."

Understand UV disinfection.,
Try a Medium Pressure UV lamp.,
Consider a Low Pressure UV lamp.,
Evaluate other types.,
Test the pool after installation.",How to Lower Chlorine in a Pool3," Ultraviolet (UV) lamps designed for pools can neutralize most germs. They cannot keep a pool safe on their own. However, they will let you reduce the amount of free available chlorine (FAC) as low as 1ppm, or even lower under some regional laws.They can also break down some of the irritating or dangerous substances that show up in a chlorinated pool. Finally, although not normally used for this purpose, some types may break down existing high levels of chlorine.


Local health codes may have different requirements.

, A ""MP"" UV lamp is a versatile option with the following benefits:


This is the only common lamp that will break down a significant amount of existing chlorine. Even then, you'll need a dose 10–20 times higher than the amount recommended for disinfection. This will probably require multiple lamps.
This is the most effective lamp for breaking down chloramines, the substances usually responsible for stinging eyes, irritated skin, and ""chlorine"" smell.
This lamp is fairly good at disinfecting, but not the best option.

, This type of lamp, often called a purifier, has excellent disinfecting ability, though you will still need to use (reduced) amounts of chlorine.This may make it an attractive option for public pools.


These lamps also tend to be cheaper and longer-lasting than MP lamps.
Advertisements may claim these lamps remove chloramines. This is partially true, but in practice they may or may not reduce the obvious signs, such as stinging eyes.

, There are a few other kinds of UV lamps, although they are less common. Here's some information to help you figure out what each product does:


""Ultraviolet"" actually includes a wide range of light with different effects. It is usually divided into UV-A (315–400nm), UV-B (280–315nm), and UV-C (100–280nm).You should be able to find either the light type or a range of wavelengths (such as 245nm) for any product.
Only UV-C light helps disinfect pools.
Only UV-A light (including UV light from the sun) breaks down significant amounts of chlorine. Even then, it will take an intense amount of light.
All three types help break down chloramines.

, Hiring a professional to install the UV system is recommended. Once installed according to specifications, very little maintenance is required. Continue to test your pool for chlorine as usual, keeping it at 1ppm or another low level as recommended by your product or local law.

Puncture the lid.,
Twist the handle.,
Lift the the lid.",How to Use a Manual Can Opener2," Close the twin handle pieces together to push the point of the can opener into the can lid. Listen for a hissing sound as the cutter pierces the lid and releases pressure from inside the can., Rotate the bar on the outside of the handle to start rolling the serrated wheel around the interior lip of the can lid. As the wheel rolls, it should consistently and evenly slice through the metal. Work your way all the way around the rim of the can lid until it is almost completely severed from the rest of the can.


Generally, the bar rotates clockwise to perform this cut. If you do not see the intended results, try reversing the direction of the bar.

, Use your fingernail or a knife to pry up the severed edge of the lid until you can grip it between your fingers. Carefully pull the lid up and away from the can top. Pour the contents of the can into a bowl or another container – or just eat out of the can! Throughout this process, be very cautious not to cut yourself on the razor-sharp edge of the can or the severed can lid. Pinch the flat top and bottom of the lid, but try not to touch the sides. Watch for tiny shavings of metal while opening that can be harder to notice if they're part of the contents!


Alternately, you can continue to cut until the can lid comes off completely. The lid may sink slightly into the contents of the can, making it somewhat more difficult to remove. Pry it out with a knife or another flat, sturdy object.

"
"
Be prepared to readjust the device.,
Clean the can opener thoroughly before each use.,
Consider other methods.",How to Use a Manual Can Opener3," If you don't apply enough pressure while you're turning the cutting wheel, you might find that the can opener stops biting into the can lid and rolls up along the surface. You'll need to reset the puncturing edge in order to get it going again. Detach the can opener from the can, then reattach it at the last point at which the lid was cut.

, Food residue tends to build up on the parts of the can opener that come in contact with the food inside the can. These small sections, which are mainly located on the cutting edges of the tool, can be breeding grounds for bacteria.

, If you can't get the manual can opener to work, look into other ways of opening a can.You can use an automatic can opener; you can use a knife, with great caution; and you may even be able to pry certain cans open with your fingernail, if you add a bit of rubbing friction.

Clean the nozzle on the head.,
Securely fasten the ""head"" of the torch on the end of the hoses.,
Tighten both valves on the ""head"" that you just secured in the socket.,
Turn on your valves on the tanks.,
Now, this is where a cutting head and a welding head are different.,
For cutting, there is a different head.",How to Set Up an Oxy Acetylene Torch," This should be done with a fine, round metal file. Just make sure that this nozzle hole is unobstructed. If holes are obstructed, a torch tip bore cleaning tool may be necessary.;
, It should thread into a socket where both the Oxygen and Acetylene hoses come together. Usually this joint is brass.

, Make sure these valves are shut completely; otherwise, your gas/air mixtures will be off.

, Acetylene main valve should only be opened 1/2 turn, and the regulator set at 5 to 7 psi (pounds per square inch). (If acetylene is turned up too high, it can become unstable.) For welding, the oxygen should be set between 7 and 10 psi. For cutting, the oxygen should be set between 15 and 25 PSI.

, A welding head is simple, and has two valves located near the base of the head. To use this head:


Turn on the Acetylene valve until you hear a slight hiss of gas from the nozzle.
Take your striker/lighter and light the torch.
This should produce a dark red-orange flame which puts out very putrid black smoke.
Now, slowly turn on the valve that controls your oxygen, until you see the flame change. Careful: too much oxygen and you can ""bleed out"" the flame -- which means the flame will go out. In this event, turn the oxygen off and try again.

The flame should be blue with a white inside tip. The inner, white tip should measure around 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) long.

, You will notice a trigger, and three tubes going up to the nozzle.


First, turn the oxygen that IS released by the trigger, all the way on.
Turn on the Acetylene valve until you hear a slight hiss of gas from the nozzle.
Take your striker/lighter and light the torch.
This should produce a dark red/orange flame, that puts out very putrid black smoke.
Now, slowly turn on the valve that controls your Oxygen (there are two valves for oxygen on a cutting head, one blocked controlled by the trigger, one unrestricted), until you see the flame change. Careful: too much Oxygen and you can ""bleed out"" the flame. Meaning the flame will go out. In this event, turn the Oxygen off and try again.

The flame, when the trigger is NOT compressed, should be a blue flame, measuring about two inches, with about a 1/2"" bluish-yellow inner flame.
When the trigger is compressed, the flame will become much shorter, louder, and faster.
When cutting, always heat the metal up to a nice cherry red, and then press the trigger for oxygen. Caution: Sparks will be thrown, so be aware and safe.

Check the Logo!,
Check the Color!,
Check the Fit & Finish!,
Check the hole pattern!",How to Tell if Your Sharpstone Grinder or Press Is Authentic or Counterfeit," There are a number of things wrong with the counterfeit grinders shown. First, SharpStone no longer uses the ™ symbol on their grinders! All new authentic SharpStone grinders will have a ® symbol, because SharpStone is now a Registered Trademark. However, this rule does not apply on all pollen presses. Standard Pollen Presses will have a ™ symbol, while the T-Shaped Pollen Presses will have a ® symbol. The second problem in the first image is that the logo is white on the counterfeit grinder! SharpStone does NOT use ANY white lettering on their non-clear top grinders. Typically lettering/logos will simply be a lighter shade of the color of the Grinder/Press.;
, Many of the counterfeit SharpStone Grinders are anodized in a color that isn't even produced by SharpStone. The only colors produced with the reeling crank handle are: Black, Silver, Copper, or Light Blue. Other types of SharpStone Grinders and Presses are produced in the following colors: Black, Silver, Copper (Brown), Light Blue (Blue), Grey, Red (Burgundy), Purple, Pewter (Green), or Pink. The colors in parentheses are what the colors are labeled on the brown cardboard box, however most retailers refer to the other color name. If you have a color other than what is listed, you might have a counterfeit product.

, SharpStone Grinders and Presses are high quality products! The teeth should never rub together and you should never see metal shavings in your grinder, these are tell-tale signs of a fake SharpStone®. If you have a reeling handle grinder, then you should expect the handle to be sturdy, it should not wobble.

, Notice how few holes are on the counterfeit grinder. Having so few holes in the counterfeit grinder will cause it to clog often. Many of the holes in the counterfeit grinder are also much too large, allowing very large particles to fall through. This leaves the user of the counterfeit grinder with a chunky, poorly ground blend!

Select and purchase a drafting table.,
Purchase a T-square.,
Purchase a set of pencils or pens.,
Buy a set of drafting triangles.,
Purchase a few other drafting essentials.",How to Purchase Drafting Supplies," The drafting table is the most important part of the drafter's tool kit. Look for a table with a height-adjustable tabletop, and one that allows you to adjust the angle of the work surface. Built-in storage boxes are an option on many tables. Some drafting tables have collapsible legs for transport, but these are not typically as sturdy as their permanent counterparts. As an inexpensive alternative to a full drafting table, you can purchase just a work surface that is designed to be used on top of another table.;
, The T-square is a very important drafting tool, allowing you to create straight horizontal and vertical lines, as well as providing a datum for the use of drafting triangles. Look for a T-square with a blade length that is nearly as long as your table; because the T-square head rests against the edge of the tabletop, a short T-square will not be able to extend far enough into the work surface to be useful. Also, select a T-square with transparent blade edges; this allows you to see your work clearly.

, For drafting, you will need a variety of different pencil weights. Pencils are graded on a scale from ""9H"" (the hardest) to ""9B"" (the blackest), with the grade ""HB"" occupying the middle of the spectrum. Hard pencils (those with an ""H"" designation) create fine, lightweight lines that are perfect for construction lines, while black pencils (those designated with a ""B"") create heavy lines ideal for finishing a drawing. An ideal beginner's set of drafting pencils would include: 4H, 2H, HB, 2B, and 4B leads. Purchase pens only if you plan on inking your drawings after constructing them.


In the United States, a scale is sometimes used that grades pencil weights using a numerical system (whereby a ""#2"" pencil is equal to an ""HB"" pencil). This scale is not likely to used by art or architectural supply stores, however.

, A drafting triangle sits against your T-square and allows you to create straight lines at different angles. Drafting triangles come in a variety of shapes and sizes. To begin with, it is a good idea to purchase 3 triangles: a 45-degree triangle, a 30-60-degree triangle, and an adjustable triangle. If you will be using the triangles as straightedges against which to make cuts, buy aluminum triangles � plastic ones will get nicked by your blade.

, There are several other small items which are very helpful when drafting.


Drafting dots are small adhesive pads that keep your drawing in place as you work.
A cleaning pad (also known as a pounce sock) allows you to cover your drawing in tiny particles that act as ball bearings so that your T-square and triangles do not create smudges.
A drafting brush allows you to manage the amount of pounce on your drawing.
A rotary lead pointer is a specially-designed pencil sharpener that is ideal for drafting pencils.
An architect's or engineer's scale is also essential. This is a straightedge that has different scale markings along the side, allowing you to draw plans and elevations to a certain scale.

Select a wood block.,
Fold the piece of sandpaper over the sanding block.,
Hold the sand block with the edges under your palm.",How to Make a Sanding Block2," You can use a small block of off-cut wood retrieved from the scrap pile, provided it's the right shape. A rectangle is the optimal shape because it's easy to hold and covers a good area when sanding. If needed, cut a piece of ordinary wood into a rectangle of a size suitable to hold in your hand (around 2"" x 4"").;
, Make firm fold line around the block to ensure that the sanding paper sits absolutely flat against the block. Wrap the sanding paper right around as if it were a present, causing the two edges to meet on one side.


Cut the sandpaper to size, as needed. You may not need to, it will depend on how large the sandpaper piece is to begin with.

, The clean, whole surface of the sandpaper is what you use to sand with on the item or surface. Sand away by holding onto the block firmly at the edges and applying pressure either on the whole flat part of the block or its edges (for tight corner work), as required. Replace the sandpaper when it has worn down and is no longer sanding.

Change the sandpaper as needed by pulling it away from the staples and prying out the staples.",How to Make a Sanding Block3," You can use a small block of off-cut wood retrieved from the scrap pile, provided it's the right shape. A rectangle is the optimal shape because it's easy to hold and covers a good area when sanding. If needed, cut a piece of ordinary wood into a rectangle of a size suitable to hold in your hand (around 2"" x 4"").

, Cut a piece of foam to the same size as the block. Glue it to one wide side of the block. When dried, cover in duct tape to keep firmly in place and to provide you with a grip.


Attach the ends of the duct tape to the sides of the wooden block alongside the foam.

, You will need to cut the sandpaper to size.

, Staple on a new piece and start again.

Never use any electrical hand tool that does not carry the Underwriters Laboratories Seal of Approval.,
Older tools with a two-wire design should be immediately upgraded to a three-wire system by qualified personnel.,
Make sure the three-wire system is maintained through all adapters and extension cords.,
Never disconnect or carry power tools by their cords.,
Consider using a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFI).,
Check the switch before plugging in your device.",How to Prevent Electrical Accidents with Hand Tools,"


This seal indicates the tool has undergone extensive testing and has been found to be safe when properly maintained.;
,


If your tool cannot be upgraded, discard it.
Most power tools in use today have a three-wire system. This third wire serves as an emergency ground in the event of an internal short or ground fault.

,


Adapters not properly connected to receptacle boxes make the ground fault wire ineffective.

,


This causes the cord's insulation to rapidly deteriorate.
Inspect tool and extension cords routinely for fraying and other signs of deterioration. Repair or replace immediately.

,


GFIs do not replace traditional protection provided by current isolation, insulation and grounding, but they are a backup if insulation or grounding fails due to age, abuse or mechanical breakdown.
The GFI detects low levels of leaking current and cuts off power quickly at leakages greater than 5 mA.

, Most electrical tools come with a switch to allow for the device to run without holding down the trigger. If this switch is on and the device is plugged in, it will turn on immediately. Pulling the trigger is the usual method of switching these switches off.

File the leading edge with moderate pressure, pushing the file forward and sideways, at a uniform angle.",How to Sharpen a Shovel," You will need steel wool, an emery cloth or a manufactured rust remover in order to prep the shovel for sharpening. You will also need a 10- or 12-inch mill bastard file. All of these materials can be found at your local hardware store.;
, Gently scrub the surface of the shovel until any vestige of rust has been removed. This is an important step, as filing a rusty surface will dull the file resulting in ineffective sharpening.

, Ensure the upper surface of the blade, or the concave side, is accessible. If you do not have access to a vice or clamps, grip the shovel between your knees and attempt to keep it as sturdy as possible.

, You will sharpen the leading edge, or the one that feels noticeably sharper to the touch.

, You should form a bevel of about 70 degrees to the upper surface of the shovel. Avoid drawing the file backward.

Switch to a high lift blade.",How to Stop Grass Buildup Under Any Lawn Mower Deck," When tilting your mower, keep the gas tank and oil fill openings on the upper side to avoid spilling. Prop the mower up securely so it cannot fall and cause an injury.


It's usually best to empty the gas tank before you begin.;
, Turning the lawn mower's blade by hand can start the engine. Always remove the spark plug or disconnect the attached wire to prevent accidents before handling the underside of the lawn mower.For additional safety, detach the blade.

, Put on heavy-duty gardening gloves and remove large clumps by hand or with a large, flat pry bar. Scrape off remaining grass with a metal putty knife or wire brush.Wet the underside of the deck if the grass is difficult to scrape off.

, For best results, use an air hose with a nozzle or wand to blow away loose grass after scraping.

, Remove the mower's air filter and check to see if it needs replacing. If it is in good condition and is washable, first use an air hose to blow off grass and debris, taking care not to tear it. Add a small amount of dish soap or degreasing soap into water and wash the filter thoroughly Shake off excess water, use the air hose to blow dry, and let dry completely before reinstalling.


If you are not sure whether the filter can be washed, check the manual.

, If hand scraping isn't doing the job, spray the underside of the lawn mower with a pressure washer. Leave the mower propped up and let it dry completely before you continue to the next section.


Water can interfere with the air filter or other mechanisms, especially on the sides or top of the mower.The underside is usually designed to withstand occasional washing, but check your manual if you are concerned.
If you have an air hose, use it again to speed up the drying process.

, This is a cheap, short-term solution that reduces buildup slightly, and makes it easier to scrape off. If you don't have a spray, rub on vegetable oil with a clean rag.


WD40 or used motor oil have a similar effect, but they can drip off and damage your grass., Graphite, silicone, or Teflon sprays are all sold as lawn mower deck sprays (although the all-purpose product probably works just as well). Cover the entire underside of a clean, dry deck, then let dry as directed on label instructions. The effect is similar to cooking spray, but should last longer. If you are mowing a short, dry lawn, this may be enough to meet your needs.


Check product reviews online before buying. Even products marketed for lawn mowers often due a poor job of long-term protection.

, If you tried a lubricant and were not satisfied with the result, check the ingredients on your rust protection product to make sure it isn't based on the same material. Follow label instructions for surface preparation and safety advice. No product has universally helpful reviews, and it's difficult to tell in advance which one will work for your mower model and lawn conditions. Here are a few possibilities:


A lanolin-based product such as Fluid Film leaves a non-drying coat. Some people swear by it, but others find that grass sticks even more to this coat. Test it on a small patch first.Cold galvanization compound is a highly water resistant treatment for unpainted metal surfaces.This might be a good choice in wet climates, but dirt and debris may still wear it down much sooner than the label suggests.Other heavy-duty rust protection products all have mixed reviews. POR-15 is one of the more popular options.

, Whenever possible, mow the lawn while it is dry. Morning dew or recent rain can make the grass clump and stick to your lawn mower.


Grass may have more internal moisture for a day or two after a rain, even if it feels dry.

, The longer the grass clippings, the more likely they are to clump. Try mowing more often to see if that reduces grass buildup.

, Most modern mowers are designed to run at full throttle the whole time.If you run your lawn mower at slower speeds, the messier cuts and reduced air flow can make it difficult to eject grass clippings.

, The longer you wait between cleanups, the harder the job will be. Check regularly to clean off any grass buildup, and make sure all parts are in good condition. Look out for clogged air filters in particular, since this can increase grass buildup.


Inspect mowers used for small home lawns (once or twice a week) at least once a month. Mowers that experience heavy use (several days a week) should be checked once every one or two weeks.

, If grass buildup is still a major problem, contact a store that sells lawn mower parts. They can help you identify which type of lawn mower blade you have, and sell you a ""high lift"" blade compatible with your model. This increases airflow and ejects the grass clippings with more force.If your lawn mower cuts the grass into small pieces so you do not need to collect the clippings, you have mulching blades. These are low to the ground and most vulnerable to grass buildup, especially on a wet lawn. Low blades are also worse for the grass, since they scalp the dirt and tear grass out by the roots.

, Do not stare at the food, sniff the food or indulge in thinking about it. Instead, just focus on the fact that you need to eat, that a meal is present and that there are some great things to be getting on with after eating.


Come up with distracting thoughts, such as things you can't wait to be doing, favorite games you enjoy playing or destinations you'd like to visit.

, Tell yourself that the food is just fine and that you're going to be fine too. Tell yourself: ""I can do this. If I eat this, I am a superhero.""

, Okay, it's depressing but it will remind you that there are people who are going without while you're fussing about the food.

, There are some foods that do smell bad to most people, such as stinky tofu and cod-based lutefisk, or stinky cheeses but many other food odors are fairly much tailored to your own experience. For example, a vegetarian might find the odor of meat unappealing, while a non-gourmet cheese lover might detest the odor of blue cheese.

, This might help to reduce the odor.


Open the windows and let a nice, fresh breeze flow through. Sometimes the build-up of strong odor is what makes you feel sick, and if air flow can dissipate this, it might help you manage to eat the food... just.
Avoid sniffing the food or being too close to it for too long if you can't stand its odor.

, Instead, cut the food into tiny bits that are safe to swallow quickly, then toss them down your gullet as fast as you can. Wash them down with water, juice or a beer.

, Remove the 1/4"" x 1/2"" hex screw holding both the Fuel Line Clamp (Retainer) and one side of the Fuel Tank Strap. Once the screw has been removed, remove the Fuel Line Hose Clamp by simply slipping the expandable clamp off of the Fuel Line., Gently squeeze the opposing tabs on the yellow Fuel Line Intake Clamp with a pair of regular pliers and slide it a couple of inches down the Fuel Line just far enough for it not to be a hindrance to removing the Fuel Line., The fuel intake assembly is press-fitted into the Fuel Tank making use of a rubber-seal fitting. The assembly is removed by simply grasping the metal elbow fitting on the Intake and gently pulling outwards.


WARNING! Once the Intake has been removed, dangerous fuel vapors will begin escaping from the Fuel Tank. Use a clean, dry rag to plug the hole until the Intake has been disconnected from the Fuel Line and subsequently reinserted back into the tank.

, Use a gentle twist-pull action while slowly working the rubber hose off of the ""barbed"" metal elbow-fitting.


CAUTION! When removing the Fuel Line be aware that fuel may still be present in the hose. Use caution when disconnecting the Fuel Line from the elbow-fitting!

IMPORTANT: Once the intake has been disconnected from the Fuel Line, re-insert the assembly back into the tank by pressing the rubber-fitting into the hole.

, The fuel tank is freely mounted in a ""saddle"" situated between the two chassis rails, thus allows the tank to be simply lifted out. Once removed, carefully empty any remaining contents of the tank into a suitable container to be properly disposed of.


CAUTION! Even though the tank has either been siphoned or allowed to run dry, there is a high-risk that fuel and ""bilge"" remains in the bottom of the tank...use caution when removing the unit. This ""bilge"" in many instances is a leading cause to carburetor failure resulting in a costly tear-down and rebuild.







, The MTD fuel tank on this yard tractor is a single-piece plastic composite tank designed to withstand the punishments of outdoor yard maintenance. When servicing the tank itself remember the following:

Clean the tank with mild detergents, or those solutions designed specifically for removing contaminants from such tanks.
During the cleaning process, do not install the tank gauge nor the fuel intake assembly. These must be serviced separately.
After completion of the cleaning process, thoroughly rinse out the tank so as to remove all detergents, preventing fuel contamination.
After completion of the rinsing process, allow the tank to fully dry before re-installation.
Allow only minimal time once the tank has dried and inspections have been completed to reinstall the Fuel Gauge and Fuel Intake in order to prevent contaminants from entering the fuel system.
Prior to beginning re-installation, thoroughly inspect the tank especially the manufacturing seams and the base of the nozzle neck for signs of splitting or cracks. If any are found, the tank MUST BE replaced!
Carefully inspect the fuel gauge to insure that there are no cracks in the needle-dome or the the threaded neck which goes down over the tank nozzle.
Carefully inspect the gasket on the underside of the gauge to insure that there are no cracks or dry-rotting. If found, the gasket or the entire gauge must be replaced.
Carefully inspect the fuel intake assembly to insure there is no splitting, cracking, or dry-rotting of the rubber seal that seats down into the fuel tank. If found, the intake will require replacement.

"
"
Prior to starting, do a close visual inspection, cleaning out any debris, then:


Tighten or replace any loose nuts / bolts.,
Remove the spark plug lead from the spark plug and move it away from cylinder head.,
Position your mower.,
Change or sharpen the blade, if needed.,
Check the motor's ""air filter"" while doing this sort of maintenance.,
Change the oil if needed.,
Be aware of stale fuel.",How to Maintain a Lawn Mower,"
Sand, prime and paint rusted structural parts.
Replace or coat any bare or frayed wiring connections.;
, Always do this before attempting any repairs to a lawnmower that require turning the engine. If you can't start it then first check your spark plug.

, Tip it with care. There is no one rule fits all for tipping two or four stroke engines.


It is best not to tip, but if you do you should remove the air filter so that it does not become saturated with oil or gas and be prepared for oil and or gasoline spillage! Most mowers now have a fuel line between the carburetor and fuel tank, and it is a good idea to clamp this in some way. Small needle nose vise grips with rubber hose slid over each jaw work great but should clamp only tightly enough to stop fuel flow.
If your lawnmower is a ""four stroke"" mower (separate gasoline and oil), never tip it on its side with the spark plug to the ground. Most four strokes have a crankcase vent that routes to the air filter box and will pour or seep oil into the air filter or carburetor throat if they are tipped with the spark plug pointing skyward.
If your lawnmower is ""2 stroke"" (oil and gasoline mixed) turn off the fuel tap. You can tip a two stroke mower almost any way that is suitable to you, as long as the fuel doesn't spill from the tank.
However, be aware that practically all four stroke mower engines have a float type carburetor that can leak fuel if tipped in a particular position relative to how the carburetor is positioned. They can either pour fuel into the air filter or into the combustion chamber, if the intake valve is open.

, To change a blade, or blade disc, it is often easier to remove the spark plug and feed a length of clean cotton string into the cylinder head to 'lock' the piston while trying to undo the blade bolt(s).

, A dirty or clogged air filter will affect engine performance and increase fuel consumption of your mower. Symptoms of a clogged air filter include difficulty starting and quickly stopping after several sputters, or a weak idle. You may also see oily or smoky exhaust.

, If your mower is a ""four stroke"" model, change the oil at least once a year. When it is tipped over with the spark plug in the air, it is a good time to remove the ""oil fill"" plug and drain oil into a suitable oil proof container for disposal or recycling. Many modern mowers have a drain plug so the mower doesn't need to be tipped.

, Stale fuel is a common cause of mowers not starting after the winter storage. Run your mower for five minutes every two or three weeks and you will save yourself problems come spring. Using gasoline without ethanol will decrease this problem, as will using a fuel stabilizer.


Assure you discharge the gas tank by letting the mower run until the fuel is gone. Keep the tank empty until the following cutting season, or, the aged gas that has stayed in the tank all that time will cause moisture and become thick, producing sediments in the gas lines and carburetor, causing the engine to die. Also, make sure you dispose of the aged oil on the tank and change for clean oil.

Before you start the mower, make sure you are seated and able to reach all pedals and levers.;
, Look on the left side. The brake may be a pedal down by your left foot. On some mowers, the brake may instead be a lever you can reach. Push the pedal or lever down to engage the brake. Hold the brake in this position., The location of the parking brake varies between models, but it will be a knob or lever near you. Look near the seat to the right or left of you. Pull the brake up as you slowly release the brake pedal.For mowers that don’t seem to have a brake knob, try pushing down the brake pedal to engage the parking brake.

, Find the gear shift lever. Typically it is near the steering wheel, sometimes below the seat. Shift the lever so it points to “N” for neutral.Some mowers, particularly those without parking brake knobs, require you to hold down the brake as you shift gears.

, Locate the throttle lever. It may be next to the seat on the left side. Many throttles are identifiable because they indicate speed by a picture of a rabbit and turtle. Move the throttle lever so it engages the choke. Depending on the mower, this is done by positioning the lever between the fast and slow settings or pulling it upwards past fast to a point sometimes indicated by a circle with a diagonal line through it., Now you are able to put the key in the ignition switch. The ignition switch may be on the mower’s dashboard ahead of you or it may be next to the seat.

, Once the key is in the ignition, turn it all the way to the right. You’ll hear the engine begin to come to life. You may need to hold the key this way for 15 seconds or more until the engine starts.

, Go back to the throttle again. Release the choke, moving the lever upwards into a faster setting, often indicated by a picture of a rabbit. Your mower may be ready to go at this point, although some older mowers may require you to let the engine warm up before you begin driving., Some mowers have a fuel gauge, but also check the tank. It will either be located under the seat or in the front of the mower. Make sure the tank is about 3/4 full with fresh gas and not leaking. After about a month, old gas begins to clog the mower and should be drained before then.

, Riding mowers need oil, and you should find the oil valve near the engine. Use the dipstick attached to the oil tank’s cap to see if there is oil and if it looks black, replace it. Place a pan under the mower and open the drain valve, then replace the oil filter, if your mower has one, before adding fresh oil.To replace the filter, twist it clockwise. You may need an oil filter wrench to help pull it out. Rub the filter with engine oil, then place the filter back and tighten it with the wrench., The spark plug is the electrical wire connecting to the front or side of the engine. First, wiggle the wire until it comes off or gently use pliers. Then use a wrench to turn the spark plug to the left until it comes off. Clean off any dirt by brushing with your hand or sanding with sandpaper or an emery board. Gently turn the metal plug to the right when putting it back on, tightening it with a wrench.If the plug is rusty or corroded, replace it. You can get spark plugs cheaply at a hardware store. Bring in your old spark plug or have your mower’s model number to find a matching plug.

, When you hear the clicking of the engine attempting to start, the electrical connection may be the problem. Open the hood of the mower and disconnect the battery. Find the red wire, which leads to the solenoid. Lift up the wire harness with a knife, then unscrew the bolts with a socket wrench to remove the solenoid. Replace it with the new solenoid, placing the wire harness over it, placing the wires on the solenoid’s electrical connectors, then using the wrench to reconnect the bolts and main wires.Solenoids can be ordered online or bought from where you got your mower. Make sure you have your model number on hand so you get the right one.

, A dying battery may also contribute to the mower’s inability to gain power. Locate the battery in the seat or hood. Make sure the wires are connected and the terminals are clean. Undo the black, negative wire first, then the red. Reverse this order when hooking up the new battery.The battery can be tested with a voltmeter to see if it still produces a charge.
Replacement batteries will work if they are of the same size and voltage, but bring in your old battery or have the mower’s model number on hand to find the best match., When the mower works for a bit, then stops, the airflow may be obstructed. Undo the spark plug and open the engine. Open the cover the leads to a chamber containing the paper filter shaped as a sheet or cylinder. Look for any dirt and grass clippings and remove them. The filter itself can be safely washed with liquid detergent and lukewarm water.Replace a damaged or excessively dirty filter with a new one from a hardware store.

, Disassemble the engine cover. Find the fuel line leading from the tank to the engine. The carburetor is the bowl shape connecting to the fuel line. Old fuel or dirt may block the lines. Use a carburetor spray cleaner and compressed air from a home improvement store to freshen these parts.If the carburetor appears eroded and gas refuses to flow after cleaning, replace the carburetor. Take it out by unscrewing the throttle rod, choke rod, studs, air intake, and fuel solenoid. Reassemble the connectors in the same spot.To get a fitting carburetor, get one of a similar size. Bring the carburetor to a store or have the mower’s model number on hand.

Clear away any children's toys or rocks., If your mower has a 4-stroke engine, you can check the oil by opening the oil fill cap or dipstick. If your mower has a 2-stroke engine you'll need to mix oil in the gas. Make sure you mix the the right kind of oil with the gas, and in the proper ratio for your engine.








, There should be a single spark plug end sticking out on the back or side of the motor, with a lead that looks a thick wire with a rubber cap attached to it. This is what gets that motor running so make sure that the lead is firmly attached to the spark plug. If it’s properly attached, it will look like a thick rubber hose capped onto a metal protrusion.









If the spark plug isn’t firmly attached, refer to your user manual. You may need to take the lawnmower to a mechanic to have it fixed.
Have a mechanic change the spark plug once a year., Locate the prime button, which is usually a red or black squishy button somewhere on the mower's body. Push it between 3 and 4 times in order to force the gasoline into the lines. Don't go crazy with the squishing, or you'll flood the engine. If you can’t find the prime button, refer to your user manual.








If your mower doesn’t have a prime button, skip this step. However, double check the user manual to be sure.

, The will usually be a lever on the handle of the lawnmower or on the body of the engine. Put the throttle lever in a mid-to-high position. If you skip this step, the engine won’t be able to keep going once you’ve started it.









If the mower is cold, set the choke. The choke helps provide a richer fuel-air mixture to the engine, which helps it stay running until it warms up. Once the mower has been running for a few minutes turn off the choke.

, If your lawnmower has a horizontal lever near the handle, hold it against the handle. Next, grip the handle of the starter (attached at the end of a rope or cord), and pull upward quickly and firmly. You may have to do this several times before the motor starts up.








If it doesn’t start or make any noises at all, the spark plug may not be attached. Check the spark plug and try again.
If it sputters and sounds like it’s trying to start (but doesn’t) you may not have enough gas in the tank.

, The starter is the rope with a handle coming out of the body of the lawnmower. If this chain is abnormally difficult to pull, the blade may be stuck or jammed with grass. Disconnect the spark plug by gently pulling the head of the rubber hose away from the metal attachment.Turn the lawnmower on its side and clear the debris from the lawnmower, being careful of the sharp blades.


You MUST disconnect the spark plug before doing this. Otherwise, you risk the lawnmower starting with your hands inside of it.
If the starter is still stuck after clearing out the debris, see a mechanic.

, First, turn off your lawnmower and allow it to sit for an hour to cool off. Monitor it to make sure the smoking stops after a few minutes. Keep a fire extinguisher on hand in case of emergencies.









If your lawnmower is smoking and won’t stay on, take it to a small engine a mechanic. Your mower may need servicing.

, Once the motor has cooled, disconnect the spark plug and clear away debris from the blades and the discharge chute (where the grass clippings fly out). If the lawnmower continues to smoke, the air filter may be clogged or the blades may be bent. See a mechanic to resolve these issues.









The air filter should be replaced yearly to reduce the risk of clogging. , If your mower dies while you’re using it, you may be cutting grass that is too tall. If this is the case, raise the cutting height of your lawnmower. Refer to your user manual to do this as every lawnmower is different.








Check your user manual to see if it addresses this issue. Some models have “quirks” that can be easily fixed if you know how to do it.
Always be careful when changing the height of your lawnmower. Make sure the mower is off and the spark plug is disconnected.

, This step is especially important if your lawnmower hasn’t been used for a long period of time. Look for a cap on top of the mower body displaying the word ""oil"" or a picture of an oilcan. Unscrew this cap to begin checking the oil.


If your lawn mower doesn’t have a dipstick attached to the oil lid, look for a “fill” line inside the oil tank. If the oil level is below that line, add more oil.

, There will be a dipstick attached to the lid to help you measure the oil. Wipe the dipstick clean and reinsert the dipstick completely. Remove the dipstick again and check the oil level on the stick. If it’s below the “fill” line, add more motor oil.








Refer to your user manual if you don’t know what kind of oil your mower uses.

, Change the oil at the recommended service interval (around 25 hours of normal operation is a good rule of thumb if you're not sure). Changing the oil yourself can be difficult and messy. If you’re inexperienced and have the funds, save yourself the headache and take the lawnmower to a professional lawnmower mechanic.Similarly, your lawn mower blades need to be sharpened every few months. This process is very dangerous and should be done by a lawnmower mechanic.








If you decide to change the oil yourself, remember to properly dispose of the leftover oil by taking it to a recycling facility. Used oil can contaminate groundwater and damage the environment.
Never attempt to work on machinery alone. If you get hurt, no one will be around to help you.

, This is the most common cause of lawnmower “failure.” Open the gas cap and take a look inside. If you don't see any gas in there, fill it up to the recommended level. There should be markings on the inside to show you where that is; if you don’t see one, fill until the level of gasoline is just below the filler tube.








Avoid filling the gas tank too high. If you do, the gas may spill out and cause a fire.
If you’re not sure what kind of gas to use, refer to your user manual.

When in doubt, see a mechanic.",How to Sharpen Lawn Mower Blades," A lawnmower can cause serious injury if it starts while you are working on it.Always disconnect the spark plug and the power source (outlet or battery) before disassembling your mower.


The spark plug can usually be disconnected by removing a prominent wire on the side or front of the lawnmower engine from its metal mounting. Once disconnected, the engine should not be able to start.
For safety purposes, it's still recommended to wear heavy gloves and eye protection during this project even if you're sure you've disconnected the spark plug.;
, However, because of the construction of a lawn mower engine, turning the mower over haphazardly can cause engine oil to spill into the carburetor and air filter.To avoid this, make sure you turn the mower so that these face up, rather than down.


The carburetor and air filter on most modern mowers are usually housed in a boxy plastic case on the side of the engine. If you're unsure of where these parts are located on your mower, consult your owner's manual or contact your manufacturer.
As additional protection against spilling, you can run the mower until it's out of gas, or pour the oil into a separate container. This project is also a good opportunity to check your oil and change it if necessary. It's a good idea to change your oil at least once a year.

, One of the most common mistakes homeowners make when sharpening their lawnmower blade is to re-install it upside-down.If this happens, the blade won't be able to cut grass, no matter how sharp it is. To avoid the extra effort of having to remove and install the blade again, make a noticeable marking on the bottom side of the blade before removing it.


There are many ways to do this. For instance, you may want to mark the bottom of the blade with a dot of spray paint, inscribe your initials with a grease pen, or simply stick some masking tape to the center of the blade.

, Most lawnmower blades are secured with a bolt in the center of the blade. Normally, it's difficult to remove the bolt with a wrench or ratchet because the blade will turn with the tool. For this reason, it's usually necessary to immobilize the blade before you start unscrewing the bolt.


There are many ways to do this. Usually, it's easiest to wedge a sturdy block of wood between the blade and deck of the mower to keep the blade steady while you loosen the nut or bolt. You can also use a vise or clamp if it's more convenient.
Some mowers have a reverse threaded nut holding the blade onto the spindle. Take note of the placement and orientation of any spacer washers or plates that come off with blade.

, Once the blade is blocked, it shouldn't be hard loosen the bolt and remove the blade. Once you do, take the opportunity to clean it — if you've been using the mower frequently, there's a good chance it will be dirty with grass clippings, grime, and so on.


For ordinary cleaning needs, all you'll usually need is a gloved hand or a dry rag. However, if it's been a long time since you've cleaned your lawnmower, you may find it necessary to use a hose and a little soapy water to remove accumulated plant material and grime.If you do, dry the blade with a rag once you finish.

, Using a vise or a sturdy clamp, secure your lawnmower's blade in a way and place that makes it convenient for you to work on it. For instance, you may want to secure it so that the blade sticks out over the edge of your workbench at roughly waist-level so that you can work on it while sitting.


You may want to lay down a few pieces of old newspaper before you begin working to catch stray metal filings, making for easier cleanup.

, Run a metal file along the cutting edge of the blade. Stroke from the inside edge of the blade to the outside edge until a clean shiny, edge is apparent. Flip the blade over and repeat the process on the other edge.


The amount of dust you'll produce from filing your lawnmower blades by hand is likely going to be fairly small compared to what you might generate from other projects. However, it's still a smart idea to wear a standard face mask or respirator to protect your lungs from airborne dust and metal particles as you would for larger grinding projects., Keep the file at the angle of the bevel of the blade as you sharpen. Often, the blade angle is about 40 or 45 degrees, but this is not always the case, so check manufacturer's information for the exact angle.


Ideally, when you're finished, the blade should be roughly as sharp as a butter knife.Lawnmower blades don't have to be razor-sharp – they spin fast enough to cut the grass without this level of sharpness.

, Spray some WD-40 (or a similar lubricant/sealant) on the main bolt to ensure that it does not rust, then put the blade back on the mower, followed by any washers, then the bolt. Tighten the bolt.


Make sure that the blade is oriented correctly when you mount it (this should be easy if you marked the downward-facing side earlier as directed). The sharp edge should be facing the direction of the spin and/or the direction of the grass catcher portal.
Do not use a hammer to make the bolt tighter. A snug fit with a wrench or rachet is usually all you need. You should be able to feel the tightness of the bolt by simply turning the wrench.

, If you aren't already wearing eye protection, gloves, and long sleeves, put these on before beginning. Bench grinders and other sharpening machines can fling sparks and tiny pieces of debris at very high speeds, potentially causing injury if you're not wearing proper protection.

, If you don't want to sharpen your blade by hand with a file or there are minor dents or cracks in the blade, using a mechanical solution may be necessary. For sharpening lawnmower blades, ordinary bench grinders usually work well.


To sharpen the blade, move it back and forth against the wheel of the grinder. As when filing by hand, you'll want to maintain the original angle of the blade's bevel as you sharpen it.
You can also use a 4½ inch (11.4 cm) hand grinder with a metal wheel.

, Another way to sharpen a lawnmower blade is to use a belt sander. The same basic principle applies here: rub the blade at an angle against the abrasive sandpaper to gradually sharpen it through friction


To use your belt sander to sharpen the blade, invert it so that the belt is facing up and lock the trigger switch in the ""on"" position., The intense friction that results from sharpening a lawnmower blade with a machine can cause the blade to get very hot. This high heat can cause the blade to warp or weaken even as it becomes sharper. To prevent this, it's important to quench the blade frequently as it's being sharpened.To quench the blade, keep a bucket full of water near your workbench as you work on it. As the blade heats up, dip it in the water to quench it and cool it down. Wipe the blade dry before beginning to sharpen it again.

, Regularly sharpening your lawnmower blades is a great habit to get in. With frequent use, it's usually appropriate to sharpen a lawnmower's blades about twice every mowing season — more if you use it frequently.


Keep an eye on your grass after you use your mower to cut it. If the grass has a clean, smooth edge, your blades are sharp. If the grass is frayed or torn, your blades are probably too dull and should be sharpened.

, If the lawnmower's blade isn't properly balanced, it can cause the mower to vibrate as it spins or even damage its internal parts. It's convenient to balance the blade when it's removed for sharpening, so you may want to do so after each sharpening.


One way to do this is with a special device called a balancer, which can usually be found at gardening centers or hardware stores.
If you do not have a balancer, it's still possible to balance the blade. Place the blade on a wooden dowel. If one side tilts higher than the other, file the opposite side of the blade, then test the balance again until the blade lies flat.

, While sharpening your blade is a great way to get it in good shape after ordinary wear and tear, some blades are beyond repair. If your blade is bent, deeply worn, dented, or cracked, sharpening won't be able to fix these problems. In these cases, replacement is usually the quickest, easiest option.

, If any part of the sharpening or balancing process seems difficult, unsafe, or beyond your level of maintenance skill, don't risk damaging your blades or hurting yourself. Instead, enlist the help of a lawnmower repair expert. Nearly any lawnmower repairman will be able to sharpen and balance a set of lawnmower blades fairly quickly and at a reasonable price.


As an example of the amount of money you might expect to spend at a lawnmower repair shop, some locations charge as little as $10-15 per sharpening."

As with all lawn mower repairs, remove the spark plug lead, and ensure that it is a safe distance from the plug.,
Check the oil, plug, and air filter to rule out these simple repairs.

,
Check compression.,
Troubleshoot bad compression, if you had it.,
Check for a bent crankshaft by tipping the mower with the exhaust up (gas will drip out, but this cannot be prevented).,
NOTE: Everything beyond this point should only be done by those who know what they're doing and have dismantled and engine before.

,
If compression was not the problem, check for spark by removing the plug from the head, replacing the lead and grounding the tip against the block.,
If you had spark, check the carburetor by removing the air cleaner and its assembly from the carburetor and check the following.,
Inspect the throttle with the air cleaner still off, move the throttle knob to see if it fully opens and shuts and, if necessary, clean it out.,
Inspect the manifold check the intake manifold for holes and try to wiggle it.,
Check the flywheel key, the small, removable notch in the flywheel.,
Recheck your work.",How to Repair a Four Stroke Lawn Mower,";
,, With the plug in the engine (disconnected lead) and the safety kill-switch bar pushed down, pull the starter cord. You should feel a quick, tight resistance. If you do, skip to step five.


If you felt little or no resistance and heard an asthmatic-sounding puff noise, you have bad compression.
If you felt and heard nothing, ensure that the starter cord system is working. If it is, you may have a thrown rod and should replace the mower.

, Bad compression could be caused by either a bent/broken valve, or a blown head gasket. Remove the eight large bolts from the front of the engine (and anything in the way) and remove the head.


Check the head gasket for any missing chunks. If you found missing chunks, remove what is left and obtain a replacement from a small engine shop. Then use steel wool to remove any stuck on pieces of gasket, place the new one on, replace everything and try to start it.
If the gasket was intact, inspect the valves and ensure that one isn't bent or not fully closing. If it is bent, gently pry it straight with a slotted screwdriver and try to get it to start.
If a valve was straight but not closing, you need to remove the valve and, depending on severity, either use a bench grinder to shorten the back end, or replace the valve entirely. Both of these are difficult and complex procedures and you may prefer to replace the mower unless you have a lots of time, patience, and experience.

, MAKE SURE THE PLUG LEAD IS OUT and turn the blade slowly. If you see the bolt in the center shimmy from side to side, discard the mower because it has a bent crankshaft and will not operate correctly. If it remained centered, proceed.

,, If you pull the starter with the safety kill switch down, you should see a small spark jump the gap on the end of the plug. If you did, continue to the next step. If you did not, the magneto (Y-shaped piece of metal with plug lead coming out) may be bad and should be cleaned or replaced.

,


If your mower has a choke, ensure that it moves without obstruction and can close fully.
If your engine has a primer bulb, push it to ensure that gas can enter the carburetor.
If this didn't work, ensure that there is no dirt or carbon deposits inside the carburetor.
If it still won't start, remove the carburetor from the tank (5 screws) and inspect the two screens for blockage.
Inspect the rubber diaphragm and paper gasket for holes and replace it if necessary.
If there is a wide spring below the gasket, place it above the gasket, not in the metal pocket below.

, If it still doesn't fully open and shut, replace the carburetor.

, If it wiggles, tighten the two bolts on the left end. If there are holes or any melting, replace it.

, If it is cracked, shattered, or missing, set the engine to TDC (top dead-center) exhaust stroke (both valves will be opened slightly). Align the flywheel magnets with the magneto and replace the key.


To remove the flywheel, pry up from the bottom while striking the top of the crankshaft with a hammer.
If the two notches in the flywheel and crankshaft were misaligned, then you have a timing problem that should be fixed by a professional.

, If at this point the mower still won't start, the cylinder may be scored from heat or it could be something worse. Either way, it is pointlessly expensive to continue repairs. You should check one last time for any mistakes you may have made and attempt a start on fresh gas. If it still refuses to turn over, it may be time for a new mower.

Lift the mower deck to expose the blade.,
Unplug the spark plug.,
Remove the blade mounting bolt.,
Purchase replacement blades.,
Mount the new blade in the appropriate direction.,
Check the blade for play.,
Refill the gas tank and do a pre-check before mowing.",How to Change a Lawn Mower Blade," It's important to look closely at the carburetor and the oil compartment to make sure you're not tilting the mower in such a way as to spill oil all over the engine, the grass, and yourself. Generally, the safest way to do this is to tilt the mower back, toward the handle, and prop it with some kind of weight, or the help of a partner. This won't necessarily be true for all mowers, however, so use your judgment and consult the owner's manual, if necessary.









It's also best to do this when there's no gas in the mower. Wait until you use it all up to change the blade, or you might consider draining out the gas with syphon hose. Typically, self-syphon pumps are sold at any hardware or automotive parts store. This prevents gas spillage onto the mower body.;
, It's best to stay on the safe side and prevent a short-out or electrical flare-up if any oil or gas should come in contact with the spark plug. It shouldn't be a problem if you hold the mower properly, but it's still best to be on the safe side., Use a socket wrench of the appropriate size and unbolt the mounting, while using your other hand to keep the blade from turning. Be careful not to lose any washers or mounting hardware that hold the blade into place, which can be reused.









Pay attention to the position of the blade as you're removing it. You'll mount the new one in the same orientation, usually with the sharp edge of the blade going counter-clockwise with the turning of the assembly. Again, this may not be true on all mowers, so pay attention to the way this blade is installed and install the new blade accordingly.

, Replacement blade kits for push powers are generally only a few dollars at most home improvement or hardware stores, featuring new pre-weighted and sharpened blades, and usually replacement nuts. If your blades are particularly worn out, it's a good idea to invest in a new set.


Some mowers feature a bottom cap on which two shorter separate blades are attached, while some newer push mowers feature a single longer blade, that looks kind of like a ruler. Tilt the mower back to inspect the blade, or talk to someone at the hardware store about the type of blade appropriate for your brand of mower. You can also check in the owner's manual, if you have it.Alternatively, you can salvage the old blades and have them sharpened if they seem to be in decent condition. If the blades are worn out, with chips or chunks out of the metal, it's probably wise to get a new set.

, Line up the blades as they were lined up before and reinstall the washers and nuts, or use new washers and nuts of the appropriate size. If you have the owner's manual, there should be torque specs for tightening the nut. If not, just make sure not to over-tighten and warp the blade, which can cause vibrations in the mower.









Most blades are either specific or universal fit. Be sure you have the same length as the old blade before mounting the new one, and make sure the clearance from the lawn mower deck is the same. Tighten the new blade onto the bolts carefully, since it'll likely be much sharper than the old one.
It's a good idea to wear thick mechanic gloves when doing the job, to keep your hands safe. It's also advisable to use a small piece of wood to stop up the blade from turning while you reinstall it. You can jam a small piece of wood between the blade and the mower deck to keep things from turning.

, Be sure the blade is mounted correctly and has no wobble when you move it up and down, firmly. Remove any jacks or props used to hold mower in place and wait about 30-60 minutes for oil to return to motor to prevent issues or motor damage. Check the oil before use to ensure it is within the proper limits.

, Check the air filter to be sure that oil did not saturate the foam filter, if necessary, and reattach the spark plug wire.


After a quick inspection, you should be able to start up your mower and start cutting that grass much more efficiently with your new blades.

Check the battery.,
Check the solenoid switch.,
Check the safety switches.,
Lift the engine housing cover as you do to check the oil, and look immediately behind the ignition switch on the firewall of the mower.",How to Check an Unresponsive Ignition on a Murray Electric Start Lawn Mower," You must be certain the battery is in good condition and we will assume that this is the case. Still, even with a fully charged battery, the voltage has to go from the battery terminals into the cables, so as well as confirming the battery is ""hot"", it is necessary to make sure both the positive cable connector is tight, and the ground cable and the frame grounding connection are tight and not corroded or shorted out.;
, After it is determined the battery is sending voltage through the cables, the next step in the circuit is the solenoid switch, usually located mounted on the frame near the starter motor in the engine compartment. This device contains an electromagnetic switch that closes contacts when it is energized by the ignition. It is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) by 1 1/2 inches (5.1 cm), with two large brass studs for the starter cable, and two small screw studs for the ignition wires, and may be round, or oblong with rounded edges, and made of high impact black plastic with a metal base. By using a copper wire to ""jump"" the two smaller terminals, you can close the contacts on the starter circuit. You should hear a fairly loud click and the starter motor should turn when this is done. Take care not to short either terminal to a grounded part of the mower, and be aware the 12 volt current will spark when it is contacted.

, If you have succeeded in getting the starter motor to turn by jumping the solenoid connections, the primary starter circuit is good, and the problem is either in the ignition switch or the safety devices on the mower. Most electric start mowers have three safety devices. One is mounted under the seat, so that the machine can only be started with the driver seated. Another is usually on the clutch/brake linkage under the deck beneath the clutch pedal. The third is located either on the mower drive belt linkage under the frame on the right side (seated) of the mower, or in the electric mower clutch circuit if the mower is so equipped. Each of these has a plastic insulated plug with two wires going into the device, and a temporary jumper may be installed into them one at a time by unplugging each one and pushing a piece of copper wire under the terminal on the end attached to the wires. If you do not have any luck finding a defective safety device, the problem is narrowed down to the ignition switch itself.

, The switch component is on the back of the keyface, and will have a number of wires running to it, usually four. The primary voltage wire will be the largest, normally it is red, and often is found in the center. The other wires will be attached to terminals situated around the outside of the switch. Jumping from the primary wire to each terminal will result in different effects, one energizing the ignition circuit, one the starter motor, and on some mowers, another the lights or other accessories. If you can jump these terminals and the starter motor turns, you have probably located your trouble, and will need to change the switch.

Seat the idler assembly.",How to Maintain a MTD Yard Machine Garden Tractor Mower Deck3," The idler spring (aka simply the ""extension spring"" by the OEM) is a 6.17"" extension spring connecting the idler bracket assembly to a stationary 1/4"" x 1-3/4"" hex bolt mounted onto the mowing deck assembly. This spring, because of its location is typically exposed to the elements and will periodically require replacement.

, Due to the orientation of how the idler spring is mounted onto the idler bracket (the Spring is attached to the Bracket from the underside) turn the bracket assembly counter-clockwise until the spring clears the deck surface and then can be removed.



NOTE: When turning the bracket assembly there was noticeable friction between the bracket and the deck indicating something amiss. Take note of the following optional steps that deviate from the standard OEM assembly.

,: After turning the bracket Assembly, unmount the V-belt from between the idler and #2-Pulley.

OPTIONAL STEP: See SHORTCUT #02 in the ""Tips"" section below for details.

, When the idler assembly is removed, check the mowing deck surface for scoring or damage caused by the Bracket coming into contact. Damage or scoring indicates either a misaligned or damaged bracket. It is also possible that this is an indication of an ""erroneous"" assembly by the factory. Refer to SHORTCUT #02 in the ""Tips"" section below for details.

Take your fork in your dominant hand.,
Catch a few strands of spaghetti in your fork.,
Point your fork into the side of your plate.,
Turn the fork to ""wind up"" the spaghetti.,
Lift the bundle into your mouth.",How to Eat Spaghetti1," Spaghetti can be eaten with nothing more than a single fork (in fact, this is how the Italians do it).Almost any standard-sized dinner fork will work.;
, Lift your fork and, with a scooping motion, gather a small number of strands between the tines of the fork. Point the fork sideways to keep the strands from falling out. Give the fork a quick (but gentle) jerk upward to separate these strands from the rest.


You really only need a few strands of spaghetti here. Two, three, or four strands may not look like much, but it will give you a good bite of pasta once it's wound up.

, Now, with the spaghetti strands still in the fork, gently press its points into a flat part of the plate or bowl. A curved lip at the edge of a plate or the sloped side of a bowl will work well, but any smooth, flat part will work.


The main thing you're trying to do here is separate the strands in your fork from the rest of the spaghetti.

, Now, use your fingers to twist the fork around and around in circles. The spaghetti strands caught in the tines will start wrapping around the fork and form a bundle. Keep winding until you have a tight, tidy little bundle of wrapped-up spaghetti.


If you notice other strands stuck to your spaghetti, jerk the fork upward and bounce it up and down a few times to separate it. The bundle should stay (mostly) on the fork.

, Now, carefully move the fork up to your mouth. Put the entire bundle in at once. Chew, swallow, and repeat!


If the bundle is too big, start over with fewer strands of spaghetti. Bundles that are too big are a recipe for spills and messy sauce drips.

"

Take the fork in your dominant hand and the spoon in your other.,
Catch a few strands of spaghetti in your fork.,
Lift the spaghetti up to separate it from the rest.,
Press the fork into your spoon.,
Wind the fork.,
Eat the bundle of spaghetti.",How to Eat Spaghetti2," For some, the ""only"" way to eat spaghetti is with a fork and spoon. If you want to do this, use a standard dinner fork and a spoon that's a little wider and flatter than you'd normally use for other foods. If you don't have one, a standard spoon is fine.

, This is exactly like if you were just using a fork. Again, you don't want too many strands — this will make for a sloppy, unwieldy bundle of spaghetti.

, When you're working with a spoon, you do most of your maneuvering off of the plate. Use an up-and-down bouncing motion to separate your three or four strands from the rest of the pasta. Keep the fork pointed to the side or upward so the spaghetti strands don't slip off.

, Hold the spoon sideways so its inward curve is facing the fork. Press the tips of the fork gently into the curve of the spoon. Lift them, together, away from the rest of the spaghetti, but keep them over the plate to avoid spills.

, Keeping the fork sideways, start turning it against the spoon. The spaghetti should climb upwards and get wrapped around the fork. Keep wrapping until you have a tight bundle.


As you do this, use the spoon as a ""surface"" to wind the fork against. It's basically serving the same purpose as your plate normally would.

, Set the spoon down. Move the fork up to your mouth — just like you would if you were eating the spaghetti with a fork alone.

"
"
Don't use a spoon.,
Don't cut spaghetti into smaller pieces.,
Don't plunge your fork into the middle of the spaghetti.,
Keep your eating clean, tidy, and dignified.",How to Eat Spaghetti3," Above, we've explained how to use a spoon to eat pasta. Though there's nothing ""wrong"" with doing this, it's not something Italians usually do.This can be considered a little ""clumsy"" or ""childish,"" like using chopsticks to spear food and put it into your mouth.


However, it is common to use a fork with a spoon to serve pasta and toss it with sauce., Traditionally, spaghetti isn't cut or broken at any time while it's cooked or eaten.This means that you shouldn't break the spaghetti in half before you cook it in boiling water and that you shouldn't use your fork to cut spaghetti strands on your plate.If you find your spaghetti bundles too large, don't cut your spaghetti — just use fewer strands.

, This doesn't just look silly — it makes spaghetti awfully hard to eat. Digging right into the center of your spaghetti before you start winding your fork will leave you with an enormous, unwieldy bundle that will be very hard to get to your mouth without spills.


Avoiding this is simple. Just use your fork to gather a few strands at a time and separate them from the rest of the spaghetti before winding.

, To Italians, pasta isn't something you shovel into your mouth to satisfy your hunger. It's a dignified dish meant to be cooked properly, cherished, and savored. Use the following tips to eat your spaghetti respectfully:


Don't slurp strands of spaghetti into your mouth ""Lady and the Tramp""-style. Instead, put small, tiny bundles in your mouth.
Don't pile food onto your plate next to your pasta. Pasta is best enjoyed by itself as a primo piatto (first course).
Eat slowly to avoid spills and drips, but don't lose your head if you make a mistake. It happens to everyone.

Understand what zero turn radius means.,
Select a mower appropriate for your mowing needs.,
Read the Owner's Manual/Operator's Manual for your mower.,
Look at the controls on the mower so you understand the purpose of each one and are familiar with its operation.,
Find a location with lots of room to practice driving your mower before actually beginning to mow.,
Sit down in the seat when you have selected your mower, checked the items listed above, and are ready to begin.,
Grasp each control arm in your hands, moving it forward and backward, to get a feel for its motion.,
Engage the parking brake, disengage the mower clutch, pull the choke knob (if equipped), advance the throttle lever, and turn your key to crank the engine.,
Slowly push the control handles forward, keeping them equally advanced so that the mower will begin to move in a straight path.,
Turn your mower left and right by advancing the opposite control stick, or easing back the control on the side you wish to turn to.,
Try backing the mower by pulling the arms backward.,
Practice making sharper turns by reversing the control arm on the side you wish to turn toward, while advancing the opposite side.,
Become familiar with the mower deck's cutting path, its width in relation to the drive wheels, and the discharge angle of the mower blades.,
Start mowing.,
Mow your lawn, taking care on steep hills and near obstacles, and watching for bystanders, buildings and vehicles that may be hit by debris thrown from the mower blades as you pass by.

",How to Operate a ZTR Lawnmower," Because the drive wheels turn independently, powered by hydraulic motors on each axle, one side can turn in reverse while the other turns forward, causing the mower to actually spin like a top in one place.;
, If you have a small urban lawn, less than a few hundred square feet, this is not the machine for you. For medium to large lawns, a 15 to 18 horsepower (now referred to as torque) mower with a 36–42 inch (91.4–106.7 cm) mowing path is as large as you need. For very large lawns, over an acre, you can go to a 22- 25 horsepower model that mows over 50 inches (127.0 cm) in each path.

, Some mowers come with a Quickstart Guide to help you get started, but it will not cover all the information you may find you need, so take a little time to browse the more complete information contained in the Owner's Manual.

, Here are the main controls common to ZTR mowers:


Ignition switch, for cranking your mower.
Parking brake, usually has to be engaged to start the engine.
Mower clutch, to engage the mowing blades.
Deck height adjustment, to raise or lower the blade, depending on how high you want to cut your grass.
Steering arms. These are the devices that replace your steering wheel to make your mower go forward, reverse, and turn.
Check your machine before starting it. Here is a brief checklist to go over every time you use your machine.
Check the fuel.
Check the oil.
Check the belts, pulleys, and blades to make sure they are free of debris and in good condition.
Check the tires. This is critical with a ZTR mower, since the turning dynamics of this machine place a great deal of stress on the tires.


, The steering, acceleration, and general feel of driving a ZTR mower will be a new experience for most people, so having lots of practice room is always a good idea.

, Before starting your engine, adjust the control arms so they are in a comfortable position. Usually these will tilt in and out (left and right, from the center line of the machine). Many ZTR mowers also have an option of adjusting the neutral position, for taller or shorter people, so your arms are in a comfortable position while you mow.

, The arms will return to a neutral position when you release the pressure on them. Pushing them forward propels the mower forward, and pulling them back reverses the mower. Give yourself a few moments of practicing this before proceeding.

, When the engine cranks, push the choke knob in and pull the throttle back to a fast idle. When you are ready to roll, release the parking brake.

, If the mower turns left, you need to advance the left arm more to compensate; if it turns right, advance the right. The handle you push forward speeds the drive wheel on that side. For straight travel, you want the wheels to turn at the same speed.

, You should get the hang of it fairly quickly, but give yourself enough time to be confident in your steering ability.

, This also should be practiced at a lower engine speed. You should have noticed by now, the farther you advance or pull back the control arms, the faster the mower travels.

, You will see the reversed wheel is pulling one side of the mower backwards, while the forward wheel is pushing that side, causing the mower to spin in place.

, You will find that sharp turns in close quarters can quite suddenly jam the mower deck against an obstacle, since it is traveling almost perpendicular to the center-line of the machine. You will also want to cut the widest path on each pass, so the mower's position as you travel needs to be in line with your previous cut.

, Now that you are familiar with the basic driving controls of your ZTR mower, pull the knob (or whichever type of control your mower is equipped with) to engage the blades, and begin mowing.

The size of the yard makes a difference in the type of lawnmower you’ll need to easily get the job done.Calculate the acreage of your yard by measuring the length and width of your yard. 1 acre is equal to 43560 square feet. Multiply the length times the width in feet and divide by 43560 to determine how many acres you have.Small to medium lawns are lawns under ½ an acre.
Large lawns are lawns larger than ½ an acre.;
, If you have a yard on a hill, a self propelled mower would be a good idea to help you get up the hill. Ride on mowers can sometimes be dangerous on hills, so plan a way to navigate the hill without putting your safety at risk. Flat yards are ideal for walk-behind, push mowers.

, If you have a well maintained lawn with few weeds it is easier for a mower to cut. An overgrown lawn with many weeds and brush may require a larger size mower to get under control.

, There are many different types of lawn mowers available, and the type you need depends on several different variables. Consider the size and landscape of the yard, the amount of maintenance you want to do, and how much muscle power you want to put into mowing when you decide the type of mower to get., Most brands offer many different types of lawnmowers, and there isn’t much difference between the brands, but you want to consider where you’ll be servicing your mower. Some lawnmower service places only work with certain brands, so check out the local service stations in your area to make sure you’ll have a place to go when you need to have your mower worked on.


If you buy the lawnmower from a local retailer, they will sometimes have their own service stations for mowers.

, These mowers are completely manually powered and leave clippings unevenly distributed around the lawn. They also are the most environmentally friendly choice.

, They run off electricity or a battery, and they come in a cord and cordless options. They are easily maintained, however they weigh and cost considerably more than gas powered mowers.Make sure you have extension cords that can reach across your entire yard if purchasing an electric mower with a cord.

, You can select push or self propelled options. Self propelled gas powered mowers are good for lawns that have hills because they push themselves forward letting you use less muscle power. These mowers have to be regularly maintained with tune-ups and oil changes, and they are a bit more noisy than electric mowers., These mowers move themselves around the yard within a perimeter wire around your yard. Robotic mowers are quite costly and sometimes give a less quality cut than conventional mowers.

, There are different types of ride on mowers including lawn tractors and zero turn radius riders. Ride on mowers are much pricier than walk behind mowers, and require regular maintenance.


Check the size of the mower deck to see how wide of a cutting path your mower has. A larger cutting deck will mean fewer passes to finish the job and cut your mowing time down.

, Buying a lawnmower is a big purchase and can be very costly, so you need to have a budget in mind when you’re shopping. When you give yourself a budget for an item, you’re more likely to be conscious of the prices when you shop.


A weekly lawn service can cost from $20-$100. When considering your budget you will want to save money over hiring a service. Depending on the size of your yard a monthly payment under $100 on a lawn mower can provide significant savings when compared to hiring a lawn service company.
Push mowers are typically $200-$600 new. A ride on or lawn tractor can easily cost several thousand dollars.

, There are many different avenues to buy a lawn mower from. You can buy a new lawn mower from a dealer, department store, garden store, or home store. You can also buy a used lawn mower from a garage sale, an auction sale, or from an online garage sale.You will save a lot of money by buying a used lawn mower, but you might not get any warranties with it.
If you want to buy a used mower, consider buying one from a reputable dealer where they sometimes have used or refurbished mowers. These usually have been tested and sometimes come with limited warranties.

, Before you purchase your new mower, make sure to inquire what accessories such as bagging and mulching attachments are included.

, Many new lawn mowers and some used ones come with a warranty to cover things that may break or go wrong within a certain time period. Make sure you read the warranty completely before buying so you understand what is covered and how long your mower is covered for. "

, Turn it off and lock the brakes or chock the wheels. Disconnect spark plug(s).,, You need to make sure it is supported solidly, as riding lawn mowers are heavy, and you don't want to risk having it fall on you while you work on it. For greater safety, consider using a manufactured mower or tractor lift., You may also need a cheater pipe or other means of keeping the blade from turning while you remove the nut., For blades that are tightly seated, you may have to pry the blade off or work it up and down to loosen it after the nut is removed., Choose new blades to suit your own preferences – there are a number of different blades for each type mower, including enhanced discharging blades, mulching blades, and heavy duty blades., Since there are many different brands and manufacturers of riding lawn mowers, making sure the blades you purchase fit your mower is critical for a successful project., Be sure to install the blade right side up, as they may fit upside down. Generally, if the blade has an offset in it, the center will be in a higher position than the ends of the blade. Make sure the blade fits all the way onto the spline to prevent damaging it when the nut that secures it is tightened., You may have torque specifications for this step for your individual mower.,,,"

, Do not blow on your soup to cool it down.Blowing on your soup can make you seem impatient and it can also cause you to splatter soup on the person sitting across from you.


If your soup is too hot to eat, then put down your soup spoon and wait until it is cool enough to eat. Enjoy the conversation of your dining companions and then check the soup again after a few minutes.

, While you may naturally want to spoon your soup towards you, this may increase the chances that you will drip soup on yourself. Instead, spoon the soup towards the back of your bowl and then lift the spoon up towards your mouth. This will give any excess soup on the spoon a chance to drip back into the bowl.When the soup is getting low in your bowl, then you can tip your bowl away from you slightly to get the last bit of soup at the bottom of the dish.

, Your spoon has a tapered end, but sipping from this part of the spoon increases your chance of spilling soup on yourself. Sip your soup from the wide edge on the side of the spoon instead.Never slurp your soup if you are in a restaurant in the west, such as somewhere in Europe or the United States. This is considered rude by many people in western cultures. Try to eat your soup as silently as possible.

, After you have finished eating your soup, put your spoon on the plate underneath your soup bowl. If there is not a plate under your soup bowl, then place your spoon in the soup bowl.Do not place the used soup spoon on your napkin or on the table.

Wait a little while.,
Have a nap.,
Do some moderate exercise.,
Drink lots of water.,
Opt for a light meal.",How to Eat when You're Hungry but Don't Feel Like Eating1," Having no appetite while technically hungry is usually a temporary thing. Regardless of the reasons why you might be feeling this way, there should come a time where your appetite finally catches up with the rest of your body. If you don't need to eat right this instant, you're better off holding off on it until you're at such a point where you can enjoy your meal in earnest.;
, It's quite possible that your body is in fact too tired to send proper signals of hunger to your brain. If you're feeling drowsy at all, it' a good idea to get a quick nap to help replenish your energy. Even a power nap as short as half an hour should do well to get your appetite going again. , Nothing whets the appetite like a walk or a decent jog. Going for some moderate exercise will help stimulate your body and remind you what you need the energy from food for.


Granted, if you have no appetite, it may feel be that you're not feeling good in other areas. Exercise is recommended in a lot of cases, but if you're feeling sick, it may be best just to have a nap instead.

, Arguably the best possible thing you can do to stimulate your hunger is to drink water. This will fill your stomach for a short time and hopefully stimulate you for more to come.

, If you've done what you can and still feel dubious towards eating something, the best possible advice is to start small, and eat slow. Even if it's just serving a fraction of your meal to yourself at a time, the manageable portions will prove far less daunting than a full meal.


Make sure you're as relaxed as possible; if you're feeling tense and really don't want to eat, your gag reflex might work up as you're trying to eat.

Tip the bowl towards you or pick it up.,
Use chopsticks to pick up noodles, dumplings, meat, and veggies.,
Use the spoon to drink the broth.,
Slurp your soup.",How to Eat Soup2," If you are eating ramen or a large bowl that is difficult to pick up, then you can just use your non-dominant hand to support the bowl and tip it towards you slightly as needed. However, if the bowl is small enough to pick up, then you can pick up your bowl with your non-dominant hand and eat it with the spoon in your other hand.Make sure that you eat the soup while it is still hot. It is important to eat your soup while it is too hot. Do not wait to let it cool down or blow on your soup. You can slurp it to help cool it off as you eat., It is okay to use chopsticks while eating soup, but make sure that you use them for larger pieces of food in your dish, such as noodles, dumplings, meat, and veggies.Don’t mix the soup around with your chopsticks.This is considered rude.
Don’t stick your chopsticks into the bowl from the top. This can remind Chinese people of funerals.
Don’t play with your chopsticks or wave them around while you are talking.
Don’t lay your chopsticks across the top of your bowl when you are done. Put them in the bowl at an angle.

, A flat bottomed spoon will be provided along with your soup. Use this to drink the broth and smaller pieces of food in your soup.When you are finished eating, place the spoon in the bowl.

, If your soup contains long noodles, such as a ramen, then you can slurp it. Sucking in air by slurping up the noodles will help to cool down the soup and it is also considered polite to eat your soup this way.Keep in mind that if you eat your soup in silence, then the chef may be offended.It is okay to slurp your food and even burp at the dinner table in most Asian cultures.How quickly you should eat depends on the setting. For example, if you are eating a meal in someone’s home, then wolfing down your food is not necessary and may even be considered rude. However, if you are eating in a ramen shop or other street food vendor, then eating quickly and loudly is appropriate.

Consuming French onion.,
Sipping consommé.,
Eating bouillabaisse.,
Go easy on the crackers.,
Add garnishes before you start eating.",How to Eat Soup3," Eating French onion soup can be challenging. This soup comes with a crouton and a layer of melted cheese on top of a brothy onion soup. To eat it, you will have to break through the crouton with your spoon (or a fork and knife if it is too hard to break through with your spoon) and use it to scoop up a bit of crouton, cheese, and broth at the same time.Use the edge of your spoon to cut the cheese by pressing it against the edge of your bowl. You may need to support the bowl with your other hand as you do so.

, Consommé is a clear broth soup that may be served in an upscale restaurant or at a fancy dinner party. You can sip consommé like a cup of tea if the bowl it is served in has handles.However, if the bowl does not have handles, then eat it as you would eat any other soup, such as by spooning it away from you in the bowl and sipping the soup from the side of your spoon.

, This French dish contains a variety of different seafood, such as clams, mussels, crab legs, and scallops. Some pieces you will be able to pick up with a regular spoon, while you will need to crack open some of the other pieces with a shellfish cracker. You may also need to use a knife and fork to extract some of the seafood from the shells.This dish is often served in two courses. The first course is the broth along with croutons, garlic, and a spiced mayonnaise and the second course is all the different kinds of fish on a platter. Spread some garlic and mayonnaise on a crouton and eat it with the broth, then work on the fish., Sometimes crackers will be served along with soup, and you can add these to your soup to help make it a little thicker. However, do not add so many crackers that your soup takes on an oatmeal-like consistency. Just add a couple of crackers for flavor if desired.You can also dip a piece of bread into your soup if it has been offered along with the soup. Just be careful to wipe away any excess broth before you bring the bread to your mouth or you may drip on yourself.

, If your soup has been served with optional garnishes, then make sure that you add these before you start eating. Use a clean spoon or fork to add the garnishes to your soup.Some common garnishes may include:


croutons
sour cream
cheese
green onions
bacon pieces
bean sprouts
lime
crushed peanuts

Figure out the reasons why you might not want to eat.,
Try eating in front of the TV.,
Savour every morsel of food you taste.",How to Eat when You're Hungry but Don't Feel Like Eating2," While having little to do with the act of eating per se, it will help your eating progress if you acknowledge and understand the specific reasons why you may be feeling this way. Feeling blue may be caused by a load of things. Likewise, there may be biological factors at work which play into depression. The mere act of contextualizing these feelings and actively working through them will make the act of eating seem all the easier.


It's just as important of a psychological step to remember the practical (and necessary) health benefits of eating food. If you see eating as an absolute necessity, you may feel more inclined towards eating.

, Watching TV while eating is often seen as a bad thing and a cause for why people overeat. You may actually find a benefit to watching TV, as you will be able to eat food without it being taking of your attention., If you're having a hard time eating a lot, you can always start out really small. Instead of seeing it as a chore, try to see eating the food as a sensory experience. Find a food you love to eat, and approach it purely with the intent of judging and appreciating the taste and sensation of it.

Try Caprese salad.",How to Eat Salad," Proper dining techniques are most important in formal settings, such as when you’re having an interview or meeting, trying to impress someone, eating at a fine dining establishment, or in some other circumstance when proper etiquette is expected.


In formal settings, there is often a salad course that comes either before the entrée (American style) or after the main dish (European style).
The salad course in a formal meal usually consists of a basic salad, such as a green salad or Caesar salad, that includes a combination of lettuce, vegetables, croutons, dressing, and possibly meat or cheese.
When a server brings you your salad, do not move away or to the side when the plate is placed in front of you.;
, Someone may come around to offer you freshly grated cheese or freshly ground pepper for your salad. It is acceptable to say yes to one or both, but be sure to indicate to the server when to stop.


Never add salt or pepper to your own salad (or any course) until you’ve tasted it first., A place setting will be laid out with the utensils in order based on the dishes that will be served. If you are unsure which utensils are for which dish, follow this simple rule: work from the outside in.When your salad is served, use the fork and knife at the outermost edge of your place setting. They will be taken away after the salad course, and then you will move on to the next set of cutlery.

, When the lettuce and vegetables aren’t cut up into bite-sized pieces, it is acceptable to eat your salad with a knife and fork. Alternatively, if the salad is mostly in smaller pieces, you can use your fork alone to eat.


When using just your fork, you can turn it on its side and use the side of the fork to cut a piece of lettuce or vegetable into a smaller piece before eating it., Don’t cut up your entire salad at once; instead, eat each bite as you cut it.Make sure they are small bites, so that you don’t end up with too large a mouthful of food, or a forkful that is too large to fit into your mouth.

, When you are ready to eat, bring your fork to your mouth and gently incline your head to take the bite. Bring your fork back down immediately, and let it hover over your plate. Do the same with your knife., In American eating style, you always perform the main cutting and eating functions with your right hand, which means you must transfer your knife and fork during the meal.To cut a bite, hold your knife in your right hand and your fork in your left hand. Hold your bite in place with the fork and cut the bite with your knife.
Place your knife down on your plate, and transfer the fork to your right hand to take your bite.
When you are ready for another bite, transfer the fork back to your other hand, pick up your knife, and repeat the process.

, The silent service code is a way for guests and servers to communicate without words, where guests use cutlery and napkin placement to indicate certain things throughout the meal.To indicate that you have left the table momentarily and will return to your meal, place your napkin on your chair. To say that you are finished and won’t be returning to your meal, place the napkin on the table to the left of your plate.This is true for both American and European dining.

, When you are taking a break from eating or wish to indicate you are finished with your course, place your knife and fork side by side at the 10 and 4 position on top of your plate (if your plate were a clock, the top of the knife and fork would point to 10, and the bottoms would point to the 4).


Place the tines facing down if you are taking a break. Position the tines face up if you are finished.When you have finished your course, be sure to place the knife and fork on your plate, even if you didn’t used the knife designated for that course., In European-style dining, you don’t transfer your fork back and forth between hands to cut and eat. Instead, you will always hold your knife in your right hand and your fork in your left throughout the meal.Use your fork to anchor your bite in place and cut it with your knife.
Use your knife to gently push other pieces of salad onto your fork, such as a piece of vegetable or cheese, before taking your bite. If it’s available, use something like a crouton or bean at the end of the fork to anchor the food to the fork.When you take your bite, rest the wrist of your right hand on the edge of the table. Place your left hand in the same position after you take your bite, and leave your hands in that position until you have finished chewing and are ready to cut your next bite.

, In European style, criss-cross the tips of your knife and fork across the top of your plate to indicate to the servers that you plan to continue eating, and have only taken a break to talk or drink.

, To say you are finished with your plate in European dining, place your knife and fork side by side at the 10 and 4 position on top of your plate. Make sure the tines of the fork are facing down., Taco salad is a Mexican- or Tex-Mex-inspired dish. The salad, which is made up of lettuce, beans, corn, tomato, cheese, spices, and other taco fixings, is served with corn chips on the side, or served in an edible tortilla bowl.Taco salads are not likely to be served in a fine or formal dining setting, so you have more freedom in terms of eating them.


One way to eat a taco salad is to crush up the corn chips or tortilla bowl and mix the pieces in with the salad, then eat the salad with a fork.
You can also use the tortilla chips to scoop up bites of salad, and use the tortilla bites like an edible spoon.

, Tuna, egg, and chicken salads are creamy salads made with one of those ingredients and mayonnaise. They can also be mixed with other ingredients, such as spices, celery, nuts, and onions. These salads can either be eaten alone with a fork, or they can be made into a sandwich.Take two pieces of bread and either leave them plain or toast them according to your taste.
Spread a thick layer of tuna, egg, or chicken salad on one piece of bread, and place the second piece of bread on top of the salad. Garnish with lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles if you like.
Instead of sandwiches, these salads can also be served spread on crackers. Use a knife to spread small amounts of salad onto individual crackers.

, While potato salad is usually creamy like tuna or egg salad, pasta salad usually has an oil-based dressing. Both are served cold or warm, and are eaten with a fork.


Potato salad is made with boiled potatoes that are cut into bite-sized pieces. It is usually mixed with mayonnaise or another cream sauce, and combined with ingredients such as onions or chives, eggs, bacon, and spices.
Pasta salad uses boiled pasta, such as bowties or penne noodles, that are mixed with oil, spices, vegetables, and greens.

, This Italian salad is made with fresh mozzarella, raw slices of tomato, fresh basil, and a simple balsamic or olive oil dressing.The cheese and tomatoes are usually layered, and you can eat this salad with a knife and fork. Use your knife to cut off a small bite that has cheese, tomato, and basil. Dip the bite in some of the dressing before eating your bite.

Make sure your tractor is in good operating condition.,
Use a mower that is the correct size and configuration for your tractor.,
Adjust the sway chains/implement stabilizers so the mower cannot swing too far when turning corners.,
Check the condition of your mower.,
With the tractor ""Off"", Hook up your mower and connect the PTO shaft.,
Crank your tractor, engage the clutch fully (tractors usually have two stage clutches, so the clutch must be fully depressed to disengage the PTO), and engage your PTO.,
Use the three point hitch hydraulics to raise the mower to the desired cutting height, and select a gear appropriate for the cutting job you are doing.,
Begin mowing.,
Select your mowing route in the field or area you are mowing, and follow it either in return row or circular configuration, which ever is more efficient.,
Listen to the tractor engine, and observe the exhaust, if your tractor has a diesel engine.,
Watch for obstacles in the vegetation you are mowing.,
Keep an eye on the gauges.,
Keep the mower deck ground rails from plowing, or digging into the earth.,
Use care if mowing under tree limbs or other overhead hazards.,
Understand the limits of what your mower can cut effectively.,
Keep an eye out for insects.,
Enjoy your mowing job.",How to Use a Rough Cut Mower," Since rough mowing may require going into brushy or bushy areas, you may want to modify the tractor to protect the front end components, such as the steering linkages and radiator screen to protect these from limbs or other hazards.;
, The manufacturers of rough cut mowers build and rate them according to two criteria:


Gearbox horsepower (torque). A 50 horsepower tractor will likely damage a 25 horsepower mower gearbox under heavy load, and a 30 horsepower tractor cannot operate a large mower equipped with a 90 horsepower gearbox. A good fit is no more than 10% difference in tractor/mower horsepower rating.
Cutting width. Smaller tractors, obviously, will handle only smaller sized mowers. For a typical 25 horsepower tractor, a 5 foot (1.5 m) mower is recommended, where a 40 horsepower tractor should be able to handle a 6 foot (1.8 m) mower, and larger tractors can handle proportionally larger mowers.

, A mower deck can swing far enough, in certain cornering situations, to hit the rear tires of the tractor, possibly ruining it. If using a flex-wing cutter, be sure to adjust the safety chains on the draw bar so there is enough slack for turning.

, Keeping the mower in good condition will decrease the chance of a breakdown while you are mowing. Some things that may need attention:


Gearbox lubrication. Typical gear boxes have two pipe thread type plugs built into the housing. One, at the top, is the fill hole, another, on the side, is the fill level. Check oil level in the gear box and if needed remove both plugs, and pour oil in the upper hole until it begins to trickle out the lower one, then replace both plugs.
Ground wheel condition. The ground wheel supports the rear of the mower to keep it from digging into the dirt if the mower is operated in unlevel conditions. It should swivel easily so the mower follows when the tractor turns, and the wheel should turn freely on its axle. Lubricate the grease fittings on this assembly, and make sure no debris is tangled around the wheel hub or axle. Also check your tail wheel chains (if your cutter has them) to be sure they are in good condition.
Power take-off connector or ""PTO"". Usually, this is a splined connection with a pin or spring-loaded locking mechanism to hold it in place. There are several sizes of PTO shafts; if you have the correct tractor/mower combination, you will be able to slide the mower drive shaft onto the tractor PTO shaft without trouble. Lubricating the splines on this assembly makes it easier to make the connection when changing out equipment.
Universal joints. These are similar to the U-joints on a car or truck, and allow the drive shaft to travel without bending while it is rotating. Make sure the universal joints are tight and grease them if they have grease fittings. Also make sure the PTO shaft guards are in place and safety chains are attached to both the tractor and the implement when operating. This will prevent vegetation from getting wrapped around them while cutting in dense areas.
Top-link connection. The top link on a rough cut mower is not a fixed length, as are most other farm implements. This is because the ground wheel raises and lowers the rear of the mower to follow the ground contour, and the top link would bind if it were a fixed length. Make sure the top link adapter on your mower allows several inches of free travel, while still allowing the mower to be lifted clear of the ground while turning. If, while cutting, you notice the mower still has to much ""free travel"" take up more slack on the top link.
Mower blades. A 5 foot (1.5 m) rough cut mower is usually equipped with two 24 inch (61.0 cm) blades, attached to the blade mounting plate under the mower deck. These should be balanced and sharp for good, clean, and vibration free service. If blades are worn bad on the edges it is best to just replace them with a new set instead of trying to sharpen a badly worn set and getting them balanced.
The blade mounting plate. Make sure the bolts or studs that attach the blades are tight. This should also be equipped with a stump jumper, to lift the bottom of the gearbox/blade assembly clear of stumps or other obstacles.

, Make sure the shaft locking mechanism engages, to prevent the shaft from vibrating loose while operating. Check any shaft guards to be sure they are in safe operating condition.

, Make sure your engine is not at idle because it will load the engine to much if you engage the PTO. A little above low idle is best because it will not load the engine as bad. Let out the clutch slowly until you feel the PTO start to engage. The blades on the mower are hinged so you want to engage them slowly until centrifugal force slings them out then you can go ahead and bring your engine up to operating speed. The mower blades should begin turning. If there is any problem, disengage the PTO immediately.

, For light weeds/grass, you may choose to operate in a gear that gives a ground speed of about 7 mph (11 km/h). In the tractor in the photos, this would be 6th gear. For heavy weeds, brush, or mowing crops after they are finished, a 4 mph (6.4 km/h) speed may give better results, so 5th gear may be used. Also your power to your PTO will change with different gears so be mindful of that when choosing a gear.

, Keep the wheel aligned with the direction you want to travel. This may seem obvious, but in a large field with no rows or other features to guide a tractor operator, the machine may drift. It sometimes helps if you are operating in a large field to pick a reference point across the field and keep the tractor lined up with whatever it may be.

, A circular mowing path is usually more efficient.

, Black smoke or a reduction of engine speed may mean you are overloading the engine. You should not exceed the limits of your tractor when mowing, doing so can cause premature failure of drive train components. If the tractor is lagging, losing power, or otherwise struggling with its load, either reduce the mower cut by raising the mower, raise the RPM of the engine if you are not already operating at full power, or drop to a lower gear to reduce the tractor speed. A reduction in tractor speed will not only give the tractor more time to cut it will also provide more power to the PTO.

, Stumps, holes, or large rocks can ruin a mower, and hitting a large hole with a tractor wheel can cause the driver to be thrown from the machine. Each pass gives you an opportunity to look at the next cutting path as you pass. If you do happen to hit a rock or a stump always shut down to check for damage before continuing—even if everything seems to be OK. Little problems can turn into big issues quick.

, Watch carefully, the engine temperature, oil pressure, and fuel gauges to ensure these stay in appropriate ranges. Mowing large vegetation can put a considerable strain on a tractor cooling system, and debris falling from the vegetation can obstruct the radiator screen. If the tractor starts running hot, more than likely, the radiator fins are clogged with debris. The best way to remedy this situation is to use an air blower (if possible) and blow in the opposite direction of the air flow of the radiator fan to clean out the fins.

, Even when properly adjusted for level ground, occasionally, a skid plate will dig into the soil when crossing a small contour, and earth and vegetation can accumulate at the corner of the mower deck. These accumulations can quickly become huge masses and soon cause cutting problems. Glancing back at the mower deck frequently will allow you to monitor and maintain the deck height and adjust the height when needed.

, Not only can these obstructions break off a muffler or bend the sheet metal of your tractor, you can actually be swept off the machine. Slow down when approaching any obstacle, and be prepared to stop.

, Because people refer to rough cut mowers as Brush Hogs, they often assume the mower is capable of cutting bushes. To some extent, this is true, but if you are inexperienced or doubt the tractor/mower's ability to handle large, thick bushes, avoid them. Also, when cutting thick brush, the mower is more likely to throw dangerous debris. Always be aware of what is around you if you do decide to tackle some thick brush.

, When mowing under trees, it is common to find yourself wrapped up in spider webs, and not too unusual to find a spider stuck on your hat or glasses. Ground bees (yellow jackets), wasps, and hornets are other hazards, and tractors are not the fastest escape vehicles for avoiding these painful pests when you encounter them. In the extreme event you have to leave your tractor suddenly to avoid these pests, make sure you pause long enough to pull the kill switch or at least take it out of gear. DO NOT LEAVE THE OPERATOR SEAT WHILE PTO IS IN GEAR.

, Nothing beats the smell of fresh mowed grass under a clear blue sky. Remember, some jobs are hustle and bustle, but that is not the tradition of agricultural life. Take your time and at the end of the day be proud of all you have accomplished.

Lubricate pivot points.,
Sharpen blades.,
Tighten bolts and screws.",How to Care for Lawn Tools2," Prevent any tools that utilize a pivot (like shears) from getting stuck in place during use. Clean the blades thoroughly to remove any sap or debris that might find its way into the pivot point. Once they’re dry, add a couple drops of lubricating oil to the pivot point.Don’t use spray cans for this. These oils tend to evaporate pretty fast. You want to apply drops rather than a quick spray so the oil has time to penetrate the pivot’s parts and settle in.

, Rub them down with lubricating oil. Then file the blades with a flat mill file. For best results, hold the file at a 20 to 45 degree angle with the blade’s sharp edge as you work. For an even sharper blade, follow up by doing the same with a whetstone.Do so at the start of the spring season so all of your blades are ready to go when you need them. Repeat as needed if any begin to dull over the course of the spring, summer, and fall.

, Expect these to work loose over time. Inspect your tools at the start of the spring season, or at the end of fall, before you store them away for the winter. Tighten each loose bolt and screw you find to make sure everything is secure when you use the tool next."

Ensure safe operation by always deferring to the owner’s manual for that exact tool.If you aren’t confident in your ability to address any issues with your machine, bring it to a professional repair shop.

, Refer to the owner’s manual for your mower, tractor, trimmer, or any other tool that requires oil. Always follow its directions regarding the amount needed for safe operation. Be aware that both too little and too much oil will result in insufficient lubrication of internal parts., Expect these to lose efficiency after 100 hours of active use. On average, this equates to every four years for residential use, but this will vary depending on the frequency of use and the size of your lawn. Keep track of how long you typically use each tool and how often. Replace spark plugs as you near the 100-hour mark., At the start of the spring season and/or winter, give your machine a thorough look over. Identify any parts that need replacing, cleaning, sharpening, tightening, or lubricating. Repeat periodically throughout the growing season. Depending on the tool in question, these could be:Mowers: pull cords; power cords; blades; air filters; belts; chain drives.
Tractors: batteries; cables; electrical connections; blades; tires; belts; chain drives; air filters.
Trimmers: blades; nuts; bolts; debris shields; air filters.
Tillers: air filters; tines; tires; levels; connections; nuts; bolts.

, Prevent damage by inspecting the area in which you will be working. Identify and remove any materials that may cause damage if they come in contact with your tool. For instance:Running your mower over rocks, bricks, branches, or anything tougher than grass can damage the blades and deck. Not only that, but shrapnel could injure you and/or other parts of the machine, such as the power cord if the mower is electric.

, Cover the pie with a flaky pie crust and bake until golden brown. This is a one dish meal, both filling, delicious and healthy. This is also known as a Deep Dish Pie, since it is baked in a deep dish so that the gravy and cut up ingredients do not spill over on the plate. Eat this pie with a fork as well as a spoon, one to pierce the chicken, and the other to scoop up the veggies and gravy.

, The bottom crust only has to be baked, and then it is topped by the filling desired. One of the most popular bottom crust only pie, that is consumed as a meal is quiche. This of course is eaten with a fork and if you add a salad on the side, makes a delicious and healthy lunch., Tarts are made in two sizes, large or small, and contain various fresh fruits. This type of pie is eaten with a fork, and is enjoyed as a desert, served with either hot tea or coffee, and topped with whipped cream if desired., This alternative cheesecake has no cheese, just tofu, juice, berries, and walnuts, pumpkin or spices. This makes a delicious pie, and is eaten with a fork.

, In fact, if you have the ingredients, it will take you longer to read about it than to make it, and you'll use no more dishes than it takes to eat the oatmeal.

, If you want a crispy top, brush top of pastry with a little milk and sprinkle with some sugar.

, Add ice cream and/or whipped cream on top, serve with a hot cup of coffee or tea, and sit back and rejoice in yet another holiday dinner enjoyed with family and friends.

Begin lunch and dinner with soup.,
Sip soup throughout the meal.,
Choose soup as snacks.",How to Use Soup to Prevent Overeating1," Starting lunch and dinner with soup can help prevent you from overeating during the meal. Soup helps provide you with nutrients, like protein and fiber, that help fill you up.The broth in the soup can help fill you up before you eat so you don’t eat too much.
Try egg drop or black bean soup as an appetizer, for example.;
, If you don’t want to eat a bowl of soup before your meal, you can instead eat soup alongside your meal. Soups and the vegetables in them are full of water, which helps fill you up with fewer calories.Have a cup of broth or vegetable soup with your meal to add nutrients and to help reduce overeating. You may want to try chicken soup, minestrone, or lentil soup.

, You can rethink your idea of snacks and have a bowl of soup. Instead of unhealthy chips, ice cream, or cakes, you can heat up some soup. This can help you avoid unhealthy snacks and keep you full longer.Look for soups that are sold in easy ""to-go"" containers, making heating and enjoying soup simple and fast — perfect for a snack.
Try tomato soup or chicken soup, for example.

Practice mindful eating.,
Stop eating when you stop feeling hungry.,
Check for satisfaction.,
Look for discomfort.,
Focus on your food.",How to Know when You're Full1," Mindful eating refers to the practice of paying attention to whether you are hungry or not. If you are hungry and have not eaten recently, have a snack or meal. If you are hungry but have just eaten a healthy serving of food, wait for a brief time, then reevaluate your hunger. If you continue to feel hungry, help yourself to another serving or half-serving., Many people find it easier to notice a lack of hunger, rather than a sensation of fullness. This is especially useful if you are dieting or trying to avoid overeating., After eating a meal, you might be able to detect your body's response as pleasure or satisfaction. This sensation is often accompanied by feelings of comfort, happiness, and an inner calm. Use your perceptive faculties to help you know when you are satisfied.Once you feel satisfied due to being full, you can multiply these feelings of dining satisfaction by pausing before eating another bite. Push your food away from you and go for a brief walk, even if it’s just around the block or around your house.
If you’re at a restaurant and cannot easily or immediately leave the dining room, go to the bathroom for a brief moment before returning to the table.

, If you’ve not been a mindful eater and have failed to detect feelings of satisfaction, there is one more way you can discover whether you are full. This involves feeling uncomfortable. Discomfort following a dining experience is often the result of consuming too much food. This discomfort will manifest as a pain in your gut and may feel as though your belly is being pushed out from the inside.Discomfort is a sure sign that you are not only full, but overly full.
If you feel that you need a breather before taking your next bite, this is a sign that you are uncomfortable or nearing discomfort due to fullness.
Another potential sign of discomfort is the need to unbutton your pants or remove your belt to allow your gut to expand.

, If you eat in a social environment, you’re more likely to be focused on conversation with your friends than on what you’re eating. However, this could cause you to miss the cues that indicate fullness. In order to avoid this, sit in a quiet environment when dining.Look at your food as you eat. If making your own food, plate it in an attractive way on bone-white ceramic plates/bowls. This presentation will help make the colors pop in an attractive way.
Additionally, do not watch TV or listen to the radio while eating.
Instead, focus on the taste and texture of your food as you chew. Enjoy the flavor of the food in your mouth.

Eat a larger portion of soup.,
Take your time eating the soup.,
Limit canned soups.,
Create healthy soups.",How to Use Soup to Prevent Overeating2," Portion control is one of the major ways to not overeat. If you have trouble overeating even when you try to control your portions, try making your soup a larger portion of your meal. This can help you refrain from eating too much of the other foods.For example, try fixing your plate with your healthy portion sizes. Then, start with a cup of soup. If you finish your meal and are still hungry, eat an additional half cup of soup instead of dessert or a snack.

, Soups generally take longer to eat than other foods. Take your time eating the soup instead of trying to slurp it down quickly. Eating your food more slowly can help you avoid overeating by giving your body time to tell your brain you are full.You can try eating your soup 15 minutes before you eat your meal. Sip slowly and enjoy the tastes instead of rushing to get to the main course.

, Eating canned soups too frequently can be unhealthy. Canned soups are full of unnecessary salts and may contain additives, chemicals, and preservatives that are unhealthy. Look for low-sodium canned soups or make your own. An easy recipe is just combining no sodium broth, vegetables, and a lean meat.You can put low-fat steak or chicken breast in no sodium added vegetable broth, then add carrots, kale, and black beans for a quick, easy soup.
You can also make pureed vegetable soup. Start by cooking the vegetable in broth until it is soft and cooked. Then puree it into a soup. Try making puree soup with carrots, beets, spinach, kale, broccoli, or butternut squash.

, When adding soups to your meals to help control your eating, you should make sure the soups you eat are healthy. This means you should avoid soups that contain a lot of cheese or are cream-based, like cream of broccoli, cream of chicken, or chowders. Instead, make soups that are water or broth-based.


Choose vegetable, beef, or chicken broth or stock to use as a base. Try to choose broths that have reduced or low sodium and no artificial ingredients. Consider making your broth yourself by boiling chicken bones.
Look for healthy soups that are broth and water-based and filled with vegetables.

"
"
Include protein with your soup.,
Add fiber-filled foods.,
Throw in whole grains.",How to Use Soup to Prevent Overeating3," Eating protein helps you feel full and satisfied. To help prevent overeating, include some type of protein with your soup. This is not limited to meat, but can also include beans or whole grains.Add kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, and other beans for protein. Beans make really good additions to soups.
Making a soup with reduced-fat dairy, like 2% milk and reduced-fat sour cream, can add protein without a lot of extra fat and calories.
Put low-fat steak or ground beef, lean chicken or turkey, pork, or shrimp for added flavor and protein.

, Soups can help you not to overeat by helping you fill up on fiber. Fiber keeps you full without adding excessive calories. Adding a variety of vegetables and beans to your soup can provide your needed fiber content.All vegetables contain fiber, but you may want to include greens, like kale or spinach, carrots, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, squash, or asparagus.

, Whole grains can help you feel more full and satisfied. They also increase fiber content and help with digestion. Include healthy sources of whole grains. Do not add white pasta or white rice, which are unhealthy carbs.You can try adding brown rice, quinoa, farro, or bulgur. You can also try whole wheat pasta or a garnish of whole wheat tortillas.

Slice the oranges thinly.,
Boil the oranges.,
Cook the oranges and seeds in lightly salted water.,
Boil the mixture with sugar.,
Remove the seed pouch and chill a saucer in the freezer.,
Check for doneness.,
Add Scotch and vanilla, if desired.",How to Use Sour Oranges1," Slice the oranges crosswise around the middle (not on the stem ends). Do this for the Seville oranges and navel orange.;
, Nestle a non-reactive mesh strainer into a bowl. Remove the orange’s seeds as you squeeze the oranges over the strainer. Tie the seeds securely in cheesecloth or muslin, and set the pouch aside.Seeds are high in pectin, which will give your marmalade the texture of a rich jelly.

, With a chef’s knife, cut each piece of orange into three parts. Leave the rinds on. Dice the parts into cubes as thinly as you can. Slice and dice the navel orange the same way.The pieces should be no bigger than 1/3 of an inch (0.85 cm) long., Add the orange pieces to a pot of water, and bring the water to a boil. Continue simmering until the oranges are cooked through. Drain the water out of the pot.Certain sour orange varieties are more resistant to cooking. Pre-boiling the orange pieces ensures that they will be fully cooked.
The oranges should be covered with water; an exact measurement is not needed.

, Pour into the pot with the oranges 10 cups (2.5L) of water, the squeezed juice, and a pinch of salt. Add the pouch with the seeds in it to the pot. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce it to a simmer. Continue cooking for twenty to thirty minutes, or until the peels are translucent.Once the peels are translucent, you can set the mixture aside overnight, if desired, to encourage the release of extra pectin.

, Stir 8 cups (1.6 kg) of sugar, then bring the mixture to a full boil. Reduce the heat so that the water maintains a gentle boil. Stir the mixture occasionally.Occasional stirring prevents the bottom of the mixture from adhering to the bottom of the pot and burning.

, Place a saucer in the freezer. After twenty minutes of the mixture boiling, remove the seed pouch with tongs and discard the pouch. Allow the mixture to boil for about twenty more minutes, stirring occasionally.Chilling a saucer will assist you with checking how well the mixture will gel.

, Check the mixture with a candy thermometer for a jelling point of 220°F (104°C). With a cooking spoon, put a bit of the stirred mixture on your chilled saucer. Place the saucer back into the freezer. After a few minutes, observe whether the mixture is slightly jelled. If not, cook the mixture a bit longer until it gels properly.After a few minutes in the freezer, the mixture should thicken somewhat, and wrinkle slightly to the touch.
The saucer is just to test a small amount of the marmalade to verify that it’s finished cooking.

, Remove the pot from heat, and stir in the Scotch. Place a piece of vanilla bean into the bottom of sterile jars. Refrigerate or can your marmalade."

Eat slowly.,
Pause before getting seconds.,
Eat regular meals.,
Sample a different flavor.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Know when You're Full2," As you eat, the stretch receptors in the stomach are activated. However, it takes time for these signals to reach your brain. Eating more slowly allows more time for your brain to receive these signals and you will, therefore, feel fuller after eating less.Plan on spending 15 to 30 minutes per meal., If you do not feel hungry, it doesn’t always mean that you’re not full. It takes about 20 minutes for the brain register that the stomach is full. In this time, the body produces leptin, a hormone that help you realize you are full.If you have just consumed a healthy portion of food but still do not feel full, it could be because your leptin production is still working to catch up to your stomach.
Distract yourself for a bit. Once you’ve eaten what you believe is (or should be) enough to make you feel full, get up and go do something else. Do the dishes, read a book, or call a friend. When you start doing something else, you will allow time for your leptin production to ramp up to the appropriate level.

, If you haven’t eaten at regularly spaced intervals throughout the day, you’ll likely have a harder time knowing when you are full when you finally do get around to eating. To avoid this, consume a hearty breakfast of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains with a small amount of lean protein like soy, seeds, or nuts. When you get hungry again, consume another meal (lunch) toward the middle of the day. Finally, consume dinner in the evening when you get hungry again.If your schedule makes it difficult to eat regular meals, pack a light snack like a banana or a bag of granola so you have something to stave off your hunger and somewhat correct your caloric deficit.

, If you believe you should be full but don’t quite feel truly full, it might be because you can’t get the lingering flavor of a great meal out of your mouth. This could confuse you into eating more. To avoid this, take a bite of something sweet (like mango or raspberries) or pop a peppermint. Replacing the flavor of your meal with a new flavor will interrupt your cravings for a second helping., Research suggests that if you don’t get enough sleep, you might not be able to accurately detect feelings of fullness. Aim for six to eight hours of sleep per night. Less than that could lead to overeating."

Drink water.,
Eat fibrous foods.,
Eat low-energy-dense foods (LEDFs).",How to Know when You're Full3," Water can fill the belly and help you increase feelings of fullness. Drink at least eight glasses of water per day and gulp water between bites of your meal.Liquid water is not the only way to increase your H2O intake. Fruits and veggies are primarily composed of water. Incorporate more produce into your diet in order to take advantage of its high water content.

, Fiber is the part of plant-based foods that you cannot digest. All fruits and vegetables are high in fiber. Whole-grain products (muffins, pastas, breads, and so on) are also high in fiber. Specific examples of high-fiber foods include:popcorn
apples
celery
bananas
whole-wheat toast

, LEDFs are foods that have high spatial volume but relatively low caloric counts. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins (such as soy, nuts, seeds, and beans) are all LEDFs.Choose LEDFs for a healthy snack. If you get hungry between meals, you can eat a snack to help you feel full. Snacks like carrot sticks, blueberries, and bananas make great snacks and will help you feel full longer than a processed snack like potato chips or candy bars.

Identify yucca plants.,
Remove the flowers at right time.,
Check for insects and snip.,
Wash the flowers and discard center bulb.",How to Eat Yucca1," Before you can pick any yucca flowers to eat, you have to be able to locate them. The plants usually have tough, evergreen leaves that are shaped like swords and grow on tall, fibrous stalks. In ideal conditions, yucca can grow to up to 30-feet tall. Its ornamental, edible flowers are white and bell-shaped. They sprout off the plant’s stalks in clusters, and typically bloom in late spring and early summer.You’ll find the yucca plant in the Southern and Western parts of the United States, including New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, and California. It also grows in Central and South America.
When the flowers are first starting to bloom, there may be a greenish tint to their petals.
The flowers also produce a light, sweet fragrance that can attract insects.;
, Timing is everything when you’re picking yucca flowers for to eat. When the blooms are older, they can take on an unpleasant, bitter taste. For the best flavor, you should eat the flowers within the first two to three days of their opening.When you pick yucca flowers at their freshest, they usually have a mild, sweet taste that is similar to asparagus or artichokes.
It’s a good idea to taste the petals of one of the yucca before you begin harvesting a large number of flowers. That way, you won’t waste your time picking a bunch of blooms that are too bitter to be eaten.

, Yucca flowers produce a nectar that is appealing to a variety of insects, including ants. There is also a moth that serves as the flowers’ only pollinator, which lays its eggs in the flowers. That means you may find larvae on the flowers, which you don’t want to eat. Examine each flower that you’re planning to harvest to make sure that there are no insects present before cutting them off the stalk.You can use garden shears to clip the flowers off the plant, but the stems aren’t usually that thick so regular scissors can work well too.
If you’re harvesting a large number of yucca blooms, it helps to have a bag that you can cut the flowers directly into it so you don’t drop any.

, Even if the yucca plants were grown on your property where you know pesticides weren’t used, you must clean them before you eat them. Shake them to remove any insects that you might not have seen, and then wash under a fine mist or jet of water.Next, remove the center bulb, along with the stamens and pistils, from each flower because it has a bitter taste.If you want to keep the petals intact and are concerned about the washing process damaging them, you can also set them in a strainer inside a large bowl of water and let them soak.
After washing the flowers, make sure to drain them carefully. Place them on paper towel to dry, so it can absorb any excess moisture.

, For every four juiced oranges, mix in 1/4 cup sugar and 1½ cups water. Serve the juice ice-cold. Drink the juice plain, or mixed into a cocktail.Naranjada is a popular South American beverage.

, Mix a finely chopped clove of roasted garlic with three tablespoons of sour orange juice. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Rub the mixture onto meat or fish before cooking.For example, try this wet rub on grilled, baked or pan-fried fish.

, Use the juice when you want to make dressing.Try making a salad dressing with the juice of two sour oranges and one regular orange, a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, a cup of olive oil, one crushed garlic clove, half of a small red onion (finely chopped), and sea salt, to taste., For example, try pickling onions with sour orange juice. Add the pickled onions to gyros or tacos.Boil and drain two large red onions (thinly sliced). Combine the onions with 1½ cups sour orange juice, a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of salt.

Peel the oranges.,
Arrange thin pieces of peel on a baking sheet.,
Bake the peels.,
Cool and chop the peels.,
Submerge bagged tea in hot water.",How to Use Sour Oranges3," Remove the orange part of the peel only by carving it away with a chef’s knife. You may find it easiest to peel in large, long pieces. Avoid picking up the white pith as much as possible.The white pith is bitter, thus you want to cut as much of the orange part only as you can.

, Use a large chopping knife, such as a Santoku knife. Cut the peel into long, thin strips. Lay parchment paper over the baking sheet before placing the peel down in a single layer., Warm your oven to a low setting, between 100 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (38 to 93 degrees Celsius).Keep the oven door cracked open, and check the peels frequently. Cook the peels until they stiffen and begin to curl.


The peels can change from dry to burnt quickly, thus you need to keep a close eye on them.
This process can take anywhere from twenty minutes to forty minutes or more.
Alternately, you can dry the peels in a food dehydrator.

, Remove the tray from the oven and allow it to cool. Cut the peels down to small pieces that resemble loose-leaf tea.


An exact size is not necessary; the peels may be finely or coarsely chopped.

, Boil water until it reaches 212°F (100°C).Fill an empty tea bag or sachet with the dried, chopped peel. Steep the bag of sour orange in a cup of hot water for six to seven minutes.Three cups of day daily, using one to two grams of dried peel, may soothe indigestion and heartburn by regulating stomach acidity."

Go for soft foods at first.,
Cut food into small pieces.,
Chew slowly.,
Consider steaming or cooking hard vegetables.,
Do not pick at your teeth after eating.",How to Eat With Separators in Your Mouth1," In order to manage the pain, it's recommended that you go for soft foods until your gums are less sore. This can also make it easier to chew slower and softer, preventing pain associated with biting too hard. Soft foods are easier to chew and less likely to get lodged between your teeth.Go for foods like mashed potatoes, yogurt, and hot cereal. Instead of eating raw fruits and veggies, try making a smoothie by mixing some of your favorite fruits and vegetables in a blender along with some juice.
As time goes by, you may feel less discomfort and be able to eat harder foods. Soft foods can help in the first few days as you're getting used to the feeling of separators.;
, Before you begin eating, it can help to cut food into small bits. Chewing can feel awkward and painful when you're first starting out with separators. Preparing small, bite-sized food can lessen the work for your teeth.Cut harder fruits and veggies, like apples and carrots, into tiny portions before eating. Do not try to bite into a whole apple on its own, or any other hard fruit.
You should remove meat from the bone before eating. It will be difficult to eat something like ribs or chicken wings from the bone with separators. You should also cut up meat into small bits before eating to make it easier to chew.

, It can be hard to get used to eating with separators as they often cause discomfort. It's a good idea to chew gently. Biting down hard can increase discomfort and pain, especially early on. When eating with separators, take small bites and chew your food slowly and softly., Vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet, but can be difficult to eat when adjusting to separators. As soft foods are generally better to eat, it's a good idea to steam or cook hard vegetables before eating. Go for steamed broccoli or cooked carrots as a side dish over raw varieties., After you eat, it can be tempting to pick at your teeth. At first, separators may feel awkward and can easily be mistaken for food caught between the teeth. Try to resist the urge to pick. Using your finger or a toothpick to pick at your teeth can cause a separator to fall out.In order to help resist the temptation to pick, try to avoid foods, like popcorn and raspberries, that often get caught in your teeth. Stay away from these kinds of snacks until you're used to your separators.

Finally, mix in some yucca flowers for color and flavor.You can leave the yucca flowers in tact as a garnish for the top of the salad, or toss the petals with the rest of the greens and herbs.
A light salad dressing, such as a simple vinaigrette, works best with this type of salad.
Mixing in other edible wild flowers, such as violets or dandelion petals, can add more color to your salad.
Other garden herbs you may want to consider for the salad include cilantro, basil, chamomile, and chives.

, Edible flowers make attractive garnishes for beverages, and the yucca flower’s attractive shape and white color make it an ideal candidate for dressing up your favorite drink. You can use them as a garnish in cocktails, such as a Bloody Mary, or use them to make a simple glass of iced tea appear more festive. If you’re having a party, consider floating some yucca flowers in a bowl of punch.If you don’t want to use the yucca as a garnish but still want to give your beverages a more decorative look, you can also freeze the petals inside ice cubes, and use them to keep your drinks cold.

, If you want to make the cake for a birthday party, shower, or any special occasion stand out a little more, consider decorating it with fresh yucca flowers. All you have to do is frost the cake with your favorite icing, and press the blooms into the frosting in whatever arrangement you like. For added interest, you can alternate the yucca with other edible flowers in different, such as pansies or violets.The yucca flowers will look best on a cake with frosting that is a different color, so there’s some contrast between the white blooms and the icing. If you’re using a vanilla or cream frosting, consider adding food coloring to tint it.
While you can obviously place the flowers on the top of the cake, don’t overlook the sides. You can create a striking look by pressing them all along the edges.
You can also use the yucca flowers to decorate cupcakes. In most cases, a single bloom will be enough to decorate each cupcake.

Boil the flowers.,
Fry the flowers.,
Mix the flowers into egg dishes.",How to Eat Yucca3," Raw yucca flower contain saponin, which is an ingredient used in soaps and cleansing agents. While it’s not toxic, some people experience a reaction from it, ranging from an upset stomach to a dry, irritated feeling in the throat.Fortunately, if you experience a reaction, you can remove the saponin by boiling the flowers. Fill a pot with enough water to cover all of the yucca flowers you’re preparing, and bring it to a boil. Add the flowers to the boiling water, and allow them to cook for approximately five minutes. Not only will the saponin be removed, the flowers will be more tender as well.Once you’ve boiled the flowers, you can use them as you would raw yucca, such as in salads, or incorporate them in other recipes that call for edible flowers, such as soups and stews.

, If you can’t quite sell your family on eating yucca raw or even boiled, deep frying the flowers may help convince them to give it a try. Pull the petals off the flowers, gather stacks of 3 to 4 petals, and dip them in tempura batter. Heat a pot of your favorite oil for deep frying to 360 degrees and drop the stacks of petals into the oil one at a time, letting them fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.For a basic tempura batter, combine ½ cup flour, ½ cup cornstarch, ⅛ teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon salt. Mix in 1 cup sparkling water and 1 egg yolk, and you’ll have enough batter for the petals from 12 to 15 yucca flowers.
When you remove the fried flowers from the oil, place them on a plate or tray that’s lined with paper towel. It will absorb the excess oil, so the yucca isn’t too greasy.
Hot sauce makes an ideal dipping sauce for deep fried yucca.
If you aren’t a fan of deep fried foods, you can also add yucca petals to your favorite stir fry recipe.

, Yucca flowers are often used to complement eggs in dishes such as omelets and frittatas. You can simply toss raw petals into the ingredients for your favorite egg dish, or sautee them along with other ingredients, such as onions, garlic, mushrooms, and herbs before adding them to the omelet or frittata.In Mexico and Central America, it’s common to mix yucca petals into scrambled eggs or fried eggs dishes, such as huevos rancheros.

Do not eat anything sticky.,
Minimize your sugar intake.,
Stay away from hard foods.,
Do not chew ice.,
Take precautions with corn on the cob.",How to Eat With Separators in Your Mouth2," Sticky foods should be completely avoided when you have separators. Sticky food can glob onto separators and pull them out. Things like gummy candy, toffee, caramel, gum, and anything else with a sticky texture should be avoided until you're no longer using separators., Sugary foods and beverages, like candy and soft drinks, are generally bad for teeth.Since you can't floss while wearing separators, these types of food are even more hazardous, and may cause more decay in your teeth.It's a good idea to minimize sugar intake until you separators or braces are removed.


If you do have a treat with sugar in it, brush your teeth and rinse with water and mouthwash afterwards. If some of the spaces in your teeth do not have separators, you should floss those as you normally would.

, Hard foods are particularly difficult to eat when separators are in place. Pretzels, tortillas, hard candies, nuts, crusted bread, and other harder foods should be avoided until you're used to your separators., Many people habitually chew ice from a beverage. You should avoid this habit when you have separators in. Ice can dislodge separators, and may also increase pain., Corn on the cob is a favorite side dish for many, but you should be careful when eating with separators. Chewing corn straight off the cob can easily dislodge your separators, and the hard biting motions can cause discomfort. If corn on the cob is being served, carefully cut the kernels off the cob with your knife before eating."

Talk to your orthodontist if a separator falls out.",How to Eat With Separators in Your Mouth3," Separators are usually not in for long. You will usually have your separators removed at your next orthodontist appointment, when your braces will be put in place. Up until this time, you should brush your teeth back and forth after eating. Brushing your teeth up and down can easily dislodge separators., Separators should not come undone during routine brushing. However, flossing can very easily dislodge a separator. After you eat, avoid flossing in the gaps between your teeth filled by a separator., You may feel some soreness after eating when using separators. You can manage pain with over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen. Take the recommended dose on the bottle. This should take care of some of the pain., Separators sometimes fall out. This can be normal. Remember, separators serve to create space in your teeth for braces. If a separator falls out on its own close to your braces appointment, this means the space has been made. However, if a separator falls out 4 days or more before your appointment, call your orthodontist's office. Losing a separator this soon means you likely accidentally dislodged it via flossing, brushing, or eating. You may need your orthodontist to add a new separator."

Prepare a hot toddy.Mix the ugli juice with rum and a sweetener.,
Mix up a smoothie.If blended with sugar, ice, and other fruit or juices, ugli fruit can be made into a tasty and tangy fruit smoothie.",How to Eat Ugli Fruit," Ugli fruit are only available from December through April, and you might need to go to a specialty food store to find them.


The ugli fruit is actually another name for the Jamaican tangelo. It was discovered in Jamaica and became one of the country's exports starting in 1914.
While the fruit is imported to the United States, its supply is fairly limited, so it can be somewhat expensive. On average, it costs two to three times more than a grapefruit costs.
Check with stores in your area known for having a wider variety of international goods, including imported produce. Many standard grocery stores may not carry ugli fruit, and local farmers' markets will almost never offer them.;
, You cannot tell how ripe an ugli fruit is based on its color. Instead, you should look for a fruit that feels heavy for its size and has a slight give when pressed at the blossom end with the tip of your thumb.This fruit lives up to its name, and most agree that it looks ugly from the outside. The skin is yellow-green with occasional hints of orange, and thickest at the neck end. It looks a little like a mandarin orange, but it has larger pores and a knobby or lumpy appearance.
Do not worry about surface scarring, uneven coloring, or loose skin. None of this says anything about the quality of the fruit.
Most ugli fruits are fairly large, but smaller ugli fruits tend to have more flavor and more sweetness. The diameter ranges from 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm).
If there are any soft spots or brown spots on the fruit, gently press them with your thumb. If your thumb goes through, the fruit is spoiled.
The fruit should have a little give, especially at the blossom end, but it should not be mushy.

, You should eat ugli fruit within five days if kept at room temperature. If you refrigerate it, however, you can store it for up to two weeks.


The fruit does not need to be stored in a container of any type.
Check the fruit daily to make sure that it is not going bad. Look for developing soft spots, and press into these soft spots with your thumb to see if the skin breaks. If the skin does break, the fruit may already be overripe and partially rotten.

, Rinse the ugli fruit under cool running water and pat dry with clean paper towels. Even though you will not be eating the peel, you will be handling it as you eat the fruit, so having a clean peel and clean hands is still important.

, Cut it in half, loosen the segments, and eat it straight out of the peel with a spoon.When you cut the ugli fruit open, the inside should look similar to that of an orange, but the fruit should appear slightly fleshier than an orange would.
Unlike grapefruit, the ugli fruit is sweet enough on its own and does not need any added sugar. If you do add sugar to the fruit, you may even find it too sweet.
An ugli fruit can be enjoyed in this manner as a simple, light breakfast.
If you want to use the fruit for a light yet exotic lunch or dessert, you can cut it in half and drizzle it with a bit of sherry or kirsch before enjoying it.

, The segments can be eaten one by one.


The skin is thick yet loose and puffy, so you should be able to remove it with your fingers.
There are seldom any seeds, so you should not have to worry about removing seeds before enjoying the fruit.
The segments inside the fruit are also easy to separate, and you should be able to separate those with your fingers, as well.
Enjoy the fruit in this manner as a snack or side dish to your breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

, Like many citrus fruits, ugli fruit works well in cold dishes like tossed salads with mixed dark greens or tropical salads.


For a simple chopped salad, use various leafy greens, like green leaf lettuce, curly endive, lamb's lettuce, and spinach. Consider adding complementary fruits, like strawberries, or other accents like sliced almonds, crumbled blue cheese, or granola. Avoid adding too many other flavors, though, since they could run the risk of clashing with the flavor of the ugli fruit.

Regarding dressings, opt for mild or tangy vinaigrettes.


For a simple fruit salad or tossed fruit dish, combine the ugli fruit with other tropical vegetables or complementary vegetables, like mango, pineapple, strawberry, or grape. Avoid adding other tangy citrus fruits, like mandarin oranges, since the tastes are too similar.
In addition to using ugli fruit in cold mixed dishes, you can also use it as a garnish for certain desserts, like cheesecake.

,


In fact, as a type of tangelo, the ugli fruit is actually a hybrid of the grapefruit (or pomelo) and the mandarin orange.
The flavor is closer to the taste of an orange than the taste of a grapefruit, but it has a tangy note that oranges lack. Typically, these fruits are very juicy and sweet.

, The peel and juice of the ugli fruit can be used to make marmalade, just like oranges can be used for marmalade.


Combine one chopped ugli fruit with 3/4 cup (180 ml) white sugar and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) ugli fruit zest in a saucepan. Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently, ad cook for 7 to 10 minutes. When done, the marmalade should lose its watery properties and should become thick and glossy., If you use ugli fruit in a cooked dish, like a stir-fry,you should add the prepared segments at the end of the cooking process to avoid breaking them down.


Ugli fruit segments work well in a stir-fry with a sweet sauce and sweet vegetables, like bell peppers. Cook all of the other ingredients first and add the segments during the last 5 minutes, stirring them gently and keeping them over the heat just long enough to warm them without causing them to burst.
You could also use the fruit segments as a garnish for roasted duck, ham, or other meats prepared with a tropical or citrus fruit glaze. Let the ugli fruit sit out at room temperature before using it as a garnish, or garnish the meat with the fruit and pop it back into the oven for another 5 minutes to let the segments warm up.

, Freshly squeezed ugli juice can be mixed with water and sugar to make a drink similar to lemonade.


Make a simple syrup by combining 1/2 cup (125 ml) white sugar with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water and heating the mixture in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Once the sugar dissolves, transfer the syrup to a pitcher and add 1 cup (250 ml) freshly squeezed ugli fruit juice to the mixture.
Add 3 to 4 cups (750 to 1000 ml) cold water to the pitcher and stir well to combine all the ingredients. Chill until ready to serve.

, Warm it up for a sharp, sweet, and comforting treat.


Squeeze the juice from two ugli fruit using a juicer. Place this in a saucepan along with 2 oz (60 ml) dark rum, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) honey. Heat it over medium heat until the honey has dissolved.
To serve, remove the drink from the heat, sprinkle in a bit of cinnamon (if desired), and serve in two clean mugs.

,


Peel and quarter one ugli fruit, then peel and slice one banana. Add these to a bender with 1/4 cup (60 ml) pineapple juice, 1/4 cup (60 ml) milk, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) white sugar or honey. Blend together until smooth, add 8 ice cubes, and blend again until the ice is crushed.

This will make about four servings, which should be enjoyed immediately.


You could also experiment with your own variations. Any flavor you might pair with citrus will likely work, including strawberry, mango, or other tropical fruit or citrus fruit.

Cool down the burn.,
Soak up the heat.,
Wait out the pain, and treat other symptoms if they arise.",How to Eat Spicy Food," It is always best to know your adversary before going into battle, right? Chiles are perceived as hot or spicy to us because they contain the chemical capsaicin, which enters your bloodstream and essentially convinces your body that your temperature is rising.This helps explain the sweating, flushing, and occasional light-headedness that can accompany eating spicy foods.
Carried in oils in chiles, capsaicin is also a skin and mucous membrane irritant.
Capsaicin is a natural defense mechanism developed by certain plants to prevent mammals from eating them.Most mammals take the hint and move on, but not us.;
, Are humans just not as smart as mice, pigs, and other mammals? It probably has more to do with our brain makeup.


Our brain neurons responsible for pleasure and pain are adjacent and possibly interconnected. This helps explain why many people get a rush out of risky behavior, especially when they can experience danger/pain without much risk, such as in eating spicy food., People tend to assume that spicy foods cause ulcers, heartburn, and other gastrointestinal discomforts, but in fact there is no real evidence to support this. If they have this effect on you, it is likely just a sensitivity you have, like others may have to dairy, fatty foods, etc.Indeed, there is growing scientific evidence that spicy foods are good for you: they may help you consume less calories by reducing sweet/salty/fatty cravings; increase calorie burning by increasing your body’s perceived core temperature;have beneficial impacts on cardiovascular health and cholesterol levels; and, surprisingly enough, reduce gastric acid production., Pepper spray does indeed contain capsaicin, the same thing in those chiles you want to add to your dinner plate. So don't treat them lightly, unless you want a taste of what it is like to be pepper sprayed.


Use gloves when preparing chiles. Or, at very least, wash your hands thoroughly after handling them.
Protect your eyes and other sensitive areas. Consider eyewear when cutting chiles. Do not rub your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands.
For that matter, if you need to use the bathroom or have an itch in a sensitive area, make sure you wash your hands before (and after!).
The hottest parts of a chile are the seeds and the inner membranes (usually white) that hold them in place. This is where most of the capsaicin is located.Scrape these away while preparing a chile if you want to tone things down.

, If you grew up on a meat and potatoes diet and don’t have much experience with chiles, allow your body to grow accustomed to spiciness slowly.


Add a little spice to common foods in your current diet. Add a shake of red pepper flakes to your soup, or put a splash of hot sauce in your ketchup.Serve diced peppers, or a chile-based sauce, on the side, and add it to your food as you eat. This gives you maximum control over the spiciness.

, If your buddy chows down on ghost peppers while you nibble on a bell pepper, it is likely that he has built up a tolerance for capsaicin over time. Slowly but steadily move up the ladder from milder to spicier chiles.You can train your body to adapt to hot weather, and you can do the same with hot chiles.


The Scoville Scale is the standard guide for heat in chiles. The more Scoville units, the more capsaicin, the spicier the chile. Use it as a guide on what chile to try next., Instead of thinking you can get the pain all over with at once by popping the whole pepper, take smaller bites, especially as you build up your tolerance. Dole out the capsaicin in smaller doses so your body can absorb it more efficiently.If you don’t overwhelm your taste buds with heat, you’ll be better able to appreciate the range of flavors in spicy dishes.

, Everybody is different. Like the guy who can drink you under the table without seeming the least bit buzzed or your friend who can eat as much as she wants without gaining a pound, some people can simply tolerate spicy foods better than others. The idea of “no pain, no gain” might urge you forward, but use common sense in deciding when you’ve maxed out your body’s adaptability to spiciness.If you seem to have reached a plateau as you work your way up the Scoville Scale, you may just want to accept that as your limit. Think of all the spicy foods you’ve already added to your eating repertoire.

, If not, you may want to pick some up along with your Thai take-out. Regular old milk, the more full-fat the better, is perhaps the ideal treatment for the burn of capsaicin.


Milk contains the protein casein, which works to wash capsaicin molecules away from the nerve receptors in your mouth.Cold milk provides a cooling effect for the burning sensation.
Fats in milk coat the tongue and mouth, again providing a soothing effect and making the casein a more effective “cleaner.”
Other milk-based products will help as well. There’s a reason why Buffalo wings are traditionally served with ranch dressing, Mexican dishes often come with sour cream, and curries often have a yogurt sauce.

, Milk is best, but may not always be a viable option. If you’re lactose intolerant, or at a sports bar or on a date where ordering a tall glass of milk is not ideal, there are alternatives.


Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, meaning alcoholic beverages will help wash some of it (and its burn) away.So here’s your excuse to have a beer with those hot wings.
Capsaicin is also soluble in oil, so you can try swirling a little vegetable or olive oil in your mouth and spitting it out (at home, preferably). Also, foods with a higher fat content like dark chocolate might provide some relief.
Sugar water is another option, especially at home. Sweet (or salty, for that matter) flavors help mask the spice, and the sugar solution helps produce a coating, soothing effect as well. Add a tablespoon or so of sugar to a glass of water.This, like oil, works best as a rinse that you spit out.
Avoid plain water, as whatever cooling effect it may have is countered by the fact that it just redistributes the capsaicin around you mouth or down your throat.

, Cold soothes burns, whether caused by actual heat or capsaicin. You can pre-treat your mouth with something cold to help numb your nerve receptors, or use it after taking a spicy bite.


Try eating cold fruit (which contain sugars) or ice cream (which contains sugars and casein) along with your spicy dish.A milkshake might provide the best of all worlds -- cold, fat, sugar, coating effect, and good flavor to boot.
You can try ice chips to cool your mouth, but as they melt they will have the same capsaicin-spreading properties as a glass of water.

, Rice is served with spicy dishes all over the world. Part of the appeal is that starches like rice and bread can absorb some of the capsaicin before it can affect you.


Like a good sponge, light, airy, textured foods work best at sopping up capsaicin. Alternate bites of your chosen “sponge” with the spicy food. Some people rely on marshmallows., It may seem like the burn will never go away, but the effects of capsaicin on our bodies only lasts for about 15 minutes after we stop eating it.If other gastrointestinal issues arise -- acid reflux, heartburn, GERD, etc. -- treat them as you normally would. As noted, chiles have no unique impact on the digestive system that requires unique treatments.
Try chewable or liquid antacids, Pepto-Bismol, or other such treatments that tend to work for you. If you have frequent heartburn, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the range of over-the-counter and prescription pills now available, most of which are taken daily (before symptoms arise).
You can also take common sense measures like limiting your intake of heartburn-inducing foods; not eating spicy foods late in the evening, since reflux symptoms are usually worse at night; and letting gravity aid in your digestion by staying on your feet or, better yet, taking a walk."

, When the salted water reaches a steady boil, transfer the nettle pieces into the pot. Your goal here is to ""blanch"" the nettles — boil them for a short time — so that their stingers are inactivated.


This does not take very long — usually less than a minute.However, since the consequences for failure can be painful, some sources recommend blanching for up to five minutes.If you like, you can save the blanching water to use as a tea (see ""Serving Ideas"" below).

, Pour the blanched nettles into a pasta strainer. As soon as the hot water drains, use a set of tongs or a serving spoon to transfer them into a bowl filled with very cold ice water (ideally mostly ice). This technique (known as ""shocking"") stops the cooking process immediately. This is important to prevent the nettles from over-cooking, which can give them a texture that's a little too soft.

, As soon as the nettles are cold, you can transfer them out of the ice bath and back into the strainer. Toss them gently to drain the water, then let them sit for five minutes to dry somewhat.

, At this point, your vegetables are completely ready to eat. You can enjoy them as-is or use them in your favorite recipe the same way you'd use greens like spinach, arugula, and so on. If you want to store them, pack them in an airtight container before tossing them in the freezer.


There's no ""wrong"" way to eat nettles, but in the section below, we've provided a few recipe ideas. Feel free to get creative and make your own!

, Just like spinach and collard greens, nettles can be simply prepared in a pan to make a nutritious side dish. See below:


Heat butter in a frying pan. Toss in a few cloves of garlic and fry them for a few minutes.
When the garlic aroma is strong and the cloves are starting to brown, toss in a heaping handful of (chopped but unblanched) nettles. Use tongs or gloves to avoid stings!
Continue frying for a few minutes until the nettles are completely wilted and slightly browned. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Voila! A world-class, dinner-ready dish.

, Nettles are great on their own, but they're also good for adding roughage and texture to other dishes. For instance, try this easy garnish recipe that's great for steaks or other pieces of meat:


Blanch or sauté nettles (as above) to remove the stings.
Season warm nettles with butter, salt, and pepper.
Toss the wilted nettles on top of a steak for a new spin on a classic dish.
Alternatively, serve the nettles on the side tossed with other sweet, soft, cooked vegetables like carrot for a vegetarian side salad.

, If you've ever seen green pasta or tortillas, you've seen foods that have had spinach or kale added to the dough. You can do the same thing with nettles:


Pulse a handful of blanched nettles in a food processor to make a smooth paste.
Add the nettles to the dough with the other wet ingredients (egg, milk, etc.). Continue the recipe as normal — you can add a small amount of extra flour if the dough is too moist.
You can do this for basically any bread product — pasta, tortillas, bread, crackers, and much more.

, Though it's most famously made with basil, you can make pesto with virtually any greens. See below for an easy nettle recipe:


Pulse blanched nettles, walnuts (or pine nuts), olive oil, garlic, and parmesan cheese in food processor. Continue until you reach a smooth, even consistency.
Use the pesto as a creamy, decadent sauce that's great for pastas or dipping. One great recipe is available here. You can also substitute blanched nettles for basil in WikiHow's pesto recipe.
Pesto will turn brown when exposed to air, but this doesn't make it unsafe to eat as long as you store it in the fridge. To avoid this, cover the pesto with a layer of olive oil to prevent air from touching it.

, As noted above, the water from blanching the nettles can be kept as a tea. You may drink it immediately or filter it through a sieve to remove any lingering nettle bits. Sweeten with cream and sugar or drink plain for a zero-calorie treat. This tea won't provide any caffeine, but it's great as a relaxing drink later in the day.

, Nettles tend to grow in temperate areas where they can get plenty of sunlight. They are common along riverbanks and at the edge of woods. They also grow well near manmade features like ditches, train tracks, old farmland, and empty lots. They can be picked as soon as they appear in early spring (sometimes as early as January) until when they flower in the mid to late summer (June-September).This page contains a map showing the approximate habitat of nettles around the world.

, Nettles start out as small, green, leafy sprouts in the spring with a ""fuzzy"" or ""hairy"" texture — at this point, they may not be able to sting, but hand coverings are still a good idea. As the plant grows, it will reach three to six feet high within a few months. Look for the following telltale features:A thick covering of small, hollow needle-like stingers (careful — you don't want to touch these).
Large, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated (jagged) edge. The leaves are attached to the central stem with small stalks. The narrow ends of the hearts point outward from the central stem.
A ""twin"" pattern to the leaves. In other words, one leaf points to 12 o'clock and another at the same level points to 6 o'clock. The next set points to 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock. The next points to 12 and 6 again, and so on.
Leaves that get bigger as they get closer to the ground.

, As their name suggests, stinging nettles can be rather painful if you try to pick them unprepared. Their small, hollow stingers are quite sharp and work by injecting painful chemicals like formic acid into the skin, so you do not want to touch them. The stingers can even penetrate light fabrics, so wear a thick pair of jeans, close-toed shoes (boots are better), and multiple layers on your upper body to protect yourself.


Gloves are also a must. Thick, sturdy gardening gloves are best, but even these don't always offer perfect protection, so handle the nettles gently.

, Find a plant that is a healthy, vibrant green color. Use a set of scissors or garden clippers to cut off a section the plant at the stem. Put the severed section carefully into a sturdy canvas or plastic sack. Some experts recommend the top leaves for their more tender texture.


If you grab the plant, know that the stingers point from the base of the leaves to the tip, so you're most likely to get stung if you rub against the grain.
Some people use the roots for homeopathy/natural medicine, but, for the purposes of this article, we'll focus on the stem and leaves, which are eaten as food.

, Sooner or later, you're practically bound to get stung while picking nettles. Don't worry — the sting causes moderate pain and sometimes itching, but it's not excruciating. While you may be comfortable simply waiting for the sting to subside on its own after a few hours, you can also apply a topical ointment or take a few over-the-counter painkillers to dull the pain.


See our article on nettle stings for a variety of DIY sting remedies.
If you're in the wilderness without any pain-relieving supplies, you can try making a poultice from jewelweed, which also works well for poison ivy. See this page for more info., It's important to show respect for mother nature whenever you're picking plants for your own consumption. Use the following easy tips to minimize your environmental impact and ensure that plenty of nettles will remain for other organisms.Only harvest as much as you need. Keep in mind that nettles wilt and shrink when cooked (like spinach), but they tend to be quite filling.
Make a clean cut and only harvest about 1/3 of each plant so that they may heal and recover.
Try to harvest only about 1/20 of each nettle patch.
Harvest from the ""middle"" of the patch. Leave the biggest, best plants and the smallest, weakest ones.

,
Bake on the top rack of the oven, anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes.",How to Eat Pumpkin Seeds2," Although the methodology sounds a little strange, boiling the pumpkin seeds first lends them a full flavor. (And you don't even have to worry about waterlogged seeds.)








, For every half cup of pumpkin seeds you're roasting, use 2 cup of water and 1 teaspoon of salt.








, The best way to do this is by hand, although you can also use an old (cleaned) comb. Use the comb to separate the pumpkin seeds from the fibrous, fleshy parts.








, Remove and drain in a colander.








,, Small seeds will be brown and crispy after 5 to 7 minutes, medium seeds will take around 10-15 minutes, and large seeds could take as long as 20 minutes to cook. Allow to cool before eating.

Cut and eat with a knife and fork.,
Fold the slice in half.,
Remove all toppings and eat it bare.,
Eat the slice with no folding.,
Eat the crust first.,
Savor the crust for dipping.,
Stuff your own crust.",How to Eat Pizza," This is probably the most polite way in eating a pizza. It's also helpful in times where you have a load of toppings and want to taste everything in one bite.;
, Put the two sides together, so it'll create a ""U"" shape at the crust. If you have several loose toppings, especially at the bottom, you may need to either pick them off or hold them in place as you move it towards your mouth.

, If you want to eat the toppings separately than having it on the dough or picky with what came with the pizza, you may want to do this. Many pizza places have combo varieties, such as Pizza Hut's ""Meat Lover's"" where the whole pizza comes with six different kinds of meat products. What if you weren't specifically sure of the toppings and didn't like a particular one?

, Many people prefer this way since it's the easiest method to eat a slice. Despite if toppings fall off or the melted cheese stretches, things get devoured nonetheless. Just place the pointed end in your mouth and chomp away.

, Who said that pizza needs to be eaten from the bottom part? Bite into a piece of crust along with a piece of the actual pizza to blend both items together.

, Use your favorite dipping sauces, such as buttermilk or ranch dressing. For this, you must use dipping etiquette and go against ""double dipping"" if sharing with someone else. Break the crust in pieces, dip, and pop into your mouth.

, Take all or half of your cheese and toppings off the pizza slice, set them to the side and eat the rest of the slice - except for the crust. Then open your crust (works well with thick varieties), take out extra dough and put in your cheese and toppings. Fold to keep everything in and eat. This is good for people who aren't fond of plain crust but love pizza.

Hold your chopsticks sideways.,
Lift the rice from below.,
Lift the bowl up to your mouth.,
If you can, choose sticky rice.",How to Eat Rice with Chopsticks1," Rice can be particularly difficult to eat even if you master the chopstick technique above. In this section, you'll learn a few tricks for making this task easier. Start by taking the basic chopstick form and turning your hand 90 degrees to the side. Your chopsticks should now rest above your hand, rather than beside it. You should still be able to move the chopsticks together and apart easily.









This makes it easier to support balls of rice as you lift them up to your face. It's hard for the rice to fall between two horizontal sticks. On the other hand, it's a lot easier for it to fall to either side when it's balanced between two vertical sticks.;
, Picking up rice with chopsticks isn't so much a ""pinching"" motion as it is a combined ""scooping/pinching"" motion. To pick up some rice, hold your chopsticks open so that one is on either side of a good-sized clump. Bring the chopsticks together near the bottom of the clump and gently squeeze as you lift it upwards.









Lifting the rice from the bottom makes it easier to handle without dropping any. The more tightly-packed rice between the chopsticks supports the rice above it, turning your set of chopsticks into a sort of makeshift spoon.

, This is usually a big piece of the puzzle for people who are struggling with eating rice. Use the hand that isn't holding chopsticks to pick up the rice bowl and bring it a few inches from your mouth. Now, transfer rice from the bowl into your mouth with the pinching and scooping method above. Use the bowl to catch any mistakes. This doesn't just make the task much easier. It's also considered more polite in many countries that use chopsticks.








Note, however, that it's considered a little impolite to shovel food directly from the bowl into your mouth. Pick up pieces of rice and bring them into your mouth. Don't just put your lips to the bowl and move the rice toward your mouth.

, Not all rices have the same weight and texture. For the easiest results, try picking a short-grained white rice, which tend to form ""sticky"" clumps that are easier to pick up. By contrast, brown rice and long-grained white rice tends to stick to itself less, so it's much easier to drop or spill."

Don’t dress up.,
Prepare absorbent materials.,
Recognize a finger bowl.,
Pick a beverage.",How to Eat Ribs1," The handheld and saucy nature of ribs means that they’re an inherently casual food. They’re a staple of laid-back gatherings like cookouts. Respect their relaxed qualities (and the relaxed qualities of the party or venue you’re attending) by wearing comfortable and easy-to-wash clothes. T-shirts, cotton shirts, and denim are all appropriate choices.It’s probably smartest to avoid white or pastel colors.
If you’re a lipstick-wearing person, consider switching to lip balm for the evening (unless you’re going for the Joker look).;
, Ribs are delicious because they’re a fall-apart tender, barbecue-sauce-soaked food that you eat with your hands. These wonderful qualities also make them a rather messy treat. Get ready by making sure you have your preferred clean-up supplies at hand, which could include paper towels, paper napkins, or moist towelettes.


Some people wear bibs at restaurants or cookouts. This is okay if everyone else is doing it, but it might be eccentric to be the lone adult bib-wearer.A detergent pen (like a Tide To Go pen) is a useful thing to bring as well.
Bring extra moist towelettes for your friends--you’ll be popular and polite.

, A finger bowl is a retro, but useful conceit: it’s a small bowl filled with water that you can rinse your saucy fingers in. If you’re eating ribs in a (slightly) more formal setting, your server may set it on the table during the meal or bring it after you eat your ribs., Ribs are delicious, but you need something to wash them down, as well. Whether you drink alcohol or not, pick a beverage that you feel complements the rich nature of ribs and sauce. This way, you won’t get bogged down by the flavors when you’re eating.If you don’t drink, iced tea (sweet or not) is a classic choice to go along with barbeque.
If picking a red wine, try something with rich and fruity notes to play off the meatiness of the ribs.Malty-flavored and Oktoberfest-type beers go well with ribs, too."

Mix tulips into tuna.,
Add tulip petals to salad.,
Use tulips as bowls for ice cream.",How to Eat Tulips1," Tuna salad can be a healthy lunch for any day of the week. To add tulips to tuna salad, pluck the petals from the tulip bulbs. Then, cut off about a quarter inch from the bottom of the petals. You can then mix the tulips into your other ingredients in tuna salad.You can use whatever you want in your tuna salad, but tulips go great with spices like curry powder and black paper. Things like cucumber and celery stalks also mix great with tulips.;
, If you're a big salad eater, a few tulip petals can brighten up and add texture to a dull salad. To use tulips in a salad, simply pluck out as many petals as you need and sprinkle them into your greens.Cut off the bottom quarter of tulip petals where they attached to the bulb.


Tulips add different flavor to a salad depending on when they were harvested. Tulips harvested during cold months will provide a sweeter flavor.
Specific types of tulips provide specific flavor. Oakleaf tulips add an apple-like taste, while French sorrel tulips leave a strong citrus flavor.

, A tulip's flower head can be separated from the stalk and shaped into a bowl for ice cream.Prop up the flower head like a champagne flute and then place your choice of ice cream in the flowers.


You do not need to eat the tulip flowers with ice cream. It will add flavor simply by holding the tulip.

Open a pistachio from the crack.,
Crack an un-cracked pistachio.,
Consider buying pre-shelled pistachios.",How to Eat Pistachios1," If there is already a crack in the nutshell, then your job will be much easier. First, squeeze the two half-shells to widen the crack until it won't get any bigger. Then, peel the pistachio open from the crack. Wedge your thumbnails into the crack and pull them apart in opposite directions. Use your forefingers to brace the nut so that you can apply more force to the shell.Try using an already-opened shell half to pry open a new pistachio. The shells are sturdy enough that you can use them to open one other.;
, The pistachio is more difficult to open if the crack is very small, or if there is no crack at all. Place the pistachio on a clean, sturdy surface like a plate, a counter-top, or a cutting board. Then, gently tap the nut with a hammer or another heavy object until a crack forms in the shell. Finally, use your thumbnails to pull the shell all the way open.


Use a nutcracker, if you have one. The nutcracker is a tool specifically designed to open up thick nutshells. Place the pistachio between the two arms of the nutcracker, then squeeze the two arms shut to crack the nut.

, You can buy the nuts already opened, if you like, which makes them somewhat easier to eat. However, be aware that pistachios sold in the shell are typically less expensive. They may also be more likely to be organic.


Studies have shown that eating pistachios in the shell slows down the eating process and lowers overall consumption. Pistachio nuts contain three to four calories each—fewer than almost any another nut—but it can be easy to eat a lot of them when they come pre-shelled. Consider keeping pistachios a ""slow"" snack by de-shelling them yourself."

Hold both chopsticks with the side of your thumb.,
Grasp the top chopstick like a pencil.,
Keep the bottom chopstick steady.,
Use your thumb, index, and middle finger to move the top chopstick.,
Grab bits of food by pinching them between the chopsticks.",How to Eat Rice with Chopsticks2," Eating rice with a set of chopsticks is easiest if you're using your chopsticks the way they were intended to be used. Luckily, this is easy to learn! Start by lining up your two chopsticks and holding them in your dominant hand. Slide them into the ""crook"" between your thumb and the side of your hand. The ""squishy"" part at the base of your thumb should pin them in place.You'll want the two chopsticks to be lined up on top of each other, not side-to-side.

, With the two chopsticks resting in the crook of your thumb, slide the top one up so that you're holding it with your thumb, index, and middle fingers. The pad of your thumb should hold the stick from the side. Your index finger should bend around it and rest on top. Your middle finger should support the stick from the other side. This may sound complicated, but it should be fairly similar to how you'd hold a pen or pencil!


If you're having trouble, set the other chopstick down so you can concentrate on this one. It's easy to slide back in later.

, One of the most important things to remember when eating with chopsticks is that the bottom chopstick doesn't move. Keep holding it in place with the fleshy part at the base of your thumb. Light pressure should be find. You don't need to keep a death grip on it. Bend your ring finger so that it supports the bottom of the stick with the side of your last knuckle., Maintaining the rest of your form, practice bending and extending your middle and index fingers. When you extend them, the top chopstick should point up. When you bend them, it should point down and eventually touch the other one.Practice this up-and-down motion until you're comfortable with it.









Try to keep your thumb straight as you do this. If you bend it to move the top chopstick down, it's easier for your form to collapse and for you to lose control of the sticks.
Remember, the bottom chopstick doesn't move. Keep it wedged in place and supported by your ring finger.

, Make a plate of food for practice purposes. If you'd rather not, you can also crumple up a few pieces of notebook paper and set them on a plate. Use a pinching motion of the chopsticks to pick up the food or paper balls between the ends of the sticks and bring them up to your mouth. It can take a little practice to get used to the feeling of holding food by squeezing it between two sticks, but it should quickly become less awkward.









If you're using food and this is your first time, you may want to lay down a towel to protect against spills.

Don't use your chopsticks like spears to skewer your food.,
Don't stick your chopsticks into your food so that they point up.,
Don't pass another person food ""chopstick to chopstick."",
Don't take food from a communal plate with your chopsticks.",How to Eat Rice with Chopsticks3," Once you get the hang of using chopsticks, it's a wise idea to learn just a few simple ""rules"" for them. These aren't absolutely essential, but they're simple to learn and they don't make eating any more difficult. For example, chopsticks are not to be used to poke or spear pieces of food. This is considered crude. It's a little like going to a fancy restaurant and spearing food on your knife instead of using your fork.







, This resembles the incense used at Buddhist funerals, so it is considered taboo.







, In other words, don't pick up a piece of food and hold it for another person to grab with their own chopsticks. Instead, put the food on his or her plate. This, too, has a negative connection to funeral rituals.









In addition, when someone wants to give you food, offer your plate, rather than grabbing it with your own chopsticks.

, This is considered unsanitary, especially if the chopsticks have already touched your mouth. Instead, use the utensils provided. There will almost always be a serving spoon or similar tool handy to transfer food to your plate.

Choose your rack.,
Cut a rib off the rack.,
Pick up your rib.,
Work from one end to the other.,
Eat slowly.",How to Eat Ribs2," If you get to pick your own set of ribs, you’re very lucky. It should be an intuitive choice: look for the ribs that best reflect your ideal. This means that if you’re extremely hungry, and there’s plenty of ribs, it’s good to go for a big set. If you like plenty of sauce, look for that. If you don’t need a ton of sauce, then save the really saucy ribs for your friends who do.

, Using a table knife, seperate one of the rib bones from its fellows. This should not require a ton of force: rib meat is tender, so gentle sawing should do the trick. If the ribs are tender enough, you should even be able to tear the rib away, instead of cutting it., Hold the seperated above your plate in case anything drops from it. Use your index finger, middle finger, and thumb to hold each end. This should keep it fairly stable, and ensure you at least a couple clean fingers. Don’t stick your pinkies in the air, because that looks silly., If you bite into the middle of the rib at first, the meat at both ends might fall off, and then you’ll have to eat the meat scraps with your fingers off your plate. Avoid this indignity by picking one end of the rib to begin with, and then biting progressively to the other side., There are several reasons to take small bites and chew methodically. One is that ribs are a choking hazard--taking huge bites might mean you swallow a bone by mistake. Another is that ribs are served on social occasions. You’ll want to be able to talk and bond with the people you’re eating with. Furthermore, ribs are a wonderful treat, and they should be savored. Finally, if you eat carefully, you probably won’t end up terribly messy!"

Don’t share leftovers with babies or pets.,
Wash your hands with soap and water.,
Check your face and teeth.,
Get barbeque sauce off fabric.,
Take care of dishes.,
Thank whoever made the ribs.",How to Eat Ribs3," If adults can choke on rib bones, the danger is even greater for dogs and infants who haven’t learned careful eating conventions yet. It’s much better to save leftovers in the refrigerator than it is to give them to your golden retriever., This is a good practice after you eat in any case, but it’s especially good if you have just been eating food covered in sugary sauce! Excuse yourself to the kitchen or bathroom, then thoroughly wash your hands.Wet your hands with warm water.
Add soap. This can be bar, powder, or liquid soap. It doesn’t need to be antibacterial, but it does need to be plentiful enough that you can see multiple bubbles.
Massage the soap around for twenty seconds, or the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice. Get the fronts and backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Rinse thoroughly with warm water.

, If you’re in the bathroom already, make use of the mirror. Are there smudges of barbeque sauce along your cheeks, like contoured makeup gone terribly wrong? Do your teeth look like you’re the star of a documentary about Tasmanian devils? Clean yourself up with water and toilet paper, and dental floss if you need it., If you’ve accidentally gotten sauce on upholstery or clothing, it’s best to get it off now, before it sets. A detergent pen is one of the best ways to do this, but if you don’t, dab (don’t rub) the stained side of the fabric with a wet cloth. If it’s possible, hold a dry cloth on the other side of the fabric to absorb the sauce., If you’re eating off china plates at your own or a friend’s house, make sure they get to the kitchen as soon as possible after the meal! This will keep the sauce from congealing, which makes it more difficult to get off. Obviously, it’s much easier to get rid of paper plates--do this in a timely fashion as well, as scraps of meat can start to smell quickly., Ribs are a glorious gift to be treasured. Whether you ate at a friend’s house or in a restaurant, thanking the chef is an excellent thing to do. Say something enthusiastic and sincere, like “Thank you for the ribs, and your company! They were the highlight of my week.”"

Make stuffed tulips as an appetizer.,
Make meatballs with tulips.,
Create a cocktail with tulips.",How to Eat Tulips2," You can stuff and cook a tulip's flower head with a variety of ingredients for a tasty appetizer. Mix two tablespoons (30 mL) of lemon juice with about a tablespoon (15 mL) of minced chives and fresh mint or dill, as well as a dash of cayenne pepper. Mix this flavoring into three ounces (90 mL) of cream cheese and a cup (240 mL) of flaked crab meat. Boil about 25 asparagus spears until tender and cut them into five inch pieces. Fill tulip bulbs with about half a cup (120 mL) of your crab mixture and then garnish the stuffed tulips with asparagus. Then, arrange your tulip bulbs on a tray and serve.This is a great appetizer to serve at parties.

, Cook a cup (240 mL) of any brown beans, such as pinto beans, and tulip petals over the stove and let them cool. Then, mix the beans into a fine paste using a spoon or electronic mixer. Fry an onion and mix it into the paste and then add marjoram and salt to taste. Roll the mixture into bulbs to make tulip meatballs. Cook the balls over the stove, using only a small amount of cooking oil., To add a flowery flavor to a cocktail, use tulips. Any cocktail can be garnished with a few tulip petals when you get done mixing your ingredients. Not only does this add flavor, it makes the drink look attractive.You could mix two ounces of blueberry vodka with an ounce of pink lemonade. Mix the ingredients together and pour the drink into glasses filled with with ice. Add tulip petals to the top of the drinks for an attractive garnish.

Choose strong scented tulips.,
Pick the right color for the flavor you want.,
Choose the right texture.,
Stop eating tulips if you experience an allergic reaction.",How to Eat Tulips3," The scent of a tulip will help you determine if it's good to eat. Tulips picked earlier in the year have a stronger smell, and tend to taste like peas. Different subtypes of tulips also come with their own unique flavor and scent, which can help you choose tulips for cooking.Couleur Cardinal tulips have a sweet, fruity fragrance and provide a fruity, plum-like smell to match.
Orange tulips smell quite strong and produce produce a strong sherbet flavor.
For a creamier flavor, go for the soft scented City of Vancouver tulip.

, The color of a tulip's petals can also indicate flavor. Red tulips tend to have a sweet flavor. White tulips provide a somewhat spicy flavor. Yellows taste a little bitter, like broccoli. Dark purple or black tulips taste like have a mild tang and a crunchy flavor., The larger the petal, the stiffer the texture. Peony and parrot type tulips tend to be chewier.When choosing texture, weigh in other factors like color. If you want something to add to a salad, for example, look for larger petals colored in a more vegetable-like flavor, such as yellow tulips.

, Some people do not take well to tulips. If you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as a closed up throat or a rash, stop eating tulips right away. If symptoms don't clear up, see your doctor for evaluation."

Suck on the pistachio shell.,
Eat the nut.,
Discard the shells in a separate bowl.",How to Eat Pistachios2," This step is optional, but many pistachio eaters love to absorb the salty exterior of the nut shell before they crack open the meat within. Put the whole pistachio into your mouth, and let your mouth absorb the salt. Remove from your mouth once the taste subsides.


You can also suck on the shells after you have separated them from the nut. This way, you can simply spit out the shell out into the garbage once you've finished sucking it.

, Once you've removed the shell, the pistachio is ready to consume. You can eat the pistachio raw, or you can add it to a larger dish.


The pistachio nut is relatively soft and oblong. The color should be some combination of green, brown, and purple. Do not worry if the nut skin appears blotchy and mottled – this is normal!.

, Once you have shelled each pistachio, eat the nut and place the nutshell into a discard pile. This might be your hand, or a cup holder, or a separate bowl. If you scatter the shells back in with the unopened pistachios, they will get in the way when you try to eat more of the nuts.

Find the surface area and the volume of water your pool can hold.,
Find the pool’s maximum volume of water.,
Establish your pool’s turnover rate.,
Choose the right filter.,
Consider how much water resistance there will be that can affect your pool’s turnover rate.,
Take all the information gathered about your pool to find a suitable filter size.",How to Select the Correct Filter Size for Your Swimming Pool," Pools come in all types of shapes. However, there are two common kinds: rectangular and round. Depending on the one you’ve purchased, make sure you’ve correctly calculated its size with the right mathematical formula.Rectangular pools are by far the most simple to measure. Simply multiply its length with the width. Surface area = L x W

If you opt for a round pool, perhaps a hot tub or a smaller children’s pool, the calculation involves taking the radius of the circle, raising it to the power of two, then multiplying the product with 3.14. Surface area = 3.14 x r2

Measuring your pool’s surface area yourself works well, but if you just bought your pool, then measurements should be provided upon purchase.;
, Then, use your pool’s volume to find out how much water can move through your filter in about a minute. This is called ‘’flow rate’’. The flow rate differs from the kind of pool you have. Ensure you calculate with this in mind to get the most out of the eventual filter you will use.To find your pool’s volume, take the maximum volume of water your pool can hold (this amount can be found upon purchasing of your pool) and divide it by 360. This will tell you how many gallons of water that goes through your filter in a minute.
It’s best to get a filter that is slightly oversized for your pool to ensure maximum efficiency.
If the flow rate for the filter is too much and the operation pressures for the filter are too high you can increase the pipe size of your plumbing system, in part or in whole, and this will reduce the operational pressure of your system.
All filters have a minimum and maximum flow rate that the pump must fall within. Too weak or too much flow and the filter will not operate correctly. Make sure the filter you get is able to accommodate for the amount of water in your pool.

, This means knowing how long it takes for the water to completely cycle through the filter. Most municipal health codes require a minimum filtration turnover rate of two complete turnovers of the water in a 24 hour period.


The minimum turnover rate is one that turns over the entire pool once in 12 hours. A turnover rate of 8 or 10 hours is the typical sizing rates for pools today.
If the pool is for commercial, semi commercial or high bather turnover applications then you will want to choose a filter that will allow you to turn over the entire volume of water at least four times every 24 hour period.

, The correct filter size depends on the size of the pool. To maintain good water clarity you must run the pump each day so that all the water in the pool is turned over. All filters have gallon per minute design rating and turnover rate..


For example: A 24 feet (7.3 m) round above ground pool has approx 13,500 gallons (51,103.1 L). A Hayward S166T Sand Filter has a 10hr turnover rate of 18,000 gallons (68,137.4 L) and would work well with this pool.

, The faster water moves through the pump, the more resistance you’ll have.


Choose a filter that would at a minimum turn your pool over in 10hrs. With filters it is okay to go bigger.. Larger filter areas will help to maintain good water clarity.
Remember that the faster the velocity of water moving through the plumbing system, the more resistance to flow the water has. This means a slower pump like low speed on a 2-speed pump has a flow increase per unit of power on lower speeds versus the high-speed option. Note that most 2 speed pumps set to low speed will not meet the minimum flow requirements for the filter to function properly.

, By using a simple equation you should have no problems. Before putting it all together make sure you’ve correctly calculated the pool’s volume (in gallons) and decided on a reasonable turnover rate for all the water to be cycled through the filter. The equation used in calculating filter sizes is:

Pool capacity in gallons divided by the desired turnover rate in hours.
This will give you the minimum flow needed in G.P.H (Gallons Per Minute).
Divide this number by 60 to get the G.P.M.
Find a pump that meets the G.P.M you just calculated.

Before you begin, consider your climate and reduce your expectations.,
Install a 3-way pool valve after the pump and filter (in the return line) so water can be directed to the panels or to the pool (bypassing the panels).,
Install a T pipe fitting near the 3-way value in the same return line on the pool side.,
Maintain the same pipe size as the return pipe (usually 1-1/2"" or 2"") for the two lines to and from the solar panel location.,
Plastic solar panels come in several sizes, but 2'x20' is common.,
Fastening the panels to the roof may be your greatest challenge and a reason to consider placing them on the ground.,
Once the solar panels are in place, connect them to each other and to the union fittings.,
After the pipes are connected, turn on the pump and open the valve to the panels.,
If you live in an area that experiences sub zero temperatures be sure to install a drain at the lowest point of the system or plan to pressurize the system with air to prevent freezing damage in the winter.

,
A solar controller system can be purchased for around $400 which includes temperature probes, valves and actuators to automate the system.

",How to Install Solar Panels to Heat a Pool," Nighttime temperatures tend to undo daytime gains, even during sunny weather. A pool blanket is absolutely essential at night as this is when the majority of heat loss takes place - when the air temperature is much cooler than the water. An in ground pool will lose heat faster than an above ground pool as the ground area below 3' in most areas is cold even during the summer. Do you have space for solar panels to receive direct sun most of the day? Will you remove the panels prior to high wind storms and perhaps each winter? Will the reduced water flow still clean your pool or is running your pump for more hours acceptable? That said, the low cost and ease of installing your first panels may make it feasible for you to experiment. In most situations plastic solar panels will increase your comfort during the regular swimming season however they are not likely to increase the length of the swimming season unless you supplement with gas heating also. No prior planning can substitute for the experience of trying it out.;
, Proper pool valves are not cheap, but they never block the return flow and can be adjusted to direct all, part, or no water through the panels. Consider a pool valve that will accept an automatic valve controller if you may want to later control the valve from another location or with a clock.

, Water returning from the panels will reenter the return line below the valve. Water is then free to return from the panels to the pool. It is helpful for winterizing the system in the future to buy valves that have unions so that you can open and drain the system.

, If the panels will be installed on the roof, plastic conduit pipe hangers will hold the pipe securely to walls and the eave. At the roof edge install a union fitting on each pipe to make it easy to remove the panels seasonally, or for wind, or to replace the roofing. Even for solar panels on the ground, union fittings will make seasonal removal easier. Consider burying the rigid pool pipes to keep your yard looking neat.

, Purchase no fewer than two. Each panel costs roughly $150. You may want to try two before adding more. Enough panels to equal the area of your pool would be ideal, if you have the space for them. An 18' diameter round pool has a surface area of about 254 sq ft / 40 sq ft per panel = 6 panels. But fewer panels are OK and it may be best to keep your investment modest until you are convinced that all the considerations and benefits are worthwhile. More panels require more pump power, so this is another consideration you will understand better after you have tried two panels. It is common to need to increase the size of the pump by 1/4hp in order to accommodate any lifts higher than a single storey or longer than 100'.

, Use stainless steel hanger bolts ordered on the internet, if your local hardware does not carry them. Consider your roof rafter spacing and locate hanger bolts slightly wider than the 2-foot width of the panels. A generous dob of roofing polymer or ""tar"" around each hanger bolt is required to prevent leaks. A strap or aluminum bar with a hole at each end fits over the panel and two hanger bolts. Secure with stainless steel washers and wing nuts to make removal of the panels quick and easy. In most communities you will need to submit drawings, comply with codes, and obtain a permit before making any roof installation. These considerations may make installing panels on the ground an attractive alternative.

, Pay particular attention to which end of the panel pipe is IN or OUT, so that the water flow will always be entering IN and exiting OUT. Air will be trapped in the panels if they are installed backwards. When panels are installed on a slope, the OUT end of the panel should be higher.

, Check for leaks. Theoretically, the greater the flow, the more efficient (because the cooler water in the panels absorbs more heat from the sun). You will probably find that the water returning from the panels is just two or three degrees higher, but over a period of a day this will heat your entire pool by a few degrees. If your nights are not too cool, you will gain a few degrees each day. Even a small pool will take about a week to be noticeably warmer. We've been conservative to help keep your expectations realistic, but I have only three panels on my South Florida pool and they are wonderful. With no electric or gas heating, I can enjoy a pool at 80 degrees or more for about half the year. This year I'll add two more panels for a total of five to extend my season. Happy swimming!

Use this equation: (Pool Volume ÷ Filtration rate) x 2 = Hours to run filter.,
Know the volume of your pool.,
Determine the flow rate of the pump.,
Calculate the turnover rate for your pool.",How to Know How Many Hours to Run a Pool Filter," This will tell you how many hours to run your pump to filter the water a full 2 times. Let's break that down:;
, How long you run the filter depends on the size pool to filter ratio.


If you have a small filter you will need to run the filter longer, depending on how many gallons the filter can process in a given time.
Calculate the volume of your pool by multiplying the length x width x average depth in feet
Multiply this number by a standard multiplier which is 7.5 for rectangular and square pools and 5.9 for other shapes. Example 16*32*5*7.48= 19,149. This would give the volume of the pool in gallons for this 16x32 pool that has an average depth of 5 feet (1.5 m).

, Include the resistance to flow in your plumbing system.


The pump manufacturer can tell you the flow rate for certain resistances.
You can estimate your pool plumbing resistance to be 20ft/lbs for small pools, and 40ft/lbs for large pools or installations where the pool pump is far removed from the pool area.
Waterfalls and elevated solar systems will cause the ft/lbs resistance in the line to increase.
An average 1 HP pump will move about 50 gallons (189.3 L) per minute. This would be 3,000 gallons (11,356.2 L) per hour.

, The minimum recommended turnover for a pool is two complete turnovers in any 24 hour period.


For example, using a pool volume of 19,149 gallons (72,486.9 L), and a filtration rate of 3,000 gallons (11,356.2 L) per hour:

(Pool Volume ÷ Filtration rate) x 2 = Hours to run filter
(19,149 ÷ 3000) x 2 = 12.766, or about 12 hours and 45 minutes for two full cycles.

Slowly pour the hot water directly on the sagging vinyl below the top edge. Use a kettle or can with a long spout, such as a watering can.
Do not pour onto the very top edge of the vinyl, but just below the top, because you next have to grasp that top edge.
Pour slowly back and forth across the vinyl.;
, As the hot water softens the vinyl, grasp the top edge and firmly pull the vinyl up and above the track, so that when released it remains just above the track.









It may take several cans of water before you can pull the entire edge up sufficiently.
It may also be necessary to lower the water level 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so to increase the amount of vinyl you can stretch.
This task is easier if one person pulls up while the other pours the hot water. But one person can do the job alone if necessary.

, Starting on one end, firmly twist the top edge horizontally and push it into the metal track.


The top underside of the vinyl has a V shaped groove which should slip into a similar V groove in the top metal track.
You should feel the edge of vinyl slip into the groove, which is supposed to keep it in place.

, Use a large, wooden paint stirrer to help push and hold the vinyl in the track as you pull the vinyl up and into place.


Be very careful not to tear through the vinyl.
For longer splits use wooden clothes-pegs broken in half and placed along the split every few inches.

, Upon completion of stretching and tucking, get several special short (1/4 to 1/2 inch long) plastic jamming pieces from your pool supply store, and jam them into place between the top of the plastic and the underside of the metal pool rim. This will help ensure the plastic liner stays in place.

, These nuts are small and low-calorie, but they are rich with flavor and nutrients. A handful of pistachios can help ward off hunger pangs, which might come in handy during prolonged activity. Furthermore, the nut is a great source of protein and fiber.

, Pistachios are packed with nutritional value, but they contain many fewer calories than fat-rich nuts like walnuts and macadamias. Try incorporating more pistachios into your diet if you are trying to lose weight, or if you're just trying be more mindful about your nut consumption.


One pistachio contains 3-4 calories, on average. Some dietitians suggest a daily portion of 30 grams, or about 49 pistachios – which translates to roughly160 calories. In comparison, an equivalent portion of walnuts contains 190 calories, and the same portion of macadamia nuts contains 200 calories.

, Use a blender, a mortar and pestle, or any food-grade grinder. You can mix the nut powder into smoothies, sprinkle it into your cereal, and even use it as a baking ingredient. If you are blending the pistachios into a smoothie anyway, you can leave them whole and add them directly to the mix.

The logic behind never changing your filter sand is that dirty sand actually filters better than brand new sand.,
Removing the sand with a shop vacuum will be much easier than scooping the sand out by hand or with a small shovel.,
After removing the old sand you will want to add water to the tank before adding new filter sand.,
The type of sand that you add to the filter will be #20 silica sand which is specifically produced for filter media.,
The amount of sand that you add to the filter will depend on the size of filter that you have.,
Be sure not to get any sand into the sandpipe which will be wide open.,
Once full you can put the filter head back on being absolutely certain that it is tight enough.,
Once back together the first thing you need to do is give the filter a thorough backwash.",How to Change the Sand in a Pool Filter,"  The flip side to this is that after enough time the sand will no longer be able to filter the water well enough.  From a manufacturer standpoint it is recommended that you change the sand in your filter every 3-4 years.  This will maximize the effectiveness of the filter and help you to maintain clean and clear water.;
,  The sand in an old filter can actually be laden with bacteria so it would be better if you minimize your direct contact with the sand.

,  This water helps to absorb any impact of the falling sand on the lateral assembly.  Many professional installers skip this step but that would not be recommended if this is your first filter sand change.

,  This sand is between 40-50mm in diameter and is available from most swimming pool supply stores.  Do not substitute other types of sand or you will almost certainly have problems with your filter and potentially damage the pool also.  

,  You must be certain to find accurate information about how much sand to use in your filter.  Over filling or underselling the filter will at least cause the filter to not function properly, and at worst cause damage to the filter.  Filter sand sizes range typically from 100 or 150 lbs all the way up to 600lbs or more for large pools.

,  It is difficult to get the sand actually into the filter without getting it in the sandpipe so you may like to tape up the standpipe opening to prevent this spilled sand from making it back to the pool through the return lines.  It is also very important that the sandpipe is directly in the center of the filter as once you have filled with sand you will not be able to adjust the position of the sandpipe.  If not centered you will not be able to get the valve head back on the filter and will need to start all over again.

,  This is where a skilled hand is helpful as if you overtighten the filter head then you may actually  crack the filter body which would require replacement of the entire filter tank - something you definitely want to avoid.

,  You should start this process by over filling the pool and then backwashing for as much as 3 to 5 minutes, followed by a 60 second rinse cycle before setting to ""filter"".

Use a pool cover.Evaporation is the largest source of energy loss for pools.,
Lower the heater when the pool isn’t in use.Run the pool heater according to how often the pool is used.,
Maintain your pool efficiently.Make sure the drain systems are clear so that water can flow freely and efficiently.,
Consider a pool heat pump.",How to Drastically Reduce the Cost to Heat Your Swimming Pool1," This can easily be prevented by using a pool cover whenever the pool is not in use, which will minimize evaporation. It’s the most effective way to reduce pool heating costs – it can reduce cost by as much as 50 to 70 percent. There are several pool cover options available on the market, including manual, semi-automatic, and automatic pool covers.


These come in a wide range of prices and many of them have added features that help to conserve even more energy.
Even throwing a large tarp or piece of plastic over the pool technically counts as a pool cover and it will certainly help. However, it’s far more effective to use a cover that’s specifically made for pools.;
, Always turn it down when it isn’t being used. Gas burning pool heaters, in particular, can warm swimming pool water relatively quickly. Depending on how often you use pool, it may be more efficient to only run the heater when needed.


For example, if you only swim on Saturday and Sunday, it’s not necessary to run your pool heater all week long.
Turn your gas pool heater on Friday night, and depending on the size of the heater, you will have nice warm water by Saturday morning.
Turn the heater off again Sunday evening for a drastic reduction in gas costs.

, Only backwash the pool filter when absolutely necessary, since doing it too often wastes both water and energy.Circulate water through the filter only once each day. Keep the water temperature in the correct range when it’s being used – 78-80 degrees for active swimming and 82-84 degrees for recreational use.


Use a pool thermometer to properly maintain the target temperatures.
Use LED or solar powered lighting systems, which are the most energy efficient.

, If you have a gas pump, consider switching to a pool heat pump. These pumps utilize the same process used by air conditioners, except the process is reversed. A pool heat pump uses warmth drawn from the outside air to heat the pool water. You need access to electricity to power the heat pump.Pool heat pumps cost more than gas heaters, but because of their high efficiencies, the yearly operating cost ends up being less than a gas heater.
Pool heat pumps tend to last longer that gas heaters, as well, as long as proper maintenance is observed.

Use a solar pool cover.These ""solar blankets"" minimize water evaporation, just like a regular pool cover.,
Install solar pool heating panels.,
Invest in a solar heating system.",How to Drastically Reduce the Cost to Heat Your Swimming Pool2," As it insulates the surface of the pool, solar blankets also allow some of the sun's energy to go through the cover and into the water, where it turns into heat. This makes your pool water warmer, which means the swimming pool heater is required to run far less often and for shorter periods of time. Solar pool covers are one of the most effective and energy efficient ways to heat your pool.


Solar pool covers can extend your swimming season and reduce the amount of water that needs to be added by 30 to 50 percent.
They can also reduce the amount of chemicals a pool needs by 35 to 60 percent, and help keep dirt and debris out of the pool, which reduces cleaning time., Solar pool heating panels collect heat from the sun to warm pool water. Once installed, they have no operating cost, are very easy for a home owner to install and are typically very durable in all climates.The only drawback is that if the sun doesn't shine, your pool isn't heated.


Solar pool heating panels are an excellent solution for those who live in warmer climates and have a lot of sunny days throughout the year.

, These systems are in the same general price range as gas and heat pump heaters. Solar heating systems have minimal operating costs and they are the most cost-efficient choice for people who live in warm, sunny climates. These systems include 4 main features – a solar collector, a filter, a pump and a flow control valve.The pump sends water through the filter and then through the solar collector, which heats the water and returns it back to the pool.
If you live in a hot climate, the solar collector can help you cool your pool water down during the summer months. It does this by running the water through the solar collector during the night.

Use a timer to control the pump.",How to Drastically Reduce the Cost to Heat Your Swimming Pool3," These pumps use approximately 30 to 45 percent less energy than a regular pump and you can actually use them less frequently. The speed can be regulated, which means you can turn the pump down on most days and only run it at higher speeds when you need a thorough cleaning.


Additionally, high efficiency pumps are able to circulate pool water better than traditional pumps.
This will save you even more money, since well circulated water causes less daily stress on the filter.

, Longer increments are unnecessary and waste a lot of energy. If your pool water doesn't seem clean enough after the reduction, increase the time in half-hour increments until you achieve the results you want.


In a recent study, pool owners in Florida decreased their pumping to less than 3 hours each day. After doing so, the majority of them reported that they were still satisfied with the quality of their pool’s water.By doing this, the pool owners saved an average of 60 percent on their utility bills.

, A significant amount of energy can be saved if you regulate the pump’s daily cycling with a timer. Set your pump to run several short cycles throughout the day rather than running for long stretches of time. Your pool will actually be cleaner by doing this, especially if you deal with a lot of debris.


The shorter, more frequent cycles allow debris to be filtered out of the pool faster because it prevents it from building up.
It also puts less stress on the filter itself."

Make sure you have a telescopic pole. Most pool cleaning supplies attach to a pole like this, so having one available helps. You might want to wipe off the pole to make sure it's free of any debris that could potentially contaminate your pool.A leaf skimmer or skimmer net is an important pool cleaning tool. This is a small net that attaches to the telescopic pole. You use this net to remove leaves and other debris from the surface of your pool. As with any pool cleaning supplies, leaf skimmers should be cleaned out on occasion.Make sure you have a pool brush. This is a device used to clean the sides, ladders, and steps of your pool. Brushes can get clogged with dust and debris, so make sure you rinse out your pool brush periodically to make sure it's clean.;
, The first step to cleaning your pool is to skim its surface with the leaf skimmer. In fact, this should be done on a day-to-day basis to make sure the pool's surface is free of any contamination.









This is a fairly easy part of pool maintenance. Attach the skimmer to the telescopic pole to start.
Then, use the net to pull out debris. Things like leaves and other foliage frequently fall into outdoor pools. Simply use the net skimmer to remove any foreign bodies you see at the top of the pool's water., Once you've cleared out any obvious debris, use a pool brush to clean the sides of the pool as well as any stairs or ladders. This should be done on a weekly basis. Simply attach the pool brush to the telescopic pole and run it over these areas, using some force to remove grime when necessary. Keep in mind areas with poor water circulation, such as stairs, may need more attention.







, A pool vacuum is used to clean the floors of a swimming pool. There are different types of pool vacuums depending on your type of pool and personal needs.


Automatic cleaners come in three types. Suction side cleaners are not recommended as they often accidentally suck up things like rocks, which can harm your pool's filtration system. Pressure side cleaners attach to the return jet of your pool filtration system and work by removing debris from filtered water and placing it in a removable bag. However, this requires you to do some filtering. The most efficient automatic cleaner is a robotic pool cleaner. These self-contained units drive around the bottom of your pool collecting debris. The only downside, however, is they tend to be costly.You can save money by using a manual pool vacuum. You can buy a manual pool vacuum online. You may also find one for sale at a hardware shop. The vacuum should come with instructions for set up and use., Once you've selected the pool vacuum that best suits your needs, set the vacuum up for your pool. Most pool vacuums come with some kind of instructions for use.


For a manual vacuum, there is usually a way to attach the vacuum's head to the telescopic pole. You will then slowly lower the vacuum head into the pool.You should then feed the hose into the pool. Make sure all air is removed from the hose before attaching it to the pump that comes with most manual vacuum cleaners. Attaching the pump to the hose before the air has been expelled can harm the pump.Vacuums should always come with individual manufacturer's instructions. If you're unsure how to use a vacuum pump, there is usually a number on the box you can call with questions.

, You use pool vacuums much the same way you would vacuum a carpet. Move the vacuum across the bottom of the pool, staying longer in areas that need appear dirtier. Some automatic cleaners do not require you to vacuum yourself.







, A lot of debris and bacteria builds on the bottom of a pool. You should be sure to vacuum your pool at least once a week to keep it clean and safe for use.

, There are chemicals in pool water that help maintain a pool's cleanliness. Factors like weather and use can affect chemical levels. You should test the pH levels at least three times a week to make sure the pool is safe to use.









You can buy a pH tester at a local supermarket. You should read reviews of different brands before making a purchasing decision to make sure you're buying a reliable brand. Once you've selected a tester, use this to check your pool's pH levels.
The pH level of your pool should be between 7.2 and 7.6. If it is outside these ranges, use either pH reducer or pH increaser. Apply as needed to bring your pool to the proper pH range., You should keep the area around your pool filter free of debris and grime. Check the pool filter for debris, grime, and other build up. If you notice anything clogging the filter, remove it.







, Sanitizing tablets are tables you can purchase online or at many hardware stores. They dissolve slowly and release chlorine to kill any bacteria in your pool water. You should add tablets to your pool as instructed on the label. You should also add tablets to your skimmer, floater, or automatic feeder to make sure these utensils are also bacteria free., Pool shock is a type of pool cleaner that targets bacteria released by things like hair, urine, and sweat. If you're worried about contamination, consider using pool shock, If you have a pool that's dirty to the point the water is green, it will take some extra effort to clean. For starters, there will likely be a layer of scum on the surface of the pool. Do not use a skimmer to remove debris as this will stir scum into the water and make the pool look worse. Instead, use a leaf net to remove debris from the pool surface. If you do not have a leaf net, you can purchase one at a local hardware store., A very dirty pool is likely swimming with unwanted bacteria. You need to adjust the chemical levels until the pool water is safe for use.









Test and adjust the water's pH levels. It will probably take a few days, and some trial and error with pH reducer and increaser, to get the pH levels to a safe level. In addition to pH reducer and increaser, you may need to add alkalinity increaser to the pool.Remember, a good pH level is between 7.5 and 7.8.You need to shock the pool. It is likely very dirty and might need quite a few gallons of pool shock, administered over the course of a few days, to get the water back to safe levels for swimming. Start off by adding 3 or 4 gallons. See if the pool water has, by morning, changed cloudy white, light green, or clear. If it has not, add another 3 to 4 gallons and wait until 24 hours. Repeat this process until the water has changed color., You'll need to run the pool filter 24 hours a day for a few days. This is clear out unwanted bacteria and debris that have gathered in the pool.


Make sure to backwash your filter 3 to 4 times a day. Green water can clog a filter and cause damage. It is normal to have to backwash the filter frequently while cleaning a very dirty pool.Have your filtration system checked if the pool does not clear up in 4 to 5 days. This could be a sign something is wrong with your filtration system. You may have to get it replaced before you can safely use the pool again., Once the pool water is clear and the pH levels are balanced, clean the pool floor using your pool vacuum. There is likely a lot of debris gathered on the pool floor so it may take some extra time and effort to vacuum the pool. Keep in mind if there's a lot of debris on the floor, consider professional help if you're not experienced with pool cleaning yourself. Debris could get clogged in your pool pipe, causing damage, and it can also cause wear and tear to your pool filtration system."

Don't try to unscrew the unit while it is still on. Most filtration systems have an easy access switch to turn the power off.On some units, simply press the button next to ""filter"" on the control panel. On other units, turn it off at the on/off switch or the time clock.
In addition, flip the breaker for the control panel or turn off the control panel. Then, unplug the salt cell, as well.;
, Once you have the power off, take the salt cell out to inspect it more closely. You'll be looking at the metal plates inside the unit. You should be able to inspect them fairly easily to see if they need cleaning.Unscrew both sides of the salt cell to remove it. It should have large screw-in unions on both ends. The unions will be the same size as the pipe. As you unscrew, be careful, as water will leak out., The cell only needs cleaning if it has mineral deposits on its filters. The mineral deposits will look white, dry, and flaky, like a tub faucet or shower head gets at times. These deposits reduce the unit's efficiency, so you need to remove them. If your filter doesn't have deposits, put it back, and check it in a month or so.Tip the salt cell up to look inside at the metal plates. Check for mineral deposits., Most salt cells will need cleaning at least twice a year. Some may need it as often as every two months. It mostly depends on how hard your water is, as that's what causes buildups. Check on it every two months to see if it needs cleaning until you figure out how often yours will need to be cleaned.If you have a newer salt system, the cell may not even need cleaning out, as these systems have built-in ways of keeping deposits from building up.
Watch for the signal. Some systems have an automatic monitor to remind you when to check your salt cell., If you notice large debris in the filter, pull it out with your hand, though only do so if it's easily reachable. Anything small should be taken care of by the hose and the chemical solution used to clean the salt cell.

, You can start cleaning the salt cell with a standard garden hose. Point it in one end of the unit, letting the water go through it and flow out the other end. This process should help remove random bits that have gotten caught in there, as well as some of the mineral deposits.Don't get the end of the plug wet, as that part is not waterproof.

, Another option for working on the deposits is to use a plastic or wooden tool. Scrape at the deposits gently to try to remove them. Don't use metal, as that will damage the filters. You may be able to remove most of the mineral deposits this way., When using chemicals, protect yourself. Put on latex gloves, as well as goggles to protect your eyes. In addition, only clean the cell where there's plenty of ventilation, as the acid can produce fumes.Coveralls also wouldn't hurt. At the very least, cover your arms and legs., You use muratic acid to clean the deposits off the filters in the salt cell. However, you must dilute it because straight muratic acid is too strong. Pour water in a clean bucket that's easy to pour from. Add muratic acid to the bucket.Start with five parts water to one part acid.
Never add water to acid. Always add the acid to the water.

, The easiest way for the solution to reach the filters is to simply pour it into the cell. To do that, screw the cell into the cleaning stand, which caps off one end. The stand goes on the end where the cord is. Stand it up on that end., Using the bucket, carefully add the solution to the salt cell, making sure not to spill it on yourself. It should cover the filters inside, coming most of the way up the inside of the cell. Leave the solution to soak for 10 to 15 minutes., The mixture will foam up inside the cell. That is a good sign, as it means it's working on the mineral deposits. Once the mixture has stopped foaming, that usually means it's clean, though sometimes you may need to go through the process again.For the moment, pour the solution back into the bucket.

, Once the deposits are gone, use the garden hose again. Thoroughly rinse out the inside of the cell, as chlorine and muratic acid shouldn't mix. Once you're sure it's thoroughly cleaned out, the process is done., Put the salt cell back into position; it doesn't matter which direction it goes on most units. Screw the unions back in place. Plug the unit back into the wall, and clear the inspection light on the control panel by holding down the up arrow or pressing down the diagnostic button for three seconds., You can keep the water-acid mixture in a clean bottle, though you should get rid of it by the time it suggests on the original bottle of acid. To dispose of it, look for hazardous waste disposal collection centers in your area, as that's the best way to get rid of it."

To ensure that your pool stays clean, make sure that the filter pump runs for at least 8 hours a day.For the best results, run the pump during the day.
To ensure that you never forget to turn the pump on or off, use a pool pump timer that can automatically turn it on and off depending on the schedule that you choose.;
, Dirt and debris can sometimes become trapped in the filter system, which can leave you with dirty water in the pool. If you have a sand or DE filter for your above ground pool, backwash it to reverse the water flow through the system and flush it out so it stays clean.You should backwash your pool when you notice that the pressure gauge is 8 to 10 lbs above normal. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for your filter system if you’re unsure what the normal setting is.
Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding the backwashing procedures for the pool. In most cases, you’ll need to turn a valve to the proper setting.

, If your above ground pool uses a cartridge filter, you must clean the cartridge filter periodically to ensure the system works properly. Turn off the filter, remove the cartridge, and use a garden hose to clean it when the pressure gauge reads 5 to 10 lbs above the normal setting.Check the manufacturer's instructions for your cartridge filter system to determine what the normal pressure setting should be so you know when to clean the cartridge.
Cartridge filters need to be replaced periodically to keep the system running properly.

, Your pool’s filter pump has a basket where all the dirt and debris that is filtered out is collected. Once a week, remove the basket from the pump, dump out the contents, and hose it out if necessary.Consult your filter system’s manufacturer’s instructions to determine how to remove and clean the pump basket.
Make sure that you reposition the basket correctly and secure the lid after cleaning it so the filter system will run properly.
It’s a good idea to clean the pump basket each week after you vacuum the pool.

, To keep your above ground pool clean, it’s a good idea to have a skimmer basket that attaches to the wall. It will remove light debris and dirt that’s in the water. Make sure to clean out the basket once or twice a day so it doesn’t become clogged.If you find that your skimmer basket becomes full fairly easily, you may want to empty it more than once or twice a day.

, While a skimmer basket works well to remove debris from the pool, it does take time for all of the dirt to circulate to the basket and it may miss some items. To get rid of small amounts of isolated debris, a flat skimmer net on a telescopic pole works well. Drag it across the water surface to lift out the items.Even with a skimmer basket attached, it’s a good idea to skim your pool at least once a day.
If your above ground pool doesn’t have a skimmer basket, you should skim it manually at least three or four times a day.

, If there is a storm in your area or other event that results in a large number of leaves and other heavy debris in your above ground pool, use a leaf rake to remove them. It is a bag that attaches to a telescopic pool pole so you can easily pull it across the surface of the water and get rid of debris.A leaf bag is also handy for removing large debris from the bottom of the pool.

, In all above ground pools, there is usually at least one area that has little to no circulation from the filter. Those spots are a prime location for algae to grow, so it’s important to brush your pool. Place a brush head on a telescopic pool pole for the job so it’s easier to reach all of the wall surface.To avoid damaging your above ground pool’s walls, use a brush with nylon bristles.
Depending on the dimensions and setup of your pool, you may prefer to do some of the brushing with a handheld brush from inside the pool.

, After you’ve attached the brush head to the pole, move the brush over the walls in a downward motion to loosen any algae and debris. Make sure to brush all the way around pool so all of the walls are cleaned.For the cleanest pool, try to brush it at least once a week.

, In addition to the walls, it’s important to clean other surfaces in your above ground pool. If there is a ladder, make sure to go over it with the brush as well to remove any residue or algae.You may find it easier to brush the ladder with a handheld brush.
If you have a set of stairs in your pool, make sure to brush those as well.

, Vacuuming a pool is a critical part of keeping it clean. Doing the job manually, though, can be time-consuming so you may want to invest in an automatic vacuum. It attaches to the pool’s filter system to move the dirt and debris out of the pool and moves around automatically so you don’t need to do any work.Make sure to choose an automatic pool vacuum designed specifically for above ground pools so you know that it will work best for your pool’s materials and dimensions.
If you have an automatic pool cleaner, you can run it daily or every other day so you can be sure that the pool is always clean.

, To vacuum an above ground pool manually, you’ll need a vacuum head with brushes or rollers to remove the dirt and debris from the bottom of the pool. Secure it on the end of a telescopic pool pole that will allow you to move around the entire floor of the pool.Before you plan to vacuum your pool, you should skim the surface of any leaves or other debris.
If you vacuum your pool manually, make sure to do it at least once or twice a week.

, After you’ve attached the vacuum head to the pole, insert the swivel end of a vacuum hose into the head. Place the vacuum into the bottom of the pool near the skimmer water return outlet.Lean the pole against the side of the pool as you’re readying the vacuum in a secure position so it won’t fall into the water.

, Hold the free end of the vacuum hose in the water in front of the skimmer return outlet to fill it with water. Wait until there are no longer any bubbles coming from the vacuum head, and insert the free end of the hose into the return outlet., With the vacuum hose attached, take hold of the vacuum’s pole and begin moving it across the bottom of the pool. Take your time to ensure that you pick up all of the debris and cover the entire floor of the pool.To ensure that you pick up all of the debris, try to overlap your strokes as you move the vacuum to go over each area twice.

, The chemical levels in your pool play a major role in how clean the water stays. Two to three times a week, use a testing kit to check the pH and chlorine levels to ensure that they are in the proper range. Add the proper chemicals to bring them to the proper levels if necessary.A digital test strip reader is usually the easiest way to test the pool’s chemicals levels. Dip a testing strip in the water, and insert into the reader to determine the levels. Other strips change color and provide a chart to help you determine whether the levels are correct.
It’s crucial that the water’s pH is at the right level to ensure that the sanitizers work properly to keep the water clean. It should be between 7.2 and 7.6 to maintain clean pool water.
The chlorine level in your pool should be between 1 and 3 parts per million (ppm).

, If you test the pool's water and the levels aren't correct, you usually need to add chemicals to the pool to address the specific level. In most cases, it will be the pH that requires your attention.If the pH is too high, add a pH reducer to the water according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
If the pH is too low, add a pH increaser to the water according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
If your pool’s chlorine levels are too low, you should add chlorine to the water.
If the chlorine levels are too high, stop adding chlorine to the water and leave the water alone for a day or so to help lower the level.

, Chlorine tablets are the most effective sanitizer for above ground pools because they dissolve gradually to slowly release free chlorine into the water. Fill a floating chlorine dispenser with the tablets according to the instructions, and place it in the pool.Make sure to refill the floater on a weekly basis to ensure that there is always a steady supply of chlorine for the water.
If you prefer, you can install an automatic chlorine feeder for your above ground pool. It attaches to the filter system and uses tablets that dissolve even more slowly so you don’t need to refill it as often as a conventional floater.

, Even if you try to maintain proper chemical levels in your pool, debris from swimmers, such as sunscreen residue and perspiration, can still build up in the water. Using a shock product can help boost chlorine levels in a hurry to remove contaminants. Add the chemical to the water if your chlorine level falls too low or the water begins to look dull.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding how to how add the shock to the water.
Even if your chemical levels are balanced, you may want to shock the pool after heavy use or a storm to keep the water clean.
In most cases, you shouldn’t need to shock your pool more than once every or every other week.
After shocking the pool, you can’t swim it in for a while. In most cases, you need to wait until the chlorine levels fall back to 3 to 4 ppm but consult the shock’s instructions to be sure.

Clean the liner with a pool brush.,
Wipe the liner with a clean cloth.,
Vacuum up any algae or debris on the liner.",How to Clean a Vinyl Pool Liner1," To remove surface dirt and grime on the pool liner, use a pool brush with nylon or plastic bristles. Pool brushes are curved and often come with an extendable handle, making it easier for you to clean the pool liner. Run the brush over the liner to remove dirt and debris. Make sure you clean the sides and the bottom of the liner.You can dip the brush in a bucket of pool water to clean it as you go. The pool brush should remove surface dirt and grime easily off of the liner.
To address any dirt on the liner that is below the water line of the pool, drain the pool and use the brush to get at these spots.;
, You can also clean any thick marks on the liner with a clean towel or cloth. Dip the towel in the pool water and wipe off the marks. Using the pool water can make wiping off marks or dirt on the liner easier.This option may be better for spot cleaning any trouble areas on the liner. You may keep a clean cloth on hand to wipe off dirty spots on the liner when they start to appear.

, Get a pool vacuum that has a tele-pole, a vacuum head, and a vacuum head. Make sure the vacuum head is made for a vinyl pool liner, as it will have brushes so it does not snag the liner. The vacuum can be used to remove debris and algae on the pool liner.The pool vacuum works by attaching the vacuum hose to the skimmer or vacuum line in the pool. Run the vacuum against the pool liner to remove debris and algae. Any dirt or debris will go through the hose to the pump basket and filter.

Apply a bleach cleaner to the liner.,
Use an alkaline based cleaner.,
Try a stain remover.",How to Clean a Vinyl Pool Liner2," If you notice that bacteria or fungus has stained the liner, use a bleach based cleaner. These stains will look like dark spots on the liner. Combine one part chlorine bleach and one part water. Use a spray bottle or a small garden sprayer to apply the bleach cleaner to the liner. Let the cleaner dry on the liner so it can remove the stains.You can clean any spots on the liner while the pool is full by applying the cleaner above the water line. Or you can drain the pool to clean the entire liner.
Wipe off any excess bleach cleaner on the liner once the stains have been removed. Rinse the liner with water so there is no remaining bleach on the liner.
Be careful when using bleach. Wear gloves when you touch the bleach and do not ingest any of the bleach.

, Look for alkaline based cleaners for vinyl pools at your local hardware store or online. Alkaline based cleaners will be gentler on the vinyl than acid based cleaners and work well on stains or discoloration. Apply the cleaner using a spray bottle or a small garden sprayer.Once the cleaner has been applied and the stains or discolorations have been removed, make sure you rinse the liner well with water.

, If you have stains and scum on the pool liner, you can use a stain cleaner made for vinyl pool liners. Look for stain cleaners at your local hardware store or online. You can find ones that come in the form of an eraser that you can attach to an extendable pole. You can then wipe off stains like algae, rust, paint, and oil.You can use the stain remover on specific spots on the liner with the pool still full of water. Or you can drain the pool to remove stains on the entire liner.
Make sure you rinse the stain remover tool well once you are done using it. Use clean water and let it air dry outside. This will ensure the chlorine in the pool does not deteriorate the tool over time.

Use a pool cover.,
Have the proper chemical levels in the pool.,
Clean the pool regularly.",How to Clean a Vinyl Pool Liner3," To keep the pool liner clean, use a pool cover when you are not using the pool often. You may do this during the winter time to protect the pool liner. Get a pool cover that fits the pool well and is tightly sealed at the edges. This will keep dirt and debris out of the pool, which can then create stains on the liner.If you are using a pool cover that floats over the pool, make sure you lift the edge of the cover every few weeks to confirm no leaves or debris has gotten into the pool.

, Most pools will self clean and maintain themselves well if there are proper chemical levels in the pool. To ensure the pool liner stays clean, check that the pool’s alkalinity, calcium hardness, pH, and chlorine levels are correct. You can use a testing kit to determine the chemical levels in the pool. Test the levels once a week to ensure they are correct.In a standard size pool, the recommended chemical levels are a pH of 7.4-7.8, a total alkalinity level of 100-150 ppm (parts per million), and a calcium hardness of 200-250 ppm.
The chlorine level in a non heated pool should be 1-3 ppm and the chlorine level in a heated pool should be 2-4 ppm.
If you are covering your pool with a pool cover during the winter, reduce the amount of chemicals in the pool by 60%.

, Maintain the pool liner by cleaning your pool at least once a week. Use a skimmer to remove any leaves, dirt, and debris on the surface of the pool. Vacuum the pool to remove algae. Brush the pool liner with a pool brush to get rid of dirt before they become stains. You may consider getting the pool professionally cleaned once a year, especially if you use it often.

Black algae are chlorine-resistant, because they have a protective outer layer that makes regular sanitization ineffective. While algae aren’t harmful, their presence can be a sign that other bacteria are present.Other alga species that are common in pools are green algae, mustard or yellow algae, and pink algae, which is actually a bacterium.
Algae tend to bloom in pools that have poor circulation, poor filtration, a high pH level, and a low chlorine level.;
, Chlorine should be somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0 parts per million. The pH level should be between 7.2 and 7.8. Alkalinity should be between 80 and 120 parts per million. Test these three levels once or twice a week and correct as needed.Calcium hardness should be tested monthly, and the ideal level is between 180 and 220 parts per million.

, On a weekly or bi-weekly basis, shock your pool to remove chloramines (chlorine molecules that have attached to other particles) and raise chlorine levels quickly. There are four products you can use to shock your pool, and they are:Calcium or lithium hypochlorite
Granular chlorine
Potassium peroxymonosulfate

, Keeping the water in your pool moving is one of the best preventative measures for algae. Not only will it make it harder for alga spores to take hold, it will also ensure that sanitizing chemicals are evenly distributed. Monitor and clean the skimmer and strainer basket regularly., A clogged filter won’t work as well, and it will slow down the flow of water. In warmer months like July and August when algae have the best chance of blooming, run the pump for about eight hours over the course of the day., Especially if you’ve had trouble with algae in the past, consider adding algaecide to your pool on a monthly basis.Ammonia-based algaecides should work for green algae, but metal-based (specifically copper) algaecides are necessary for black algae., Brushing will remove dirt and spores, and prevent algae from taking hold.Brush the walls, floor, and steps of the pool. Once you’ve completed your brushing, vacuum the pool to dislodge and remove any spores that have settled on the bottom.


Use a steel brush for concrete or plaster pools. Use a nylon brush for vinyl, fiberglass, acrylic, or painted pools., Brush daily for a week with the proper brush for your pool, paying special attention to algae-affected areas. The protective layer that forms on black algae makes the algae otherwise impervious to regular sanitizers, so you must brush the algae to break through this layer so that chlorine and algaecides can kill the organism.Black algae have deep roots that work their way into the walls, grout, and filters in your pool. If the roots aren’t destroyed, the organism will continue to grow back.
Try rubbing the algae spots with a chlorine tablet after brushing.

, After brushing the pool for the first time, add a copper-based algaecide that has an active ingredient concentration of at least 30 percent.Aim the water return jets at the affected areas., After the algaecide has run its course, shock the pool. Continue your daily brushing, and after three days, shock the pool again., This will remove the dead algae and any debris that has settled on the bottom of the pool. To remove larger quantities of deal algae, consider adding an alum flocculant, which will cause the material to clump together for easier removal., Black algae can not only clog the filtration system and make it less efficient, but spores can also hide in the filters and bloom again when you least expect it. Wash all bathing suits and towels in the washing machine, and dry them in the dryer to kill any algae that may have attached to the fabric. Sanitize pool equipment and toys by scrubbing them with a bleach-based cleanser., You should do this regularly, but especially if you have recently adjusted the chemical levels of the pool.

Use chlorine as your go-to algae killer.,
Brush the walls and floor of the swimming pool.,
Review pool chemical safety.,
Adjust the pool pH.,
Choose a chlorine shock product.,
Add an extra large dose of shock.,
Test the pool again the next day.,
Brush and test daily.,
Vacuum the dead algae.,
Clean the filter.",How to Eliminate and Prevent Green Algae in a Swimming Pool1," When your pool water is green or contains visible algae clumps, your pool does not have enough chlorine. ""Shocking"" the pool with a large dose of chlorine is the most effective way to kill the existing algae and bring your pool back to sanitary conditions. This usually works within 1–3 days, but can take up to a week if pool conditions are poor.


The other methods listed below are faster, but may not fix underlying sanitation concerns. They are also more expensive and can have unwanted side effects.;
, Brush vigorously to remove as much of the algae as possible. This will reduce the amount of time it takes to kill and clear the algae bloom. Pay special attention to the steps, behind ladders, and other nooks and crannies where algae tends to gather.


Make sure the brush is compatible with your pool. Steel brushes work well on concrete, while nylon brushes are preferable for vinyl pools., You'll be handling dangerous chemicals during this method. Always read the safety information on the labels first. At minimum, follow these safety standards for all pool chemicals:Wear gloves, eye protection, and clothing that covers your skin. After use, wash hands and inspect clothes for chemicals.
Avoid inhaling the chemicals. Use caution when handling in windy weather.
Always add chemicals to water, never water to chemicals. Do not place wet scoops back in container.
Store chemicals in sealed, fireproof containers, away from children, on separate shelves on the same level (not one above the other). Many pool chemicals explode when they touch another pool chemical.

, Use a swimming pool pH test kit to measure the pH of your water. If the pH is above 7.6 — which is common during an algae bloom — add a pH reducer (such as sodium bisulfate) to your pool according to label instructions. Aim for pH levels between 7.2 and 7.6 to make your chlorine more effective and reduce the growth of the infestation.Wait at least a couple hours, then test the pool again.


Test kits that use tablets or droppers are much more accurate than paper test strips.If pH levels are back to normal but total alkalinity is above 120 ppm, check the pH reducer label for instructions to bring total alkalinity down between 80 and 120 ppm., The chlorine you use for regular pool treatment may not be the best choice for a shock treatment. Ideally, you should use a liquid chlorine product intended for swimming pools. The product should contain sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, or lithium hypochlorite.Avoid calcium hypochlorite if you have hard water.
All hypochlorite products are flammable and explosive. Lithium is relatively safer, but much more expensive.
Avoid granular or tablet chlorine products (such as dichlor or trichlor), which contain stabilizers that should not be added to the pool in large quantities.

, Check your chlorine product's label for ""shock"" instructions. To fight algae, use twice the recommended amount for a regular shock. Use triple the amount if the water is very murky, or even quadruple if you can't even see the top rung of the ladder.With the pool filter running, add the shock directly to the perimeter of the pool. (If you have a vinyl pool liner, pour the shock into a bucket of pool water first to avoid bleaching.)



Warning — liquid chlorine will explode and produce corrosive gas if it touches chlorine tablets or granules. Never pour the liquid chlorine into your pool skimmer or anything that contains these products.
Because UV rays in sunlight break down chlorine, shocking is most effective when added in the evening and left overnight.

, After the pool filter has been running for 12–24 hours, examine the pool. Dead algae turns white or gray, and either suspends in the pool water or settles to the floor. Whether or not the algae is dead, test the pool again for the new chlorine and pH levels.


If your chlorine levels are higher (2–5 ppm) but the algae is still there, keep maintaining these levels as usual for the next couple days.
If chlorine levels have risen but are still below 2ppm, shock a second time the next evening.
If there was no significant change in your chlorine levels, your pool likely has too much cyanuric acid (more than 50 ppm). This comes from using granulated or tablet chlorine, and can ""lock"" your chlorine into unusable forms. The only way to fight this is to shock repeatedly (sometimes many times), or to partially drain your pool.
Large amounts of leaf litter or other objects in the pool can also eat up your chlorine. If the pool has been unused a long time, this could take a full week and several shock treatments.

, Brush vigorously to fight new algal growth on the walls. Over the next couple days, the chlorine should kill the algae. Test daily to confirm that chlorine and pH levels are acceptable.


A well maintained pool has roughly the following values: Free Chlorine: 2-4 ppm, pH: 7.2 – 7.6, Alkalinity: 80 – 120 ppm and Calcium Hardness: 200 – 400 ppm.Slight differences in standards are common, so a small deviation should not be an issue.

, Once there is no green color left in your pool, vacuum up all the dead algae until the water is clear. You may skip this step and let the filter handle it, but only if you have a powerful filter and are willing to wait several days.


If you're having trouble getting all the algae, add coagulant or flocculant so it clumps together. These are available at pool stores, but may not be worth the purchase for a home pool.

, If you have a D.E. filter, set it to backwash. If you have a cartridge filter, remove it and clean the cartridge with a hose at high pressure, followed by dilute muriatic acid or liquid chlorine if necessary. If you do not clean the filter thoroughly, dead algae may block the filter.

Add preventative algaecide to your swimming pool on a weekly basis if you regularly experience problems with algae growth.,
Realize that if you have algae right now, you may need to use an algaecide.,
Know the different types of pool algaecide.,
Use a pool clarifier chemical when water becomes dull or cloudy and is not cleared by 12-24 hours of filtration.",How to Determine Which Pool Algaecide and Pool Clarifier Is Best for Your Swimming Pool," If you have never had an algae problem in your swimming pool, there is no need for the algaecide.;
, Some algaecides are preventative and others are used to treat an algae problem. Once algae has grown in your swimming pool, only a treatment algaecide combined with shocking will kill the algae.

,

Copper-based algaecides use copper to treat algae growth, and are most effective against mustard and green types of algae. Copper algaecides will not cause foam in a swimming pool, which can be a problem when using “quat"" algaecides. Although they are effective against many forms of algae, copper algaecides can cause stains on the surface of a swimming pool if the product is not used properly. Copper algaecides cannot be used in a swimming pool using a biguanide-based sanitizing system (such as Baquacil or SoftSwim).
The “quat"" or “polyquat"" algaecides are quaternary ammonium compounds (instead of a copper formula), which treat and prevent algae growth in a different way. These algaecides are safer to use than a copper based algaecide because they will not stain a swimming pool. If you have experienced any pool stains caused by metals in the past, you should use a quat or polyquat algaecide to treat your swimming pool. Although quats cannot cause staining, these algaecides may cause foaming if not used properly. Polyquat pool algaecides cannot cause staining or foaming, and are typically more expensive than the other forms of algaecides.

, If all chemical levels are properly balanced, cloudy pool water is caused by fine debris suspended in the swimming pool water. Dust or debris particles are sometimes too small for the pool filter to remove from the pool water, and may pass directly through the pool filter. A sand filter provides the least efficient filtering of pool water, and this problem is more likely to occur when using a sand pool filter. A pool clarifier chemical will group together very fine particles of debris into larger bunches, which can be more easily trapped by the pool filter. Most pool clarifier chemicals cannot be used in a swimming pool with a D.E. (diatomaceous earth) filter.

Use a pumice stone.,
Try a nylon bristle brush.,
Spray a releaser.,
Scrub the tile in a circular motion.",How to Clean Pool Tile1," Because calcium carbonate scaling is white and flakey, it is easy to remove with a pumice stone. You can purchase pumice stones from your local pool maintenance store or online.Pumice stone is safe to use on hard surfaces such as tile and concrete. It can be used on both concrete and plaster pools.
Do not use pumice stone on vinyl or fiberglass pools.;
, Use a nylon brush if your tiles are glass, ceramic or porcelain. A nylon brush will not scratch these tiles. As an alternative, you can use a 3M blue or white nylon scrub pad., Releasers, such as the Ocean Care Calcium Releaser, will soften the calcium for removal. The Ocean Care Calcium Releaser is acid-free, biodegradable, and non-toxic, making it safe to use without having to drain your pool completely., Scrub the tiles until deposits, mildew, and build-up are gone. If using a pumice stone, make sure both the tile and the stone are wet at all times while cleaning. This will prevent any scratching.You may wear latex gloves to protect your hands while cleaning, but it is not necessary.

Rinse any debris from the filter with a garden hose and spray nozzle before the filter dries after you have removed it.,
Allow the filters to dry thoroughly, preferably in bright sunshine, which has effective algaecide properties.

,
Shake or use an air compressor to remove loose particles from the filter's fabric.,
Save the filters you would normally throw in the trash until you have several to clean.,
Prepare a large bucket with a tight-fitting lid to soak your filters.,
Allow the filters to soak to kill any microorganisms that are trapped in the filter media, and to break down any organic contaminants.,
Remove the filters and rinse in a bucket of clean water.,
Hang or place the filters in bright sunlight and allow them to dry thoroughly.,
Seal the bucket you soak the filters in when not in use so you won't have to add additional chlorinator each time you clean filters.,
Mix a solution of muriatic acid and water to dissolve minerals that accumulate in the filter media, reducing the rate water can pass through the filter.,
Soak the filters in the acid solution until it quits bubbling.,
Seal this container when you are finished with it.,
Rinse the acid cleaned filters with plenty of fresh water, then allow them to dry, shake any remaining collected dirt from the pleats, and they are ready either to proceed to chlorine soaking, or if this step has followed the chlorine soaking, they are ready for reuse in your pool.

,
Reuse your cleaned filters.

",How to Clean a Cartridge Type Swimming Pool Filter2," Drying will allow the collected debris to set into the filter media, making it more difficult to remove later.

,, This can be done by tapping it on a surface, brushing with a stiff paint brush, or other means. Note that this step is in preparation for the actual cleaning, so getting it perfect is not necessary.

, Because cleaning involves using chlorinator and takes time, cleaning individual filters is not efficient. five gallon/18.9 liter plastic paint bucket will hold about five type C filters.

, Use a solution of 1 part pool chlorinator to 6 parts water. Submerge the filters in this solution, then place the lid on the bucket.

, One day is good start, but 3 to 5 days will provide better results.

, Agitate the filters by holding them at one end, and dunking them briskly in and out of the rinse water. You should see a cloud of rinsed contaminants coming from the filter.

, Any more dirt that is trapped on the surface of the filter should be brushed off, using a stiff bristled paint or parts cleaning brush.

, Some sediment will accumulate in the bottom of this bucket, but it doesn't affect the usability of the solution.

, Use another clean bucket with a lid that seals tightly. Add about 2/3 of a bucket of clean water, then carefully pour in enough muriatic acid to give you a 1 part acid to 10 parts water solution. In a typical 5 gallon bucket, this means about 3 gallons of water to 1 1/2 quarts acid.

, The bubbles are an indication the acid is reacting with the mineral deposits, and when the bubbling has quit, the minerals should be dissolved.

, If you keep your containers sealed tightly, the chemicals (either the acid or chlorinator) will not weaken and may be reused for several cleanings. Allowing the containers to remain open will allow the chlorine to evaporate out of your solution, rendering it useless in a short time.

Improve circulation to handle small spots of algae.,
Gather the algae with a flocculant.,
Treat the pool with algaecide.",How to Eliminate and Prevent Green Algae in a Swimming Pool2," If small clumps of algae form but do not spread to the rest of the pool, you may have areas of stagnant water. Check that your water jets are functioning properly. They should point into the water at an angle, so the water moves in a spiral pattern., A flocculant or coagulant clumps the algae together, making it possible to vacuum living algae. This may take a hard day of work, but your pool should be clear by the end of it.This is the fastest way to get your pool looking good, but it does not make the water safe to swim in. If algae can multiply, so can viruses and bacteria. Follow this with a chlorine shock treatment to sanitize the pool, and do not swim in the pool until chlorine and pH levels are back to normal.

, Algaecide will certainly kill your algae, but the side effects and expense may not be worth it. Here are a few factors to weigh when considering this option:Some algaecide products are not powerful enough to treat an existing bloom, especially if you have black algae as well. Ask a pool store employee for help, or find a product with 30%+ active ingredients.
Quaternary ammonia algaecides (""poly quats"") are cheap, but cause your water to foam. Many people find this annoying.
Copper-based algaecides are more effective, but expensive. They usually stain your pool walls as well.
After adding the algaecide, wait at least 24 hours before adding other chemicals.

"
"
Maintain your pool water.,
Add an algaecide as a preventative.,
Remove phosphates.",How to Eliminate and Prevent Green Algae in a Swimming Pool3," Algae should not grow if you keep on top of your pool chemistry. Test the pool regularly for free chlorine levels, pH, alkalines, and cyanuric acid. The faster you catch a problem, the easier it will be to deal with it.


Daily testing is ideal, especially in the week or two following an algal bloom. Always test at least twice a week during the swimming season.

, Algaecides are best used in small, weekly doses when pool conditions are normal. This will kill algae populations before they have a chance to grow. Check the product label for instructions.


Make sure to follow instructions for regular prevention, not for existing algae blooms. Too much algaecide may stain your pool or cause foaming.

, Algae feed off several nutrients in the water, notably phosphates. Phosphate test kits are a cheap way to test for these chemicals in your pool. If they are present, use a commercial strength phosphate remover from a pool supply store. Let the filter and robot or manual vacuum remove the phosphate remover over the next day or two. Shock the pool once the phosphates are at a reasonable level.


Pool professionals disagree over acceptable phosphate levels. 300 ppm is probably low enough unless you have recurring algae problems."

Rent a pressure washer from your local hardware store.,
Remove debris around the pool.,
Test a small area first.,
Wash your pool in sections.",How to Clean Pool Tile2," Choose a steam pressure washer with a PSI of 2000 to 2600 and one that can reach a temperature of at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). The pressure and temperature will enable you to clean your pool tiles quickly and effectively.With steam pressure washers, you do not need to pretreat the tile with chemicals or detergents.

, Debris such as branches, leaves, twigs, and trash should be swept up and removed before using the pressure washer. Also remove lose furniture and objects that can be easily swept away such as plants, pool equipment and toys, lawn furniture, grills, and other lose objects., Set the machine according to the manual’s instructions. Start with a low setting and the least powerful nozzle first. Pick an inconspicuous spot and stand at least three feet away from it. Spray the area for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, stop and check the spot to make sure the surface is not damaged.Make sure all the outlets, inlets, and accessories are perfectly connected and secured before turning the pressure washer on.
For your safety, make sure to wear safety goggles, close-toed shoes, and protective clothing that can get wet.

, Turn the pressure washer up to a higher setting, for example 2000 to 2600 PSI at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius), and begin washing the pool in small sections. Use the washer’s wands and attachments to reach tight corners and crevices when you need to.If you are having a tough time removing the scaling from the tiles, then turn the temperature up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius).
Remember to stand at least three feet away.

Add 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of muriatic acid to 1 gallon of water in a bucket.,
Apply the solution to the tile with an acid brush.,
Add soda ash to the acidic solution at the bottom of the pool.,
Pump the neutralized acid out of the pool.",How to Clean Pool Tile3," Remove debris like leaves and algae from the bottom of the pool once the water is drained. Then place your water hose at the deep-end side of the pool. Position it near the ledge so that the water will run over the tile when you turn it on., Because the acid solution emits noxious fumes and is harmful if it gets onto your skin and body, rubber boots, safety gloves and goggles, and a respirator with an acid approved filter are necessary. For extra precaution, wear a protective suit that is chemical-resistant., You can use a plastic bucket. Make sure to slowly add the acid to the water and not the other way around. Because the acid will fizz and emit fumes when you pour it into the water, make sure you are wearing your respirator, goggles, gloves, and protective clothing.You can purchase muriatic acid and acid-resistant cleaning tools from your local pool maintenance store or online.

, Starting at the deep end of the pool, work the solution into the grout with the brush. Working on small sections at a time, scrub the tile with an acid-resistant scrub brush. Once the calcium silicate scaling is removed, rinse the tile with water using the hose.Alternatively, fill a watering can with the solution and use the can to pour it onto the tiles. Then use the acid-resistant scrub brush to clean the tile.
Repeat this process until all the tiles are cleaned.

, Add 2 pounds (.9 kilograms) of soda ash for every gallon of acid. Do this once you are done cleaning all of the tiles. The soda ash neutralizes the acid so it can be safely removed from your pool., Do this using a water pump. Once the acid is pumped out, rinse the pool with the hose. Then proceed to pump this water out of the pool as well. When the pool is completely rinsed and cleaned, refill it with water.When rinsing the pool, make sure to rinse your boots, gloves, goggles, and protective clothing with water as well. Rinse until all the acid is completely gone.

Call a pool cleaning professional in case of continued failure.",How to Diagnose and Clear Cloudy Swimming Pool Water," Algal growth, molds, and buildup of body wastes from swimmers can all cause cloudiness. If the water is green or visibly contaminated biologically, avoid swimming in the pool and begin treatment to kill biological growth.;
, It should measure alkalinity, calcium hardness, total, free, and combined chlorine, pH, and cyanuric acid. These levels all have impact on the clarity, safety, and sterility of pool water. Many low-cost kits only test for pH and free chlorine levels, which might not give you an accurate picture of the chemical situation of the pool water., The two areas that are most likely to cause cloudy pool water are the pH and the calcium hardness, though low chlorine/can indicate biological contamination.


Non-chlorine pool cleaner alternatives like bromine can be measured with a DPD test. Multiply the chlorine level by 2.25. Recommended levels of chlorine should be multiplied as well. This particular test is impacted by the density of the cleaning agent, and bromine is more dense by this factor. , Buildup of sediment can interfere with the filtration and retention of particulate matter. Previous attempts to clean could have damaged the filter. You can monitor the filter for clogs by examining if the return pump in the pool has reduced pressure.


Avoid using backwash cleaning methods with a sand-bed filter, as this can reduce filtration efficiency by loosening the filtration media, and might force the purchase of a new filter.

, Vacuum any loose debris, scrub the sides and floor with a brush, and vacuum any loosened detritus. Run the pool filter for 8-12 hours to remove any flotsam and detritus that might be clouding the pool.

, If it is malfunctioning, or is a sand-bed filter, backwash cleaning methods could have damaged the filtration media. It is essential to continue pool maintenance, and any malfunction should be treated seriously. Check the lines and filtration media before deciding what to replace.

, Vacuum any loose debris, scrub the sides and floor with a brush, and vacuum any loosened detritus. Run the pool filter for 8-12 hours to remove any flotsam and detritus that might be clouding the pool.

, Loose colloidal particles cause cloudiness. They are either organic in nature (like algae) or mineral buildups (loose calcium). Adjust the chemicals to these ranges and run the pool filter system for another day before re-testing.


Free chlorine: 1-2 ppm
Combined chlorine: <.3ppm
pH: 7.2 – 7.8
Total alkalinity: 80 – 120 ppm
Calcium hardness: 180 – 220 ppm (higher levels are acceptable up to approximately 400ppm)

, Do not attempt to mix strong acids or bases in your pool or without eye and skin protection and respirators.

, Combined chlorine is free chlorine that has reacted with an agent in the water to form chloramine, which produces a strong chlorine scent. Pool shock kits should raise the chlorine to over 30ppm.


If your pH test kit uses litmus paper and produces a purple or off color, this may be due to high levels of chlorine. Test kits often have a reagent, typically thiosulfate, that will remove the chlorine and enable an accurate test.
High levels of cyanuric acid can reduce chlorine’s efficacy as a sterilizing agent and can be reduced with dilution. , High variance day-to-day indicates a chlorine demand problem. Monitor cyanuric acid levels, which acts as a stabilizer for chlorine to prevent UV degradation, and consider investigating your chlorinator or investing in one to ease the process of keeping your pool stable. , Add them according to the directions on the package according to the volume of your pool. The solutions should be dispersed and accomplished their chemical reactions within six hours of treatment. , You can also use dilution with softer water to soften the water. These are agglomerating solutions that work best in slightly alkaline water, and take several days for the full effect to be observed. The hardness of local water resources varies tremendously from area to area, and the strength and dilution of these products can be recommended by pool cleaning professionals.

, Clarifiers are agglomerating solutions that bind to colloids from the water and bring them out of suspension, to be removed by vacuum or through the filter. These chemicals are called flocculents, and the process is referred to as flocculation. Continue filtering for without interruption until the water clears.

, and continue to run your filtration system if the pool has not cleared. Keep in mind that too much clarifier will actually work against the clarifying process; particles will repel one another rather attract, and the concentration of the clarifier will increase. Follow label instructions to the letter. Do not repeat more often than 2 additional times over the course of one week.

, Discoloration, buildup, or rust, is likely the result of water hardness or alkalinity changes, rather than the flocculent.

, Multiple treatments failing generally indicates a secondary, unseen problem that can be detected and treated most effectively and safely by a professional. Multiple cleanings can cause skin and mucous membrane irritation for swimmers. Make sure any cleaning hardware is not malfunctioning.

If your pool has an autofill, you should make sure that you turn it off during the drain. Once your pool is completely empty, start the acid-wash process.;
,, Acid must be added to the water and not the other way around.

, The hose should not have a nozzle and water should be running from the hose at all times.

, During this time, you should be scrubbing the wall with a brush.

, Before moving to the next section, make sure you rinse the wall well so the acid doesn't continue to eat the plaster.

, The acid-washing process leaves a foamy puddle of residue on the bottom of the pool that must be removed before it damages the plaster.


Apply soda ash to the acid puddle, scrubbing the mixture with a pool brush. You will need to use 2 lb. (.9 kg) of soda ash per 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of acid.

Shock the pool regularly.,
Shock after the sun has gone down.,
Dissolve the pool shock chemicals.,
Stir the bucket well.,
With the filtration system running, slowly pour the bucket of dissolved shock directly in front of a return line fitting.,
Refill with water.,
Do readings before re-entering the pool water.",How to Shock Your Swimming Pool," What determines ""regular"" will depend on a number of swimmers using the pool and the temperature of the pool water. The best indicator is to monitor the results of home chlorine tests; when the test results show that combined available chlorine and free available chlorine are below their recommended ranges, then it's time to shock the pool.Pool experts recommend shocking a pool at a minimum of once a month. If the water is warm (such as for a spa pool), twice a month minimum is recommended.However, some pool experts recommend shocking pools once a week, or more frequently, if the pool is used heavily, after large amounts of rain, or during extended periods of hot, sunny weather.;
, This will prevent the sun's UV rays from affecting the chlorine or other chemical and ensures that the majority of the chemical is available to shock the pool., This must be done before adding the pool shock chemicals to the swimming pool. All forms of pool shock chemicals are granular and should dissolve relatively quickly.


Fill a 5-gallon/19 liter (5.0 US gal) bucket with water from the pool.
Slowly pour the granular pool shock into the bucket of water.

Never add water to a chemical; always add chemicals to water.

, Agitate the water for one minute or more to dissolve the pool shock chemicals.

, You will see the water being carried out into the pool by the jet of water coming from the return line.


Pour slowly enough that all of the water from your bucket is carried out into the pool and does not settle to the pool floor. Pouring slowly is also vital to prevent splashing on your skin, clothes and any surfaces, which can injure or stain, depending on what the splashes land on.Pour as close to the water's surface as possible.

, When you are pouring and get near the bottom of the bucket of dissolved shock water (down to about 1/4 left in the bucket), fill the bucket back up with water.


Stir the bucket of water again for one minute or more, to dissolve left over shock granules at the bottom of the bucket, which did not dissolve the first time.
Continue pouring until all the contents are used.
If undissolved granules reach the pool floor bottom, stir them up with a pool cleaner.

, Swimming in water with too much chlorine is very dangerous. Wait until the water reads 3ppm or less.

Stop adding chlorine to your pool.,
Use a bucket to dechlorinate a small amount of water.,
Run the pool pump.",How to Dechlorinate Pool Water1," Simply stop adding the chlorine tablets that you regularly put in your outdoor swimming pool. Exposure to sunlight will gradually dechlorinate the water. You’ll need to leave the pool uncovered for two weeks., If you only need to dechlorinate a bit of pool water to irrigate a tree or a shrub, you can use a bucket. Scoop out a bucket of water and place it in a sunny spot. Leave it in the sun for a week, and the chlorine should be evaporated., Although you have stopped adding chlorine, you should continue to run the pump. By circulating the water in your pool, the pump will help ensure thorough dechlorination."

Shock your pool.,
Keep chlorine in the pool using a chlorine feeder.,
To maintain safe swimming in your pool, it is important to monitor your pool chemical levels.",How to Chlorinate a Pool,"  This method requires you to add a large amount of chlorine to your pool quickly.  Doing this eliminates organic substances in your pool that bother your swimmers and prevent the chlorine from sanitizing the pool water.;
,  Many pool owners prefer automatic chlorine feeders because they precisely dole out small increments of chlorine into your pool. This keeps your pool safe for swimming. Using an automatic chlorine feeder saves you time on pool maintenance because a properly adjusted chlorine feeder only needs to be checked once a week.  Another option is to use a flotation device that holds chlorine tablets to keep your pool properly chlorinated. 

,  Use test strips to check your pool's chlorine and pH levels.  Typically, you dip one test strip into your pool and then compare the color on the strip to the color code on the bottle.  Once you know your pool's chemical levels you can add the necessary chemicals.

Check your gauges again.",How to Clean a Sand Filter," The pressure gauge (or gauges) on your filter will let you know it's time for a cleaning. If your sand filter has both an ""inlet pressure gauge"" and an ""outlet pressure gauge,"" a pressure differential of 16 and 20 psi means it is time to clean your filter. However, if your sand filter has just an inlet pressure gauge, a rise in pressure of 8 to 10 psi indicates that it is time for a cleaning.Most sand filters will need to be cleaned every 2-4 weeks.
You can also clean your sand filter anytime your pool seems cloudy, or after a period of very heavy use (such as a party).;
, Before you take any action to clean the sand filter, it is important to turn of the pump. To ensure your safety (and the longevity of your pump), you should also switch off the pump's power at the circuit breaker., Once the pump has been turned off (and the circuit breaker switched off), you are free to change the setting on the filter. Switch the filter valve to the ""backwash"" setting., Take your backwash hose and position it over the backwash nozzle. Secure the hose with a metal hose clamp and tighten it using a screwdriver. Point the other end of the hose to where you would like to discharge., Once your waste hose is properly positioned, it is time to turn the pump back on (remember to turn on the circuit breaker as well). Allow the pump to run on the backwash setting for at least two minutes., Although two minutes is a general guideline, the best way to determine whether or not you have adequately back washed your sand filter is by keeping an eye on the sight glass. When the water flowing through the sight glass runs clear, you know that your filter is clean., After you have completed your backwash cycle, you will need to change to a new setting. Once again, before changing the settings on your valve, you must turn the filter completely off. , With the filter switched off, turn your valve to the ""rinse"" setting. After backwashing, the sand in your filter will need resetting. Additionally, any dirty water remaining in the filter needs to be rinsed out, otherwise it could reenter the pool. Turn the pump back on and run the filter on ""rinse"" for 1-2 minutes to clear out dirty water and reset the sand., After rinsing is complete, turn the pump off once again, and switch your valve to the standard ""filter"" setting. Turn you pump back on and allow it to run normally., After allowing your pump to run for 1-2 hours, be sure to check your pressure gauges again. Your gauges should have returned to normal, indicating that your filter is clean.A normal pressure differential is between 3 and 5 psi.

Purchase a dechlorination product.,
Try vitamin C-based dechlorination tablets.,
Ask a pool professional about carbon absorption filters.,
Pour sodium thiosulfate into the pool.",How to Dechlorinate Pool Water2," To chemically dechlorinate your swimming pool, you can use dechlorination tablets or liquid, such as sodium thiosulphate. The most common chemical for dechlorination is sulfur dioxide, although carbon absorption, sodium metabisulfite, and hydrogen peroxide are also used for this purpose. You should make sure the product you purchase from your swimming pool retailer states that it meets Environmental Protection Agency standards., You can use ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate, which are two forms of vitamin C, to dechlorinate water. Vitamin C does not remove oxygen from the water and is not toxic to aquatic life. Whereas sulphur-based products remove oxygen from water and are toxic to fish, vitamin C-based dechlorinators, such as Vita-D-Chlor, are aligned with the EPA’s Clean Water Act. They are safe to handle and easy to dissolve.Vitamin C-based dechlorinators are more expensive than sulphur-based products.

, If you are looking for the most thorough method of dechlorination, carbon absorption is the way to go. However, it is more expensive than some of the other methods, such as sulphur-based dechlorination tablets. You’ll have to ask a swimming pool specialist about the carbon filters that are available for your pool.You could ask the pool professional, “Is there a carbon-based filter that would work well for my pool?”

, You can use an appropriate amount of sodium thiosulphate to dechlorinate your pool. Pour some warm water in a bucket. Add the required amount of sodium thiosulphate to the bucket. Pour the contents of the bucket into the pool.If your pool contains 5000 gallons of water and the total chlorine is currently 50 ppm, you’ll need to add 1.56 pounds (.7 kilograms) of sodium thiosulfate.
Use an online dechlorination calculator to determine how much sodium thiosulphate to use.

Test the chlorine levels after two weeks.,
Obtain a water sample for testing with a DPD test kit.,
Hold the comparator at eye level in proper light.,
Compare the color in the tube with the comparator in the test kit.,
Use a colorimeter to determine chlorine levels.,
Use test strips.,
Determine whether chlorine levels are close to zero.",How to Dechlorinate Pool Water3," After two weeks without adding any chlorine to your pool and with the pump running, you should test the chlorine levels. The most accurate way of measuring chlorine concentrations is through a DPD (N-Diethylparaphenylenediamine) test, although test strips or a colorimeter can also be used.DPD test kits use a comparator. A comparator allows you to compare your sample to color standards. You put your sample in the slot and then compare the color to the standards on the side of the instrument.
A colorimeter is an instrument that uses white light to determine chlorine levels. It is a separate instrument, which won’t be included in standard DPD test kits.
Test strips can also be used to determine chlorine levels. They are the simplest and cheapest option.

, You’ll need to get a DPD test kit, which should include some test tubes to obtain water samples. Reach into the pool to obtain a water sample from at least elbow depth. Add the recommended drops of DPD reactant to the tubes. Mix the solution in the tube by turning it upside down with the cap on., Since the use of the color comparator included in your test kit will involve differentiating between different hues of the same color, such as shades of yellow or pink, you’ll need to perform the test in good lighting conditions. If you are outside, you’ll need to hold the comparator at eye level with the sun a bit to the side, as opposed to shining directly through the comparator. You’ll need to remove your sunglasses, which could interfere with your reading.If you are inside, you’ll need to establish lighting that is as close to daylight as possible.

, On the front of the test kit, you’ll see a color chart that you can use to determine the chlorine level.Find the closest match and note the associated chlorine level in a notebook., Instead of the comparator included in a DPD test kit, you could use an instrument called a colorimeter. This tool uses a white light beam, which is sent through an optical filter. You just insert your water sample in the top slot. Turn on the colorimeter, which will send a white light beam through the sample. You will get a number on a digital display on the front of the instrument, which indicates the amount of chlorine in the sample., If you are looking for a simple and cheap way to test chlorine levels, you might want to use test strips. Dip the test strip in your pool. Pull out the test strip and wait for the number of seconds indicated on the test strip kit. You’ll need to hold the test strip horizontally. Then, compare the color on the test strip to the color chart included in the test strip kit. Once you find a match, note the associated chlorine concentration.Although not as accurate as a DPD test using a comparator or a colorimeter, test strips will give you a good enough reading in most situations.

, You’ll want to use one of the testing methods to determine whether the chlorine levels are close to zero or at least at an acceptable level (<0.1 mg/L). If the color in the water sample indicates an acceptable level of chlorine, you have successfully dechlorinated your pool.If the chlorine level is not acceptable, you can let it naturally dechlorinate for another couple weeks, or use a chemical method.

Understand how a hydraulic system works.,
Determine what type of power source your hydraulic system will require.,
Look at some simple, everyday hydraulic systems to help you become familiar with their function.,
Plan your hydraulic system project with the design parameters you will require.,
Determine the amount of work your system will do to allow you to size the components correctly.,
Choose the appropriate container for your hydraulic fluid reservoir.,
Pick a suitable material to plumb up your hydraulic circuit.,
Find a suitable valve system for your task.,
Select the type of and capacity of your hydraulic pump.,
Pair up a suitable motor to your pump.,
Hook up your power application component.,
Build a support frame that will position each component in a position where it will perform it's task.,
Fill the system with the hydraulic fluid you choose, bleed the air out of it, then pressurize it to check for leaks.",How to Hook up Hydraulics," There are basically four elements to the system, as well as possibly many smaller associated components for specialized purposes. Here are the basic four and a brief description of each.


Fluid Reservoir. This is a tank or other container that holds the fluid to supply the rest of the system.
Fluid Circuit. These are the pipes or hoses which transfer the fluid from one element of the system to another.
Hydraulic Pump. This device pushes hydraulic fluid through the circuit and provides the energy for the system to do its job.
Hydraulic motor or cylinder. This is the component that causes something to move, driven by the power of the hydraulic pump.

Subcomponents that manipulate or regulate the fluid as it does its job include various valves which allow excess fluid to bypass the hydraulic motor or cylinder, control valves or valve spools, regulators, accumulators, pressure switches, and pressure gauges.

;
, This can be an electric motor, and internal combustion engine, steam, wind, or water power. The main requirement is that the means for supplying the system with energy is that it is available and can generate sufficient torque for the purpose it is intended.

, A hydraulic jack can allow a small person to lift 20 tons of weight or more. A power steering system on a car can reduce the force required to steer it considerably, and a hydraulic log splitter can force a steel wedge through even the toughest wood.

, You will need to decide what type of power you will use for generating pressure for the system to do the work, what type of control valves, if any, what type of pump you will use, and what type of tubing you will pipe/plumb your system with. You will have to choose a power delivery system to accomplish the task you are building your system for, an example would be using a hydraulic cylinder to split a log, or lift a heavy weight.

, A large capacity system will need a pump rated at a high volume, measured in volume per minute, such as GPM, or gallons per minute, and pressure, measure in weight per unit of area, such as PSI, or pounds per square inch. This being said, and typical hydraulic pump may deliver 0.65 GPM at 2200 PSI. The same applies to the hydraulic engine or cylinder you will use to drive, or operate your machine. An example is a cylinder that lifts a set of forks on a forklift. It requires ""X"" gallons of oil at ""Y"" pressure to lift ""___"" pounds, ""___"" feet in the air.

, A steel or plastic tank that can have leak proof fittings attached to it to connect hoses or pipes will work. Remember, the reservoir is not pressurized when the system is operational, but you will need to vent it if you pipe excess fluid directly back to it through a bypass valve or other device.

, Reinforced rubber hoses with o-ring seals or flared fittings may be the easiest to route on your machine, but high-tensile steel tubing is more durable and requires less maintenance over time.

, A simple On/Off fluid valve will function as a control valve if it is rated for the operating pressure of your system, but for complicated functions, you will be better off with a variable flow valve spool, which can regulate the flow, and in some instances, the direction of flow in a hydraulic circuit.

, There are essentially two types of hydraulic pumps, a generator type, which forces oil between two or more meshed gears in a sealed housing, or a roller type, which operates with a number of cylindrical rollers configured around a cam in a sealed housing. They each have advantages and disadvantages, so choosing one that performs to your machine's requirements is up to you.

, Pumps may operate off of a direct-drive shaft, a reduction gear drive, a chain and sprocket drive, or a belt drive. Obviously each is more suitable in specific applications, and the choice depends on individual design criteria.

, For simply moving an arm or lever on a machine, a hydraulic cylinder is your most likely choice. This device is a steel tube with a piston/rod assembly inside of it, sealed to prevent oil from escaping. There are a number of types of cylinders in many different sizes, so again, selection depends on the specific design requirements of the project. Another device that uses the hydraulic power supplied by the pump is a hydraulic motor, seen used on winches and ground drive wheels on some types of aerial equipment, as well as manufacturing equipment like metal forming rollers.

, This can be done on a flat surface, a metal framework, or even in multiple framed, remote function elements. An example would be having a pump, reservoir, and valve assembly on one platform, and having the hydraulic cylinder and support assembly in another location, as is found on hydraulic elevators in 2 to 4 story (or even higher) buildings.

, Now it should be ready to operate it to assess the function of the components. Without specific design criteria and engineering, it is likely you will need to tweak the finished product to optimize its operation.

Separate the grease gun head from the barrel.,
Insert the open end of the barrel into a container of grease.,
Remove the barrel from the grease.,
Reattach the barrel of the grease gun to the head of the grease gun.,
Test the dispensing of the grease.",How to Load a Grease Gun1," If you have access to bulk grease in large containers, grease guns can be loaded more efficiently. To get started, unscrew the head from the cap. The head is the part with the handle and applicator tube attached. Unscrew the two pieces of the grease gun and separate them.









Make sure that the handle on the back of the barrel, which is the handle of the piston rod, is fully depressed into the barrel, or you risk sucking some grease through the gun during the process, accidentally.;
, Fill the barrel by holding the open end of the barrel down into the container of grease and slowly drawing back on the plunger rod to fill the reservoir, pulling grease back into the barrel.









Bulk grease containers are available at hardware stores and auto parts stores, widely, and are commonly used in garages in place of smaller cartridges. If you're a serious mechanic, this might be a good option for you.

, When the plunger rod has been fully withdrawn, lift the open end of the barrel out of the container of grease. Rotate the barrel to break it free from grease that may cling to the barrel. Use a cloth or rag to wipe excess grease from the end of the barrel.








, Different grease guns will work in slightly different ways. For some, it might be a matter of screwing the end cap on, while others need the nozzle screwed on. Either way, engage the threads and turn until the joint is fully seated.








, Press on the handle of the piston rod and squeeze the trigger of the grease gun until delivery of grease is seen at the end of the grease gun applicator tube. Wipe excess grease from the dispensing tip and the body of the grease gun. Use a cloth or rag to wipe the gun down and clean it to prepare for use.

Invest in a tool that allows you to identify studs in your walls.,
Determine what kind of stud finder you have.,
Calibrate the stud finder if necessary.,
Pay attention to which model of stud finder you have.,
Run the tool across the wall at the installation height for whatever you want to hang.,
Find out if you have metal studs before drilling into them.",How to Find a Stud1," These are often called stud finders or stud sensors. They can be purchased at hardware shops, home improvement retailers or department stores.;
, Some stud finders are magnetic, so you will feel a pull when a stud is identified based on the presence of nails or wires running along the stud. Others measure changes in your wall width. These will signal the presence of a stud with a sound or flashing light.


Magnetic stud finders can be less effective than other types of stud finders. This is because they do not discriminate between metals. A metal pipe that is nowhere near a stud will appear much the same to a magnetic stud finder as will a length of wire mounted on a stud.Only use a stud finder that measures the changes in wall width if you have walls made of drywall. This is because drywall has a uniform width, which makes it easy for the stud finder. Plaster, on the other hand, often lacks uniform width, which can interfere with the stud finder.

, Some models will require you to calibrate them before use. You do this by placing the stud finder against a section of wall where there is no stud and turning it on. The calibration process will take differing lengths of time depending on the model. Some models may calibrate in a few seconds while others may need closer to one minute. Generally the stud finder will indicate once it has finished calibrating or if you need to repeat the process.Stud finders that require calibration will generally have a method of alerting you if you have placed the finder over a stud or other material that may interfere with the calibration process, such as metal. Simply move the stud finder to a different location and try again.

, An edge-finding model will locate the edge of a stud. So if you have one of these, you will have to repeat the process from the other direction to find the other edge of the stud. You may also need to recalibrate the stud finder before making a second pass. A center-sensing model, on the other hand, will indicate where the center of the stud is.If you have an edge-finding model, bear in mind that the width of studs can vary between 1.5 and 3.5 inches (3.81 cm and 8.89 cm) if your residence uses 2 x 4 lumber.Other widths of lumber lead to different stud widths.Therefore, consider checking with a contractor or your landlord to determine how wide your studs are.

, Look for the indicator that tells you a stud has been located. Repeat this process several times at varying heights to confirm that you have found a stud.


Measure and mark 16 inch (40.64 cm) increments across to find additional studs based on your baseboards. This is typical stud spacing. Older homes may have studs 24 inches apart. Use your stud finder to confirm that studs exist at these points.

, Many apartment and office buildings use metal studs rather than wood ones. If this is the case for your residence or building, you’ll need to use special fasteners. Most wood screws will not go through metal."

Drain your pool.,
Coat the sides of the pool with liquid chlorine.,
Coat the bottom of the pool with chlorine.,
Scrub away any remaining algae.,
Rinse the pool down with water.,
Pump the liquid out of the pool.,
Maintain adequate chemical levels.,
Use an automatic cleaner.,
Keep your pool’s filter and pump clean.,
Fill in cracks in your pool.,
Redirect your returns.",How to Chlorine Wash a Pool," Before you can chlorine wash your pool, you will need to drain it. Drain your pool using the waste line of your pool pump and motor system.Check your water discharge regulations before draining your pool so you can dispose of the water you pump out in a responsible manner. Many municipalities prohibit pumping water into street sewers. Instead, you’ll probably need to drain your pool into your sewer’s clean-out.
Contact your local water and sewer department for information about how to drain your pool legally.;
, Pour some liquid chlorine in a large watering can. Move around the inside of the pool with the watering can, pouring the water along the top edge of the pool so that the liquid chlorine washes down the sides. You should be able to see the algae visibly washing off the sides of your pool.It probably won’t be necessary to use undiluted liquid chlorine. Fill your watering can up about halfway with liquid chlorine and the rest of the way up with water. If you find the chlorine wash is not adequately removing the algae from your pool, decrease the amount of water you use in your watering can.
You can get liquid chlorine at many big-box stores that deal in home and garden supplies.

, After applying the liquid chlorine to the sides of the pool, repeat on the bottom of the pool. Moving from one end of the pool to the other, pour the water/chlorine mix over the surface. Coat the entire bottom of the pool in the liquid chlorine mix., If, after chlorine washing your pool, you see a few isolated spots of particularly tenacious algae, dip a stiff bristled brush in the liquid chlorine. Scrub the affected areas until the algae is gone.After chlorine washing your pool and scrubbing away any remaining algae, your pool should be algae-free. However, if scrubbing is not doing the trick, try a second chlorine wash using a water/chlorine mixture that contains less water and more liquid chlorine.

, Once you’ve pumped the chlorinated algae wastewater out of your pool, rinse the sides and bottom of the pool. This will wash off any algae that might have been loosened by the scrubbing process, and flush out algae that still lurks in cracks or crevices.Rinse the pool using a watering can filled with regular water. Pour the water over the pool’s surface just as you initially did when applying the chlorine wash to the pool.
Alternately, break out a pressure washer to spray the sides and bottom of the pool off with a high-pressure spray.

, Once you’ve chlorine washed your pool, you’ll need to pump the dissolved algae and liquid chlorine out. Use your pool pump and motor system to remove the liquid just as you did when you initially drained it., When your pool is in use, you should test it two or three times weekly to ensure its chlorine, bromine, and alkalinity levels are within acceptable ranges. To test these levels, use a pool test strip. Just dip the strip into the water according to manufacturer directions and check the results. Typically, if the levels is off, the test strip will display a particular color.For instance, if the levels are normal, the test strip might show a blue color. If the levels are off, it might show a color like green or yellow.
If any of your pool’s chemical levels are off, apply the appropriate product (chlorine, bromine, or another product) in amounts that enable you to get your pool within the acceptable level.
The amount of each product you’ll need to maintain a chemically balanced pool depends on your pool’s size and the amount of chemical product already in your pool. Consult the product instructions and/or your pool’s owner manual to determine how much of each product you should use.
You can obtain pool test strips from any big box store that deals in pool supplies or home and garden products.

, If you have an automatic cleaner, you can run it to prevent your pool from developing a buildup of algae. There are many makes and models of automatic pool cleaners, but generally, operating one is as easy as pressing the “on” switch and dropping it in your pool.Running the automatic cleaner once each week should be sufficient.

, The pool pump and filter are like the lungs of the pool. If they are clean, the pool can “breathe” easily and will stay clean and healthy. If they are dirty, you might see algae. Cleaning the filter at least once a month is usually sufficient, though if you notice a lot of gunk in the filter, you might need to begin cleaning it more often.Consult your pool’s user guide for directions regarding how to clean the pool filter.
Generally, you’ll need to turn the pump off and relieve the pressure in the filter.
Remove the filter head off the filter and slip the pool filter out of the filtration unit.
Spray the filter down using a high-pressure hose. Replace the cartridge and close the top of the filtration unit when you’re done.

, Algae often takes root in the cracks the develop in the sides or bottom of the pool where circulation is poor. After emptying your pool, chlorine washing the sides, and scrubbing it clean, you’ll have the opportunity to fix any cracks that may have developed in the sides or bottom. You can easily fill in pool cracks using a specialized pool caulk or pool plaster (for instance, Pool Putty or a similar product)., If you have an in-ground pool, the pool’s filtration system will take water in, filter it, then spit it back into the pool. The returns are the aptly-named parts of the pool that return the water to the pool after filtration is complete. By aiming your returns down or to the side, you can prevent or eliminate recurring algae.The return redirection process will vary slightly depending on your pool’s design. In most cases, though, you can simply turn the directional eyeball (the structure that aims the water back into the pool) to the direction you want it.Most in-ground pools have two or three returns.
Above-ground pools will not have a return system.

Unscrew the cartridge cap.,
Pull back on the metal handle.,
Secure the piston rod and remove the cartridge.,
Prepare the new grease cartridge for loading.,
Insert the cartridge into the barrel.,
Reattach the barrel to the head of the grease gun.",How to Load a Grease Gun2," Cartridge-loaders are made of two basic parts: the cartridge of grease itself, housed in a similarly-sized and shaped housing, and the dispenser or nozzle, from which the grease is extruded. To remove the cartridge, you'll basically just unscrew the cap that the cartridge is in by turning it clockwise while turning the dispenser nozzle counterclockwise. It might be screwed on kind of tight, so use some elbow grease.

, On the end of the barrel where the cartridge is held, opposite the nozzle, you should see a plunger rod that’s used to push on the cartridge and force the grease out. Continue to pull until the plunger rod is withdrawn fully from the barrel.


On some grease guns, pulling back should make the cartridge eject automatically. Depending on how much gunk is built up on the inside, it may come out all or halfway. Before you remove it, though, you need to secure the rod in place.

, On most grease guns, you should be able to move the piston rod sideways slightly, into a slot in the barrel so that it cannot move forward. On some grease guns, the retracted piston rod will latch into the fully retracted position, and a release tab is provided on the end of the barrel to allow the piston rod to move again.


When you've secured the rod in place, you can pull the empty cartridge loose and discard it.

, Cartridges are typically available at hardware and auto parts stores. Typical sizes are 14 oz. (414 ml) and 16 oz. (473 ml) cartridges. Before you load one in, it's a good idea to clean up the gun slightly to get it ready for a new cartridge. Wipe the end of the barrel with a cloth or rag. This will remove excess grease that may have leaked out during removal of the spent grease cartridge.


Before inserting a new cartridge, remove the plastic cap from one end of the new cartridge, so the grease can flow out normally.
For lots of people, storing grease cartridges upside down is a good way of getting it to settle on the right side, near the nozzle. If it hasn't been stored upside down, shaking it hard once or twice toward the cap can help to settle it in the direction you want, before inserting it.

, Insert the end of the cartridge that had the plastic cap on it first. Push it fully in, so that the end of the cartridge seals with the end of the barrel. Remove the metal seal from the exposed end of the cartridge. Discard the metal seal.

, Screw it on part way, two full rotations, without screwing it down tightly. Release the piston rod from the retracted position and push it into the barrel while simultaneously pumping the handle of the grease gun nozzle. This helps to work air through the mechanism and get the grease started. Stop when grease begins to appear at the dispensing head nozzle.


Continue screwing together the head and barrel. Push on the piston rod to ensure that it is fully engaged in the replacement grease cartridge. Pump the handle make sure that grease is being delivered.

Check the trim.,
Try the knock test.,
Drive a pin into the spot where you think the stud is located.,
Locate switches and outlets on your walls.,
Calculate stud positions by measuring from corner to corner.",How to Find a Stud2," Any kind of interior trim such as baseboard or crown molding is attached to studs. You can find where the studs are by looking for small dimples in the trim. These indentations are where the trim was nailed to the stud. The nail holes are filled with caulk and painted over after the trim is attached, but generally they remain visible if you look carefully enough., This requires you to knock lightly on the wall to see if you can hear whether a stud has been added. An area with no stud will produce a low, hollow sound. An area with a stud will produce a higher, more solid sound. Practice in areas where you know there are studs to train your ear.

, If there is a stud there, the pin will stop when it makes contact with the wood. If there is no stud, you will encounter little resistance and the pin will go all the way into the wall.If you don’t find a stud the first time you use a pin, try the wire test. Fashion a coat hanger or other piece of long, thin, rigid wire into a right angle. Insert the wire into the hole you’ve made in the wall and spin it until it makes contact with a stud.This way you won’t have to knock multiple holes in your wall.

, Most electrical boxes will be mounted on the edge of a stud. Turn off the power to that switch or outlet and remove the cover. You should then be able to see which side of the switch the stud is located on by looking for the mounting screws. If you can’t, use the knock or pin test to determine the placement of the stud.


Measure at least 3/4 inches (1.9 cm) away from the outlet or the electrical unit to find the center of the stud. Try the knock or pin test if you want to figure out the stud’s width. Remember that studs will normally be located at 16 inch (40.64 cm) intervals on either side of the outlet/switch.

, Because studs tend to be 16 inches (40.64 cm) apart, you can measure in from any corner to figure out where to find studs.


Remember that not all walls are divisible by 16 inches (40.64 cm) exactly, so there may be some studs that show up in a distance that is less than 16 inches from the previous or next stud.

Use wood lath to hold lighter items.,
Try a strong magnet or magnetic stud finder.,
Don’t use the pin test.,
Consider using a wall anchor.",How to Find a Stud3," Hanging items on a plaster wall can be easier than hanging them on drywall because plaster is applied to an interior layer of wood lath. Lath is generally strong enough to handle any item weighing less than 10-15 lbs. But for heavier items like television sets you’ll still need to find at least one stud., An electronic stud finder that measures changes in the depth of the wall will not work on plaster. But a magnetic stud finder or particularly strong magnet can indicate where the wood lath has been nailed onto the stud.


A metal detector can also show you where the lath has been nailed to the stud.If you use any of these methods remember to find multiple studs and measure the distance between them to make sure that you haven’t found a metal pipe or wire that isn’t attached to the stud.

, You can find studs in drywall by driving a pin through the wall to see if it hits the stud. But plaster is generally too tough for a pin to penetrate. A pin also won’t go through the wood lath in any case.


The knock test will still work for plaster. Knock on the wall to see if a stud is present. An area with no stud will produce a low, hollow sound, while an area with a stud will produce a higher, more solid sound.
Using switches and outlets to find studs will also work. Any electrical switch or outlet will be mounted on a stud. Turn off the electricity to the switch or outlet and remove the plastic cover to see on which side of the stud the switch or outlet is mounted by looking for the screws.

, You may not need to worry about studs if you use a strong enough wall anchor. Some wall anchors are strong enough to hold several hundred pounds, whether on drywall or plaster. Always remember to read instructions carefully before hanging anything on a wall anchor to avoid serious damage to your wall."

, This is the right of the drill, as it is shown in the photo.

, When you get the knack, you can do it with the ball of your right hand.

,, This ball is used in the handle tips of levers in gardening, farming, etc.


Check that the ball threads in properly. Hold the Hand Tool with the key inserted for an easier and safer job when securing the ball in place.

,
You can even attach a metal saw or a part of it. You can fit a small saw blade for little wood or plaster jobs.
Now a metal drilling bit has been attached. This comes in handy when hand drilling inside a wooden cabinet.
With an allen bit (key) you can do the first approaching turns with the screws of a piece of furniture bought in kit. Judge if you finish the tightening with a proper allen key for a stronger leverage. Good for your wrist, perhaps.

,


Make the holes that fit the screws, then enlarge them with this bit about 1 cm (1/2"") deep.
Put the screws fixed tight in and cover the big holes with little pegs of the same wood. This finishing looks quite professional.

Recommended: a new snow blower scraper and new drive belt. They are usually sold as part of a kit with the rubber paddles and are essential to satisfactory snow removal.
A friend or family member is not required, but they can be very helpful when working through some of the more tedious steps.
Make sure to have the safety glasses and rubber gloves on at all times to prevent any particulates from getting into your eyes and/or from getting into cuts in your skin.;
, It is important to keep your hands and feet away from the rubber paddles until you remove the spark plug, even when it is turned off.


Turning the key to the off position may temporally disable the snow blower, but it does not guarantee the snow blower is safe to work on because it can still easily start up while you are working on it.


, Unscrew the three bolts that hold on the snow chute on. Use one wrench to hold the nut still while using another wrench on the head of the bolt to unscrew it.

, Unscrew the bolts holding on the control panel. Then gently pull the entire control panel backwards and swing it off to one side to rest.

, Locate the two or more screws holding the cover on and use the Philips head screw driver to remove them.

, Unscrew the gas gap and gently lift the engine cover off the frame of the snow blower. Be sure to go back and securely screw the gas cap back on before going onto the next step.

, The spark plug wire is the black wire prominently located on the ribbed part of the engine, gently disconnect the spark plug wire from the spark plug.


The snow blower can cause serious harm if starts up while you are working on the paddles. Disconnecting the spark plug wire helps prevent the engine from accidentally running while your hands are near the paddles.
Do not yank on the spark plug wire, if it is stuck take the snow blower to a professional.

, Do not skip this step! Using the spark plug socket and 3/8 socket wrench carefully unscrew and remove the spark plug.


There are many documented cases of engines with only disconnected spark plug wires sputtering on for just long enough to dismember the individual working on it, therefore to make the snow blower safe to work on it is crucial that you remove the spark plug.

, Making sure the gas tank engine cap is on tightly, place the handle of the snow blower on the ground to tilt the rubber paddles upwards.

, Use one wrench on the bolt head to hold it still while using another wrench to take the nut off.


If they are stuck on try using some WD-40. Spray it onto the bolts and wait five minutes before coming back to break the bolts free.

, They are the black ""star"" shaped bolts located at each end of both rubber paddles. Use the torx 25 bit with bit socket wrench to unscrew the torx bolts while holding the nut still with the appropriate wrench.

, Be sure that the solid rubber side of the paddles is facing the side that will be in contact with the snow before placing them into their assembly.

, Being sure to keep the nut on the side that will not be touching the snow, insert and tighten down the center attachment bolts as tight as you possibly can. Attach and secure the other new rubber paddle according to the last step and this step before going onto the next step.


If you do not believe you can tighten the bolts down enough get a friend or family member to help you do it, it is better to be safe then sorry.

, Spray WD-40 onto the threads of each torx bolt and then work them into their respective holes on all the rubber paddles.

, Align and place the torx bolts into their respective holes so that you can then clamp a vice grip down in between those two torx bolts.

, Keeping the torx bolt nut to one side of the other vice grip, secure the vice grips down onto the nut.


Doing this ""arbitrary"" step prevents a lot of difficulties when trying to line up the torx bolt with the nut in the next step.

, Initially threading the torx bolt onto its nut can be difficult but using the nut held into place with the vice grips instead of a wrench makes this step much easier.

, While using the torx bit in the bit socket wrench use the appropriate wrench on the nut to tighten the torx bolt down as much as you can. Make sure for the rest of the torx bolts your secure the end of the paddle you are working on, initially threading the torx bolts with the vice grips, and tighten down each torx bolts using the wrench.


If you are having a hard time getting the bolts tight it would be wise to have a family member or friend do it for you, it is better to be safe then sorry.

, The scraper is located on the bottom of the snow blower, just underneath the rubber paddles, and all you need to do is remove three screws to pull it off.


It is recommend that you replace the scraper at the same time as the rubber paddles, they work in tandem and it will allow for a much better snow removal when you are done.
If they are corroded on, try spraying some WD-40 onto them. Spray it onto the bolts and wait five minutes before coming back to break the bolts lose.
If they break off while removing them get some replacement ones at your local hardware store.

, After attaching the new scrapper onto its guide rail, use the appropriate screws and nuts to tightly attach the new scraper.

, It is usually located on the left side of the snow blower and is secured in place with bolts located at each corner.

, Push down on the belt idler pulley, the brushed metal plate that holds the belt on and gently pull the belt off biggest pulley before taking it off any other pulley.

, Wrap one end of the new belt around the smallest pulley in the compartment, making sure the white letters are facing outwards. Then place the other end of the belt underneath the idler pulley, the wheel in the middle, before wrapping it around the largest pulley. Make sure to put the belt is under the belt idler pulley, the brushed meal plate, before going onto the next step.


Make sure the lettering on the belt is facing outwards. Doing so ensures that the fibers in the belt take the stress and not the rubber, preventing the belt from snapping under stress.

, Be sure that all bolts are securely in place.

, Do so by lifting up on the handles so that rubber auger paddles are resting on the ground.

, Be sure to that it smoothly follows the threads as it goes in.


If you feel the spark plug get stuck, gently screw it back out and try again. If you forcefully thread it on it will jump threads and you will never be able to get the spark plug out again.
Consider cleaning the spark plug with a metal brush before putting it back in, cleaning the electrode of the spark plug can make the engine run smoother.

, Use the spark plug socket with 3/8 socket wrench to snugly, but not forcefully, tighten the spark plug down.

,, After removing the the gas cap, place the engine cover back on the snow blower and then thread the gas cap back on before going onto the next step.

, Using the appropriate screws, screw the engine cover back down, though be careful not to forcefully tighten them down.

, Using the same nuts and bolts you took off, attach the snow chute back onto the snow blower.

, Place the control panel back in its framework and secure it in place by snugly screwing the bolts you took out back into it.

, Congratulations on the the improved snow blower, it is ready to get back to work!

Try a Mexican papaya.",How to Eat Papayas1," As with all fruit, papaya is the best when locally grown and picked. If it is available in your area, pick or purchase it for the best taste. If not, try to choose fruit imported from areas closest to your location to insure freshness and flavor.;
, This papaya is grown in Hawaii and Costa Rica, and is known for a small to medium sized fruit with sweet, yellow flesh.

, Mexican papayas are much larger than kapaho papayas, and have orange or red flesh on the inside. They are known for the tendency of having a bland or bitter flavor.

Eat noodles like an Italian.,
Twirl or cut spaghetti noodles.,
Use a spoon and a fork to eat noodles in soup.",How to Eat Noodles1," Italians eat noodles by twirling the pasta with a fork, turning the noodles into a small nest. Different cultures have different ways of eating noodles.


Italians twirl the pasta because it allows them to capture other ingredients that are blended into the pasta dish, like nuts or capers. This method works with more pasta dishes than spaghetti.
Traditionally, you would see more Italians using both a fork and a spoon to twirl their pasta. While this is not technically wrong, the modern trend is to use a fork instead. Why do you need both anyway?;
, Spaghetti noodles can be sloppy, so what’s the right away to eat them so you don’t look like you’re making a mess?Take the fork, and twirl some noodles around the tines of it. At the same time, anchor the fork on the side or the bottom of the plate. Some people then twirl the fork on a spoon, but others just use the fork.
If using a fork and spoon, hold the spoon in your left hand, and the fork in your right. Push the fork tines through the pasta meeting the spoon on the opposite side. Hold the spoon firmly, and twirl the fork until no strands are hanging from it. Now, lift the fork to your mouth.
You could also cut the pasta into small pieces with a fork or knife, making it easy to eat with either a fork or a spoon. Many people will serve spaghetti noodles to children in this manner. , In Thailand, Japan, and some other countries, noodle dishes are eaten with both a fork and a soup spoon.


Pick up the noodles with the fork, and twirl them or hold them against the soup spoon before lifting them into your mouth.
One utensil serves as a guide, and the other will hold the noodles, allowing them to be lifted.

Eat them while they are hot, and don't save them for later.,
Keep your hands clean.,
Make your own nachos if you are at a party and there is a nacho bar.,
Turn nachos from a simple appetizer to a meal by piling on more toppings.,
Use the dry nachos to scoop up the toppings.,
Know how to keep your fingers clean while eating nachos that are loaded with toppings.",How to Eat Nachos1," Nachos taste best while they are still warm. The longer you let them sit, the greasier they will become. If you end up having any left over, it might be best to throw them away. Nachos don't reheat well, and usually turn into a greasy, gloopy mess., Nachos are a finger food, much like French fries, so you'd want to eat them with your fingers. This is especially important if you are sharing a bowl of nachos with other people. If you are serving nachos at a party, consider including some baby wipes of hand sanitizer. This way, your guests can clean their hands before digging in—and keep them clean throughout the meal.


It is possible to eat nachos with a fork, but other people might laugh at you.

, Some hosts may put out a big bowl of tortilla chips and smaller bowls filled with various toppings. If you see this, you'd want to put a handful of tortilla chips onto your plate first, and then add the toppings. Start with the heavier items, such as meat and beans. Add on the cheese and salsa. Finish off with guacamole, sour cream, and if desired, green onion.


No matter how much you like a certain topping, don't take more than a spoonful or two until the other guests have taken their first helping. It is not polite to hog all the food.

, The most basic nacho dish consists of a bowl of tortilla chips slathered with cheese sauce. This makes a great appetizer, but a poor meal. You can take your nachos to the next level by piling on pulled pork or beans.

, When you look a bowl of nachos, you may notice that some chips are dry, and some are loaded with goodies. Take the dry nachos first, and use them to scoop up the goodies. Keep doing this until there is a thin layer of goodies. Only then can you pick up the goodie-covered chip. This will prevent you from taking too many toppings at once and making a big mess., If you don't want to get your fingers dirty while taking a goodie-covered chip, pick up a dry chip first. Place it over the covered chip, sandwiching the goodies in between. You now have a nacho sandwich that is dry on the top and bottom. You can now pick the chip up, and pop it into your mouth.

, Papayas are very soft and can be cut with a spoon, but for a smooth edge use a paring knife. Scoop out and discard the black seeds at the center with a spoon.

, Run the centers under cold water to clear out any of the seeds or pulp that may make a mess when eaten. Place on a plate when finished.

, The acid in these citruses help to enhance the natural flavor of the papaya. Squeeze the juice over the fruit for the best taste.

, It should be very easy to eat the papaya if it is ripe, as the flesh will be very soft."

Prepare a papaya milkshake.",How to Eat Papayas3," A traditional Thai dish, green papaya salad combines the sweet papaya with tomatoes, chilli peppers, lime, garlic, and fish sauce. Serve it cold for a refreshing introduction to a meal.

, Similar to a banana bread or zucchini bread, papaya bread is a sweet dessert made from fresh fruit, nuts and spices.

, Sorbet is a fruit-based ice cream perfect for a warm day. Make papaya sorbet by blending the fruit with water, sugar, and lemon juice before freezing. Serve with fresh papaya to cool off poolside in the summer., For a twist on a classic shake, blend fresh papaya, milk, sugar, and vanilla. Serve in a cool glass, preferably with a bendy-straw.

Eat noodles in soup.,
Use chopsticks to eat noodles in soup.,
Go ahead and slurp noodle soup.",How to Eat Noodles2," You will want to use a two-handed method when eating the noodles in soup.To eat noodles in soup, put the chopsticks in one hand and a soup spoon in the other hand. Ladle a spoonful of broth into the spoon, and then pick up noodles with the chopstick. #*Now, put the noodles in the spoon and then eat the noodles and broth from the spoon, while using the chopsticks to guide the food into your mouth.

, Some Chinese people eat noodle soup by using the chopsticks to lift the noodles into their mouths and then alternate by eating spoonfuls of the broth.

Start by snapping the chopsticks apart. Take one stick in your dominant hand and hold the narrower tip like you would a pencil. You want to hold the stick so that only an inch of the thicker end is sticking out of the area between your forefinger and thumb.
This is the base stick, which doesn't move as you manipulate the other stick between your index finger and thumb to clench the noodles between the two sticks.
The same general process is used to eat noodles with chopsticks that aren't in soup broth. Asian countries such as China, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand use chopsticks to pick up the noodles and deposit them in a large spoon; then eat the contents.

, It depends on the culture. In some Asian cultures, slurping your noodles and soup as you lift them to your mouth with chopsticks is not considered rude. In other countries, it's not done as often, though (such as in Thailand).


In some cultures, such as in Japan, it’s also appropriate to pick up the entire soup bowl and to drink or slurp down the remaining broth in it.
Slurping noodles actually has a practical purpose. It’s done because the breath cools down piping hot soup before you eat it.

Eat Ramen noodles correctly.,
Eat the noodles fast.",How to Eat Noodles3," Ramen noodles are a college student’s staple because they are cheap and easy to make. They’re also tasty. And there’s a correct way to eat them.Take a pair of chopsticks, and pull a small amount of noodles out of the bowl. You should take fewer noodles than you expect to need.
Pull the noodles up. You want to separate them from the rest of the ingredients in the bowl itself. Dip them back into the soup broth to add flavor and then lift them to your mouth, pursing your lips like you’re about to drink a hot beverage.
Slurp the noodles. Then eat some of the other ingredients in the bowl. Take a bite of the meat, for example, and drink a spoonful of broth

, The trick to eating Ramen is to eat the noodles within five minutes. Otherwise, they soak up too much of the broth.In some cultures, the chef will be offended if you don’t slurp Ramen noodles as you eat them. Slurping them is a sign you like how they taste.You’re going to fail and make a huge mess if you try to grab too much at once. Remember that Ramen noodles are lighter and thinner noodles though than other noodle types.

Decide whether you'll use fresh or dried pasta.,
Choose a pasta shape.,
Choose a pasta flavor.,
Read the label accompanying the package of dried pasta or purchased fresh pasta.,
Use a large saucepan to cook pasta.,
Add the pasta.,
Cook until it is al dente, meaning that it has some resistance when bitten.,
Take the saucepan off the heat.,
Choose a suitable sauce.,
Serve the cooked and coated pasta in a decent sized dish or plate.,
Separate a portion of pasta with a single tine of your fork.,
Use the twirl for long pasta.,
Finished.

",How to Eat Pasta," You can cook either fresh pasta (pasta fresca) (and the faster of the two), or you can use the typical dried pasta (pastaciutta). The difference between the two is obviously freshness, but for ease of use the dried pasta is often readily available in the pantry, while fresh pasta needs to be purchased as it's needed or made from scratch (the latter being a time-consuming but enjoyable kitchen exercise). Or, you can use layers of pasta between sauces and filling to make lasagna and cylinders of pasta to make cannelloni.


Most dried pasta is made in a factory. It is quality controlled and comes in a wide variety of shapes.
Fresh pasta can be purchased from specialty stores, from supermarkets or made at home. If eating pasta at a restaurant of good quality, it is preferable that the pasta be made fresh.
The dough is usually made from hard durum wheat; this produces an elastic quality in the dough that makes it easy to stretch into shapes.;
, There are many different types of pasta shape, and some are purely about preference, while others may hold certain sauces better than others. While there are hundreds of different shapes, some of the typical shapes include spaghetti, penne, spirals, farfalle bows, macaroni, curled pasta and lasagna sheets.

, It is possible to get flavored pasta beyond the standard version without flavoring. This is perhaps for special occasions and it's not necessary if it doesn't interest you. Some of the flavors include spinach, chili, squid ink or tomato. Egg may be added too, which can color and flavor the pasta (known as pasta all'uovo).

, This will tell you the amount of time the pasta should be cooked for, and this will vary depending on the brand and shape/filling of the pasta. Standard cooking times:


Dried pasta: About 8 to 10 minutes.
Fresh pasta: About 2 to 3 minutes.
Filled pasta: About 12 minutes.
Lasagna or cannelloni: About 25 to 45 minutes.

, Pasta needs the space to move around and will cook unevenly if in too cramped a space. Fill with a lot of water and ensure that it is boiling before adding the pasta.


For each person, add about 75g or 3 ounces of pasta. A little extra can be added and if not eaten, can be reheated the next day or used to make a pasta salad.

, If it is long, such as spaghetti or linguine, drop one end into the boiling water, then gradually push down the rest of the pasta as it softens through cooking. This won't take long, and watch out for the hot water and your fingers!

, It should not be a mush. Test before it is due to be ready; it is better to be too early than too late.

, Drain the pasta and get it ready for serving.

, Dried pasta tends to be better for strong sauces with thin textures. Fresh pasta is often stuffed with cheese, vegetable or meat fillings, making it delicate, so it is usually best with fine cream or cheese sauces.


Smooth pasta (no ridges or curls): Creamy, cheesy sauces, meat sauce.
Bumpy, ridged or curled pasta: Same as above but also butter, oil, vegetable and tomato sauces.

, Eat as you would normally. A little seasoning always goes down well. Use a small pinch of salt and enough pepper to fill the center of your palm. Afterwards, season according to taste.

, This will pull it aside from the main mass of pasta.

, This action helps you to get sufficient pasta on your fork without losing sauce or making a mess when eating it. Wrap the fork tightly around the spaghetti and place it in your mouth. Chew the spaghetti thoroughly, then swallow it.


A more proper method is simply twirling it on your plate, still keeping the twirling separate from the main mass of pasta.
This works only with stringy pasta (spaghetti or linguine).

Share nachos with friends.,
Serve nachos in the evening at casual events and parties.,
Make a nacho bar if you are serving them for a crowd.,
Pair nachos with other side dishes for a more complete meal.,
Pair nachos with fizzy drinks.",How to Eat Nachos2," Nachos often come in big portions. If you are making some at home, consider inviting some friends over to help you eat them. You can even turn the nacho-eating-party to a game or movie night. If you are at a restaurant with a group of friends, consider ordering a bowl of nachos as an appetizer.


Guacamole and sour cream are popular toppings, but not everyone likes them. Consider serving the guacamole and sour cream in separate bowls so that those who do like them can serve themselves., Some foods work well at formal, suit-and-tie events, while others don't. Nachos, being a messy finger food, are one of those. They fare better at casual events where people aren't wearing their best clothes and practicing good etiquette.


Barbeques
Casual parties and dinners
Movie nights
Sports games, especially the Super Bowl

, Set out a big bowl of tortilla chips along with a stack of plates. Next, set out smaller bowls filled with various nacho toppings. Your guests will serve themselves and make their own nacho plates. Here are some ideas for toppings:Beans (black or pinto)
Black olives and/or pickled jalapenos
Cilantro, onions, and/or scallions
Guacamole and/or sour cream
Pulled pork
Salsa and chopped tomatoes
Shredded cheese and/or cheese sauce
Limes cut into wedges

, Not everything goes well with nachos. Whether you are trying to turn a bowl of nachos into a more complete meal, or add variety to your nacho bar, it is important to select the right dishes. Here are some popular side dishes that many people find complement nachos well:


Beans (black or pinto)
Chicken tortilla soup
Corn
Green salad
Spanish rice
Quesadillas

, Like pizza, nachos are heavy and greasy. A cold, fizzy drink, such as a soda, will help them go down better. If you are of legal drinking age, try pairing the nachos with a cold, pale beer, lager, or ale instead.Other alcoholic beverages that go well with nachos include margaritas and mojitos.
Wine goes with many dishes, but nachos are one exception. When eating or serving nachos, skip the wine."

Decide between a hard shell or a ""shedder."",
Choose between a male and a female.,
Choose one that looks healthy and lively.",How to Eat Lobster1," If you go to a restaurant that offers you the chance to choose your own lobster, you may be asked whether you want a hard shelled lobster or one that has recently shedded.

Hard shell lobsters have matured enough that their shells are a little tough to break. The meat inside is firm and flavorful.
Shedders have softer shells, since they have recently moulted. Soft-shelled lobster are much easier to get through. However, they usually aren't as ""full"" and consequently have less meat.;
, If you like tail meat, choose a female lobster, since the females' tails are larger to accommodate the transportation of eggs.

, Now's not the time to go for the runt of the litter, or the underdog - choose a lobster that twitches its antennae and moves around inside the tank. Its color should be bright (though not red - that happens after it's cooked) and its eyes should be shiny.


Avoid lobsters that look lethargic or sickly. Lobsters with visible shell damage or cloudy eyes might be contaminated. Lobsters with tails that are curled under are likely already dead, so avoid them.

"
"
Dress appropriately.,
Be prepared to use your hands.,
Know the tools.,
Eat it as you go, or dismantle it first.",How to Eat Lobster2," Lobster are often served in fine restaurants, but the experience of eating them can get a little messy. Small bits of lobster may fling from your fork as you eat, and you may get drops of butter on your clothing. Bibs are often provided, but you might want to wear something that isn't easily stained just in case.

, It's very difficult to eat lobster without handling the various parts. Expect to touch the lobster's shell, legs, claws, tail, and insides with your fingers. By the end of the meal, you'll be quite familiar with lobster anatomy.

, Lobster is served with the following equipment, used to make the experience of eating it a little easier:


A lobster cracker, which is similar to a nutcracker. Without this, you'd have trouble getting through the lobster's tough shell to reach the meat inside.
A lobster fork, or lobster pick, which is a tiny metal fork used to dig into the lobster's crevices for meat.
A bone dish, used as a receptacle for lobster shells.
Hand wipes are often dispensed after the meal, so you can wipe the lobster juices from your fingers.

, Some people like to eat the lobster part by part, eating the meat from each piece as it is detached from the body. Others prefer to dismantle the entire lobster and enjoy the meat all at once, after the work is out of the way. The choice is yours - both are equally acceptable, etiquette-wise.

Twist off the claws.,
Pull the legs off the lobster.,
Separate the tail from the body.,
Cut incisions in the underside of the body.,
Eat the tomalley.,
Find the coral.",How to Eat Lobster3," Pull each claw down and away from the body to remove it. Twist at the base of each claw, so you're left with two lobster ""arms"" with claws attached.


Eat the arm meat. Use a lobster fork to dig out the meat from the arms. There's not much, but it's worth digging it out.
Remove the thumb off the claws, breaking the claws at the joint. You'll see meat inside the thumb section. Use your lobster fork or pick to take it out.
Use the lobster cracker to crack the larger part of the claws then use the lobster fork to remove it. The claw meat may be hefty enough to cut into smaller pieces using a knife.
Discard pieces of shell and cartilage in the dish provided.

, It is easy to simply suck the meat out of the legs. Some people don't bother as a lobster has skinnier legs than a size zero model and considerably more of them.

, Crack the tail open and using your fork or pick, remove the meat from the tail in one piece. Twist the ""flippers"" from the tail and pull out the small morsels of meat inside. Find and discard the large black vein in the tail meat as this is the bowel and not highly prized.

, Pull the shell of the main body open, and pick out any pieces of white meat that you can find.

, This is the lobster's liver, avoided by some but loved by diehard lobster fans. It's a gray substance found in the body of the lobster among the innards., If you have a female lobster, you may see red eggs, or roe, inside the body. These are edible, but not the most delicious part of the lobster.

Always eat breakfast.,
Eat standing up.,
Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes.,
Eat foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).,
Drink a moderate amount of alcohol or soda with meals.,
Avoid mustard.",How to Eat More Food1," It's a common misconception that you need to keep your stomach empty if you want to eat more, and in fact this can't be further from the truth. Starting your day with fruits, whole grains, or lean protein is an excellent way to kick your metabolism into gear, meaning you'll be hungrier later in the day, meaning you'll be ready to eat more later in the day.


A recent study found that the morbidly obese are more likely to skip meals earlier in the day. There's no connection between skipping meals earlier in the day and weight loss. Don't ever starve yourself.;
, Competitive eaters eat standing up for a reason. When you eat sitting down, pressure is put on your stomach by your other organs, and it won't expand as much as when you're standing. It's also uncomfortable. The stomach can hold quite a bit of food when you stretch your torso out to it's longest, which happens in the standing position.

, Those sweatpants you get out on holidays? Smart move. Wearing comfortable clothes is an essential part of eating more and remaining comfortable while you do it. Your stomach does, in fact, expand as you eat, and tight shirts and slacks restrict its ability to do some comfortably. If you want to eat more, wear the clothes that will allow it.

, Monosodium glutamate is a naturally-occurring compound that's artificially added to many foods to give it flavor. One side effect of MSG is that it stimulates insulin response, effectively lowering your blood-sugar levels and making your body think that it needs to eat more to bring those levels back up.


MSG is found in lots of packaged and prepared foods, like ramen noodles, potato and tortilla chips, canned vegetables and soups, and processed meats.
MSG is a controversial ingredient, often derided for its connection to obesity and linked by some people to health effects as diverse as chest pains and facial numbness.While studies report that there's no actual connection between the additive and these symptoms, it's still a controversial substance.

, Aside from the fact that sugary sodas and alcoholic beverages complement meals quite well, the sugars in sodas and boozes of all sorts cause insulin spikes that trick your body into thinking that you want to eat more food.


Commercial sodas contain lots of refined sugar, and the body needs to produce more insulin to process refined white sugars, resulting in a similar insulin response to that of MSG. Your body will think you need to eat more food. Diet soda, which contains aspartame, likewise results in a similar effect.Aside from the inhibition-lowering effects of alcohol, which can cause you to eat calorie-rich foods you may normally avoid, the sugars in alcohol can have a similar effect, lowering serotonin levels and increasing your insulin response, causing hunger.
Carbonated beverages are filling, which means that if you drink a lot of beer or soda with a meal, you'll get more full faster, leaving less room for food. Aim for about half a soda, to get the same insulin spike, without the filling effect.

, If you're trying to eat a lot of food, it's important to avoid consuming certain condiments, the contents of which can irritate your stomach and esophagus, making it more difficult to eat a larger quantity of food. Mustard is made of ground mustard seed, a potent member of the brassica family, and vinegar, both of which will slow your hunger and metabolism.


It's also good to avoid any other vinegar-based, spicy condiments, like bbq sauce, hot sauce, Sriracha, and other peppery dips or toppings.

Calculate the necessary caloric intake for building muscle.,
Calculate your protein needs.,
Drink whey protein shakes between meals.,
Eat low-glycemic slow-digesting carbohydrates.,
Stimulate testosterone production by eating fat.,
Develop your lifting or training regimen.,
Take a fiber supplement.",How to Eat More Food2," If you're trying to bulk up because you're too lean, or you're trying to gain muscle, it's important to make sure your body is ready for gaining weight in the healthiest possible way. Just because you ""look skinny"" doesn't mean you have a BMI that's optimal for weight gain, and you might be doing yourself an unhealthy disservice by trying to gain before you get into shape. While it's best to visit a nutritionist first, you can measure your BMI yourself with the following calculation::


Your weight in kg (or weight in pounds divided by about 2.2), divided by
Your height in meters squared
If your BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, you're at a low-normal body weight, which means you can safely gain weight, with the proper nutrition and guidance., Muscle can only be built when you create a calorie surplus, then work out in targeted ways to promote muscle growth in your body. The difference between gaining muscle and gaining fat requires that you calculate how many calories you'll need to eat to gain muscle effectively, and making sure you eat the right kinds of foods. To calculate the amount of calories you'll need:


Multiply your bodyweight in pounds by 20. This is the amount of calories you'll need to eat on days that you work out, to gain muscle.

, If you want to build muscle and gain weight, it's absolutely essential that you take in enough protein to promote muscle growth. Without the proper amount of protein, you can do damage to your muscles by over-exerting them. To find out how much lean protein you'll need, multiply your bodyweight in pounds by about 1.5 to find out the number of grams of protein you'll need to consume in a day.


Make friends with chicken and peanut butter. Lean in fat, but high in protein, these are easy-to-eat and widely available ways of making sure that you get enough protein in your diet.

, An extremely common way of bulking up and gaining muscle mass after workouts is to use a protein supplement to stimulate muscle growth. Protein whey powders are widely available, which allow you to mix up smoothies to get added nutrients, vitamins, and added protein into one easy-to-drink concoction.


Protein shakes are notoriously not very tasty, so it's helpful to incorporate whey powder into smoothies including yoghurt, bananas, strawberries, and other tasty fruits, so you're not just slugging down what amounts to protein wallpaper paste. If it tastes better, you'll be much more likely to use it.

, You should be eating about twice your weight (lbs.) in carbohydrates (grams) on days that you work out, and those carbs should consist primarily of low-glycemic carbohydrates. That means whole grains, like rolled oats, and fresh fruits, and sweet potatoes. Avoid refined wheat flour., Athletes who build muscle typically eat more monosaturated and saturated fats, which increase testosterone levels, in turn helping muscle growth. You should typically be eating about half your body weight (pounds) in good fats during your work out days.


One of the best ways to do this is drinking milk. It's easy to take down, even if you're not feeling hungry, and an excellent way to get more fat into your diet. Drink a glass of milk three times a day when you work out.

, All this calorie intake will just translate into fat unless you're lifting and workout out vigorously along with your calorie surplus. Make sure you develop a healthy work-out routine tailored to your interests and goals for muscle gain.


Typically, on days that you'll work out, you'll add a hefty pre- and post-workout meal to your regular three-meal-a-day regimen. To eat the proper number of calories on your off-days, simply skip these meals.

, If you're going to be increasing the amount of lean protein and carbs that you eat in a day, it's also very important that you take a fiber supplement to keep your gastro-intestinal tract functioning regularly. Gaining weight effectively can be somewhat uncomfortable without one.

Build up your stomach capacity slowly.,
Train with water.,
Wet your food.,
Train with cruciferous vegetables.,
Chew gum to strengthen your jaw muscles.,
Do lots of cardiovascular exercise.,
Specialize.",How to Eat More Food3," Anyone who's ever been inspired to down as many franks as possible by the Nathan's Hot Dog competition has come up against a quick and harsh reality: you can't eat that many hot dogs without preparation. The stomach is a muscle like any other. It needs training and recovery, otherwise you risk injury. If you want to increase your stomach's capacity, take it slow.


According to some studies, the average human stomach holds about 1.5 liters before becoming nauseated, but can hold between 3-5 liters if trained properly.
It is possible to rupture your stomach if you eat too much too quickly, but it's extremely uncommon and rare. You'll usually vomit before you risk a stomach tear or other physical problems., The healthiest way of training and expanding your stomach capacity is not with food, but with water. Competitive eaters are able to drink as much as a gallon of water at a time, in less than 20 minutes. This increases the stomach's capacity and carries relatively little health impact, compared with eating lots of food at once.


Start slow, increasing the number of glasses of water you drink in a day incrementally, then increasing the speed at which you consume the water you drink. It's usually recommended to drink as many as eight glasses of water in a day to begin with, so start there and gradually build up your capacity.

, Water serves a purpose during eating competitions, as well as during your training. While dunking a hot dog bun in water might not seem that appetizing, it helps to break down the food before you put it into your mouth, making it much easier to swallow and start digesting. The faster you get it down, the more you'll be able to eat, and water helps this process.


Don't drink too much of the water while you're eating. While it's ok to use some water to help lubricate the food, don't gulp it to quench your thirst, or you'll be taking up valuable real estate in your stomach.

, Two or three times a week, competitive eater Yasir Salem steams as many as eight pounds of broccoli and cauliflower for a training meal. These vegetables are bland, high in vitamins, and will move through your digestive tract quickly, making them ideal for stretching your stomach easily, combined with a large amount of water.For an added bonus, add a large amount of sauerkraut. Fermented cabbage has probiotic properties that will help keep your intestinal flora in balance, making it an ideal food for competitive eaters.

, Competitive eaters will regularly chew up to six pieces of gum at once, to strengthen jaw muscles and make sure their eating instrument is in good working order. As important as your stomach is to your ability to eat more food, it won't do any good if you can't chew that food quickly and efficiently.


Check out this wikiHow article for neck and jaw strengthening exercises you can incorporate into your routine.

, Ever notice how competitive eaters are generally lean and mean? That's because they're in shape. Contrary to what you might expect, the ability to eat a lot comes from a lot more than a big appetite. Hard training and good cardio are an essential part of being able to eat food quickly and competitively.


Read this wikiHow article for good tips about cardiovascular health.
Good breathing is necessary for competitive eaters, as well. Do breathing exercises to make sure you can breathe effectively while you're cramming that food in.

, Not all competitive eaters are alike. Hot dog champions need to train in completely different ways, for completely different amounts, than does a bacon-eating champion, a chili eating champion, or an oyster eating champion. Knowing the specifics of your food of choice will allow you to prepare more specifically.


Major League Eating is the US national organization that governs competitive eating. Check out their website to learn more about joining up and competing.It's very important to meet with a health professional, dietician, or biofeedback specialist to come up with a health and training regimen for the food you hope to consume to keep your body working for you, instead of against you.

Eat breakfast and get plenty of sleep.,
Keep a food diary for at least a week, and track all food and drinks, including snacks.,
Use the food journal to identify calorie hogs, empty calories, and hidden calories.,
Substitute quality for quantity.,
Learn to measure appropriate portions.,
Allow (some) treats.,
Make a meal plan and stick to it.",How to Eat in Moderation,"


Studies have shown that well-rested individuals and people who take the time to eat breakfast are less likely to indulge or overeat for the remainder of the day, sometimes saving hundreds of calories over their famished or tired counterparts. Thinking about it logically, consider that the body needs to get energy from somewhere. If you don’t fuel it with sleep and rest when it feels drained, it will look for sources of fuel elsewhere. That’s when overeating can enter the scene. The difficulty is that there are different types of fuel for a reason; when the body is physically hungry due to a lack of food, it benefits from more food, but if the body is sleep-deprived and gets food as a replacement, food stores overflow and turn into excess fat and other health issue.
Going to bed earlier may also prevent overeating by opportunistic or habitual eaters, who reach for entire bags of potato chips or pints of ice cream when staying up late.;
,


Take note of the quantity or volume, the type, and even the time each food is consumed. For instance, write “large order of fries, two double cheeseburgers, large regular soda, noon” or “whole cinnamon raisin bagel with two tablespoons cream cheese, 1 small apple, medium latte with caramel sauce, 8am.”
Note binge triggers or particular food weaknesses where moderation is neglected, such as consuming several handfuls of potato chips at 11 o’clock every evening, or a tendency to eat a second brownie after trying a first for dessert.
Many studies have documented the power of food journals for estimating the quantity and quality of food and calories consumed in an average day or week.
Be sure to include weekends, restaurant meals, quick snacks, smoothies and shakes, desserts, and other calorie sources of any type.

,


Sometimes just having a written log of the amount and types of food consumed in a given day or week can be enough of a wake-up call for people to reduce their consumption. For others, it may be easier to target a reduction in quantity for specific food groups or times of day.
Simple sugars, condiments, fatty snacks, desserts, and foods that trigger additional eating can be a great place to start.
Setting small but significant goals–and achieving them–can help mitigate the risk of overeating and even provide the confidence and willpower to take more drastic dietary restrictions if necessary.

, Some foods do not satisfy hunger cues because they confuse the brain or contain little nutritional value.


Add a healthy protein or fat source to small snacks or regular meals.
If a feeling of hunger persists 15 minutes after eating, try snacking on foods that carry very few calories despite their volume, such as a few handfuls of popcorn, a small bag of carrot and celery sticks, a cup of vegetable soup, or two rice cakes.
When meals and snacks are built around vital nutrients and filling but healthy ingredients, it is easier to be satisfied with modest quantities.

, Many people are astonished to learn that a recommended serving size of meat is approximately the size of a deck of cards, and the recommended serving size for peanut butter is about the size of a golf ball.


By dishing up appropriate portions at home and by requesting half of a restaurant meal to be packaged for leftovers in advance, many people can avoid overeating simply by limiting amounts before the food is on the plate.
With less food on the plate at the beginning, most people’s tendency to finish their serving will still satisfy their hunger without loading on extra calories from oversized portions.
If one plateful is not enough, opt for second helpings only of the healthiest dishes, such as vegetables or whole grains.

, For some people, attempts to abruptly or totally remove unhealthy items or desserts can lead to eventual binging or overeating. Instead, start by allowing one sweet item or treat each day, in moderation.


Limit portions to only a few bites. Waiting a few minutes between each bite to savor and appreciate the food. This may help reduce the urge to finish the entire item while still satisfying a sweet or salty craving.

,


Planning meals and portion sizes ahead of time can help reduce overeating or mindless munching.
Charting out ingredients for each meal and snack in advance also makes it easier to build a balanced, nutritional diet.
Plan to keep filling but healthy snacks on hand and avoid buying trigger foods, calorie-dense foods, and high-calorie drinks.

Eat a good amount of meat, fish, poultry, and eggs.,
Choose meat from animals that were grass-fed and poultry that was raised cage free.,
Avoid meats that have been highly processed and very high in fat.",How to Eat Like a Caveman1," As you may have guessed, almost all meats are considered to be paleo. If you are ever unsure about whether the meat you are about to eat is paleo, ask yourself: does this meat come from an animal that used to moo, oink, grunt, etc? If the answer is yes, then it’s probably paleo.;
, Also opt for wild caught fish over farm raised fish.


Poultry - turkey, chicken, goose, ostrich, pheasant, quail, eggs (duck, chicken, or goose)
Meat - steak, veal, ground beef, grass-fed beef, buffalo meat, NY steak, beef jerky, chuck steak, venison steak
Pork - tenderloin, chops, bacon
Lamb and goat - lamb rack, chops
Fish - salmon, bass, halibut, mackerel, sardines, swordfish, tilapia, trout, tuna, red snapper, shark, sunfish, walleye
Seafood - shrimp, lobster, clams, crawfish, crayfish, crab, scallops, oysters
Wild game - rabbit, elk, wild boar, turtle, rattlesnake

Eat it with something you do like.,
Drink something before and after.,
Cover the food with seasonings or condiments.,
Restrict your sense of smell.,
Eat only a polite amount.",How to Eat Foods You Don't Like1," Cut the food you don’t like into the smallest pieces you can so that you don’t have to chew as much and you can mix it in easier with other foods. You might even be able to swallow pieces whole, but be careful not to swallow too-large or hard pieces that might get stuck in your throat.;
, Surround the food you don’t like with other food you do like on your plate. If you don’t like asparagus, for example, you could push it into a ball of mashed potatoes before putting it in your mouth. Also try simply putting a bite of something you like in your mouth and holding it there as a sort of barrier for your taste buds before you put in a bite of the bad food.

, Sip from a glass of water, soda, juice, or alcohol right before you take a bite, and then take another sip directly after to replace the taste quickly and help wash the food down.

, Add salt and pepper, butter, some lemon juice, ketchup or mustard, or anything else available on the table. Be careful not to noticeably overdo on your seasonings, or ask for something that’s not already available or would clearly not go with the dish, to avoid offending the cook or your fellow diners.

, Breathe in through your nose before taking a bite of the offending food, then try not to breathe in or out while you’re chewing and swallowing to dampen the flavor.

, Don’t feel like you need to eat the entire quantity of the food you don’t like at a dinner party or other social situation. Eat enough that it appears that you’ve enjoyed most of it and are just too full to have the rest. Leave small amounts of other foods on your plate too, so that it doesn’t look like you neglected one thing.

Eat plenty of veggies.,
If you want to eat like a caveman, enjoy plenty of vegetables.,
Take care with some veggies.",How to Eat Like a Caveman2," Almost all vegetables are on the approved paleo diet because they were easily accessible to hunters/gatherers. You should strive to purchase vegetables that are organic when possible.

, When eating like a caveman, you do need to take caution with starchy tubers, better known as potatoes and squashes. While these vegetables aren’t bad for you, they are not as good for you as non-starchy vegetables due to the amount of carbs and sugars they contain. Starchy vegetables that should be enjoyed in moderation include:


Butternut squash, corn squash
Yams, sweet potatoes
Beets.

"
Enjoy using full fat content in your diet.",How to Eat Like a Caveman5," Part of what makes the Paleo diet different than other diets is fact that fat intake is not restricted, since cavemen/women did not limit their intake. In fact, you are encouraged to consume healthy fats and oils. After all, fat is not what makes you fat, and this is your body’s preferred source of energy.Healthy fats and oils include:


Coconut oil
Olive oil
Macadamia oil
Avocado oil
Grass-fed butter.

Fast food
Processed foods (packaged and pre-prepared)
Potatoes
Pseudograins (quinoa).

",How to Eat Like a Caveman6," Start by slowly eliminating unhealthy foods until they are completely gone. Many of the foods that are not approved on the paleo diet are on the list because of the amount of sugar, trans fat, or artificial chemicals they contain. None of these items were around during the Stone Age and were certainly not consumed by cavemen/women.

Add it to other things.,
Add seasonings or other flavor.,
Talk to others about the food.,
Cook the food yourself.,
Try different varieties.,
Become an expert on the food.,
Eat around people you like.,
Eat the food as much as possible.",How to Eat Foods You Don't Like2," Look up recipes online that use the type of food you don’t like. There may be a dish that sounds delicious to you that you would never expect would contain that food. Try a dessert recipe that sneaks in a vegetable, or add an offending food to a casserole or soup so it’s mixed in with other things.


If it’s a vegetable you don’t like, try any number of desserts that use vegetables in their recipe, like a carrot cake, zucchini bread, or avocado milkshake.This may not help you get used to the taste of the food you don’t like if it’s highly disguised by other ingredients, but it will get you accustomed to the idea that it can be used to make something tasty.

, Try preparing or eating the food with new seasonings or sauces, without overdoing it to the point of disguising the food. Get ideas for good seasonings to pair with the food from cookbooks or online. Try several different types of ethnic restaurants for a good way to try different preparations and flavors of the same food.

, Talk to friends, family, or the host of the dinner you’re at about the food you don’t like and how they like to prepare it. Try these new ways to find one that you like better.

, Try taking the recipes you’ve found in cookbooks, online, or from friends and family to prepare dishes with the food you’re learning to like, or just experiment with it on your own! Test out what it tastes like when you prepare it in different ways, like sauteing, steaming, roasting, or even deep-frying. Experiment with whatever seasonings and sauces you have around the house, or try new ones that recipes suggest.

, If there are multiple types of the food you don’t like, give them all a try to see which one you like best. Try both fresh and canned versions, and try getting produce from a farmer’s market instead of the grocery store if it is a fruit or veggie that you don’t like.

, Learn everything you can about the food you don’t like from the internet or books. Understanding more about the nuances of the food and understanding its differences from other foods will help you to appreciate it more., However you choose to prepare or eat it, have the food you don’t like in happy situations when you’re surrounded by people you enjoy. This will help change your emotional response to the food to a positive one., Even if you haven’t found a way to enjoy the food you don’t like, continue to eat it as much as possible, even if you have to completely disguise it with other things. You can actually psychologically condition yourself to like a food in this way."

Fried chicken is greasy and can be messy, so put out plenty of napkins or paper towels so you can wipe your hands and mouth as you eat., Fried chicken is a finger food, meaning you can eat it with your hands and don’t need a knife and fork. Some pieces of fried chicken, like drumsticks, will have natural handles you can hold easily with one hand. For more awkward pieces, like the breast, use two hands to hold both ends of the piece.To get a better grip on the chicken and to prevent your hands from getting too greasy, wrap a napkin around one end of the chicken, such as around the tip of the wing or the top of the drumstick.

, Bring the entire piece of chicken to your mouth and take a small bite from the piece.Lower the piece away from your mouth as you chew and swallow. Keep taking small bites until you’ve eaten all the meat from the bone. Avoid licking the bones clean when you're at a restaurant or out in public.


When you're done with the piece, place the bone back down on your plate.

, Even though fried chicken is a finger food, it’s still not polite to lick your fingers in public. Use a napkin to wipe excess grease from your hands. You can also excuse yourself to the bathroom to wash your hands with soap and water., In a large mixing bowl, combine the 8 cups (1.9 L) of lukewarm water and the ½ cup (150 g) of salt. Stir to dissolve the salt. Place the chicken into the brine. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about four hours.


You can also brine the chicken overnight if you want to fry it up in the morning.
Brining the chicken like this before frying it will ensure the meat is tender and juicy., Break the eggs into a shallow bowl. Add the water, salt, and 2 teaspoons (4.6 g) of the black pepper. Whisk the mixture together. Drain the chicken into a colander and discard the brine. Transfer the chicken to the egg mixture and stir to coat the chicken in the egg.The egg will help the flour coating stick to the chicken, which will make for fried chicken that has a thick and crispy batter.

, In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, garlic salt, paprika, poultry seasoning, and 1 teaspoon (2.3 g) of the black pepper. Remove the chicken from the egg mixture and transfer it to the bowl. Toss everything together to completely coat the chicken in the flour and spice mixture.


You can also toss the chicken and flour together in a paper or resealable bag.
Other spices you can add to the flour mixture include ground ginger, ground mustard, and dried herbs like basil, thyme, and oregano., Remove the chicken from the flour mixture and place the pieces onto a wire cooling rack. Let the chicken rest for about 10 minutes as the oil preheats. This will give the coating time to set, so it won’t fall off when the chicken is cooking., Fill a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan with enough oil so that there's a 4-inch (10-cm) layer in the pan. Depending on the size of the pan, this could take about 5 cups (1.18 L) of oil. Heat the pan over medium heat and bring the oil to 350 F (177 C).


Good oils for frying include vegetable, canola, and peanut.
You can also use a heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven to fry the chicken., When the oil reaches 350 F (177 C), transfer as much chicken to the pan as you can without crowding the pieces. You'll likely have to fry the chicken in a few batches. Fry the chicken for 10 to 15 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 F (74 C). Use tongs to turn the chicken every three minutes as it cooks.When the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oil and let the oil return to 350 F (177 C) before cooking another batch. Repeat until all the chicken is cooked.

, Remove the cooked chicken from the oil and transfer it to a wire cooling rack set on a baking sheet. Let the excess oil drain off and the chicken rest for about 10 minutes. This will ensure the chicken stays juicy while you eat it.


Don’t drain the chicken on paper towels, as this will steam the chicken and make the batter soggy., Fried chicken is often served with different sauces, and there's no limit to the types of sauce you can serve with this dish.You can either place a small amount of sauce on your plate to dip the chicken into, fill a small bowl with sauce for dipping, or pour sauce right onto the chicken if you're in a casual setting. Popular sauces to pair with fried chicken include:


Barbecue
Hot sauce
Honey
Ranch
Honey-mustard
Gravy

, Fried chicken isn't often served alone as a meal, and it’s often paired with a number of different side dishes. A few of the most popular side dishes to go with fried chicken include:Baked potatoes
Collard greens
Mac and cheese
Cole slaw
Potato salad
Cornbread

, Waffles are a classic pairing with fried chicken, and many people like eating this dish for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Typically, you serve a piece of fried chicken on top of a freshly made waffle, and serve the chicken with its own sauces and the waffle with a sweet syrup, such as maple.


When eating chicken and waffles, eat the chicken with your hands and the waffle with a knife and fork.

, Hot chicken is a Nashville version of fried chicken. The major difference is the spices used, because Nashville hot chicken is very spicy. To make this dish, you can either add a spicy sauce to the chicken afterward, or marinate the chicken in spices before breading."

Make the most of your time.",How to Eat Fast1," If you are away from home, eating out at a fast food restaurant often seems like a quick and easy way to have a meal when you're busy. However, it takes a lot of time to decide on a restaurant, wait in line to order, then wait for your food to be cooked. If you have prepared yourself a meal ahead of time you can save yourself a lot of time.;
, If you are going to eat an orange, peel it and separate the slices in advance and bring them along in a container. When you get home from the store, wash and chop up some vegetables like carrots or celery so you have them ready to go.Prepping your food ahead of time can save you valuable minutes when you don't have much time to eat.


If you find you are always short on time in the mornings, prepare your breakfast the night before. Likewise, you might benefit from prepping your food at home if you struggle to find enough time to eat at work.

, It takes approximately 20 minutes for your vagus nerve to stop telling your brain it is not hungry anymore.If you eat your food too quickly your brain will still think it's starving. Eating something small 30 minutes or so before your meal can help shut off those signals. This way you can eat a smaller meal, which will take you less time, and you will still feel happy and full when you finish.

, Eating fast often leads to eating too much. You can avoid this by only bringing along or ordering a reasonable amount of food. If there isn't too much in front of you, then you can still have a relatively healthy lunch even if you're eating too fast.


Look for pre-packaged, single-serving portions of foods like greek yogurt, crackers, and string cheese. These items are all easily transported and can help to moderate your portions.

, Stay away from soda, junk food, and sweets and eat a meal full of healthy foods that will give your body the nutrients it needs to get through the day.

Stuff your face.",How to Eat Fast2," Water is the most important training tool to help you eat faster.Try drinking lots of water at once to help increase the amount you can swallow at once. It is safer to start trying to swallow larger amounts with water because there is no risk of choking., Chew lots of gum at once.Instead of chewing one piece of gum at a time, try chewing the whole pack. This exercise will help build up the muscles you need to chew your food fast. In order to eat fast, you will need to chew fast.

, Figure out the breathing techniques that will work for you. You may need to take a breath every two bites or three or four. Everyone is different. The best way to figure it out is to figure out your eating rhythm. Once you know what is a good breathing pace for you, keep your focus. Don't let the excitement of the meal get to you and throw you off your rhythm. Then you will have to stop and catch your breath.

, Videotape yourself eating and assess your performance. Try to figure out where can you shave a few seconds off your time. You can also check out some professional eating contest to try and pick up some more tips from the pros.

, Avoid eating solids as much as possible for a day or so before your meal.The hunger may give you a little extra motivation to get your meal down faster.


You may still want have something small, like a piece of fruit, a few hours before your meal. This will help hold you over, but won't fill you up prematurely.

, Water can help clear the palate and help you digest your food. A small sip will also prevent your throat from getting too dry. However, avoid drinking down all your water as it can fill you up and waste precious time. Just think of it as a food lubricant.

, Place large quantities of food into your mouth at once, but only break down the food as much as needed in order to swallow it. You don't want to choke, but you don't want to waste time chewing food unnecessarily either. As soon as you know it won't get stuck, swallow it down so you can move on to the next mouthful.


If you are eating something that is bigger than you can fit in your mouth at once, like hot dogs, hamburgers or pizza, figure out the best way to break the food down with your hands to make it faster to eat. For example, you can rip your hot dogs and buns in half and dip them in water to help break down the bread and be able to fit both halves in your mouth at once., This will only slow you down and waste your oxygen. Focus on breathing in between bites. Block everything else out.

, Use the force of gravity to help the food pass quickly down your esophagus. Tilt your head back so the food can travel down your throat easily.

After a long enough time training to eat fast, you will be able to slightly expand your esophagus and eat more at once., If you're eating something with a spoon, use a large spoon and completely fill it before bringing it to your mouth. If you're eating pasta with a fork, twirl a large amount onto the fork.


Try shoveling the food in. This is easiest with a bowl, and you can literally use your eating utensil to shovel large amounts of food into our mouth.

, If you're out of time and there is still food in front of you, just shove it all in your mouth. You can always chew it after the event finishes. The important thing is just to get as much of it in there as quickly as possible.

Find dragon fruit.,
Select ripe fruit.,
Cut the dragon fruit in half.,
Scoop out the flesh with a spoon.,
Eat the dragon fruit.",How to Eat Dragon Fruit1," The hardest part of eating dragon fruit might be finding it first, depending on where you live. It is commonly sold in Asia, but is less available in the US and Europe. If your local grocery store does not stock dragon fruit, check Asian markets in your area.






;
, Dragon fruit should be bright red or pink. Like a kiwi or a peach, it tastes best when it's fully ripe.









Press the flesh of the dragon fruit. If it has a little give, it is probably ripe. If it is too soft, that means it is overripe, and the texture will not be as good. If it is hard, give it a few days before you eat it.
Avoid fruit that has dark blotches or bruises, brown dry spots, or dry spines.

, Use a sharp knife to slice right through it. You will find bright white flesh that looks similar to a kiwi inside, with tiny black seeds distributed throughout the fruit.








, Run a spoon along the edges of the skin and then scoop underneath to loosen the flesh. If the fruit is ripe, is should separate easily from the skin.








, Spoon it directly into your mouth, cut it up into quarters like an apple, or use it in one of the recipes below.You can also cut it into fifths and create a really cool pattern.









Dragon fruit tastes especially delicious cold. Consider refrigerating your dragon fruit.
Take care not to eat any dragon fruit skin. The skin is inedible, and could give you a stomach ache if you eat it.

Know your cherries.While most people think of cherries as a single type of small red fruit, there are many varieties of cherry, each with their own shape, size and use.,
Buy your cherries, preferably handpicked.,
Wash your cherries off in hot water.,
Pit your cherries.,
Find somewhere quiet and relaxing to enjoy your cherries.,
Savour the cherry.,
Freeze whatever portions you won't eat soon.",How to Eat Cherries1," Doing a little research (as well as knowing what you want cherries for) is a smart first move. Here are a few of the most popular types of cherry you should know about:


Bing cherries are arguably the best-known, archetypal cherry. They are red, and very versatile, great both for using in recipes and eating on their own.
Rainier cherries are large cherries with a yellow hue to them. When they're most ripe, they develop a more reddish colour.
Lapin cherries tend to be dark red and quite big. They're perfect for making jams with.;
, Although there are canned and packaged options, you'll want to get cherries fresh whenever possible. Hand-picking them is the best option, as it gives you the most control over which ones to buy. Go to a local and trusted produce store, and buy a bagful.


As a rule, if you're getting the popular red Bing cherries, you should look for the darkest cherries of the lot. Darker cherries are riper, and have a sweeter kick to them. Lighter cherries are generally more sour, and better suited for baking rather than eating them by themselves. , Giving your cherries a good wash at home will remove any remaining pesticides, making them safer to eat. This rule applies to all uncanned produce, so make sure to give it all a rinse before you move forward! Putting them under the faucet for around 30 seconds should suffice.


Try to avoid washing your cherries prior to storing. Adding moisture will dry them out and hurt their taste, so it's better to wash them right before eating. , The most complex and unique aspect of eating cherries is the pitting process. While removing the pit from a cherry isn't necessary, leaving them in means you'll have to spit the pit out afterward, as eating them is mildly toxic. Its easy to eat around the pits of fruit like peaches, but a cherry is so small that it should be removed manually. There are several ways to do this, and it's recommended you try out most of them to see which one suits you best. The best option if you're going to be eating a lot of cherries is a specialized cherry pitter. These simple contraptions are usually reasonably priced, and can make the pitting process several times faster than they would be if you're doing them by hand.
If you're not interested in picking up a pitter, you can get a steady momentum going by using a chopstick and a glass bottle. Place the cherry on top of the bottle with the stem on top, and push the chopstick through the cherry. The pit should fall through into the bottle, eliminating any cleanup from other methods.
If you're looking for an easy, basic solution to pitting, take a knife and cut around the edge of the stem. Once you've cut around, you can pull the pit out. This process takes significantly longer than the other methods listed, but it'll do in a pinch if you don't have a lot of utensils around.
If you're wanting to circumvent the pitting process altogether, you can always purchase a pack of pitted cherries. Keep in mind, however, that these tend to be less fresh than if you were hand-picking them yourself.

, Arguably the most overlooked part of the way someone eats is where they're eating. Trying to eat somewhere busy and crowded isn't going to lend itself to a memorable snacking experience. Find something where you don't have to worry about anything distracting you from your cherries.


You might find it beneficial to add an element of ritual to your cherry-eating. Even if it's just finding a favourite chair to sit in each time you eat them, treating the experience with an air of importance might enrich your experience.

, It goes without saying that the most important part of enjoying cherries is eating them! The key here is to draw out the experience of eating it; let the cherry sit on your tongue, and let yourself focus on the taste as you bit down into it. Close your eyes, and let your taste buds appreciate each cherry for all they're worth!


Savouring food is a lost art in the current age of expedience and efficiency. If you're having a hard time pacing yourself while you eat, try to give yourself approximately 45 seconds for each cherry.

, It's important to note that cherries are very perishable. In a refrigerator, they might last a week if you're lucky! If you want to save yourself the trouble of constantly going back to the grocery store, you can freeze them in bulk. Bring them out and let them thaw a few hours before you plan on eating them. Frozen cherries are best eaten within a year, although judging from how delicious they are, it's not likely you'll have them sitting around a fraction of that time!

Include a variety of summer vegetables.,

Drink adequate fluids.,
Plan the right time of day to eat.,
Heat up the outdoor grill.,

Go for chilled foods and those that don't require any cooking.,
Keep your kitchen cool.",How to Eat During the Summer Heat," Focusing on hydrating foods during the summer can help you stay hydrated during those hot days. Cucumbers in particular are a great vegetable that contain a lot of water to help you stay cool.Cucumbers are about 95% water. Just one cup of sliced cucumbers will give you as much water as an 8 oz glass of water. Remember that water from food counts toward your overall daily fluid intake.
Keep cucumbers raw during the summer. Once you cook cucumbers (or any vegetable), a lot of the moisture and water seeps out.
You can use cucumbers in a variety of ways during the summer. You can slice cucumbers to make infused water, eat them raw with your favorite dip, make a creamy cucumber salad or even make chilled cucumber soup.;
, Mint is an herb that can also help provide some refreshing coolness during the summer heat. Although this leafy plant doesn't provide a lot of moisture, it does give you a sense of coolness when you eat it.Eating mint tricks our brains into feeling a cold sensation (even when the mint isn't actually cold). Methanol is the compound in mint responsible for attaching to nerve receptors in our mouth that sense coldness.
Mint also helps satiate thirst. Together with a cold beverage (like chilled cucumber-infused water), mint can help ease thirst and satisfy your thirst much faster than room temperature water. A great tip for summer.
Since you may not want to eat mint plain, try mixing it with other foods. You can add mint to infused waters, toss chopped mint with fruit salad, or mix chopped mint into a cold bean and beet salad.

, Like cucumbers, dark greens and lettuce are also extremely hydrating as they have a high water content.In addition, these crunchy greens need little or no cooking and can be eaten raw which is perfect for a hot summer day.


Any type of lettuce (like iceberg or cabbage) or dark green (like spinach or kale) will have a high water content. In general, greens are about 93% (and sometimes more) water.
If you're going for some lettuce, try to pick some of the darker greens. These are high in nutrients like Vitamin C, Vitamin K and Vitamin A compared to those lighter greens like iceberg lettuce.
Lettuce and dark greens go perfectly into a summer salad. However, you can also use lettuce as a sandwich wrap instead of bread or a tortilla. Toss greens like spinach or kale into a frozen smoothie.

, It's not surprising that spicy chicken wings are served with celery. This stalk is super high in water and can help cool down your mouth quickly. It's also a great vegetable to help tame acid reflux.When you bite into celery, you might notice how juicy this vegetable is. That's because celery is over 95% water.
Celery has gotten a reputation over the years that it doesn't contain many nutrients. However, this crunchy veggie actually has a decent amount of fiber, folate, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin K.
Serve sliced and cleaned celery stalks with sliced cucumbers and your favorite dip for a super hydrating snack. You can also make a raw celery salad or make a celery salsa to serve with chips.

, You might only think of vegetables and fruits as a source of hydrating fluids; however dairy products like yogurt (and even milk) are an unlikely but great source of water.Whether you choose greek or regular yogurt, this creamy dairy treat contains about 85% water.
In addition, yogurt is a great source of protein, electrolytes, calcium and Vitamin D. It's also a great summer food because it's eaten cold straight from the refrigerator.
Besides eating yogurt plain right from the container, you can try topping it with frozen fruit (for an extra cold hit), pureeing it with frozen fruit and freezing into popsicles, or making frozen yogurt.

, Summer is a time when there are a ton of fruits in season. You can avoid buying canned or frozen fruit and purchase fresh and local fruit (sometimes at a cheaper price).


Fruits are not only a healthy and nutritious food group (they're known to be high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants), but many fruits are also very hydrating and contain a higher water content.Fruits like watermelon, grapefruit, peaches and berries are all known to be high in water and can help cool you down and keep you hydrated during the hot summer months.Incorporate one to two servings of hydrating summer fruits each day. Measure out about 1/2 cup or one small piece per serving.
Eat fruit raw or sliced into fruit salads, toss sliced berries into a spinach salad or puree into a breakfast smoothie or homemade sorbet.

, Like fruit, summer offers a whole host of in season vegetables. Whether it's lettuce, tomatoes or cucumbers, summer's vegetable harvest provides easy foods to incorporate into your diet to beat the summer heat.


The great thing about summer vegetables are that they're a little cheaper in price and you don't always need to cook them for long periods of time. Many are great raw or only lightly or quickly cooked.
Incorporate summer vegetables into your barbecues. You can put vegetables like sliced zucchini, asparagus, peppers, mushrooms right onto a hot grill and serve them up as a delicious, nutritious side. Or you can toss the vegetables in a little olive oil and seal them in an aluminum foil packet and roast them on the grill.
Eat three to four servings of hydrating summer vegetables daily. Aim for 1 cup of vegetables and 2 cups of salad greens per serving.Try recipes like: a raw tomato, cucumber and onion salad, a caprese salad with sliced raw tomatoes, mozzarella and basil or a cold pasta salad tossed with onions, black olives, peppers and cucumbers.

, You might not think that eating spicy food would be ideal on a hot summer day; however, many scientist say that eating spicy food is actually the perfect thing for a hot summer day.


Studies have shown that when you eat hot or spicy foods, initially it makes you feel hot; however, after a few minutes you begin to sweat around the top the of your head, ears, neck and face. This is called gustatory sweating. Sweating is the way your body cools itself down naturally. So even though initially you may feel like your mouth is hot, it'll eventually cool you down quite nicely. This is especially true if you're in front of a fan or out in a breeze as you feel particularly cool once air blows on your damp skin.
Spicy foods that are perfect for a hot summer day include: chips and salsa, spicy chilled gazpacho or a spicy cucumber salad.

, Although there are many different types of foods and combinations of foods that can help you beat the summer heat and cool you down, it's also important to focus on the fluid you're drinking during hot days.


Most people need a minimum of eight glasses of hydrating fluids each day; however, during the hot summer months, you may need 13 glasses or more depending on how much you're sweating.Drinking continuously throughout the day in addition to eating hydrating fruits and vegetables is the best way to keep yourself hydrated and your thirst satiated during those hot summer days.
Go for fluids that hydrate you with little or no calories as these are the most nutritious as well. Go for plain or infused water, sparkling water, flavored water, decaf iced tea or coffee. You may even want to try milk as this dairy food also has a high water content.
Skip the alcohol. Although summer margaritas or beers are tasty, alcohol dehydrates you very quickly. Keep your consumption in check during those super hot days.
You should also limit your consumption of sweetened beverages, such as lemonade, juice, soda, fruit punch, cold specialty coffee drinks, and sweet tea. The sugar in these drinks makes them high in calories, and if you're gulping them down when you're hot, you may be racking up your calorie count without even realizing it.

, Although summers can be overly hot and humid, there are certain times of the day when things cool off . You might want to schedule bigger meals or meals with hot, cooked food during those times.


Many times you may not feel like eating a big meal when you're hot. Think about other times during the day that are cooler that would make eating more enjoyable.
Usually it's significantly cooler in the morning. Consider eating a bigger breakfast so you can stick with small, light lunches during the heat of the day.
Evenings are also cooler. You may be able to eat more and feel more comfortable eating when the sun has already set.
You may also find it easier to have smaller meals or snacks during the day. Sometimes when you have a large meal, you'll feel overheated. Instead, go for four to six small meals during the day.

, Grilling is a common summer cooking method. The weather is nice, the sun is out and you can enjoy eating your foods outside as well.


Although grilling is a very high-heat method of cooking, if you're using an outdoor grill, the heat can dissipate into the air around you.
Indoor grill pans or grill tops may heat up your whole kitchen, making your home much warmer. These still require you to heat up your stove top to a high heat level in order to cook foods thoroughly.
Grilling allows you to cook just about every type of dish or food that you'd want without having to turn on your oven. You can do a whole chicken, make burgers, grill vegetables, make baked potatoes or even make sweet desserts like baked apples — all without turning on the stove or oven.

, If you don't have the luxury of an outside grill, you'll still need to use your stove to cook foods indoors. Skip the oven and only use your stove top to make any cooked foods.


You may notice a slight increase in your kitchen temperature when using the stove top, but it will be significantly less than if you turned on the oven and decided to roast a whole chicken or bake potatoes.
Avoid baking or roasting foods. These cooking methods require your oven to heat up and stay hot for extended periods of time. This can make your house or apartment warm and more difficult to cool down.
To speed up cooking time on the stove top so you can minimize how much you heat up the kitchen, try: slicing foods into smaller pieces, using thinner or smaller cuts of meat or poultry, and covering your pan or pot to trap the heat inside.

, If you can, try to focus on foods and meals that are served cold or don't require any cooking (or very little cooking). This can help keep you and your home cooler during the hot summer months.


Try sticking to foods and recipes that don't require you to turn on the oven or only need a quick cooking session on the stove top. This can help reduce the heat dissipated into your kitchen.
Chilled foods can include: cold salads (tuna salad, chicken salad); green salads; cold vegetable salads (three bean salad, beet salad); chilled soups; and yogurt/cottage cheese with berries.
Also try to make meals that require little to no cooking. You can make sandwiches, scrambled eggs on toast, grilled chicken or steak over a salad, chilled soba noodle salad with raw vegetables, cheese and crackers with deli meat, or a poached egg over a spinach salad.

, Try to figure out a good method of keeping your kitchen cool in the summer as well. This will help you prepare meals during those hot summer months without getting too hot.


If you have windows in your kitchen, keep them open for ventilation. You might want to try to opening windows on opposite sides of the kitchen or house to get a cross draft.
Try using a portable fan to keep hot air moving through the kitchen. You can align it so it points toward a window or pushes hot air out of the kitchen area.
Also, if you do need to use the oven to bake or roast something, try doing it early in the morning when the temperature is the most cool. This will help prevent heating up the kitchen in the middle of a hot day."

Research some recipes.,
Prepare cherries as though you were going to eat them on their own.,
Bake them in a pie.,
Add them to salads.,
Accent an ice cream sundae with a cherry!,
Make a cherry jam.",How to Eat Cherries2," If you're new to using cherries in your cooking, it's definitely recommended to look online for some standard options. Most often, cherries are used in dessert dishes for their sweet taste. For certain recipes (particularly baking) you'll want lighter-tinted, sour cherries. If you're adding them as an accent, as you would atop a sundae, you'll want them dark and sweet. You don't have to make up your mind right away, but it's a good idea to have some vague idea what you'd like to make with your cherries.

, This includes washing and pitting them. Remembering to do this is arguably even more important when you're using them in a recipe; if you cherries in a pie, for example, without first pitting them, the entire pie will end up being ruined!

, The most famous use of cherries in cooking is arguably in pies. Cherry pie is a staple dish in many cafes, and for good reason! You can add cherries into your pie whole if you want, or you can mash them into a thick paste so they're able to disperse more evenly. You can even try baking with cherry jam! There are lots of possibilities when it comes to baking; look up some solid recipes, and you'll end up with a delicious summertime treat. , An even simpler way of adding cherries is through salads. Salads tend to be inclusive of all sorts of fruits and vegetables. You won't need too many cherries to accent your salad-- just a few will give a tangy kick to your meal you won't soon forget. , In many ways, an ice cream sundae is the ultimate dessert. It can be made even better by adding a cherry atop some whipped cream. While it will taste great, adding cherries as accents has the extra benefit of boasting some visual panache as well. It's an easy way to give your home concoctions the look of fine dining.


For sundaes, you'll want to get sweeter, darker cherries. The sour taste of light cherries doesn't compliment ice cream nearly as well.

, Jam is one of the most versatile creations you can make from fruit. The sweetness in cherries makes them perfect for making jams with. Pit your cherries, pick off the stems, and finely chop them up. Next, add some sugar and pectin, and mix them together until they make an even paste. Next, boil it together. Look up some special recipes, and you'll have your own homemade jam in no time at all. Cherry jam is best served on bread, but it's also great in pies and on ice cream.

Husk the corn, if needed.,
Add some seasoning, if desired.,
Consider cutting the corn into halves or thirds.,
Insert corn holders or picks into each end to keep your fingers clean.,
Eat the corn while it is still on the cob.,
Cut the kernels off first if you have braces or don't like getting messy.",How to Eat Corn on the Cob1," If you cooked the corn with the husk on, you will need to remove it. There are two ways to do it, depending on how you cooked it. This is important, especially if you seasoned the corn beforehand. Removing the husks incorrectly could result in you removing the seasoning!


If you boiled, steamed, or microwaved the corn: cut the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) off, grip the corn by the exposed end and the point, then pull.If you baked or grilled the corn: untie the strings holding it together (or peel away the aluminum foil), then peel the husks away.;
, You can eat your corn plain, or you can add some butter or salt on top. For a fancier meal, try butter seasoned with herbs and/or spices. If you already seasoned your corn beforehand, you could add any leftover seasoning on top.


Don't butter your corn all at once. Instead, butter it only one or two rows at a time. This will prevent messy drips., This is a great idea if you aren't feeling very hungry. Some people also find it easier to chomp into smaller pieces of corn rather than larger ones.

, It will also keep them from getting burnt if the corn is still hot. If you can't find any, you can wrap folded paper towels around each end of the corn instead.

, Hold the corn by each end, then bite off the kernels.Start at one end and work your way to the other, like a typewriter.


You can also the corn working your way in vertical rows rather than horizontal.

, Stand the cob up on one end, then use a sharp knife to slice off the kernels. You can then eat the kernels with a fork or spoon.

Forego utensils.,
Use bread instead.,

Be conscious of waste.,
Wash your hands before and after.,
Use your right hand only.,
Respect your neighbors.,
Fold the leaf afterward.,
Inspect and rinse the leaf.,
Start with salt.,
Add side dishes.,
Add main dishes.",How to Eat Food on a Banana Leaf," Use your hand to eat most dishes. Enhance your dining experience with all five senses, including touch. Enjoy the added benefit of never burning your mouth or tongue, since any food that is too hot to touch will have to cool off before it reaches your mouth.Serving utensils are often used to collect food from a communal platter. Using a spoon to eat wetter dishes (like soups or daals) is another exception.If you find that using your hand alone is way too difficult to eat most dishes without making a huge mess, asking for a spoon is perfectly fine for newcomers.Forks and knives, however, may puncture the leaf.;
, Be sure to order some form of bread with your meal. Use your fingertips to transfer other food, such as curries, to your bread. Be sure to use your fingertips only, though, since many cultures regard overly messy fingers as a sign of a rude guest.Once you bite into a piece of bread, refrain from dipping it in any shared dish.Types of bread often served with banana leaf meals include chapati, khakras, naan, paranthas, phulka, puri, roti, and rumali.

, Virtually all banana leaf meals come with some form of rice, so use your fingertips to collect enough to roll into a ball. Keep your index and middle fingers pressed together, and then use your thumb to roll the rice around against them until it forms a ball. Dip the ball into a sauce, combine it with a piece of vegetable, meat, or both, and then place them in your mouth.Be careful to only use your fingers to roll the rice, since using your palm can be considered rude.
When bringing the food to your mouth, hold it up to your lips and nudge it inside with your thumb without inserting your fingers., Be aware that many societies that serve banana leaf meals frown upon wasting food. If you are eating from a communal platter, finish what you have before going back for more.When eating meat from a bone, use your fingers to pick each piece of meat off it. Clean the bone thoroughly before helping yourself to another piece.Take your time as you eat. Pay attention to your stomach to gauge how full you are becoming. Avoid treating yourself to one more helping to only then realize that you are too stuffed to eat it.

, Since banana leaf meals are typically eaten without utensils, ensure your hands are clean before eating. Especially take care to do this if you are taking part in a communal meal where everyone shares food from a single leaf. Double-check your fingernails to make sure that all dirt and grime has been removed.Some restaurants will offer extra sinks just for this purpose.If no water or soap is available, wiping your hands clean with a cloth or towel is acceptable.Since your hands will undoubtedly get messy, be sure to wash them after eating as well.

, Remember that many societies that use banana leaves also happen to believe that the left hand is “unclean,” even if you thoroughly washed it before sitting down. Respect their traditions and keep your left hand below the table. Only use your right hand to handle food and other items.This rule exists because such societies are supposed to use their left hand only for cleaning their body.So placing this hand on the table where others are eating or handling shared food with it is considered disrespectful.

, When sharing a communal meal, be conscious of the fact that the person next to you will be helping themselves to the same dish as you. Avoid double-dipping bread, rice, or other items in shared food. When bringing food to your mouth, be careful to only place the food inside, not your fingers. Additionally:Do not help yourself to the last serving of a communal dish.Wait until your fellow diners make it clear that they do not want it.
If you use a toothpick afterward, shield your mouth with your hand to catch any bits that may escape your mouth.
If smoking is permitted, wait until everyone has finished eating so you do not ruin their experience.

, Indicate to waitstaff that you have finished eating by folding your leaf in half. Fold it along its spine, with the spine facing away from you. Be aware that folding it the other way around (with the spine closest to you) is a special custom in some societies, reserved exclusively for funerals, in order to show sympathy toward the surviving family., First, make sure that the leaf is intact without any tears or other punctures.Then use cold water to wash away any dirt, dust, or other materials that may have collected on the leaf. If the leaf appears to be perfectly clean before rinsing, sprinkle water over it anyway. Pay respect toward guests by observing this custom of purification., First, think of the leaf as a clock. Consider the top of the leaf (the narrowest end of its spine) as twelve o’clock. There, pour enough salt over the spine to serve all guests., Work counterclockwise. Use the left side of your leaf (from twelve to six o’clock) to arrange your sides. Starting from twelve o’clock, place your sides in ascending order of sustenance toward six o’clock.For example, the following items are placed in this order from top to bottom: lemon, chutney, raita, fritters/bhajii/nastha, and then sweets.

, Work your way back up from six o’clock. Arrange your mains along the remaining space on the leaf’s right side. Start with your bread at the bottom, followed by rice, stir fries (if serving), and then your gravy or curry toward the top at one o’clock."

Eat chicken with utensils.,
Use your fingers to eat chicken.,
Follow the lead of your host.",How to Eat Chicken1," Usually, sautéed or boneless chicken is eaten with a fork and knife. Use the knife to cut the meat into smaller, bite-sized pieces. If you’re eating chicken with bones in it, use the knife to hold the chicken in place while you pull the meat off with the fork.


Americans usually hold their knife in their right hand and fork in the left while cutting food. To eat it, they move the fork to their right hand.
European diners usually hold their fork in their right hand and the knife in their left.;
, In most cases, fried and roasted chicken can be politely eaten with your fingers. To do so, pick the chicken up with both hands and take a modest bite.


Avoid sucking the chicken off the bone or licking your fingers in public. This is seen as rude and unsanitary., If you’re being served chicken and you’re not sure how to eat it, watch your host. If they use their fingers to eat the chicken, you can do so as well. However, if they choose to use a knife and fork, follow their lead.If you don’t, you may unintentionally offend someone.

Choose a type of potato.,
Decide what cut or style of French fry you want.,
Determine whether you want classic or baked French fries.",How to Eat French Fries1," Classic French fries are made using white potatoes, such as Russets or other baking potatoes. However, sweet potato fries are tasty alternative if you want a lower carb version.You can also sometimes find non-potato fries. Other vegetables or fruits such as eggplant, yucca, and avocado are sliced into sticks and prepared in a similar fashion to classic French fries. You can also find polenta and chickpea variations.;
, While classic French fries typically feature sliced potatoes, there are several different ways that the fries can be cut. Some fries are sliced extremely thin, while others are thick or have a wedge-like shape. If you’re simply planning to dip your fries in a sauce or condiment, any size or shape will work. For fries that are covered with toppings, a thicker fry typically holds up better.Shoestring French fries are some of the thinnest fries that you can get. They’re best used for dipping in a sauce or tossed with a seasoning.
Regular or traditional French fries feature julienned potatoes so they’re fairly thin. They’re best served with a dipping sauce.
Crinkle cut fries feature a wavy or ruffled edge. They are usually a medium thickness, and work well for dipping or covering with toppings.
Curly fries are cut into a coiled, spring-like shape. They’re fun to dip into a sauce or condiment, but can also work well as a base for heavier toppings.
Steak fries are thick and flat, and work well if you want to add toppings to your fries.
Waffle fries are thick fries that features a crisscross pattern. They also work well if you want to pile toppings on your fries.
Wedges are also extremely thick because the potato is actually cut into wedges rather than slices. They hold up well to heavy toppings.

, As their name implies, traditional French fries are made by deep frying the potatoes in oil. In many cases, they are actually fried twice to make them extra crisp. However, if you prefer a low-fat diet, you can choose baked “fries.” They aren’t as crispy as the fried version, but they don’t have as much fat or as many calories either."

Take soft, creamy cheeses, such as Brie, out of the fridge two to three hours before serving/eating.
Take fresh cheeses, such as cottage cheese, out of the fridge 30 minutes before serving/eating.;
, The rind is usually hard and waxy. Examples of cheeses where you should peel/cut the rind off include: Cheddar, Gruyere, and Romano.

, This rind is usually soft and white. Examples of cheeses where you can eat the rind include Camembert and Brie.

, Just don't make a huge show of it. Smelling is a big part of tasting. It can actually help intensify the taste of the cheese.

, When you smoosh cheese onto bread or crackers, you tamper with the unique flavor of the cheese. If you really want to appreciate the taste of the cheese, eat it alone., In general, soft, creamy cheeses are milder than hard ones. If you are unsure which cheese is mild and which cheese is sharp, ask the host.If you start out with a sharp cheese, your taste buds will be overwhelmed, and you might miss out on the underlying flavors of any mild cheese you eat afterwards.
Make sure that you use a different knife for different types of cheese to that you don't mix flavors."

Try adding some fruit, but stay away from citrus.,
Try adding some nuts.,
Consider eating or serving a variety of cheeses.,
Try baking Brie with honey.,
Experiment with adding grated or shredded cheese to your meals to make them more savory.",How to Eat Cheese3," Most cheeses actually go well with sweet items, such as fruit. The next time you are eating or serving cheese, consider choosing two to three types of fruit to go with it.Try dried fruit with hard cheeses, such as: apricots, cherries, and figs.
Try fresh fruit with fresh cheeses, such as: apples, dates, figs, apricots, and plums.

, They help bring out the sweet notes in cheese. Almost any type of nut pairs well with cheese, but many people seem to enjoy almonds, hazelnuts, and toasted pecans., Cheese does not have to be paired with just fruit, nuts, or wine. You can also pair different types of cheese together. The next time you are eating or serving cheese, consider pairing three to five different types of cheese, all with different textures and flavors. Just remember to start eating the mildest cheeses first, and work your way towards the sharper ones. For example, you could try:A soft, creamy cheese, such as Brie.
A nutty, textured cheese, such as Comté.
A dry, hard, aged goat cheese.

, Preheat your oven to 350°F (176.7°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a wedge or wheel of Brie on top of the parchment paper. Drizzle the cheese with some honey. If you want, you can top the cheese with other goodies, such as dried cranberries, figs, rosemary, thyme, or walnuts/pecans. Bake the cheese until it is soft, then serve immediately with crackers.


Bake wedges for 5 to 7 minutes.Bake wheels for 8 to 10 minutes., Adding a handful of grated of shredded cheese to your meals can give them extra texture and a hint of flavor. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Scrambled eggs and omelets
Baked potatoes and mashed potatoes
French fries (with Cheddar and bacon bits)
Tortilla chips (Mexican cheese blend with sour cream and salsa)
Salads (Caesar salad pairs well with Parmesan)

, You can use a fork to eat the cheese directly, or you can place the cheese on a cracker first, then eat the cracker with your fingers. This is very important for formal events.


If you see any crackers or fruit served alongside the cheeses, don't hesitate to pluck a few up and drop them onto your plate.

, If you are at an informal event, you might find cheese served alongside the rest of your meal. Simply eat it with a fork, and not your fingers., If a cheese is cut into cubes and speared with toothpicks, eat the cheese with your fingers. If the cheese is cut into slices, transfer it to a cracker, and eat the cracker with your fingers."

Find a vendor who sells raw balut eggs.,
Boil a pot of water.,
Remove the egg from the water.,
Serve with beer.,
Locate the rounded end.,
Break the shell with a spoon.,
Prepare your seasoning.,
Season and drink the broth.,
Break apart the remaining shell.,
Eat the egg.",How to Eat Balut," Balut eggs may be difficult to find, but check with Filipino restaurants, Asian grocery stores, specialty delis, and even local duck farmers to find a supplier of raw, fertilized duck eggs.


Balut eggs are usually incubated for about 16 to 18 days before they're boiled and eaten.Look for eggs with thick shells and no cracks.;
, Fill a saucepan with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. When the water is boiling, use tongs or a slotted spoon to gently place the egg in the water. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium, and boil the egg for 30 minutes., When the 30 minutes is up, use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the egg and immerse it in a bowl filled with ice water. This will stop the cooking process and help cool the egg faster., If you're serving balut at a party or to a group of people, it is traditionally served as a snack that’s paired with beer.Simply place the eggs in a basket or bowl and serve them with your desired seasonings. Make sure each person has an egg cup, shallow bowl, and spoon.

, Some balut eggs will come with a stamp on one end, and that is the end you're supposed to open.If your egg isn't stamped, find the fatter, rounded end of the egg (as opposed to the more pointed end).Place the egg in an egg cup or ramekin with the pointed side down. If you don't have these items, use a small cup or plate.
The pointed end of the egg contains the egg white, while the rounded end contains the yolk and broth.

, Use the bottom of a spoon and tap the rounded side of the egg three times to break the shell. Pick away the cracked bits of shell to form a small opening in the top of the egg, being careful not to let pieces of egg shell fall into the broth.Create an opening in the egg about the size of a bottle cap.
Use your fingers to pick away at the layer of skin protecting the egg just beneath the shell. This will release the broth., Balut is often eaten with salt, pepper, vinegar, chili pepper, or diced green onion. Take your desired seasonings and mix them together in a small, shallow bowl., Take a small spoonful of seasoning and drop it into the hole you made in the egg shell. Use the spoon to gently stir the seasoning into the broth.When the broth has been seasoned to your liking, put the egg up to your mouth and suck the broth out from the hole in the shell.

, Once you’ve slurped the broth out of the egg, use your fingers to pick at the shell and peel it away to expose the rest of the egg., There are two basic ways you can eat the egg from this point on. For the first way, season the egg by sprinkling it with seasoning or rolling it around in your seasoning bowl. Then, eat the egg yolk and embryo together in one or two bites.To savor the egg a little more, use a spoon to break away bites of the yolk, and dip each bite in your seasoning bowl. When you’ve eaten the yolk, move on to the embryo and eat small bites in the same fashion.The balut egg white is edible, but some people choose not to eat it because it’s tough and rubbery."

Choose organic.,
Eat blueberries raw.,
Eat blueberries every day.",How to Eat Blueberries1," To get the most nutritional benefits out of this healthy fruit, choose organic blueberries. That’s true of most fruits and vegetables, and blueberries are no different!


Conventional blueberries have been found to contain lower amounts of anthocyanin antioxidants than organic blueberries do. Antioxidants are ingredients that combat free radicals in the body that can damage cells and DNA.Organic blueberries also carry less risk of trace elements of pesticide, which can have a negative impact on health. Appreciate the power of blueberries. Blueberries are considered one of the world’s healthiest foods because they contain antioxidants. They are known as a superfood!
Non-organic blueberries are still good for you. They just aren’t as good for you as the organic variety, which is usually a little more expensive.;
, As with many foods, you will obtain the greatest health benefits from blueberries if you eat them raw.


Cooked blueberries still have some health benefits but, say, blueberries baked into pancakes won’t have all of the nutritional flavor or nutritional benefits of the raw fruit.
The other issue with cooking blueberries is that you end up with the sugar that baked dessert or breakfast recipes call for. Don’t think that processed package of blueberry muffins will be that good for you!
Blueberries are the second most popular fruit in the United States. Only strawberries are consumed more.

, In order to truly reap the health benefits of blueberries, it’s important to eat them consistently and in fairly large quantities.


Studies have documented health benefits in people who eat between 2 and 2.5 cups of blueberries every day. Blueberries are considered on par with strawberries and pomegranates in antioxidant capacity. At least three times a week is a good place to start.Some diabetics who have eaten at least three servings of blueberries every day reported improvement in their body’s ability to regulate blood sugar.
Healthier eating plans often recommend between 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Some government organizations recommend a little less. The bottom line, though, is that you can’t go wrong by adding more fruits and vegetables into your diet and removing processed foods from it! To gain the benefit of blueberries, though, you need to eat them regularly.

",How to Eat Caviar,"


Learn what caviar is so that eating caviar will be less daunting. Caviar is the eggs of a female fish, traditionally coming from sturgeon. Today, more affordable caviar is made from salmon and the American paddlefish.;
,


Caviar should be served chilled and never at room temperature. Eat caviar after it's been thoroughly chilled and serve it cold or even in a dish of ice to keep its temperature down.

,


Caviar should never be served on steel or stainless steel plates or forks, as this can change the taste of the caviar and make it bitter or metallic. Eat and serve caviar with utensils of ceramic, glass or plastic to preserve the taste.

,


Caviar comes in many varieties and each of them tastes slightly different. Try different types of caviar to find one that suits your personal palate. Don't be discouraged if the first kind you try doesn't taste good.

,


Caviar should be served and consumed in amounts smaller than a tablespoon. It is traditional etiquette to eat caviar in small bites, and if you're just learning to eat it, small bites will help you experience the flavor more completely without becoming overwhelmed by the flavor or texture.

,


Caviar is often served on unsalted crackers or bread, or on small traditional Russian pancakes called blini. Eating caviar with these accompaniments will enhance the flavor.

,


Eat caviar with some of the traditional garnishes, which include fresh herbs like parsley or dill, sour cream, chopped onions, chopped hard boiled egg. Trying these garnishes will improve your caviar-eating experience.

,


Caviar is sold in small containers and meant to be consumed in one serving. Eat or serve a container of caviar and don't save any that is left over. Saving opened caviar will change its taste and will cause it to spoil quickly.

,


Caviar is meant to be consumed as an appetizer or garnish accompaniment to a larger meal, not the main course. Keep this in mind when eating or serving caviar, because making a whole meal out of it would be expensive and would probably negatively affect your tasting experience.

If you're at a party, eat it by the slice.,
Eat it alone, with fruit, nuts, or bread.,
Pair it with a drink.,
Know if it's bad.",How to Eat Brie1," It's considered pretty gauche to scrape out the inside, so eat some of the rind, too. Would you pick up a sandwich, take out the meat, and put the bread back down? Didn't think so. If the rind doesn't appeal to you, simply cut it at an angle to maximize the amount of ""inside"" you get.


You've had the rind before and it tasted nasty, you say? Well, you probably just had bad brie (yep, there is such a thing). A good rind should crumble a little and taste a little bitter, but not be too distracting from the gooey, Brie-y goodness. If you haven't tried it, go for it! It's totally edible.
By slice, we mean like a very, very small pie slice. Not like a slice of bacon.;
, Brie is so good. If you can resist just shoving the entire wheel in your face, it's practically even better when combined with the power of other delicious things. Try it with:


Apples or pears
Fig jam or tart cherry compote or honey
French bread
Almonds or candied walnuts
White crackers

Of course, you can eat it however you like! We'll cover brie in recipes in the third section -- it doesn't just have to be eaten as a finger food.



, Brie goes great with champagne, but also well with certain wines and beers. Wines with more acidity go better with this cheese, while beers with more heartiness about them (like a good stout) will complement the flavor.Soft cheeses like brie tend to pair very well with dry Riesling, Marsanne, or Viognier wines. A lighter red wine (like Pinot Noir) works well too for it's the delicate yet rich flavour that contrasts nicely with the mellowness of brie.
Not looking to drink it with alcohol? No problem. Apple cider and similar juices also go well. The lighter and fresher the better.

, Brie generally only keeps for a couple of weeks.Here's a few things to keep in mind when looking at your wheel:


Underripe brie will be hard to the touch. The outside should be firm, but the inside will be slightly springy.

Note: Brie stops aging when it's sliced. If you already have a slice, it will not ripen any further.Overripe brie will be soft and runny.
Brie can bruise like an apple if mishandled. Brown spots may appear and it could develop an ammonia-like taste.If you already cut into it, it can be refrigerated for a couple of days. Beyond that it should be thrown out. The only way it won't be eaten is if you've forgotten about it!

Blueberries are good for the heart because they both relax and regulate the vascular wall’s arterial elasticity. Blueberries also have a positive effect on blood pressure.
Blueberries also improve heart health by helping with blood flow., Blueberries are great for older adults who might be struggling with memory loss as well as people of all ages hoping to improve their memories or stave off the aging process.In one study, people with an average age of 76 ate blueberries every day for a 12-week period. The study demonstrated that the boost to memory can come fast.
The adults who ate blueberries performed better on cognitive tests at the end of the study period compared to adults who did not eat blueberries.
The anthocyanin in blueberries can also help prevent Alzheimer’s Disease or dementia by stimulating nerve growth in your brain and improving communication between the nerve cell processes in the brain, slowing aging.

Identify different kinds of blueberries.,
Pick firm berries.,
Store the blueberries.,
Freeze the berries.,
Create blueberry dishes.",How to Eat Blueberries3," Blueberries are part of the Ericaceae plant family and the Vaccinium genus. There are three groups of blueberries that get the most attention.


Highbush blueberries are the type of blueberries you usually see in the grocery store. They grow 12 feet in height and are hybridized to produce larger berries for consumers.
Lowbush blueberries are commonly called wild blueberries. They produce smaller berries and are usually found growing in the wild. More species of blueberries are native to North America than any other continent, and blueberries were used by many Native American tribes. Wild blueberries are very strong in nutrients.Rabbiteye blueberries are native to the southern United States. They are sometimes cultivated and their plants grow up to 4 to 10 feet. Blueberries are found on all three continents.

, Choose blueberries that are not too mushy and that have a vibrant color with a whitish bloom.


In order to determine if the berries are moldy or damaged, shake their container to see if they move more freely. If they do, they are likely firmer.
Skip blueberries that seem watery or full in color. Water causes blueberries to decay. You don’t want to eat decayed blueberries.
Shake a frozen bag of the berries to make sure they are not clumped together, which can be an indication that they were thawed and refrozen. Blueberries are cultivated in the United States from May through October.

, To store blueberries, first remove any of the crushed or spoiled berries from the carton.


Don’t wash the berries until you’re just about to eat them because washing will make the berries’ skins degrade more quickly by removing their blooms.
Blueberries can keep in a refrigerated covered container for about three days. A typical plastic container can work well.
As with most fruits, blueberries will spoil more quickly if they are left out at room temperature.

, Wash the berries, and remove any damaged ones before you freeze the berries. Spread the berries out on a cookie sheet for freezing if you have space as this will allow for uniform texture.


Once the berries are frozen, you can put them in a plastic bag for further storage in the freezer. Thaw the berries and drain them before using. Blueberries are healthy naturally, but some researchers believe the nutritional benefits of them increase if you freeze them.
One researcher found that the antioxidant levels in frozen blueberries increased. The blueberries were frozen for one, three and five months.The science behind this is that the ice crystals from the freezing process disrupt the plant tissue’s structure, making an antioxidant more available that is called anthocyanin. Freeze the blueberries at temperatures of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or -17 degrees Celsius. Anthocyanins help to protect various systems in the body from illness. Anthocyanin is also the ingredient that gives blueberries their vibrant color!

, There are many ways you can eat blueberries. The possibilities are endless! Some are healthier than others, though.


Put frozen blueberries in a smoothie or breakfast shake. Add them to cold breakfast cereals or put them in yogurt.
Add blueberries to peach crisp, granola, quinoa cereal, or fresh peaches and other fruit. The best way to eat them, though: Raw and by themselves.
Many people add blueberries to baked goods, like muffins, pies, and pancakes, but this is a less healthy way to eat them. Pour the blueberries into a small bowl with heavy cream.

Peel an orange by hand.,
Peel an orange with a spoon or fork handle.,
Cut an orange into a strip.,
Cut an orange into wedges.,
Cut an orange into crescents.",How to Eat an Orange2," Dig a metal teaspoon or a knife into the peel and tear a bit of the peel off. Once you can get a good grip on the peel, put away the knife or spoon, and pinch the edge of the ""gap"" you made. Pull as much of the skin away as you can. Keep peeling the skin until it is all gone. If there are any stringy bits, pull those off too.


Pry the orange open before you eat it. Stick your fingers into the hole at the top of the orange, and pry it open like a book. Separate the wedges, and eat them individually.
Be sure to pick out any seeds, or to spit them out.

, Slice an orange across the equator, going only through the skin, and not the flesh. Use a serrated knife. Next, take a spoon or fork with a flat, curved handle. Stick handle into one side of seam, pointing it towards the top of the orange. Run handle all around orange, prying the peel away from the flesh. Repeat for other side of the seam. When you are done, pull the peel away from the orange, like a hat or sock.Try rolling the orange around on table before you peel it. This will loosen the orange from the skin and make it easier to peel.

, Place the orange down sideways on a cutting board, and cut the top and bottom off. Next, cut a slit into the side of the orange, all the way down to the core. The slit should go from one cut end to the other. Finally, use your fingers to pry open the orange, like a book, into a long strip. Use your fingers to pull the orange segments off of the peel, and eat them.Don't cut too much; about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) off of each end will be enough.
This method works best for Mandarin oranges, but many people find that this works with regular oranges as well, such as Valencia., Place and orange down on a cutting board, with the stem part facing upwards. Slice it in half, then place each half face-down on the cutting board. Cut each half into wedges. Start by cutting it in half, straight down. Then, make two cuts to either side, angling your knife towards the center of the orange.


Eat the orange directly from the peel. Place the flesh part of the orange into your mouth, with the peel between your lips like a big, orange smile. Bite down slightly, and suck the juices out.

, Place an orange down on a cutting board with the top/stem facing upwards. Slice the orange in half, then place each half face-down on the cutting board. Cut each half into ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices. Start at one end, and finish at the other.

, Do you want to do it section by section - or course by course? Is there one section that interests you more than others - where maybe you want to concentrate most of your eating? Think about what you want to eat - don't just go up and grab food blindly.

, Talk to yourself (not out loud!) about what would be the healthy choices or convince yourself that some really bad choice doesn't look all that good. It may not work but the guilt may help you follow the next steps.

, When you go up to get food, take only a teaspoon or tablespoon-sized portion of each choice. Your goal is to taste everything you want - just not in huge portions. With buffets, the desire to taste everything combined with taking ""regular-sized"" portions is what will do you in.

, As you taste, decide if the item really merits getting more. For example, let's say the macaroni and cheese looked great - and tastes terrible! You won't be going back for that. On the other hand, the General TSO chicken is delicious and worth getting another taste.

, Too many people were brought up to feel bad about ""wasting food"" because of all the starving children in some country. Because you took mini-portions, you aren't wasting that much food.

Buy asparagus from a grocery store or farmers market.,
Know when to buy fresh asparagus.,
Store asparagus in a refrigerator or on ice.,
Consider blanching asparagus before you freeze it.,
Consider growing your own asparagus.",How to Eat Asparagus1," Fresh asparagus is a luxury vegetable, and its prices tend to reflect this. You can buy fresh, frozen, or canned asparagus. If you're buying fresh, look for bright green or violet-tinged spears. Spears should be straight, firm, and uniformly-sized, with closed (not flowering) tips. Ideally, buy fresh asparagus on the day that you plan to use it.Asparagus spears range from thick to thin. Some people prefer one kind over another, but size does not generally signal quality or flavor. Thicker spears are more mature, and thinner spears less so. Thicker spears often have tougher, woodier ends, and most people chop these off before cooking.
Asparagus goes bad quickly, so it’s important to pick bundles that are refrigerated or on ice. Do not buy asparagus that isn't being kept cool, as it may go bad even more quickly.;
, Asparagus is one of the first green vegetables to come into season at the end of winter. Fresh, American-grown asparagus often appears in stores in late February, but the vegetable is at its best – and is usually cheapest – in April and May. You can eat frozen or canned asparagus year-round, but many consider fresh asparagus a delicacy., Use asparagus within two or three days of purchase, and preferably sooner. If you do need to keep it for a day or two, the best way to preserve the spears is to place them upright in a bowl (or even a small vase) of cold water. You can wrap the ends of the spears in a damp paper towel and refrigerate them. You can refrigerate them in a plastic bag for up to three days.

, Blanching is an important step in preparing vegetables for freezing. Scalding the vegetables stops the enzymes that break the vegetable down. This may help preserve flavor, crispness, and color. Blanching before freezing also cleans the surface of the vegetable, slows the loss of vitamins, and makes the veggies softer and easier to pack.

, You can start these plants from seeds, or you can plant their crowns for faster results. Mature asparagus plants yield spears every spring for 12 to 25 years.

Drink lots of water.",How to Reduce Sugar at Breakfast," The nutritional label on prepackaged food products you purchase will list the total amount of sugar per serving in that product. Keep the serving size in mind as it may be less (or more) than you typically consume.Generally, you shouldn't get more than 5 percent of your calories from sugar. For the average adult, this works out to about 30g of sugar a day, maximum.
Any food product with more than 22.5g of sugar has a high sugar content and should be avoided – especially for breakfast. Eating something with that much sugar would mean you'd reached (or even exceeded, depending on the size of your portion) your daily allowance of sugar with the first meal of the day.
Foods with 5g of sugar or less typically are considered low in sugar. If you're trying to reduce sugar at breakfast and can't get away from prepackaged food products, these are going to be your best bet.;
, While you may see the word ""sugar"" on a list of ingredients on the side of a prepackaged food product, you're also likely to see a number of other words that also are sugar, just in a different form.Watch for any word ending in -ose – sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose. These are all sugars.
Highly processed sugars like corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup can be found on many ingredient lists for prepackaged food products you might find in the grocery store.
Also be on the lookout for molasses, fruit juice, and honey. Though technically ""healthier"" than refined sugar, these are still sugars and should be limited if you're trying to reduce sugar at breakfast.

, Packaged, prepared, and frozen foods are notoriously high in sugar. Many frozen foods, such as pre-made breakfast sandwiches, may include sugar as a preservative despite the fact that the food itself isn't particularly sweet.Even if the front of the box proclaims that the product is ""lite"" or ""sugar free"" or ""diet,"" you still need to check the ingredient and nutrition panel. Keep in mind that many of these labels, such as ""lite,"" aren't regulated and could be a deceiving advertisement.
Particularly with food products advertised as diet foods, you need to be on the lookout for artificial sweeteners in addition to regular sugars.

, Many sugar-free or diet versions of standard breakfast fare include chemical sweeteners that can be as chemical sweeteners that have their own downfalls. For example, using artificial sweeteners does nothing to lessen your craving for sweet foods. Perhaps more importantly, using artificial sweeteners does nothing to lessen your craving for sweet foods.If you find you need some kind of sweetener, at least in the beginning, use Stevia, which is more natural than the other artificial sweeteners on the market.
Try to use progressively less artificial sweetener each day until you eventually find you no longer need it to enjoy your food.

, Omelettes are a quick and easy breakfast option that allow you to get a well-balanced meal with plenty of protein all in one dish. You may equate omelettes with vegetables and savory flavors, but you can make sweet omelettes too – without adding sugar.For example, mix currants or berries into your eggs along with cinnamon and nutmeg for a sweet omelette. Place fresh fruit and plain yogurt in the middle, then fold it over and serve.
Savory omelettes can be made with your choice of spices, peppers, onions, and other vegetables. If you have limited times in the morning, dice up some peppers in the evening or when you have more time and store them in your fridge in a closed container so they're ready to go at breakfast time.

, Simply swapping your sugary breakfast cereal for plain whole wheat or oats can eliminate as much as 70g of sugar from your diet over the course of a week. If you need some sweetness, add dried fruit or spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg.Plain grains often can be purchased more cheaply than commercial cereals, and you can save even more by buying in bulk since they have a long shelf life.
If you want to reduce sugar at breakfast gradually, you may want to buy one box of your favorite cereal and mix a small amount of it into your plain cereal. Each day, gradually decrease the amount of commercial cereal you use until you're not using any of it.

, Fruit has natural sugars, but will help you decrease your craving for sugary confections in the morning while also providing vitamins and nutrients you need for a balanced diet and healthy body.You can blend fresh fruit in season with plain yogurt for a smoothie. One benefit of smoothies is that you can make them in advance and keep them in the fridge to grab and go if you're pressed for time in the mornings.
Many commercial cereals that include fruit also include a lot of sugar that you don't need. Buy plain cereal without sugar and add your own dried fruit.
Diced fruit also can liven up a bowl of oatmeal or cup of plain yogurt.

, You can use spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander, and cardamom to add a sweet flavor to breakfast foods such as toast or oatmeal. You'll get the sweet flavor you crave and gradually decrease your desire for sugar.Cinnamon is a versatile spice that can add complexity and a balance of flavor to a number of breakfast dishes. For example, you might try putting a dash of cinnamon on your scrambled eggs.
For a warm and hearty winter breakfast, add cinnamon and nutmeg along with dried apple chunks to plain oatmeal.
You might also consider adding these spices to plain yogurt or blending them into your favorite fruit smoothie.

, Coffee and tea are common breakfast drinks, but many people load them up with cream and sugar. If you're trying to reduce sugar at breakfast, don't overlook this potential source of added sugar.Try to gradually decrease the amount of sugar you add to your coffee or tea each day until you're no longer using any at all.
If you need your morning cup to be sweet, try using honey or molasses. While still sugar, they're a little healthier for you than refined white sugar.
You might also try using an artificial sweetener such as Stevia.

, Protein, fat, and fiber are highly satiating and will help you keep your blood sugar stable. For breakfast, this means eggs for protein and whole grains for fiber. Olive oil and avocado provide healthy fats.Consider an omelette with peppers, onions, turkey, and tomato that's drizzled with olive oil or that has a sliced avocado on top. That's a quick and easy breakfast option that will leave you feeling full for hours and provide a healthy amount of protein, fat, and fiber.
Oatmeal with dried fruit and nuts – especially almonds – is another way to get the protein, fat, and fiber you need to satisfy your body.

, Exercise is one of the easiest – and most effective – ways to reduce sugar cravings and keep your energy levels up. Try to get at least 20 to 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise every day.If your not currently physically active or if you are elderly, then take a 15-minute walk in the morning and then another in the evening. This amount of activity should be sufficient to maintain a healthy activity level. However, if you are physically active and/or young, then you should strive to get more physical activity than this. You should also include some weight training in your exercise regimen.
Add strength training to build muscle mass and start burning belly fat, which excess sugar helps create.
When you get a craving for sweets, take a minute to go for a walk or run up and down a flight of stairs. After exercise, your body craves salt, not sugar, so this can help you control those cravings while you're trying to cut back on sugar.

, Nutritional deficiencies sometimes hide behind sugar cravings, making you feel like you need something sweet when really the need lies elsewhere. Get in the habit of taking a good-quality multivitamin every morning after eating breakfast.Studies have shown that chromium, Vitamin B3, and magnesium are particularly instrumental in helping your body control blood sugar.Typically the fewer nutritional deficiencies you have, the fewer cravings you will have, making it easier for you to weaken the grip that sugar has on your body and mind.
If you have any significant health problems or chronic medical conditions, you should consult your doctor for recommendations on a vitamin that would work for you and not interfere with your condition or any prescription medications.

, Sleep deprivation can disrupt your normal hormone levels and cause you to think you're hungry when you're really not. Making sure you get between 6 and 8 hours of sleep each night can help you avoid sugar cravings while you're cutting back.Keep in mind that your brain associates sugar consumption with a burst of energy. So if you're tired or fatigued, your brain is going to tell you that you want something sweet.
However, if you're well-rested and intersperse activity throughout your day, you'll be less likely to start thinking you need sugar to keep going.
Additionally, getting too little sleep can cause tension, stress, and anxiety, all of which may increase your craving for sugar.

, Aside from it being generally important to keep your body well hydrated, drinking water can reduce or eliminate your cravings for sugar. Often your brain tells you that you're hungry when really you just need water.Drinking a large glass of water before meals can help reduce your appetite, which may be important if you're trying to lose weight.
If you have a craving for a sweet or sugary treat, drink a large glass of water and wait for five minutes. You may want to go for a walk or do something to take your mind off your craving. After five minutes has elapsed, you may find that your craving is gone.

Open the lid of your grill.,
Hook up gas to your grill, if necessary.,
Turn on the gas.,
Ignite the grill.",How to Start a Gas Grill1," Keeping your lid closed while lighting can cause gas fumes to build up. This can create an exploding hazard. If the gas has been turned on with the lid closed, turn off the gas and open the lid. Wait a few minutes for the gas to dissipate, then start the process over., In most cases, a propane tank is used to supply your grill with gas. Propane tanks are usually stored beneath, behind, or to the side of the grill. Attach the gas line firmly to the propane tank and the gas intake for your grill.Depending on your grill, the hookup for your gas may vary. When in doubt, follow the usage instructions. If you don’t have these, look up a digital manual with a keyword search for your grill online.
Some grills may be connected by a direct line to the natural gas supplied to your home. This kind of gas supply acts the same as a tank, but is stationary.
Smaller tabletop grills oftentimes have small canisters of gas which are screwed into the valve of the grill before it can be ignited.

, This is usually done by turning a circular shaped valve on top of the propane tank. Some grills may have a secondary valve on the grill that you need to open for it to receive gas. Open the valve fully, then wait about a minute for the gas to move through the line to the grill., Generally, this involves turning a regulator knob on the front of your grill for the burner closest to the igniter to its highest setting. This will allow gas to flow through the grill up through the grate. Press the igniter button to cause a spark inside the grill and light the gas. Follow the ignition instructions for your grill for the best results.Different grills may have different designs, like ones that have the starter and regulator knob combined. Follow the grill instructions when confused about the ignition procedure.
Once one burner is lit, you can light burners next to the lit one without the igniter by simply turning on the regulator knobs for these burners.

Steam your asparagus.,
Grill your asparagus on an outdoor grill.,
Grill asparagus on a griddle.,
Oven-roast the asparagus.,
Saute asparagus.",How to Eat Asparagus2," Cut the ends of the asparagus if the spears are thick. Wash the asparagus. Fill a large pot with a couple inches of water and place a vegetable steamer into the pot. The water should not seep through the holes in the steamer; if it does, pour some water out of the pot. Put the asparagus in the pot and bring to a boil. Steam until soft or until you reach the texture you want.


Consider serving steamed, grilled, or roasted asparagus as the first course at dinner. It is traditionally served with fresh-melted butter or freshly-made Hollandaise sauce. Eat with forks or fingers.
Asparagus gets soft and moist when you steam it, and the result can taste bland. Add salt and other seasonings to spice up the flavor. Bear in mind that even though asparagus is very healthy, adding tons of salt and other seasonings may offset the health factor.

, Cut the the ends of asparagus if the spears are thick. Wash the asparagus. Make a ""boat"" with aluminum foil for the asparagus to go in; the sides should be high enough to prevent the oil and asparagus from spilling over. Pour 1-2 tbsp. of olive oil into the aluminum foil ""boat"", and lay the asparagus in on top. Place the ""boat"" on an outdoor grill on medium heat until the spears reach the texture you want.


Asparagus gets tougher when you grill it, but it still retains all of its moisture. The best part is that when it's cooked, you don't lose any nutrients!
This is one of the simplest, tastiest ways to eat asparagus if you don't want to work it into a more complicated recipe.

, Trim the spears and drizzle them with a bit of olive oil and seasoning. Toss the spears and seasoning in a bowl to mix. Then place the asparagus onto a hot griddle pan; ridged is ideal, but a flat iron skillet will do. Leave on a medium heat until blackened on one side (1-2 minutes). Roll over and cook the other sides. Serve warm.

, Asparagus develops a rich flavor when roasted, making this one of the most popular ways to eat the vegetable. Wash and trim spears, lightly peel the base of tougher stalks, and pat dry. Place on a baking sheet and mist or drizzle with olive oil, rolling each spear to coat. Sprinkle with salt and fresh-ground pepper, and bake at 425°F (220°C) for 10 to 15 minutes.


You can stir your roasted asparagus into a risotto or a creamy pasta dish. You can also serve the roasted asparagus as a side-dish to meat, fish, and pasta.
Consider adding a couple of fresh garlic cloves and a dash of freshly-grated lemon zest. Consider roasting with butter, salt, and parmesan or mozzarella.
Consider chopping the baked asparagus and sprinkling it on top of oven-baked macaroni. If you are so inclined, you can also chop bacon into bits and sprinkle it in with the asparagus.

, Chop the asparagus into two-inch chunks along with eggplant and butternut squash. Place the vegetables into a pan on the stove, and simmer on a medium-low heat. Season them generously with salt and pepper. Add tomato sauce. Let the mixture simmer for 5-10 minutes until the vegetables have cooked thoroughly into the sauce.


Sauteed asparagus taste great with pasta.

Blanch the asparagus.,
Stir-fry your asparagus.,
Fry asparagus with bacon.,
Make cream of asparagus soup.,
Dice asparagus into an egg recipe.,
Eat asparagus raw.,
Add asparagus to a smoothie.",How to Eat Asparagus3," Boil the asparagus spears in a pot of water for 3-5 minutes, depending on their thickness. When the spears are bright green and tender, place them into an ""ice bath"": a large bowl 2/3 filled with cold water and ice cubes. The ice bath will ""shock"" the asparagus to stop the cooking. Soak the asparagus for as long as it took to boil. Drain your spears using a colander or a paper towel.


Serve blanched asparagus spears in salads, or eat them on their own with dressing and seasoning. For a simple and tasty dish, add a bit of coarse salt and a drizzle of olive oil to your asparagus before serving it.
Blanching is a great way to prepare asparagus for storage if you plan to eat it later. If you are blanching asparagus in advance, or you plan on bringing it to a picnic or potluck, refrigerate the spears in a paper towel-lined plastic bag.

, Stir-fry tends to include a variety of vegetables, and asparagus isn't an unheard-of addition to the mix. Add to any stir-fry as long as the asparagus goes well with the ingredients.


If you have picky children, a stir-fry can be a great way to get them to eat asparagus. You can easily put in some shredded chicken and small chunks of vegetables, and they may not even notice the asparagus.

, Wrap bacon around pieces of asparagus and put them into a pot. Use more oil than than you would in a stir-fry. Fry for 10 minutes and serve on a plate. Be careful not to over- or under-cook the bacon. Be prepared to clean the dishes very well, as they may grow greasy and messy.

, Cream of asparagus soup is an elegant starter or lunch dish, and you can prepare it in 50 minutes. The soup is hearty enough to be a main dish, but you can also serve it as a side.To serve four:


Cut the tips from 12 asparagus spears, 1.5 inches from the top, and halve the tips lengthwise if thick. Save the tips to garnish the soup.
Cut the stalks and all remaining asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces.
Sauté one large onion, chopped, in 2 tablespoons butter in a 4-quart pot over moderately low heat. Cook, stirring, until the onion softens. Add the asparagus pieces, and salt and pepper to taste. Sauté the asparagus and onion, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add 5 cups broth and simmer, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes or until the asparagus is very tender.
While the soup simmers, cook reserved asparagus tips in boiling salted water until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes, then drain.
Purée the soup in batches in a blender until it is smooth. Transfer smooth soup to a bowl, and return to pan. Stir in crème fraîche, and add more broth to thin the soup to your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Bring soup to a boil and whisk in another tablespoon of butter.
Add 1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, and garnish the soup with asparagus tips. Serve cream of asparagus soup with warm, crusty bread for dipping.

, Dice up leftover asparagus to toss into your scrambled eggs. If you have a cast-iron skillet, try making a roasted asparagus frittata. If you have a pie crust, try to make an asparagus, leek, and Gruyere quiche. Try making a crust-less asparagus quiche, or an asparagus and zucchini torta.

, It may not sound tasty, but eating asparagus raw is a quick and easy way to get its nutrients. You can have it as a snack or put it into a salad. To serve with a salad, chop the asparagus up and serve it raw with lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, and anything else that strikes your fancy. Consider serving with a light vinaigrette.

, Simply add a spear or two of asparagus to your fruit smoothie. You can blend the asparagus, raw, into the smoothie, or you can dunk the spears so that they stick out of the cup.

Open the lid of your grill and hook up its gas, if necessary.,
Open the valve for the gas supply.,
Turn on and ignite the gas.",How to Start a Gas Grill2," With the lid closed, potentially dangerous explosive gas won’t have a chance to build up. Hook up your gas by attaching the gas line to the gas output, like a tank, and the input, like a connector on the back or side of the grill.


Gas inputs and outputs are usually preceded or followed by a shutoff valve and are frequently shaped like spigots., On the connector that’s linking your gas supply to your grill there should be a shutoff valve. Open this fully to supply gas to your grill. Wait a few minutes after opening the valve to give the gas enough time to fill the line., Place a match in the lighting hole. This should be a small hole located on the grill’s side. Open the regulator for the burner closest to the lighting hole fully. Light the first match already in the lighting hole with a second match. The turned on burner should light.


After your first burner lights, it’s a simple matter to turn on the regulator knobs for the other burners. They should light off the flame already burning in your grill.
Some models of grill may not have lighting holes or might have poorly designed ones. In this case, stand as far from the grill as you can and use a long stick match to light the grill."
"
Check the gas supply and supply lines.,
Use a manual method of lighting for faulty starters.,
Replace burners, when necessary.,
Inspect electrical components, if applicable.,
Allow more time for cold tanks to supply gas to the grill.",How to Start a Gas Grill3," If your tank is empty or your gas supply line is turned off, even a perfectly functioning grill won’t work. Replace empty tanks. Turn all supply valves to the ""On"" position once the gas supply and grill are hooked up. Check supply lines for cracking, looseness, and other signs of wear and tear. Replace old or faulty supply lines.If the rubber of your supply line feels brittle, it’s a good sign the line should be replaced. Replacement parts can be found at most hardware stores and home centers.
When the grill and gas supply are properly hooked up and the gas turned on, a hissing sound, especially from connectors or valves, could be a sign of a gas leak. Leaks can result in fire or explosions. Turn off the gas and stop using your grill immediately if you suspect a leak.

, The starter on your grill is used every time you fire it up. The frequent usage of this part sometimes causes it to break or fail. When you’re certain you have gas and the supply lines are in good condition, manual lighting is a great solution for faulty starters.Sometimes you can tell when an igniter is bad by the sound it makes. If you push your igniter and it makes a different sound than normal, this could indicate that your igniter no longer works.

, If your gas supply is fine and the igniter seems to be working, the problem may be with the burners under the grate of your grill. Follow your grill instructions for proper replacement procedures.Before replacing your burner, try resetting its regulator. This may not be possible for all grills, but if it is for yours, instructions on how to do this will be in the grill's manual.
You can usually replace burners inexpensively with a suitable new part purchased from a hardware store, home center, or the manufacturer.

, Many newer grills have batteries and electrical lines to supply power to other functions of the grill. These can come loose or degrade over time. Re-fasten loose electrical cables. Replace any batteries that might be flat, then try to light your grill again.


Igniters, in some cases, use a small battery to power the ignition mechanism. The placement of this part will depend on your grill, but many times it is situated close to or underneath the igniter switch., Cold weather can cause the internal pressure of tanks to decrease. This can cause the gas to flow slower than normal or freeze. Allow additional time for gas to feed through the supply line to your grill when it is chilly or cold.


If your tank has frozen, you won’t be able to use it until it has thawed. Bring the tank in a warmed location, like a shed or basement, so it can thaw."

Cut the avocado in half.,
Scoop the pit out with a spoon.,
Alternatively, remove the pit by striking it with a knife.Position the heel of a sharp kitchen knife over the center of the pit.,
Remove the flesh in chunks.,
Scoop out the flesh.,
Cut the flesh into slices.",How to Eat an Avocado1," Hold the avocado steady with one hand while using your other hand to cut the fruit in half, from top to bottom.Use a sharp kitchen knife. While the flesh is fairly soft, you will need a sharp knife to cut through the outer layer of skin.






Make sure that you cut around the pit.






The pit should be exposed and stuck in one side.







, If the flesh of the avocado is fairly soft, you can dig around the pit using a large metal knife and pry it free.


If the flesh is too tough, you may need to cut the pit free with a knife. Make a lengthwise cut in the avocado half containing the pit. Cut around the pit, exposing enough of it to wedge the knife beneath and force it out.






Discard the pit once you remove it.







, Carefully yet forcefully swing the heel of the knife into the pit, getting it a few millimeters in. Twist and turn the knife gently until you can dislodge and lift out the pit.


Hold the avocado with a folded kitchen towel as you do this. Using a towel will help to protect you in case the knife slips, and it can also give you more traction as you hold onto the avocado.






Use a large chef's knife instead of a small paring knife. The latter will not have enough power to stick into the pit.







, Use a small knife to cut a cross-hatch pattern into the flesh of the avocado. Slide the knife below the cubes of avocado, cutting them as close to the inner part of the skin as possible.


At no point should you cut through the skin of the avocado.

, Slide a metal spoon or ice cream scoop into the flesh of the avocado. Dig out a portion of the flesh by twisting and turning the spoon, slicing the avocado with the edge of the spoon.


Do not pierce the avocado peel as you do this.

, Use a sharp knife to cut each half into slices. Use your fingers to gently separate each slice from the skin by peeling it away.


Avoid cutting the peel off completely. You can, however, still pry the slices from the peel if you accidentally cut into part of the peel.

Being smooth and stable is the key here. Don't grasp the Oreo too tight, and definitely don't wiggle the cookie back and forth. Grasping too tight or wiggling may lead to the filling failing to separate cleanly.


Make sure that both the Oreo and your hands aren't too warm. Warm hands will warm the Oreo and soften its filling, making it more gooey and sticky. A warm Oreo is harder to separate.
Don't grip the Oreo for too long. The longer you hold the Oreo without starting the next step, the more likely it is to start to warm up.;
, With each half of the Oreo in your fingertips, begin to smoothly rotate your hands in opposite directions. Most Oreo experts rotate the half that is in their dominant hand towards them, while gently rotating their non-dominant hand away from their body.

, As you gently rotate you will feel a gentle pop come from the Oreo. This is your signal to separate the Oreo by moving your hands apart from each other. It is best to gently pull away so that the filling-covered half of the Oreo and the non filling-covered half of the Oreo don't accidentally bump.

, With proper technique and a little luck, you should have one half of the Oreo that is completely clear of filling and one half with all of the filling. If so, success! If not, don't worry. This only means that you need to practice by separating (and eating!) more Oreo cookies.

, There is no 100% correct way to eat an Oreo, but there aren't any incorrect ways either. Now that your Oreo is ready, you are free to do as you choose. You could even put the Oreo back together, knowing that you were successful. Regardless of what you choose, enjoy the pairing of the sweet taste of victory and the delightful crunch of Oreo cookie.


Some people enjoy saving the filling-covered side for last, enjoying it in one delicious bite.
Another popular eating method is to scrape the filling from the covered side off of the cookie with your teeth.

, This is a very popular way of eating Oreo cookies. Dipping an Oreo in milk will soften it and will make the milk taste like an Oreo. If you are dipping, be careful not to leave the Oreo in the milk too long, which will cause it to crumble.


Some people love to properly dunk an Oreo cookie.
You can also drop an Oreo cookie in a glass of milk to flavor your milk and leave yourself a sweet treat at the bottom of the glass.

, It isn't as if either Oreo cookies or ice cream needed to be any better, but combining the two allows for the creation of some truly unique delights. Here are a few suggestions to get started with.


You can use Oreo cookies as edible spoons for ice cream. Simple scoop ice cream with an Oreo cookie and enjoy two treats in one bite.
You can also crush or crumble Oreo cookies and sprinkle them on top of ice cream to add a tasty crunch.
You can mix Oreo cookies, ice cream, milk, and a banana in a blender to create a delicious Oreo milkshake.

, Believe it or not, deep fried Oreo cookies are a favorite at some fairs and carnivals.If you have a favorite batter, are a big Oreo fan, and have experience deep frying, this might be worth trying out.

, For those with a sweet tooth, an Oreo can be even better when dipped in warm melted chocolate or cold whipped cream.

, Some bakers make pie crusts or cheesecakes using crumbled Oreo cookies. To make Oreo crumbles that you can incorporate into your own baking simply break Oreo cookies into two or three pieces each and place them in a resealable plastic bag. Roll over the bag several times with a rolling pin and viola, Oreo crumbles!An alternate way of making Oreo crumbles would be to crumble them in a food processor. Just be careful not to over-blend them. Most recipes look for Oreo crumbles, not Oreo flour!

If you want to bake with your apples, or like tart apples, Granny Smiths, Braeburns, and Jona golds are all solid choices.;
, At the store, check to make sure that apples are firm to the touch and fragrant. A ripe apple should feel firm and should smell like an apple at the stem and at the blossom end. Some apples, like the Macintosh or the Jonathan, will feel slightly softer to the touch, because the flesh is somewhat mealier. That's perfectly fine. If they smell ripe, they are good to eat.


Look for bruising, discolouration, and signs of worm infestation in your apples. Apples with brown soft spots or dark holes that look burrowed into the flesh should be avoided. Little superficial dark dots on the skin of the apple are fine to eat, however.
In general, you're looking for signs of over-ripeness, not under-ripeness. All apples you get at the store should be ripe enough to eat right away. You're just trying to make sure you don't get any over-aged apples.

, Apples are harvested at their peak of ripeness, so they're perfectly fine to eat right away. You can keep them on the counter for a day or two.


If you don't want to eat your apples right away, keep them in the refrigerator in a paper bag. Good either way.
Saying that one bad apple spoils the bunch is more than just a tidy phrase. Apples produce ethylene as they ripen, which promotes ripening in other fruits around them.Never store apples in closed plastic bags, or they'll ripen and spoil very quickly. Go with paper.
If you want to store a sliced apple or a halved apple, do so in the refrigerator. These will dry out and brown very quickly, but a little spritz of lemon juice on the flesh of the apple will help to keep it fresh for longer.

, Wash your apple under running water, and scrub the outside of the skin with a clean towel to clean it from excess pollen and dust from the store. Then dig in or start slicing it up.


Some commercially available apples are covered in a thin layer of food-grade wax, if the tree it comes from has been sprayed. While people have varying opinions about food safety issues associated with eating this, it's commonly consumed and technically approved for consumption.
If you have concerned about pesticides in the wax around your apple skin, remove the skin of the apple.Use a paring knife to remove the apple skin carefully, leaving as much of the white flesh as possible.
The skin of the apple is the highest in fiber and a compound called ursolic acid, which has been linked to weight loss, respiratory health, and blood sugar regulation., By far the most common way of eating apples is by biting right in and eating the skin and the flesh of the apple raw, rotating the apple around as you bite off what you want. If there is a stem in the apple, twist it off and discard it. It's common to eat right down to the hard, plastic-like core of the apple, with its small clutch of seeds, and then discard it.


Contrary to popular belief, the ""core"" of apples are perfectly edible. According to some estimates, eating around and saving the core wastes around 30% of the edible flesh of each apple. Try eating the whole thing, starting at the bottom blossom end of the fruit.
Apple seeds do contain a minuscule amount of cyanide, but at levels which are so small there's no threat of affecting your health. It's perfectly fine to eat them., If you want to cut your apple into slices for snacking or dipping, use a small paring knife to remove the core and cut each half into bite-sized slices the size of your choice.


Cut the apple in half, from the stem to the tail to split the core into two halves. Then, you can cut each half of the apple into slices.
It's usually a good idea to remove the seeded core of the apple with a small paring knife.
Alternatively, cut the apple across the ""belly,"" between the stem and the tail, cutting through the core instead of down it.

, Raw apple slices make excellent vehicles for dipping and topping, perfect for an afternoon snack, a quick breakfast, or a fun treat for a child., Even the pickiest eaters often love apples dipped in peanut butter. Making caramel apples can be a fun cooking project with kids (or adults).
Eat slices of sharp cheddar or swiss with apple slices for a salty and sweet combination, or combine apples with sunflower seeds, peanuts, almonds, or a combination of other seeds and nuts for added protein.

, It will make it very pleasant and refreshing snack. They can also be served with ice cream with caramel poured on top!, If you bought too many apples and are worried they'll go bad before you can eat them raw, making your own applesauce is one of the best ways to get a longer life out of them. It couldn't be easier to make applesauce to your taste. You can keep the skin on the apples for added fiber content, if you like, or remove it if you'd prefer a smoother applesauce.


Start by washing and cutting up your raw apples into bite-sized pieces. In a medium pot over medium-low heat, add the apples and a small amount of water to keep the apples from scorching. Let applesauce cook down, stirring regularly, until it reaches the desired consistency. Stir the apples regularly, adding brown sugar and cinnamon to them to suit your taste.
You can eat fresh applesauce warm or let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate it for a cold version. Store applesauce in the refrigerator if you want to save it.

, Apple pies are one of the most iconic and perfect pies for a reason: apples make for great pie filling. Apples also make perfect additions to lots of different baking projects, adding sweetness, moistness, and texture to a variety of dishes. Check out the following baking ideas for creative ways to cook with apples:


Apple pie
Baked Apple
Apple Cake
Vegan Apple Cake
Apple Muffins

, Take a look at the ingredients list of any commercial juice. Number one ingredient on most of them? Apple juice. That's because apple juice is sweet, delicious, and easy to mix with other more sour juices to create great combinations. If you have a juicer, cutting raw apples into slices and juicing them can be a great way of stretching other juices or drinking straight for a vitamin-packed treat.


Apple cider or is another excellent drink that you can make at home, though it's technically somewhat different than juicing. To make cider, puree apple slices into a consistency similar to applesauce, then strain the pulp through cheesecloth. Store the resulting juice in the refrigerator.
Heat cider and juice on the stove, adding cinnamon, rum, orange zest, clove, and other spicy additions for a great and warm holiday treat.

Choose a turkey under 20lbs to ensure it fits under the grill hood.,
Combine the turkey rub ingredients together.,
Take the turkey out of the fridge an hour ahead of time and thoroughly wash it inside and out, then pat dry with paper towels.,
Put your wood chips in a pan and add apple cider vinegar, a shot of cognac or whiskey and water.,
Put your aluminum drip pan in the middle of your grill and add about 8 charcoal briquettes to either side of the drip pan.,
Loosely place aluminum foil over the wing tips to prevent burning.,
Place your turkey exactly in the middle, add 1/2 a cup or so of your wood chips to either side, and close the lid.,
Check back and add new wood chips about 20 minutes after first placing the turkey on the grill and check to ensure any liquid is landing in the drip pan not on the coals.,
When it's done, check with your thermometer to ensure it is cooked.",How to Smoke a Turkey on a Weber Charcoal Grill," A high quality, preferably fresh turkey that has been farm raised (a varied diet increases flavor) and allowed to run around generally yields the best flavor. Buy or have a good thermometer ready to ensure it hits 165 °F (74 °C) as the smoking will impart a pink color to the turkey (this is normal, doesn't mean it isn't cooked - use temperature for accuracy).;
, Let sit for at least 15 minutes to let the flavors come together. If you have a bigger bird increase each of the ingredients accordingly.

, Rub the ingredients all over the outside of the chicken and especially under the skin of the breast (make sure you get to the front of the breast not just the back). Coat the inside of the turkey as well. Let it sit for an hour to get up to room temperature.

, Make sure the woodchips are submerged but not swimming in the water. They need to soak for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer prior to use.

, Use a charcoal chimney to get your coals going (never use lighter fluid). After the coals are ready put half on each side of the drip pan working to get more coals on the sides of the grill rather than next to the drip pan to reduce potential burning of the turkey.

, Lightly coat the middle of the grill grate with oil and place the grill so that you can add wood chips to each side (you can use a Weber with a grill grate that opens on one end for just this purpose - if you don't have this, you'll need to put wood chips on the coals prior to putting the grill gate/turkey on).

, Ensure that your top vent is about a 1/3rd open and your bottom vent is 3/4 open. Watch for a few minutes to ensure the wood chips are smoking properly. 

, The first 2 or 3 times you add wood chips are critical to getting that deep rich smoke flavor and color. After the first hour, you can add wood chips dependent on the level of smoke you wish. You will also need to add charcoal briquettes a few at a time, each time you add wood chips.

, Pull it off the grill (lightly tent it with aluminum foil) and let it sit for 15 minutes before carving to let the juices flow back into the meat.

Pick a ripe one.,
Rinse the outside.,
Cut melon into wedges or chunks.,
Watch out for the seeds.,
Chill your watermelon.,
Try adding a small amount of salt.,
Add lime juice and chili powder.,
Cut into large slices.,
Cut watermelon into chunks.,
Try slicing wedges.,
Make a blended watermelon drink.,
Make a cold melon soup.,
Make watermelon salad.,
Make balsamic watermelon skewers.",How to Eat a Watermelon," Picking a ripe watermelon doesn't need to be a total mystery. There are two basic ways to pick a melon that's ripened to perfection, which involve using your eyes and your hands:


Feel the melon. Pick it up and feel the weight. Good melons should feel slightly heavier than they look. That means they're juicy and sweet. If you tap a melon, your knuckles should bounce back. If the melon feels hollow or soft, that's a bad sign. The surface should feel quite firm. Bumpiness is a sign of irregular watering.Look at the melon. Ripe melons should have a ""field spot,"" which is usually yellowish or brownish on one side, which may be slightly flatter. This means the melon was allowed to ripen for a while on the ground before being picked. Avoid any melons with a very shiny green surface, which is a sign of under-ripeness.;
, Even though you don't eat the rind of the watermelon, it's still a good idea to give it a rinse. The knife you use to cut it up will pass through the outside, which can still have residual pesticides and other stuff from the dirt on it. Even if you grew it yourself, it's still a good idea to give it a rinse before you cut it up.

, There's no wrong way to eat watermelon. The most classic way is to slice it into hand-held pieces and eat it right down to the rind, but cutting up melon into chunks and eating with skewers or a fork is also perfectly delicious.


Place the clean, dry melon on a flat cutting surface. You can stabilize the melon with your your hand on the other end of the melon, or by placing the melon on a towel.
Use a sharp chef's knife to cut watermelon, and keep your fingers clear of the knife as you work.
Check out the next section for different ways to slice up your watermelon.

, Most watermelons have lots of hard black and white seeds throughout the flesh. Part of the fun or the challenge of eating watermelon is negotiating these seeds and getting rid of them. Spit them into a small cup if you're inside, or take the melon outside and have a spitting contest in the yard. It's hard to do elegantly.

, Watermelon is great, but chilled melon in the summertime? Out of this world. If you've picked a ripe melon, storing it in the refrigerator will help to keep it fresh as well as add some refreshing coolness to the melon. It's always a good idea.


It's hard to eat a whole watermelon at once. If your group can't finish one, cut it into chunks and store them in a bowl in the fridge, or cover the melon with plastic wrap and put it cut-side up in the refrigerator. It'll be even better when it's cool.

, While it might sound strange, some people like to add a very small sprinkling of salt to watermelon. The thought is, the salt creates a sweet-salty contrast that makes the melon actually taste a little sweeter.Watermelon's pretty subtle, though. If you want to try salting yours, it's important to use a very small portion of salt. Don't overwhelm the fruit.


Try putting out a little dish of salt and dipping the melon into it, rather than dumping it onto the fruit. Much easier to control the portions.

, One great way to lively up some bland or underripe melon is chili powder. A little spritz of lime juice and a kick of chili powder? Boom. Your melon's back in business.In a small dish, mix the following ingredients and dust the melon gently with a light coating:


1 tablespoon of coarse salt
1 teaspoon of ground chile
Zest and juice of 1 lime

, Trim off one end of the watermelon using a sharp chef's knife, then cut 1-inch thick sections off the melon, across the middle. Cut these in half to make two half-moon shaped slices, or cut again into triangles. Hold by the rind and enjoy.


You can also cut down the middle of the watermelon long-ways, then cut extra-long sections of watermelon to dive into. They might be messy, so it's best to eat them outside.
Some people also like to start in the center, cutting the melon in half to get right to the juiciest parts of the melon. This can be effective, especially if you've got a really big watermelon. There's no wrong way.
What do you do with the melon in the end-piece? Scoop it out with a spoon.

, Another great and easy way to serve watermelon is to cut it up into bite-sized chunks and store them in a bowl. Cut big slices as normal, then use a smaller paring knife to remove the whitish-green rind from the melon. Cut into chunks that suit your taste.


Cut into cubes, triangles, or other shapes. Use butter knives with your kids to let them chop up watermelon into animal shapes, or letters. Or use cookie cutters for real fun.
Some people like peeling the rind off before chunking up a watermelon. This can be done with a sharp chef's knife and some care, stabilizing the melon on a flat cut side, or it can be done with a vegetable peeler.

, One innovating way of cutting up watermelon involves chopping it as you might an onion or a potato.This is an excellent way of serving watermelon as finger-food at a slightly fancier affair, because it'll cause less mess.


Use a small rounded melon, or cut off an end-section of the melon no larger than about a half-basketball size. Place the melon cut-side down on the cutting board.
Make cross-hatch cuts in the melon, spaced about 1-inch apart. Cut straight across the melon at 1-inch intervals going on direction, then make perpendicular cuts in the other directions.
Serve as is. Have guests pull out the long-skinny sections to munch on and provide a bowl for the rinds.

, Watermelon makes the perfect subtle base for a blended drink. Why use water when you can use watermelon? Try out the following watermelon drinks:


For the simplest and most delicious blended melon drink, try mixing 2-3 cups of chopped and de-seeded watermelon with 1-2 cups of cantaloupe. Blend thoroughly in a blender, then add the juice of half a lime, and sugar to taste, if necessary. Use honey for a natural alternative.
Mix blended watermelon with cucumber, gin, and mint leaves for a twist on a summer cocktail.
Want to lively up some lemonade? Blend up some watermelon chunks and mix with equal parts lemonade for a delicious summer treat. Garnish with strawberry, or mint leaves.
Use watermelon to sweeten green smoothies. Blend up two cups of kale, a half cup of parsley, and half an avocado, then add three cups worth of cubed watermelon and some pineapple juice to sweeten., Gazpacho made with watermelon as a main component can be a delicious and refreshing summer treat. Using little additions to emphasize the sweetness and sourness of the watermelon can be elegant and delicious.


In a blender, mix up 6-9 cups of cubed and seeded watermelon, one cup of sweet Riesling or other sweet wine, one teaspoon of fresh chopped ginger, the juice of half a lemon, a teaspoon of sugar, and chopped fresh mint to taste.
Chill the mixture for at least half an hour, then serve topped with chopped mint and crumbled feta cheese.

, Watermelon can make for a cool, crunchy feature for a summertime salad, adding sweetness and subtle flavor. Here are a few ideas for simple salads that only involve a few ingredients:


Mix thin-sliced cubes of watermelon with slices of cucumber, raw onion (optional), tomato, chopped mint or basil, a teaspoon or two of apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper to taste.
Layer slices of watermelon, cooled and sliced roasted beet, chunks of blue cheese, and basil leaf.Mix a few cups of arugula with chopped watermelon, walnuts, feta cheese, mint leaves, and dress with lemon juice, chopped shallot, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste.

, A classy summer appetizer or snack combines sweet and savory together on a plate. Plus you can also eat it as a skewer, which is always fun. Cut cubes of watermelon into large, bite-sized chunks, then top with a full basil leaf, a piece of feta cheese, and a drizzling of balsamic vinegar and fresh cracked pepper. Stab with a wooden skewer and serve like a sweet-favorite popsicle.

Prepare your ingredients.,
Mash the avocados.,
Mix in the remaining ingredients.,
Serve with tortilla chips.",How to Eat an Avocado4," The avocados need to be seeded and peeled, using a method described in this article. The onion, tomato, chiles, and cilantro need to be cut into small pieces and the garlic should be minced or crushed.

If using garlic powder, use about 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic.






If using dried cilantro instead of fresh, use about 4 tsp (20 ml) of the herb.






Remove the seeds from the green chiles as you dice them. If you include the seeds, the dip will be spicier.

Transform it into a pizza.,
Stuff your waffles.",How to Eat a Waffle," A waffle iron, or waffle maker, is a small appliance that’s specifically designed to make waffles. Preheat the waffle maker to 365 F (185 C), or setting three or four.As the waffle iron heats up, you can make the batter.


Most waffle irons will beep when they reach temperature.;
, In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk everything together to remove lumps and combine all the ingredients.For some additional flavor and spiciness in your waffles, add ½ teaspoon (1.3 g) of ground cinnamon to the dry ingredients.

, Crack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl one at a time. Add the milk and oil. Whisk until all the wet ingredients are incorporated and the eggs are light and fluffy.


For even richer waffles, use melted butter in place of the oil., Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and mix the batter with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula as you pour. Once you’ve added all the liquids, stir the batter until all the ingredients are just combined.


Avoid overmixing, as this can develop the gluten in the flour and make for chewy waffles.
It’s ok if there are a few lumps left in the batter., For waffle irons that don’t have a non-stick coating, spray the inside with cooking spray or brush it with a thin layer of oil. Measure between ⅔ and ¾ cup of batter, depending on the manufacturer’s instructions, and pour the batter into the bottom plate of the preheated waffle iron.Close the lid, secure the latch, and cook the waffles for four to six minutes.
Some waffle irons will beep when the waffles are ready. For irons that don’t beep, cook the waffles until there's no more steam escaping from the waffle iron.

, When the waffle is cooked, unlatch the waffle iron and open the top. Use a rubber spatula or silicone knife to remove the waffle without scratching the iron. Transfer the waffle to a plate and serve warm.


Add more cooking spray to the iron, and repeat with the remaining batter until all the waffles have been cooked.

, There are a number of garnishes you can put on a waffle, but some of the most traditional are butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, and confectioner’s sugar.You can top your waffle with any combination of these, and classic topping combinations include:


Spread butter over top of the warm waffle, and then drizzle maple syrup on top until the syrup runs down the sides of the waffle.Spread a layer of sliced strawberries or sliced bananas on top of the waffle, and then cover the fruit with a generous dollop of whipped cream.
Add some fresh fruit to the waffle and sprinkle a dusting of confectioner’s sugar over the fruit.

, In many places, waffles are served and eaten with a knife and fork. Pierce the corner of the waffle with your fork, and use the knife to cut off a small, bite-sized piece. Use the fork to pick up the piece and bring it to your mouth. Wait until you chew and swallow before cutting another small piece.


If the syrup drains off the waffle piece when you pick it up with the fork, dip it into the excess syrup on the plate before taking your bite.
If your waffle has toppings life fruit and whipped cream on top, pick up a piece of fruit and cream with each forkful of waffle.

, This method of eating works best for waffles that aren't garnished with fruit, cream, syrup, and other toppings that can fall off easily. Leave your waffle plain, or garnish it with some powdered sugar. Wrap the waffle in a napkin or piece of waxed paper, and eat the waffle by taking little bites at a time.


In Belgium, there are two main types of waffles, Brussels and Liege waffles. While Brussels waffles are eaten with a knife and fork, Liege waffles are generally eaten with the hands.
Liege waffles are sold as street food, and they typically aren't garnished the way other waffles are. Instead, Liege waffles have rocks of sugar in the batter, and the sugar melts and crystallizes when the waffles cook., Waffles are extremely versatile, and you can top them with any type of garnish you like, including a homemade cream cheese glaze. Simply drizzle the glaze over your waffle in place of syrup. To make the glaze, beat together in a mixing bowl:4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter
2 ounces (57 g) of cream cheese
¾ cup (94 g) of powdered sugar
½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) vanilla extract

, Chicken and waffles is an American dish that combines a breakfast-style waffle with dinner-style chicken. The waffle is typically served with butter and syrup, and the chicken is deep fried and served with one or two dipping sauces.


When eating chicken and waffles, you can opt to eat the two components of the dish separately, or you can combine the chicken and waffle in every bite.

, Waffles don’t have to be a breakfast dish, and you can eat them with savory toppings like cheese, meat, and vegetables. In fact, you can use two waffles in place of bread to make a sandwich, such as a waffle Monte Cristo. To make this meal, or one like it, butter the waffles and make a sandwich using:Dijon mustard
Thinly sliced ham and turkey, or other deli meats
A couple of slices of Emmental or other cheese
Red currant jelly
A dusting of confectioner’s sugar

, Bread pudding is a tasty dessert that’s popular around the world, and you can make your own creative version using waffle pieces instead of bread. Bread pudding typically requires stale bread, and you can replicate this by leaving the waffles out and exposed to the air for a day or two.To make the bread pudding more like a traditional waffle dish, use maple syrup instead of sugar, and use heavy cream instead of milk to replicate whipped cream.

, Waffles make a great creative alternative to pizza dough, and you can make a customized waffle pizza with all your favorite toppings. To make the pizza, put fresh toppings on a pre-cooked waffle and heat it in the oven. Popular toppings to try include:Cheese
Tomato paste or sauce
Olives
Spinach
Pepperoni

, Stuffed waffles are a delicious variation on traditional waffles. To make a stuffed waffle, you cook the toppings right into the waffle rather than using them as garnish. Pour the batter, add your favorite toppings, close the lid, and cook the waffles. Toppings you can try include:Peanut butter and jam
Caramel or chocolate sauce
Fresh fruit or fruit compote
Chocolate-hazelnut spread

Remove a single Tic Tac from the plastic box at one time.,
Turn the Tic Tac case upside down.,
Shake the Tic Tacs so they fall to the bottom of the compartment.,
Leave the Tic Tac on your tongue.,
Learn interesting facts about Tic Tacs.",How to Eat a Tic Tac," The correct way to eat Tic Tacs is to dispense with the small breath mints one-by-one.


The wrong way to eat Tic Tacs is to try to shake a bunch of them in your hand at once. Often, the latter method results in the small mints landing on the floor. You never know how many you will get.
It turns out that Tic Tacs come with a compartment design that allows you to rather precisely remove them one by one. Who knew?;
, Many people make the mistake of shaking the Tic Tac box right side up and then trying to shake them into their hand. Instead, turn the plastic case upside down to start the process.


Don't worry if you've been using the shake-it-into-the-hand method for years.This method has earned the scorn of Internet meme writers, who acknowledge that lots of us have been doing it that way for a very long time. So you're not alone. “I’ve been eating Tic Tacs wrong FOR YEARS,” reads one.The ability to extract a single Tic Tac from the container is attributed to the oval-shaped compartment that is located under a Tic Tac container flap. Open it up and check it out before you proceed., Once you’ve turned the box upside down, perform this maneuver. This will leave a space at the top of the upside down box.Now, grab the compartment lip and then pull the box back.
No one knows for sure if the makers designed the box this way for this reason, however, the crater inside of the lip works to push out a single Tic Tac.Flip open the lid slowly. There should be a Tic Tac on it. The single Tic Tac should be sitting in the oval-shaped contained on the Tic Tac lid., Don't think you need to chew Tic Tacs. They are breath mints, not candy (although some people regard them as such).


Thus, you should let the Tic Tac linger on your tongue a bit because this should freshen your breath.
Let the Tic Tac dissolve in your mouth.

, There are a lot of other things you might not know about Tic Tacs. For example, they each contain under two calories.They are available for purchase in 100 countries, and they were invented in 1969 by an Italian company. In the beginning, though, they were called “refreshing mints.” Tic Tac recently enlarged the size of its box.
They used to come in grape flavor, but they don’t anymore. In some countries, people can only buy white Tic Tacs. On the other hand, the only place you can get cardamom Tic Tacs is in India. Tic Tacs come in many flavors, including orange, mint, and cherry.

Keep in mind what you put on top of the lettuce. If you spread hot meat over the lettuce, it could wilt. Consider layering cheese, beans, or rice on top of the lettuce.;
, Avoid filling the shell too full. Hard shells will usually begin to crack with the first bite. The more filling you have, the messier it will be. Overfilling a soft taco will make it harder to wrap and might cause it to tear and lose its filling.


Be prepared in the event that filling does fall out or your hard shell breaks. Have a fork or chips nearby to scoop up any filling and shell that ends up on your plate.

, Never leave hard tacos laying on their sides. The filling is likely to spill out and your shell will soak up any liquid on your plate. Instead, rest a fork right-side-up with the tines facing your taco. Gently insert your fork into the end of the taco, balancing it vertically.


This is also useful for loading up your taco.

, To do this, place your filling off-center and fold one edge of the wrap over. Tuck the ends towards the filling, then roll in the direction of your first fold.


Rather than load up your soft taco with salsa or sour cream, think about dipping the wrapped taco in those condiments instead. This reduces the chance of your taco splitting open or becoming soggy.

, Place a napkin in your lap or tuck one into your shirt if you worry about dribbling sauce down your chin. Wipe your mouth frequently in between bites to clean off any grease.


If you're really messy or the tacos are very saucy, keep some wet naps around the table.

Pair pineapple with savory dishes.",How to Eat a Pineapple," Lay the pineapple on its side. Hold it in place with one hand and grab the base of the leafy stem with your other hand. Gently twist and pull the leaves to remove the stem. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut off the top and bottom half-inch (1.3 cm) of the pineapple.


To determine if a pineapple is ready for eating, hold the fruit steady, pinch a center leaf from the stem with two fingers, and gently pull the leaf. If it comes out easily, the pineapple is ripe.;
, Stand the pineapple on its bottom base. Use a sharp knife to slice off thin lengthwise strips of skin from the pineapple. The slices should be about a quarter-inch (0.6 cm) deep to remove as much of the skin and divots as possible. Go around the entire fruit until all the skin has been peeled off.Once the skin is gone, go around the fruit and carefully cut out any brown divots that are still left in the fruit.

, Lay the peeled pineapple on its side. Hold the fruit steady with one hand and use the other to cut. Cut the pineapple into slices or discs that are between a half-inch and an inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick.You may need to cut the slices thinner or thicker than this for different applications, so read and follow any recipes that you may be using before slicing the fruit.

, Lay each pineapple slice flat on a cutting board. Use a 1-inch (2.5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch the center core from each slice.The core is the darker yellow flesh that runs through the middle of the fruit.

You can also use a knife to cut the core from each slice if you don’t have a cookie cutter.

, It is perfectly acceptable to eat pineapples slices with your hands. Pick up a slice either with your hands or a serving utensil, bring the slice to your mouth, and bite off a small piece of fruit from the slice. Chew and swallow your bite before taking another one.

Sometimes, people serve pineapple wedges with the skin still on. In this case, eat the wedge from the tip toward the skin, but don’t eat the skin.

, Ripe pineapple is quite juicy, and eating slices with your hands can get a little messy. Before you start eating, grab a couple of napkins that you can use to wipe juice from your hands and face as you eat., You don’t have to eat pineapple with your hands, especially if you don’t want to get your hands covered in juice. Place the pineapple on a plate and use a knife and fork to cut it into bite-sized pieces. Use the fork to pick up single bites of pineapple and bring them to your mouth.


Eat one bite at a time, and don’t pick up more pineapple until you’ve chewed and swallowed the piece in your mouth.

, Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain, and this may cause a mild tingling in your mouth. This is perfectly normal, and it doesn’t mean that you're allergic to the pineapple.

Bromelain is concentrated around the center and core of the fruit, so removing the core will reduce the tingling you feel., Barbecued or grilled pineapple can be enjoyed on its own, served with meats or burgers, or even added to warm salads. You can either marinate the pineapple beforehand or cook it plain. You can also cook it in foil or directly on the grill, depending on your preferences.

Cooking pineapple breaks down the bromelain that makes your mouth tingle, so if you don’t like the sensation you get from eating raw pineapple, try eating it grilled., Pineapple is a delicious and sweet fruit that you can use in baking, just like you would bananas or apples. There are a number of different recipes that you can try, and a few of the more popular pineapple baked goods include:

Pineapple upside down cake
Pineapple bread
Pineapple pancakes

, Pineapple salsa is a delicious condiment that you can use in place of traditional tomato salsa. Pineapple salsa is cool and refreshing, so it’s particularly tasty in summer, at picnics, and at barbecues.

You can eat pineapple salsa with tortilla chips, put it on burgers or hotdogs, or use it as a side for different meat and vegetable dishes., Because pineapple is so sweet and juicy, it’s great in smoothies, pina colodas, and other drinks.You can also drink pineapple juice plain, add it to a fruit punch, or mix it with carbonated water and ice to make a refreshing homemade soda., Pineapple is often thought of as a dessert food because of how sweet it is, but it also goes great with meats, vegetables, and other savory meals. Cut the pineapple into bite-sized chunks and:

Put it on pizza
Skewer it between pieces of meat on a kebab
Serve it with shrimp
Add it to tacos
Serve it on top of rice
Add it to stir fries

Shop for chestnuts.,
Give your chestnut a chance to ripen.,
Store your chestnuts.,
Peel your chestnut with a chestnut knife.,
Eat your raw chestnut.",How to Eat a Raw Chestnut1," Chestnut season generally starts in December, right before the holidays. While you can buy chestnuts by the scoop, it is recommended that you choose each chestnut individually, as there are always a few duds in the bunch.


When picking out your chestnut, make sure to pick a nut that is round, with no holes and no black areas. Holes can be attributed to bugs and black areas usually imply mold, so examine your chestnut carefully before purchasing.A good chestnut should be heavy for its size, with shiny skin that is stretched tightly. The chestnut should also be a rich, brown color.;
, Chestnuts taste best when they are completely dry and ripe. After purchasing your chestnuts, leave them out on your counter for between one to three days. During this time, the carbohydrates in your chestnuts will turn to sugars so your nuts will taste perfectly sweet.To test if your chestnut is ripe, try giving it a good shake. If it rattles, that means the chestnut is old and should be thrown out.

, If you pick your chestnuts in a forest, store them for 7 – 10 days before peeling and eating. This will help reduce tannins and make your raw chestnuts more digestible.Chestnuts have a shelf life of two – three weeks.Never allow raw chestnuts to freeze and thaw.
Store your chestnuts in a covered container in the coldest part of your fridge.

, Raw chestnuts are very difficult to peel and are traditionally peeled by boiling or roasting the chestnut. To peel the chestnut without applying heat, use a chestnut knife. Make an incision at the bottom of your chestnut. Using your chestnut knife, chisel your chestnut until all the skin is gone and only the nut remains.Chestnut knives can be purchased on Amazon for approximately $10.00
Peel your chestnut very slowly and carefully. The knife is very sharp and often gets stuck inside the skin, so proceed with caution.

, Depending on where your chestnut originated, it may or may not be safe to eat raw. American chestnuts have high concentrations of tannic acid and will make you ill if you eat them raw.European chestnuts may or may not be eaten raw, depending on the chestnut.Asian chestnuts are generally approved to eat raw, but there is no guarantee that eating a raw chestnut will not make you ill.
Before purchasing your chestnuts, ask their country of origin and double check that they are safe to eat raw.
Because of the dangers of eating raw chestnuts, they are rarely used in recipes without first being cooked.
Conkers, which are a variety of chestnut grown in Europe, should be kept away from animals, as they may prove mildly poisonous."

Cut your chestnut.,
Wash and microwave your chestnut.,
Peel your chestnut.,
Eat your chestnut.",How to Eat a Raw Chestnut2," Place the chestnut flat side down on a cutting board and using a sharp knife, make an incision horizontally across the chestnut.

Make rhubarb, apple, and pear crisp.",How to Eat a Pear," Each type of pear has a distinct flavor, color, shape, and season. No one type of pear is superior to the other, so it's up to you to decide which type of pear you want to eat, based on what pears are available to you. Here are some of the most common types of pears:


Anjou pears: These are golden green and have a buttery, sweet flavor, are in season from October to May.
Asian pears: These are yellow, sort of apple shaped, and taste like a watermelon crossed with a potato.
Bartlett pears: These are best when they have turned yellow, but still have green flecks they are summer pears that bruise very easily. These are green when unripe; there are also Red Bartlett pears which are similar except for their color.

Comice pears: These pears are thick-skinned, green, juicy pears.
Seckel pears: These pears are small and red and green and are perfect for snacks.;
, Usually, when you buy a pear in a store, it is still hard and not quite ripe, so you will probably have to wait until it is ripened at home. Contrary to popular belief, you should actually start the ripening process by cooling the pears in the fridge first (just 1-2 days for Bartlett pears, but anywhere from 2-6 weeks for Anjou, Bosc, or Comice pears) for optimal effect. Once you remove them from the fridge, you should ripen them at between 65-75 degrees, waiting from 4-10 days for them to reach their full potential.To speed up the process after you take the pears out of the fridge, you can place them in a paper bag or near a ripe apple or banana.

If you don't like the taste of the pear's skin and find it too bitter or tough, you can carefully remove the skin with a knife first. This will make the pear a bit more juicy and tougher to eat out of your hand, though, so if you want to skin the pear, it may be better to eat them sliced (see the next step).

, You can also chop up a pear before eating it. Before cutting, you might consider peeling the pear, especially if it is thick skinned, to increase the flavor. Remove the skin from the pear, slice it in half, remove the core from each side by scooping it out with a knife, and then cut the pear into slices or chunks as thick or thin as you'd like them to be.

Examine the shape.,
Check the variety name.,
Look for defects or special shapes.,
Consider special varieties.",How to Eat a Persimmon1," Its shape is usually enough to identify persimmons sold in Western countries. Nibble cautiously if this is your only guideline, especially in East Asia where there are many varieties with all sorts of shapes.


Most sweet persimmons are squat with a flat base, similar in shape to a tomato. Some have slight indented lines running from the stem to the base, while others are smooth.
Most astringent persimmons are longer and taper to a blunt point, similar in shape to an oversize acorn.;
, In the West, persimmons are sold under just two names. Fuyu persimmons are sweet (non-astringent), and are eaten when firm. Hachiya persimmons are astringent when unripe, and can only be eaten when completely soft.Some stores in East Asia will distinguish between many more types:


Other sweet varieties include Jiro, Izu, Hanagosho, Midia, Suruga, and Shogatsu, plus any variety ending in ""Maru,"" ""Jiro"" or ""Fuyu.""There are dozens of astringent varieties. Tanenashi, Eureka, Tamopan, and Gailey are a few of the most common.When in doubt, assume the fruit is astringent.

, If you're still stuck, the shape or growth pattern of the fruit can provide hints. Many persimmons won't have these distinguishing marks, but it's worth a look:


American persimmons or ""possum apples"" are native to the eastern United States. These are typically very small and harvested from wild trees. These are astringent.A persimmon with four sides to it is astringent.
A persimmon with concentric rings around the flower end (which looks like leaves) is probably astringent.
A persimmon with cracks near the flower end is usually sweet, or a rotten fruit of either type.

, A few varieties have special characteristics to consider:


Triumph persimmons (also called Sharon fruit) often taste sweet when sold commercially, due to special treatment.Straight from the tree, this is an astringent variety. (And be careful — in some regions, all persimmons are called Sharon fruit.)
Some varieties are astringent if the inside is seedless and light-colored. They transform into sweet, seeded, dark flesh if pollinated. These include Chocolate, Giombo, Hyakume, Nishimura Wase, Rama Forte, and Luiz de Queiroz varieties.Hiratanenashi persimmons, common in Japan, can stay astringent even when soft and ripe. Proper handling prevents this, so buy from a vendor you trust.

, To cut a nectarine into neat slices to eat, you will want to make a series of incisions. Do not attempt to separate the nectarine. Just slice into it gently with a knife, leaving the fruit intact. You will separate the sections when you get done cutting your nectarine. To start, cut the nectarine in half around the pit.Start your incision slicing the nectarine on the end where the stem is located. Move your knife inward until you feel it hit the pit.
Allowing the pit to guide your knife, bend your knife around the nectarine. Make an incision circling the full nectarine that cuts around the pit.

, Hold your nectarine so the pit is facing upwards. On either side of the nectarine, make three small cuts.Make the first cut about half an inch from the line wrapping around the center of the tangerine.
Proceed to cut the sides of the tangerine into three even sections of about half an inch each.

, Now that the nectarine has been cut into sections, you can make another line slicing the nectarine in half. Again, cut into the nectarine until you feel the pit. Then, use the pit to guide your knife around the nectarine., Once all the cuts are made, use both hands to grasp the nectarine. One hand should the end with the stem.

Note that picking apart the muffin with your fingers will create crumbs, making this method less than ideal if you are trying to be clean, or are eating in a public space such as the car or subway.
Muffins that contain larger fruit such as blueberries often lend themselves very well to piece picking, as the blueberries often can be removed from the muffin in natural chunks.

, Pick up the base and eat it like a piece of fruit.

, These smaller pieces of the base are great for dipping into coffee and icing, or holding small spreads of jam or butter.

Confirm the persimmon is sweet.,
Eat when firm and orange.,
Wash the persimmon.,
Cut off the leaves and slice.,
Eat raw.",How to Eat a Persimmon2," Sweet persimmons are typically tomato-shaped, and often sold under the name Fuyu in the West. If your persimmon does not match this description, read the ID guide above. You won't enjoy it if you follow these instructions with the wrong type of persimmon.

, Sweet persimmons taste best when firm and crisp. A ripe persimmon is orange or deep orange-red.A yellow persimmon is edible, but not fully ripe. Do not eat an unripe green persimmon, which will always taste astringent.You can eat it overripe as well, with a spoon. This tastes different, but you might like it.

, Rub the persimmon clean under running water. The peel is edible, so wash it thoroughly.

, Using a sharp knife, cut off the leaf-like flower and stem. Slice the persimmon into thin wedges or slices, as you would a tomato.


The skin is edible and usually thin. If you prefer to peel it, briefly immerse the whole fruit in hot water. Remove with tongs, then peel. This is the same process as blanching tomatoes.

, A sweet persimmon should be firm and crisp, with a sweet flavor. If there are seeds, remove and discard them.


Try adding lemon juice, or cream and sugar.For more uses, check out the recipes below.

, Chop sweet persimmons roughly. Toss with standard salsa ingredients, such as red onion, cilantro, and chili peppers.If you don't have a favorite sweet salsa, follow this recipe and replace the mango and the tomatoes.

, You can cook persimmons into a jam as you would any fruit. For best results, use soft, astringent varieties, and taste each fruit before adding it to the pot. Even one astringent persimmon will add significant off-flavors.Optionally, add cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or orange zest.
Peel the fruit before stewing.

, Soft, ripe persimmons of either type are perfect for desserts. Mix the persimmon with yogurt or ice cream, or explore these options:


Puree the flesh and blend with cream cheese, orange juice, honey and salt.Replace the apricot in this sorbet recipe.
Bake them into cakes or cookies. The easiest way to find the right amount is to use a recipe that calls for overripe bananas, and replace them with an equal quantity of persimmon.Try banana bread or banana muffins. Baking soda will reduce astringency and thicken the pulp, but also reacts with persimmon to make the batter very light and airy.Halve the amount or skip it completely if you want a dense bread.

Wipe off any dirt or debris stuck on the nectarine.You should also wash your own hands before washing a nectarine.

, Nectarines taste best, and are easiest to eat, at room temperature. If you were storing your nectarine in the fridge, place it on the kitchen counter. Wait until the nectarine is at room temperature to eat it., There is no harm in eating your nectarine with the skin still on. However, some people dislike the taste or texture of nectarine skin.

Make sure the nectarine is ripe.,
Do not store a nectarine until it softens.",How to Eat a Nectarine3," Nectarines lose their color quickly. You should not slice a nectarine until right before you eat it to keep the color intact.If you're serving nectarines in a fruit salad, and want to preserve the color, you can dip nectarine slices in a cup of water with a tablespoon of lemon juice.

Unwrap your muffin.,
Grip the whole top of the muffin and twist.,
Eat the muffin top like a cookie.,
Finish eating the muffin base.",How to Eat a Muffin2," The paper cup, when unwrapped and placed flat, can help keep any crumbs from spilling elsewhere.

, The motion is similar to that you would use to open a jar. Pull the top of the muffin away from the base.


This method is most reliable when the muffin top has a slight crust or hardness compared to the base of the muffin.The crust makes it much easier to pull the top away from the base in one piece.
When the overall consistency of the muffin is softer or less dense, you may find the muffin top crumbling in your hands when you attempt to remove it. Be prepared to change your strategy!

, If the muffin is dense, the underside of the muffin top makes a great vehicle for butter or other spreads. If you found the muffin drier or more crumbly, the muffin top may be unable to receive a spread without falling apart first. In this case, it is best to eat the top plain.

, Eat the base as desired, either with your fingers or utensils.

Unwrap your muffin.,
Hold the muffin sideways or upside down in your hand.,
Eat the remaining muffin top.",How to Eat a Muffin3," The paper cup, when unwrapped and placed flat, can help keep any crumbs from spilling elsewhere.

, Eat the muffin bottom first, similar as to how you would eat an apple.


This method tends to be rather clean, as the bottom part of the muffin can often be eaten in one bite, leaving the top behind.
Consider this method if you are on the move, but also wish to respect the cleanliness of your surroundings.

, You may eat plain, or spread an icing or butter on the muffin top.


Unlike when you remove the top first, you'll find that this method typically produces less crumbs, since you aren't picking it apart with your fingers - most of it will end up in your mouth!
Bear in mind that this method, along with eating the muffin whole, can appear somewhat uncouth depending on the size of the muffin. Assess the social situation first!

Unwrap your muffin of choice.,
Slice the muffin into desired portions, using a fork and knife.,
Eat the muffin with your fork and knife.",How to Eat a Muffin4," You can place it on a plate or leave it on top of its wrapper, to collect crumbs.

, Take note that using utensils works best on muffins that are on the moister end of the spectrum. Drier muffins are more prone to crumbling into pieces, making utensils more work than necessary.


Cutting the muffin directly in half allows a flat surface on each slice that is great for applying butter or other toppings.
Cutting the muffin into smaller, bite-sized sections allows for easier dipping in coffee or icing.
Using a fork is helpful when eating a muffin that contains large pieces of fruit, such as strawberries or blueberries, even if the muffin is dry and crumbly. The fruit makes a great anchor point for your fork and can allow for easy pickup of large pieces of muffin.

, If you find the remainder of the muffin has fallen apart into smaller chunks, use the knife to scoop the crumbs onto the fork, or use a spoon. This method is typically only possible at home, or when eating at a restaurant or bakery.

Place muffin in microwave.,
Heat on High setting for 30 seconds.,
Enjoy the muffin.,
Heat the muffin in the oven or toaster.",How to Eat a Muffin5," Do not heat a muffin while it's still in the wrapper, as the wrapper may overheat or catch fire.

, Tupperware or other plastic containers may also be used, but make sure they are microwave safe and not prone to warping.

, Make sure the surface the muffin rests on is microwave safe.

, Individual microwave settings may vary. If you aren't sure that 30 seconds is appropriate, check the muffin every 15 seconds it is in the microwave.


If reheating multiple muffins, you will need to increase the time spent microwaving for each additional muffin. Thirty seconds for each muffin is a good start.

, It should be warm and soft if reheated correctly.

, Muffins can also be reheated in conventional ovens and toaster ovens.


For conventional and toaster ovens, wrap the muffins in foil and toast them at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes.
Muffins may also be cut in half and toasted with a little butter applied to each side. This helps ensure muffins do not dry out with reheating. You may wrap each side of the muffin with foil and toast at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes. Muffins may take less time to heat up, pending on your device's settings, so check on the muffins every 5 minutes if uncertain."

, Think of eating the muffin in this fashion as similar to eating a piece of fruit, such as an apple or pear.

, This method can be particularly messy, so make sure you have a plate or napkin handy to catch any crumbs.


Eating the muffin whole is the wildcard of methods! A muffin that is too large, too dry or too crumbly can make eating a muffin whole quite the spectacle.
Consider saving this method for the home or around friends to avoid unnecessary stares and creating a mess for someone.

Determine the environment.,
Prepare the ingredients.,
Cook the hot dog.,
Prepare the presentation.,
Eat.",How to Eat a Hot Dog," How you prepare for this meal will depend greatly on the circumstances and surroundings. Is this a quick lunch; a party with friends; a “working lunch” with a business contact; something for the kids? Each of these situations require different methods of preparation and consumption. If you must be mundane and a quick lunch is your objective then these are the proper steps to follow.;
,


The Dog: The standard sausage hot dog made from beef or pork is the most common. You can also choose turkey or chicken, or, if you have dietary restrictions, even vegetarian, halal. Beef hotdogs, especially kosher dogs which are made from only the best cuts of beef (and usually have garlic in the recipe) are generally thought to be the best. They also typically cost more, but are well worth the price adjustment.
The bread bun: Ordinary white bread buns are most commonly used, but potato buns are much better and it is also becoming more common to make your own ""New England style"" buns out of a loaf of Italian bread.
Chips: Many people include potato chips or corn chips. Lay's is a popular brand potato chip that goes great with hot dogs, and the Kettle Cooked variety seems to go best.
Side dish: Potato salad or beans (baked beans or pork and beans are appropriate) go great with hot dogs.
Accompanying drink: The soda of your choice will always do, but Root Beer (Barq's) is recommended.
Garnishes and Condiments: Mustard, ketchup, relish compliment hot dogs well. More are listed below.

,


Microwave oven: For the quick-and-dirty preparation, this works adequately. For a thawed, standard hot dog, between 30 and 60 seconds is quite enough. Hot dogs are precooked so you are only heating them to the right temperature. This method is for people who don't care what the thing looks like, smells like or what it tastes like, and are most likely more afraid of hunger than they are interested in eating a meal. One more note about the microwave method: If you cook them too long they will pop like popcorn. Some people enjoy watching this process and eating the strange shaped fragments.
Pay Fry: This is the preferred method. It takes a bit longer, but the taste is well worth the effort. Use a non-stick spray and turn the dogs frequently. The objective is a golden brown with just a few dark streaks.
Boil: For straight from the hot dog cart taste you can boil the dogs. They're already cooked so just leave it in until it's hot or it splits!
Optional: Slice the dog before cooking. This will allow you additional serving options.

, Even a fast lunch is more appealing when served appropriately. This takes very little time, and you'll drastically improve the quality of your meal.


Plate, napkin, or neither? Many people enjoy eating hot dogs with just their hands with a napkin nearby. If your dog is loaded with toppings, definitely go for a plate to catch the falling goodies.
Garnish: Chopped onions, relish, chili, and sauerkraut are popular. Sprinkle on as much as you like, or as much as will stay in the bun while you are biting the dog.
Condiments. Mustard is the standard condiment, although some people will put things like ketchup or mayonnaise on a hot dog with the mustard or by themselves. Place the dog on the bun and squeeze the mustard on the dog (not on the bun) so it forms a long serpentine or a zig-zag shape.
Chips and side dish: Add chips and a side dish.

, The way to eat this preparation is entirely casual. It is not uncommon to drip mustard on clothing and that is perfectly acceptable for this weekend afternoon family fun.

Gather materials.",How to Eat a Mango1," If you push your fingers into it and they leave a dent, then the mango is ready to eat. Use the same method as you would to tell if an avocado or pear is ripe.


If you touch the mango and it remains firm, then leave it out for a few days until it's ready. If you eat a mango that isn't ripe, it'll taste hard and bitter, and you don't want to waste a good mango, especially because they can get expensive.;
, The mango should be clean even if you plan on peeling the skin.

, To cube or slice your mango, you'll need a knife, a cutting board, and a bowl for your mango cubes or slices.

Dig out the seed.,
Eat the fruit.,
Store extra fruit.,
Add to a fruit salad.,
Stuff the lychee.,
Garnish cocktails.,
Chop up for a salsa.,
Cook lychee in hot dishes.",How to Eat a Lychee," Find a firm fruit, that gives a little when squeezed without collapsing or leaking. A relatively smooth skin is also a good sign, with slight bumps instead of major raised nubs.Hard, unripe fruits are edible but won't have as strong a taste. A wet, soft fruit is overripe, and may be fermented (edible with a different, strong taste) or rotted (unpleasant). Crushed or soaked peels are almost always rotted.Different varieties have different skin colors, but most are red, orange, or yellowish when ripe. Brown fruits have usually gone bad.;
, Grasp the nub of the stem and peel away the pink or yellowish-brown skin at one end. The white, semi-translucent flesh inside is the edible portion of the fruit. You may want to peel the fruit over a bowl to catch the dripping juice.


If the lychee has been left out a while, the skin will be harder and tougher to peel. Use your fingernail, teeth, or a knife to cut a slit. Soaking the fruit will make it easier to peel as well.Completely transparent flesh, mottled flesh, or yellow-brown flesh mean the lychee may be fermented or rotten.

, A perfectly ripe lychee has a soft skin that separates easily from the flesh. You can gently squeeze these fruits to pop out the flesh inside. If this doesn't work, just tear off the skin in small pieces using your fingers.The skin is inedible. Throw it away or compost it.

, A large seed lies in the center of the fruit. Gently tear apart the flesh with your fingers, pick out the glossy brown seed, and discard it. The seed is slightly poisonous.

, Fresh lychees have sweet, crisp, juicy flesh, with a signature scent that you can't find in the canned product. Enjoy it raw, or keep reading for more uses of this fruit.


A thin, brownish membrane lies on the interior of the flesh, where the seed was. Just eat this with the rest of the lychee. It adds a slight crunch without affecting the flavor. Removing it tends to squeeze out a lot of the tasty juice., Refrigerate lychee wrapped in a dry paper towel, inside a perforated plastic bag or a container with the lid left ajar. They can last up to a week this way, although the rind may turn brown and hard. Throw away the fruit if it turns grey.If you can't eat them all within that time, freeze the rest whole and unpeeled, in a sealed zip-locked bag. Run warm water over the frozen lychee for 15 seconds, then peel and eat. Partially thawed lychee have a texture similar to sorbet., This obvious option is perfect for summer. Because lychee lose juice rapidly when peeled, add them at the last minute.

, Carefully peel the lychee fruits and remove the seed, without tearing the flesh. Mix minced nuts, honey, and/or ginger into a soft cheese, such as cream cheese or chenna. Gently push open the lychee with your thumb, and fill with a small spoon or chopsticks.


You can even stuff the lychee with savory foods, such as a chicken stir fry. Make sure all ingredients are finely minced, and broil the lychees for 2–3 minutes after stuffing., Add a skewered, pitted lychee fruit to margaritas or other light cocktails. Or try something new with the lychee sake martini or novelty Mad Eye martini.

, Soft, sweet lychee adds a bold dimension to spicy or sour salsas. Try a simple salsa of avocado, lychee, and red onion, with your salsa toppings of choice., To make lychee chicken or another hot, savory dish, add the lychee to a stir fry or roasting pan just a couple minutes before the dish is done. Lychee pairs particularly well with cinnamon, ginger, or honey."

Let your astringent persimmon ripen completely.,
Speed up ripening.,
Eat chilled, with a spoon.,
Use shortcuts to eat unripe persimmons.",How to Eat a Persimmon4," Astringent persimmons are usually acorn-shaped and labeled ""Hachiya,"" at least outside of Asia. They must be eaten when soft, practically bursting into mush.The skin should be smooth and semi-translucent, with a deep orange color.


Read the identification guide above if you're not sure about your persimmon type.
If you eat Hachiya persimmon before it is completely ripe, you will have the strongest mouth puckering experience of your life, due to its astringency.This numb feeling is temporary. Drinking and eating other food will help it go away.

, Astringent persimmons ripen within 7–10 days of purchase, but can sometimes take a full month. To speed ripening, store in a closed paper bag or airtight container.If stored in an airtight container, it may become moldy. Add a ripe apple, pear, or banana to the paper bag or container, or add a few drops of rum or other spirits on each of the leaf-like growths.To ripen these without causing extreme mushiness, wrap each fruit in three layers of non-porous plastic wrap. (Avoid wraps labeled with recycling symbol 4 or ""LDPE""). Heat in an oven at minimum temperature or with just the pilot light on, no more than 120ºF (50ºC). Leave for 18–24 hours, checking occasionally., Once the fruit is soft, pop it in the refrigerator. When you're ready to eat it, cut off the leaf-like flower stem, then slice lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and inner stem if present. Eat the rest with a spoon.The peel is edible as well, but eating it is messy when the fruit is ripe.
Some people add cream and sugar, or a squeeze of lemon juice.

, There are a few tricks you can use to remove the astringency of an unripe persimmon. These will change the taste and texture, but you won't have to wait days before eating the fruit:


Freeze the soft fruit instead to create a sorbet-like texture.If you prefer it warm, defrost it in the microwave.
Alternatively, soak the persimmon in salt water for about a minute.

Peel the lemon.,
Cut wedges from the lemon.,
Cut the wedges into bites.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Eat a Lemon1," Lemon zest is great as an addition to many dishes, but you don’t want to eat the entire lemon rind raw. To start, take a sharp knife and cut off the top and tail of the lemon. Stand the lemon up on one of those cut sides. With your knife, peel off strips from the lemon until all the skin has been removed.When you're peeling, try to remove as much of the white pith as possible, as this is very bitter.
Once you’ve peeled the lemon, go around and remove any leftover pith by peeling it away with your fingers or cutting it off.
When possible, eat only Meyer lemons raw. They are sweeter and less acidic than other lemon varieties, and are much more pleasant to eat like this.;
, Insert the tip of your knife in between two wedges of the lemon, cutting to the inside of the membrane that encases the wedge. Cut the full length of the wedge, then move to the other side to separate the second side from the lemon. Remove the wedge of lemon and place it into a bowl.Always cut to the inside of the membrane, so that the lemon wedge doesn’t have the membrane attached. This part of the lemon is sour and bitter.
Repeat until you have removed all the individual wedges from the lemon.

, Cut each lemon wedge in half so you get two bite-sized halves from each wedge. Return the cut wedges to the bowl.


You can leave the lemon wedges whole, if you prefer.

, You can sprinkle the lemon with some sugar if you want to take away some of the sourness and add some sweetness. Sprinkle one to two teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of sugar over the lemon bites and stir to coat them.


You can either eat the lemons plain, with sugar, or you can add them to a salad, a fruit cocktail, or another dish.

Dip into sauces.,
Be open to trying different kinds of samosas.,
Consider balancing a samosa with a healthier option, such as a salad.",How to Eat a Hot Samosa," The filling-heavy parts of a samosa are going to be the hottest, so biting off the corners first allows the steam to release.


A samosa is known by different iterations around the world; some are packed with meat, while others are packed with vegetables..;
, This allows steam to release faster from the other side.


You want the samosa to be hot, but not so hot that it will burn you.

, Though samosas, with their wrapped-up filling, are a great food to take on the go, they also only take a few bites to devour.


Make sure you chew slowly to really experience all the flavors.
The slower you chew, the more time you allow for the rest of the samosa to cool down.
If you’re eating on a plate, tear the samosa apart first to experience the visual appeal. All of the colors and textures of the filling will make the meal that much more satisfying.

, It's the perfect way to cap off the experience.

, Like many classic American finger foods, the most popular Indian finger food pairs wonderfully with sauces. Pairing with sauces will also help cool down the samosa.


The sauces come in as many varieties as the samosas themselves, with two sauces being the standard offering on the plate.
The sweet and sour chutney, made with tamarind fruit, pairs well with potato samosas.
Whatever samosa you order, find your ideal pairing by trying it with both the sweet and sour sauce as well as a cilantro dip, made with cilantro and green chiles.

, You may not care for fish, for example, but may end up pleasantly surprised at how the mixture of spices in a samosa allow you to savor each bite. If you’re a vegetarian, the spiced potato may be up your alley.

, Samosas are best enjoyed in moderation, for they are filled with high fats and refined sugars. Share your uneaten samosas. There's no better treat for friends and family.
You can also buy or cook samosas in bulk and freeze them in foil for up to six months.
Thaw in the fridge before you’re ready to eat.

Keep it sanitary.",How to Prepare a Breakfast Bar," One common mistake is buying too much food. Fruits and breads don’t stay fresh for very long. An accurate head count can help you avoid this pitfall. Buy enough food for everyone to enjoy about two helpings each.;
, Having a breakfast bar means you are going to have to pick out foods that you feel your guests will enjoy. Buy an assortment of hot and cold foods.Some foods to consider are:


Fresh fruit.
Oatmeal and/or cold cereal.
Breakfast meats and/or veggie meats. If you do buy animal products, be considerate of guests who need vegan, Kosher, or Halal options.
English Breakfast items, bacon, eggs, sausages, beans etc.
Breakfast Cereals
Danish Pastries, doughnuts, muffins, or croissants.
Fresh bread rolls

, Check the sell-by dates on all your food. Those croissants you buy today could be 48 hours old. Even if they’re safe to eat, you don’t want your guests eating stale bread products., You need to wash your food down with a glass, cup or mug of your favorite breakfast drink. Even if you know what your guests always drink in the morning, offer them a range of options. Some good choices are:


Orange juice or apple juice.
Water.
Coffee or tea. Have regular and decaffeinated options available.
Milk. Have a non-dairy option available for your guests who are vegan or lactose intolerant. Since soy allergies are becoming more common, aim for milk made from rice, almonds, or hemp seeds.

, Don’t forget your guests who take cream in their coffee. Offer a variety of sweeteners, such as raw sugar, honey, and artificial sweetener. If you’re serving pancakes or waffles, you should buy a bottle of syrup. If toast or bagels are on the menu, it’s a good idea to buy jam, butter, or peanut butter.

, If you have a large enough space, you could use several folding tables for your bar. On the other hand, if your space is limited, a kitchen counter will also work. Make sure your bar will be in one general location so that your guests can find what they need quickly.

, Lay out pancakes, cooked breakfast foods such as bacon and sausages and other main dishes before the other foods. This will help your guests to spot the stars of the show first. It will also help them to avoid taking up too much plate space with side dishes., Keep each category together. This adds a hint of aesthetic appeal. More importantly, it makes these perishable foods easier to monitor.

, Put hot foods on a hot plate or in a slow cooker. Keep them at an internal temperature of about 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) or warmer. Place cold foods on a bed of ice to prevent them from getting warmer than 40 degrees F (4 degrees C).Throw out any food that falls out of its safe temperature range or goes uneaten for two hours.

, Place the syrup near the waffles or pancakes. Put jam or peanut butter near the bagels or toast. This will prevent your guests from having to go out of their way to dress their foods., This will prevent items like syrup from dripping into the food in front of them. Even if you keep liquids in their containers, be courteous of your guests who might not want honey or jam on their waffles.

, Your guests shouldn’t have to wait for their bread products to pop out of the toaster when they could be enjoying their meal. Put your toaster on a light setting to accommodate everyone.If you have a guest or two who likes their toast or bagels “well done,” let them use the toaster for a second round.

, This will give your guests a chance to put their food on the dining table first. Coffee and tea drinkers can mix in their cream or sugar without holding up the food line. Your guests can also get refills without cutting in front of people trying to fill their plates.


Place the drinks station near an electrical outlet for the coffee maker and tea kettle.

, You need plates or bowls to hold our foods, so it makes sense to put them at the beginning. Stack plates and bowls face up. This will make them easier to grab., When your guests are filling up their plates, they shouldn’t also have to juggle other objects. Put napkins and utensils at the end of the bar so that everyone will have a free hand to reach them. You could go one better by putting them at the dining table., Even in a private home, it’s a good idea to keep everyone’s hands out of food others will be eating. Place tongs by foods such as muffins or fruit slices. Put a large serving spoon or ladle in the bowl of granola or oatmeal. Place a smaller tablespoon near the bowl of raisins. If you’re serving finger foods like Vienna sausages, stick toothpicks in them.

Put the mango cubes in a dessert.",How to Eat a Mango2," Cut the mango into halves or thirds while avoiding the large pit. Then, make vertical cuts on the piece you're holding. Be careful not to cut through the skin. Now make horizontal cuts to create a checkered pattern. Grasp the skin on the back of the half and push it forward.


The chunks you cut should come out, making the mango piece look like a flower.
Next, just pull off the mango chunks.
If they don't give, use a knife to slice them off into a bowl or a spoon to scrape them off.


, Place the cubed mango in a bowl, grab a spoon, and enjoy! If you want to save the cubed mango for later, put it in Tupperware, but recognize that it's best enjoyed fresh and will get soggy if you put it away for a while.


Add a touch of lemon juice to the mango for zest.

, Cubed mango can be a fantastic addition to any fruit salad. If you don't want the salad to be overwhelmed by mango juice, drain the mango chunks before adding them to the salad. Here are some suggestions for making a delicious mango salad: :


Make a salad with papaya, apples, and cantaloupe.
Make a salad from mangos and pineapples. Add a pinch of cinnamon for flavor.
Make a salad of mangos, pears, and a few cherries sliced in half.
Eat a salad of mangos and oranges with a touch of lime juice.

, Though you may think mangos work best in fruit salads and desserts because of their sweet and juicy flavor, they can add a perfect kick to almost any main course. Here are a few examples of ways to use mango chunks in main courses:


Create mango salsa just with papaya, avocado, a little bit of lemon juice, and some cilantro. You can put the salsa over chicken, beef, or shrimp, or just use it for potato or plantain chips.
Put the cubes of mango in a burrito.
Use the mango in Caribbean rice or any other foods with a Caribbean flavor.

, Mangos are naturally sweet and would work well in many desserts. Here are some suggestions:


Put cubes of mango into yogurt.
Put cubes of mango into ice cream.
Put the cubes of mango into rice pudding along with some raisins.
You can put the cubes on top of these desserts, or stir them in.

Slice the mango.,
Add the sliced mango to a variety of foods.,
Dry the sliced mango.,
Finished.

",How to Eat a Mango3," Before you slice a mango, be aware that it has a large pit the shape of a giant almond in the center. Slice the mango as you would an apple, but take care to avoid the pit. Cut wedges into the mango that are no more than an inch thick.


Once you're done slicing, you should have several slices of mango with the skin still on, and a pit that still has some skin on it. Here's what to do next:

If you just want to eat the mango, pick up the slices by the skin and eat them. You can try to eat some of the looser skin around the pit, but don't eat the skin too close to the pit because it can be stubborn and will get stuck in your teeth worse than corn-on-the-cob.
If you want to peel the mango, you can pick up the slices by the skin and gently scoop them out with a spoon. If the pieces aren't ripe enough for that, use a knife.



, Though cubed mango is a bit more versatile, fresh sliced mango can spice up many ordinary meals, from desserts to main courses. Make the most of your sliced mango by adding it to the following foods:


Thai mango salad
Sweet and spicy chicken
Chicken with lime and cilantro
Beef teriyaki
Mango, corn, and black bean stew
Mango and pineapple pie

, To do this, cut the mango into thin slices and dry the pieces to get dried mango. For a sour tang, mix the pieces in a ziplock bag with li hing mui powder, or a small amount of citric acid.

Make a simple syrup.,
Get your lemon juice.,
Combine all the ingredients.,
Refrigerate and serve over ice.",How to Eat a Lemon2," Simple syrup is made by dissolving sugar in equal amounts of water. It’s ideal for cold recipes because the sugar stays liquid after it dissolves. To make it, combine the sugar and 1 cup (237 ml) of the water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat and bring the mixture to a low simmer.Once the sugar is fully dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool.






Simple syrup will keep in the fridge for several weeks. To make extra for later, add double the water and sugar and divide when cool.







, While the simple syrup is cooling, squeeze the juice from between five and eight lemons, until you have a full cup (237 ml) of juice.You can either peel the lemons and run them through a juicer, or cut them in half and use a manual juicer to push out the juice.


You can also substitute in lime juice for any or all of the lemon juice if you want to make limeade or lemon-limeade instead.






You can use bottled lemon juice if you don’t want to go through the trouble of squeezing your own, but the results won’t be quite the same because bottled lemon juice doesn’t taste the same as fresh lemon juice.







, In a large pitcher or juice jug, stir together the syrup, the lemon juice, and the last 4 cups (948 ml) of water. Once fully combined, the lemonade is ready. You can also garnish it with:Sprigs of fresh herbs and flowers, such as thyme, basil, rosemary, and lavender






Fresh lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit slices






Pineapple wedges







, Transfer the pitcher of lemonade to the fridge and let it chill for about half an hour.To serve, fill a highball glass with ice and pour the lemonade over the ice. Refrigerate any leftovers for up to a few days.


To turn the lemonade into a lemon soda, mix equal parts lemonade and sparkling water and serve with an extra shot of lemon juice.

Clean and trim the lemons.,
Cut the lemons.,
Salt the lemons.,
Prepare your canning jar.,
Pack the lemons.,
Set the lemons aside to pickle.,
Use in your favorite dishes.",How to Eat a Lemon3," Preserved lemons are made by adding salt to lemons and letting them sit in the salt for several weeks. Preserved lemons are ideal for making salads, dressings, soups, sauces, for cooking with vegetables, and for other dishes. To make them, you will need:


Your ingredients
Some fresh lemon juice
Knife
A one-quart (946-ml) canning jar with lid

, Run your canning jar through the dishwasher, and leave it in there until you're ready to pack the lemons. Wash the lid and ring by hand in hot, soapy water.


If you don’t have a dishwasher, wash the jar by hand in hot, soapy water. Then place it on a baking sheet and into a 225 F (107 C) oven until you're ready to use it., Wash and scrub the lemons with a vegetable brush to clean the rinds. Pat the fruit dry. Cut off the stems and tops (where the stems were) from each of the lemons, but leave the bottom nub intact.


When you cut the lemons, you won’t quarter them the entire way, which is why you leave the bottom nub uncut., Cut each lemon in half, starting at the top. Stop cutting about a half inch (1.3 cm) from the bottom, so that the two halves are still joined at the bottom of the lemon. Then cut each lemon in half again to quarter it, leaving the bottom half-inch of the quarters joined as well.Keeping the lemon quarters attached will help to keep the salt packed inside evenly, and this will ensure they preserve properly.

, Reserve 4 tablespoons (72 g) of the salt. Peel open the lemon quarters and sprinkle the remaining salt over the juicy flesh. When all the lemons have been salted, press the quarters back together.


Salt works as a preservative because it doesn’t allow microbes and bacteria to survive, and these are what would cause the fruit to rot., Remove your canning jar from the dishwasher or oven. If there's any leftover water, dry it with a freshly cleaned towel. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons (36 g) of salt into the bottom of the jar, enough to create a generous layer., Place two or three salted lemons into the canning jar. Press them down firmly so they release their juices. Continue adding more lemons, packing them down as you go to make room, and to juice the lemons.


When you’ve added all your preserved lemons, make sure that the lemons are covered with juice. Add the cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice to the jar if you need more juice to cover the lemons.Sprinkle the tops of the lemons with the remaining salt and put on the lid.

, Transfer the jar of lemons to a warm place, such as a countertop, and let them ripen for 30 days. Turn the jar upside down once or twice every few days to shake up the salt and juices, and prevent everything from settling on the bottom.


After 30 days, the preserved lemons are ready to use., When the lemons are ready, you can remove individual wedges or whole lemons and use them for cooking. Remove a wedge or lemon and rinse off the salt. Remove and discard the seeds and pulp, and use the rind and juices in salads and other recipes.


Preserved lemons will keep for up to a year, unrefrigerated."

Try lemon curd.,
Make some lemon sugar.,
Whip up some lemon icing.,
Use fresh lemon juice.,
Bake a lemon cake.,
Try some lemon pepper seasoning.,
Infuse lemons and olive oil.",How to Eat a Lemon4," Lemon curd is a tart and tangy dessert that can be used as a spread, a topping, or eaten on its own. It goes great with other fruit, can be used as a pie filling, and is an incredible way to enjoy a taste of summer any time of year.

, As the name suggest, lemon sugar is regular sugar that’s been infused with fresh lemon flavor. You can use lemon sugar anywhere you'd use a regular sweetener, but it’s particularly delicious as a topping for cookies and baked goods.

, There are plenty of baked goods that pair well with lemon icing, such as poppy seed cakes, muffins, biscotti, and even fresh fruit or ice cream.

, Lemon juice is packed with vitamins and is very healthy to consume. There are plenty of ways you can use fresh lemon juice in your everyday meals and drinks, including:


Add it to smoothies
Squeeze it on fresh fruit for extra flavor and to prevent browning
Drink it with hot or cold water
Sprinkle it on fish
Add it to salad dressings and sauces
Add lemon juice to baked goods

, Lemon poke cake is a delicious, fresh, and citrusy treat that’s great for celebrating occasions like Easter, birthdays, Mother’s or Father’s Day, or other holidays.


A poke cake is particularly flavorful because you poke holes in the cake that get saturated with frosting, cream, or in the case of this cake, a lemon glaze.

, This seasoning is quick and easy to make, it’s tasty, and it goes great on lots of dishes. You can use lemon pepper seasoning on meat, fish, vegetables, or in soups, salads, and other side dishes.


To change up the flavor of the seasoning for other recipes, you can also use orange or lime zest in the mix.

, Olive oil is a light and flavorful oil that works great as a drizzle or sauce for dishes like salads and pastas. And when you infuse olive oil with lemon, it creates a beautiful and fresh citrusy oil that brings dishes to life.


Lemon olive oil is wonderful in the winter because it brings a taste of summer to your meals.

Reach for low-energy dense foods.,
Fill up with fiber.,
Choose whole fruit instead of juice.,
Add protein.,
Pick healthy fats.,
Don't try to save calories for later.",How to Prepare a Filling Breakfast1," Low-energy dense foods are ones that have a few calories for a large amount of food. High-energy dense foods are the opposite. They have a large number of calories in a small amount of food. If you reach for low-energy dense foods, you'll feel fuller without adding too many calories to your day.Take vegetables and fruits, for example. They have a high water content, so they make you feel fuller for fewer calories, especially compared to something like oil or butter. For example, you could eat a single pat of butter or two cups of broccoli for the same number of calories.
Make sure to add some fruits or vegetables to your breakfast line up. For instance, you could eat a banana, slices of tomato, or pieces of watermelon.;
, Foods that are rich in fiber take longer for your body to digest, keeping you full for a longer period of time. Trying loading up fiber-rich foods with your breakfast. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are particularly high in fiber. Beans are also a good source of fiber.If you're already eating some fruits and vegetables with breakfast, that's great. You could also try adding a piece of 100 percent whole-wheat toast or a bowl of oatmeal for some whole grains.

, Juice has been a staple at many breakfast tables. However, if you're looking to stay full, picking whole fruit is a better option. With juice, you get the nutrients but not the fiber. The fiber in whole fruit will fill you up and help you stay full.However, when you blend whole fruits, such as in a smoothie, you retain the fiber.

, Protein makes you feel full by preventing the release of a hormone called ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry. At breakfast, you should eat about 30 grams of protein to get this effect.Low-fat Greek yogurt and egg whites are both healthy, protein-rich options for breakfast. To get the full 30 grams of protein in your breakfast, you can also try:


One large egg and four ounces of canadian bacon.
One cup of low fat cottage cheese topped with one ounce of nuts and half a cup of berries.
One cup of oatmeal prepared with one and a half cups of soy milk. Top with one and a half ounces of almonds and one tablespoon of hemp seeds.
A tofu scramble made with 3/4 cup tofu and one vegetarian sausage patty. Add an ounce of soy milk on top.

, To really feel full, you should go light on fats because they are high calorie without providing bulk. However, some fat is fine, and when you do reach for fats, healthy fats are best. Look for unsaturated fats for a healthy diet.Unsaturated fats include foods like avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds, corn oil, safflower oil, and ground flaxseed. Many types of fish are also a great source of unsaturated fat, such as tuna, rainbow trout, mackerel, sardines, and bluefish.

, Many dieters avoid eating breakfast, so they have more calories to eat later. However, doing so can lead to you being so hungry later that you overindulge. You'll often eat enough that you're adding more calories to your overall intake rather than saving some. Plus, eating regularly throughout the day helps keep your blood sugars steady, which in turn can lower your cholesterol."

Freeze breakfast burritos.",How to Prepare a Filling Breakfast2," Overnight oats are a quick and easy way to have a solid, nutritional breakfast that will keep you full for hours. The oats have a lot of fiber, and if you add in more protein and maybe some fruit, it will definitely fill you up. You prepare the ingredients in a jar and place it in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, pull it out, and eat it cold.


Try peanut butter and jelly flavored overnight oats. In a bowl, add a cup of old-fashioned oats, 1 1/2 cups (360 milliliters) of almond, soy, or regular milk (low-fat), 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of of peanut butter, a scoop of vanilla protein powder, and a dash of cinnamon.
Combine the ingredients, and let them sit overnight. It makes two servings that you can top with your favorite jam or jelly or even some fresh strawberries., Egg casseroles are a great way to feed a crowd while doing the work ahead of time. You can make many egg casseroles the night before and bake them in the morning for breakfast, keeping things simple in the morning. Plus, they're heavy on protein, and you can add vegetables for extra fiber.For instance, try combining 4 eggs, several dashes of salt, and a dash or two of pepper in a bowl. Whisk the eggs until they are well beaten.
Next, add in a 16-ounce (473 milliliters) container of cottage cheese (low-fat), a frozen 10-ounce (296 milliliters) package of chopped spinach (make sure to thaw it out and squeeze out any liquid), chopped green onions (1 bunch), 1 cup (240 milliliters) of shredded low-fat cheese (cheddar is a good option), 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of whole-wheat flour, and a 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of cooked, crumbled bacon (you can use real bacon bits). For flavor, add 3 tablespoons (44 milliliters) of fresh dill or basil. You can also use 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of dried herbs instead.
Pour the mixture in an 8-inch greased pan, and cover it. Put it in the refrigerator overnight. Let it bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) in the morning.
Try serving this casserole with a side of whole wheat toast or even some whole-grain pancakes for extra protein and some added whole grains. You could also serve it with some fresh fruit and a whole-grain muffin.

, You may be tempted to pick up those frozen breakfast burritos at the grocery store. However, you can make your own at home that at are much more filling and healthier overall. Plus, you'll save some money.Start with large tortillas (in the 10-inch to 12-inch range). Dice and cook two potatoes any way you'd like, as well as a sliced onion, a bell pepper, or any vegetable you'd like. You can roast them by spreading them in a pan, drizzling some olive oil on top along with some salt and pepper, and roasting them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). Scramble and cook a dozen eggs in a pan. Let both fillings cool. You can also cook some turkey breakfast sausage if you'd like.
Lay out the tortillas. Place a scoop of vegetables and a scoop of eggs in each tortilla. Add any other toppings you'd like, including the sausage, a sprinkle of cheese, or a handful of beans. An ounce of cheese, for example, will add up to seven grams of protein.
Roll up the tortillas into burritos. Wrap each one tightly in foil. Freeze them in a single layer, then put them in a gallon-size zip-top bag.
To eat them, take them out of the aluminum foil, then microwave for a minute or two. Try adding a bowl of fruit on the side to make it extra filling.
A glass of low fat milk or soy milk can add up to eight grams of extra protein to this meal.

Try simple peanut butter toast.,
Create a simple egg scramble.,
Make a smoothie.,
Bake eggs in avocados.,
Create your own parfait.,
Try protein-packed pancakes.",How to Prepare a Filling Breakfast3," One quick option for the morning is to pair peanut butter or another nut or seed butter with 100% whole grain toast. Just lightly toast the bread and smear the nut or seed butter on top while it is still warm. Add a sliced banana on top to make it extra filling.This breakfast combines protein (nuts or seeds, plus the whole grains in the bread), fiber (whole grains and the banana), and low-energy dense foods to make it more filling (the banana).
Another good option is spreading a bit of almond butter on toast with a layer of low-fat cottage cheese and a bit of jam on top. Pair it with some fruit to make it even more filling., An egg scramble filled with lots of fresh veggies and a touch of cheese is a great way to get in protein, fiber, and filling veggies. Pair it with a side of fruit or some whole-grain toast, and you're good to go for the morning.Scramble two eggs or three egg whites. Add a bit of butter or oil to a nonstick pan on medium heat, then add in your favorite veggies. You can use onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, or squash. If you're using spinach, hold off on adding it. Let the veggies cook until they're starting to get tender.
Add the eggs into the pan, and stir until the eggs are setting up. Stir in the spinach, cooking until it wilts. Throw in a small dash of low-fat cheese on top.

, Smoothies are an easy way to combine high-fiber foods like fruits and vegetables with high protein-foods like Greek yogurt or peanut butter. You'll need a blender to blend all the ingredients together thoroughly.For instance, try combining a single banana, 5 strawberries or 6 or 7 raspberries, 2 cups (480 milliliters) of spinach, 4 ounces (120 milliliters) of Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of almond butter, and a 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of cannellini beans in a blender. You may need to add some liquid such as water or low-fat milk to thin it out.

, While avocados are high in fat, they are a good fat. Eating them paired with protein and a side of high-fiber carbohydrates (think whole-wheat toast, cut-up fruit, or even slices of tomatoes) should keep you filled up until lunchtime. This breakfast takes about 10 to 12 minutes to bake, but you don't have to watch it the whole time.Slice avocados in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seed with a spoon. Add a dash of hot sauce to each of the halves (if you'd like). Crack an egg in each half, and add a dash of salt and pepper. Add any other condiments you'd like (such as pesto). Bake for 10 minutes or so at 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius), until the yolk is set to your liking.
You can also beat the eggs before pouring them into the avocado.

, A parfait is a simple way to get a filling breakfast in. Start with eight ounces of your favorite Greek yogurt, which is high in protein. Layer it with granola, fresh fruit, and nuts to your liking. You can even add a bit of honey or a scoop of your favorite jam. The yogurt, nuts, and granola all add protein, while the granola and fresh fruit keep you full with fiber.

, Pancakes aren't always considered the most filling, healthy breakfast, but you can add protein to make them more filling. For instance, some recipes add cottage cheese (blended) to the batter to make them more filling.


Try oatmeal-cottage cheese pancakes. In a blender, add 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of old-fashioned rolled oats, 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of low-fat cottage cheese, a couple of tablespoons of low-fat milk (or milk replacement), 1/2 a banana, a dash of vanilla extract, a couple of dashes of cinnamon, and an egg (or 2 egg whites).

Set up your ""mise en place.""",How to Make Healthy Breakfasts the Night Before," Overnight oats are a really quick, nutritious and easy way to make oatmeal. Note that these oats are usually served cold, not hot, so the flavor may take you by surprise. Oats are a whole grain that are high in fiber and protein and will keep you feeling satisfied all morning long. They may even help reduce cholesterol.Mix together 1/2 cup of rolled oats and 1/2 cup of milk in a tupperware or mason jar.
Add in fruit, nuts, seeds, or anything else that you'd like in addition to any sweeteners (honey, maple syrup, agave) or spices. Cover your oats tightly and place in the refrigerator.
The oats will be ready the next morning. You can make a couple of these and keep them in the refrigerator for two or three days.;
, If you crave a bowl of warm oatmeal in the morning, but don't want to spend time making it, try making your oatmeal in a slow cooker the night before.


In the bowl of a slow cooker, mix together 1 cup of oats, 3 cups of water or milk and any flavorings or spices you desire.
Set your slow cooker on low and let cook overnight. It will be ready in six to eight hours. Transferred to a tupperware container, the cooked oatmeal will keep for about four to five days in the refrigerator.
When you're ready to serve yourself a steaming hot bowl of oatmeal in the morning, add a splash of milk if desired and top with fruit, nuts or sweetener (honey, agave nectar, blackstrap molasses or stevia) if you'd like.

, A super simple, super quick breakfast to make in advance is yogurt and fruit parfaits. These are high in protein, calcium, fiber, B vitamins, potassium, and magnesium, and antioxidants from the yogurt and fruit.Choose between either Greek or plain yogurt. Both will work in this recipe; however, Greek yogurt has a significantly higher protein content.Look for natural yogurt without added flavoring, as these can be full of sugar.
In a tupperware or mason jar, spoon in a 1/2 cup of yogurt. On top of the yogurt, place 1/4 cup of cut up fruit (your favorite fruit).
Repeat the first step so you have two layers of yogurt and two layers of fruit.
You may also want to season your yogurt or fruit with honey, cinnamon or even add in a sprinkling of whole grain granola or nuts.
Store your yogurt parfait in the refrigerator sealed. These will stay fresh for at least one week.

, Eggs are a great food to have for breakfast. They're high in protein, health fats and many minerals. When combined with a whole grain English muffin and cheese, you get extra protein and fiber.Make egg sandwiches in advance and freeze or keep a few in the refrigerator, so all you need to do in the morning is heat and serve.


Start by toasting your English muffins. You can toast one or as many as you'd like.
In a small bowl, scramble your eggs. Use one egg for every English muffin you toasted. Scramble in a small frying pan for a few minutes or until cooked.
Layer one slice of your favorite cheese on one half of your English muffin. Top with one scrambled egg. Repeat if you're making multiple sandwiches.
Allow each egg sandwich to cool to room temperature. Then wrap in plastic wrap to put in the refrigerator. Add a layer of aluminum foil on top if you're planning on freezing them.
You can also swap out your English muffin for an 8"" whole wheat tortilla. Wrap all the fillings inside the tortilla, roll, and wrap in plastic wrap. Keep in the refrigerator and heat the next morning.

, If you're not into eating a big breakfast or are not a fan of typical breakfast foods, you may want to make yourself a smoothie instead. You can mix milk, yogurt, fruit and vegetables together for a nutrient-packed breakfast.


The night before, measure out 1/2 cup of liquid (milk, soy milk or even water) and place in the jar of the blender.
Add in 1/2 cup of your favorite yogurt — this could be Greek or plain yogurt (but look for a variety that is low in sugar).
Also add in 1/2 cup of sliced fruit or 1/2 cup of frozen fruit. If you want to add vegetables — like spinach — you can also throw this in as well.
Cover the blender jar with the lid and place in the refrigerator. The next morning, put the blender together and puree until your smoothie is ready to drink.

, Chia seeds are unique in that when mixed with a liquid and allowed to sit for a few hours, they congeal and make a pudding-like consistency. In addition, chia seeds are high in protein and fiber and make a great breakfast food.In a small tupperware or mason jar, mix together 4 tablespoons of chia seeds with 1 cup of milk, soy milk or almond milk.
Also consider adding in a tablespoon of sweetener like honey, maple syrup or agave syrup.
You can also add in 1/2 cup of sliced fruit or flavorings and spices to give your chia seed pudding more flavor.
Cover tightly with a lid and refrigerate overnight. The pudding will set up in a few hours. You can eat this the next morning or save it for another breakfast during the week.

, You'll also need to make sure that you have the appropriate types of storage containers. If you're preparing any type of meal in advance, you'll need to figure out how you're planning to store it safely.


Tupperware containers are a great tool when you're making meals in advance. Most keep foods fresh in the refrigerator and many are also freezer and microwave safe.
Mason jars are a more artistic and unique way to store food. The screw-on lids provide an airtight seal. This is great for items like yogurt, oatmeal or cottage cheese.
Aluminum foil or plastic wrap can help keep foods fresh in the refrigerator. They're not airtight and can leak so make sure to only use these on solid foods-like an egg sandwich.

, It's nice to be able to pull out a nutritious breakfast right from the fridge; however, you can't store pre-cooked food for days on end. Choose the best option for your meal storage-refrigerator or freezer.


Many breakfasts that you'll make might be for the next morning; however, some recipes allow you to make multiple servings that can last you all week. Only make enough servings to last you for about five breakfasts. If you make more you'll need to freeze it.
Only freeze items like egg sandwiches, chia seed puddings, smoothies (blend the frozen smoothie to make smooth again), or oatmeal. Items like yogurt won't freeze well.
If you're choosing to store foods in the refrigerator, store them above any raw meat or seafood. All cooked foods should be stored near the top of the refrigerator where liquids or juices from raw foods cannot contaminate them., If you're short on time in the morning, even for a quick reheat in the microwave, consider bringing your breakfast to your office instead.


Keep your meal cool during transportation to work. This is especially important if you have a fairly long commute. You do not want your food getting too warm — this increases the risk that harmful bacteria will grow.
Use an insulated lunch bag to pack your breakfast. Place a freezer pack or frozen water bottle in your lunch bag to keep your breakfast cold prior to getting to your office.
If you're bringing a liquid to work — like milk for your cereal — consider putting the liquid in a thermos to keep it at the appropriate temperature. Only juices, milk, non-dairy milk or smoothies need to be kept cold.

, If you're planning on making breakfast in advance, you need to make sure you have everything you need in your kitchen to prepare your recipes.


To help you with your grocery list, write up your breakfast meal plan. Write down the breakfasts that you want to make in advance so you can see what ingredients you need to complete the recipes.
Also set aside some time to write up your grocery list. Look at your meal plan and write up your list based on the foods that you need.

, As with any recipe, you need to make sure you have the right cooking utensils or tools to make the recipe. Luckily, breakfast meals are usually pretty simple and require only minimum equipment.


A small sauté or frying pan will be great for small tasks like scrambling eggs.
A toaster will help give a warm crunch to items like bread or English muffins.
Consider purchasing or using a slow cooker or crock pot. You can make items like oatmeal the night before and have a hot breakfast ready the next morning.

, Mise en place is a french cooking term meaning ""set in place."" For quick and efficient cooking, it's important to set up everything you need — both ingredients and equipment — so that you can make your breakfast meals with ease.


Start by preparing one breakfast recipe or meal. It's difficult to try to assemble multiple different recipes all at once.
Get out all the ingredients that you'll need. For example, if you're making oatmeal with apples, lay out the oatmeal, apples, milk, etc.
Also get all your equipment out that you'll need to make your breakfast. You might want to get out your slow cooker and wooden spoon to make oatmeal overnight.

Ground beef is one of the worst things to grill because it contains very high amounts of fat and must be grilled to well-done meaning that not only will there be a lot of flare-ups but the meat will be subject to the burning for a long time.

Bones increase cooking time and should be removed if possible. Some pieces such as chicken drumsticks cannot have the bones removed.
Choose visually smooth cuts of meat without any nooks or crannies. Rough meat causes uneven cooking, and makes more fat drips.

Figs are healthy no matter how you consume them. There are 37 calories for every 8 oz (50 g), and the same amount yields an average of 1.45 g fiber, 116 mg potassium, 0.06 mg manganese, and 0.06 mg vitamin B6.;
, The exact size and color of a ripe fig varies based on the variety, but all varieties are soft when ripe. A ripe fig will give when poked and will have a very potent, sweet smell.


Avoid figs that are hard or ones that have deep rips or bruises. A few small scratches are fine, however, since these will not affect the taste or quality of the fruit.
Also avoid figs that appear to have mold on them or those that smell sour or rotten.
Ripe figs can be green, brown, yellow, or deep purple.
You should use figs as fresh as possible. They can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days after harvest but will begin to spoil past that point.

, Rinse the figs under cool water and gently wipe them dry with clean paper towels.Since figs are so delicate, you should never scrub them with a vegetable brush. Remove any dirt you see by scrubbing it gently with your fingers.
Remove the stems as you wash the figs by gently twisting them off using your fingers.

, Sugar crystals can be removed by sprinkling 1/2 cup (125 ml) figs with 1 tsp (5 ml) water and microwaving them on high for 1 minutes.


Ripe figs often ooze a sugary syrup that can crystallize on the surface. These figs are still good to eat, but for presentation or texture purposes these crystals are usually removed.

, Figs have a mildly sweet taste and can be enjoyed fresh and on their own.


The skin of the fig is edible. As a result, you do not need to peel the fig before eating it. Merely twist off the stem and eat the fig skin and all.
If you do not like the texture of the skin, you can peel it off before eating the fig. After twisting off the stem, carefully use your fingers to peel away the skin starting from the exposed top.
To enjoy the flavor of the interior without removing the skin, simply cut the fig in half. Gently hold the fig with one hand and use a sharp knife to cut it in half lengthwise. This exposes the sweet interior, allowing the taste to come forth immediately as soon as you eat it.

, A common way to serve fresh figs is to enjoy them raw with a little cheese or dairy spread over them. The dairy should be sweet and tangy, however, rather than sharp.


Cut the figs in half and place a dollop of cream cheese over each half.You could use plain cream cheese or flavored cream cheese. This can be served as a snack or simple appetizer.
Melt a piece of blue cheese into the fig. Remove the stems and cut a small ""x"" shape in the top of the fig. Stuff a bit of blue cheese into the cut and bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).
Rich dairy products, like mascarpone and crème fraiche, also work well with the flavor of figs.

, Figs can be poached on the stove or in a slow cooker. Use roughly 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid for every 8 figs.


You could use fortified wine or wine that has been simmered with warm spices, like cinnamon, cloves, or star anise. You could also use fruit juice or flavored vinegars like balsamic vinegar.
Simmer the figs for 10 to 15 minutes on the stove.Cook the figs on low for 23 hours in the slow cooker.Poached figs are often served with yogurt, rich dairy products, or frozen desserts.

, Mix 1 lb (450 g) chopped figs with 1 cup (250 ml) sugar in a saucepan. Cook on low heat for 30 minutes until thick preserves form., Figs can be used in breads, cakes, muffins, and other flour-based baked goods.


Mix with other fruits. For instance, you could add chopped figs to your favorite peach cobbler recipe or add figs to raspberry, lemon, or orange flavored pies and desserts.
Make figs the center of attention. You can also have baked goods that completely rely on the flavor of figs, rather than pairing figs with other fruits. You could make a fig tart or bake chopped figs into pound cake or yogurt cake.
Use as a garnish. Halved or quartered figs make an appealing garnish for cakes and similar desserts. They work especially well on cakes made with rich frostings, like cream cheese frosting, or on cakes flavored with nuts, like an almond cake., Dried figs can be eaten plain, just like raisins or other dried fruits. This is one of the simplest ways to enjoy the fruit as a snack.

, When using dried figs for recipes, you may find it beneficial to rehydrate them so that they become juicier and plumper.


You can soak dried figs in water or fruit juice overnight.
A more thorough method of rehydrating figs is to simmer them for several minutes in water or fruit juice.
When using either method, add just enough liquid to cover the layer of figs.

, Both dried and rehydrated figs can be used in baked good recipes.


Gravitate toward breads, cakes, muffins, and cookies over pies and tarts. Mix the dried figs into the batter of these flour-based baked goods before baking.
Replace other dried fruits with dried figs. Instead of making oatmeal raisin cookies, make oatmeal fig cookies. Instead of adding dried tart cherries to a muffin batter, add dried figs.

, Another simple way to enjoy dried figs is to simply sprinkle a few over hot breakfast cereal. The figs will add a mildly sweet boost of flavor.

, For a light lunch, you could mix a handful of dried figs into a serving of cottage cheese or yogurt. These rich, tangy dairy products complement the taste of figs rather well.

Turn your donut into a sandwich.",How to Eat a Donut," Dry yeast has a specific temperature that’s ideal for proofing. To activate the yeast, transfer the milk to a saucepan. Heat the milk over medium heat, stirring regularly, until it reaches 110 F (43 C).When it reaches that temperature, remove the pan from the heat.


Proofing is the final stage before baking, when you let a yeast-based product rise and grow into the right shape.;
, Pour ¾ cup (176 ml) of the warm milk into a medium mixing bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (9 g) of the yeast. Stir the mixture with a spoon to dissolve the yeast. Add ¾ cup (95 g) of the flour. Stir the mixture into a paste. Place it on top of the refrigerator for 30 minutes.You want to put the yeast somewhere warm to rise, which is why the top of the refrigerator is a good choice.
Reserve the remaining quantities of these ingredients for later.

, Transfer the yeast mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in the reserved teaspoon (3 g) of yeast and the ¼ cup (59 ml) of milk. Add the egg yolks and vanilla.Use the paddle attachment and mix the ingredients on low speed for 30 seconds to create a smooth dough. Turn off the mixer.


If you don’t have a stand mixer, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix the batter.

, Pour in another cup (127 g) of the flour. Add the sugar and salt. Mix the batter on medium speed for another 30 seconds, until the dough comes together. Turn the mixer off.It’s important to turn the mixer off between additions because you don’t want to overmix the batter. Overmixing will develop the gluten in the flour, which will make your donuts chewy and dense rather than light and fluffy.

, Cut the room temperature butter into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes. Add the cubes to the dough. Turn the mixer on and mix the dough on medium speed for an additional 30 seconds, until the butter is fully incorporated into the dough. Turn the mixer off.

, Remove the paddle attachment from the mixer and replace it with the dough hook. Add more flour in ¼-cup (32-g) increments. Mix the dough on medium speed. Add enough flour to make a smooth, moist dough ball that doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl.You may not need to use the full amount of flour to get the right dough consistency.
If you don’t have a stand mixer, turn the dough out onto a clean flat surface and knead the extra flour in with your hands.

, Cover the top of the mixing bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap. Transfer the dough to a warm place and let it rest for about 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the plastic wrap. Press gently on the dough to push out air and gasses. Recover the bowl and transfer the dough to the refrigerator for at least one hour.You can leave the dough to chill for up to 12 hours before making the donuts.

, Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured flat surface. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a large circle that’s ½ inch (1.3 cm) thick.Use a 3-inch (7.6-cm) diameter cookie or donut cutter to punch out as many donuts as possible.


When you’ve punched out all the donuts you can, collect the dough scraps. Roll them into a ball, and roll the dough out again into a circle with the same thickness as the original. Punch out as many donuts as you can.
With any leftover dough, roll the dough into half-inch (1.3-cm) balls to make donut holes.

, Place a clean lint-free towel onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle flour over the towel. Transfer the donuts to the baking sheet, leaving an inch (2.5 cm) of space between each donut. Lay a sheet of plastic loosely over the donuts and transfer them to a warm place to rise for an hour.A good warm place to proof the donuts is an oven that’s turned off but with the light on.

, Fill a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed saucepan with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of cooking oil, such as canola or coconut. Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 360 F (182 C). Transfer as many donuts to the oil as you can fit into the fryer or pan. Fry the donuts for one to two minutes. Flip the donuts and cook for another one to two minutes.


The donuts are ready when they're golden brown on both sides.
You may need to work in batches to fry all the donuts and the donut holes.

, When the donuts are cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove each one from the oil. Transfer the donuts to a paper-towel lined wire cooling rack. Let the donuts cool for at least 20 minutes before glazing, adding your favorite toppings, or eating plain.


To add an extra bit of sweetness to the donuts without glazing them, dust them with confectioner’s sugar after about 30 minutes., Donuts are considered finger food, so it is acceptable to eat them without utensils. Pick up the donut with one hand. If you find the donut is too large, sticky, or hard to hold, use both hands to hold it like a sandwich.


To keep your hands clean while you eat, you can wrap the bottom of the donut in a napkin or piece of waxed or parchment paper.

, Many donuts come topped with things like sprinkles and other goodies. To prevent these from falling off while you're eating, hold the donut with two hands and keep the top level with the table as you eat.

, Bring the whole donut to your mouth and take a small bite. Pull the donut away from your mouth while you chew and swallow your bite. Eating a donut isn't a dainty task, but you should take small bites to avoid stuffing your mouth too full or choking.

, Some donuts have cream or jam fillings stuffed inside. These fillings can come oozing out when you bite into the center of the donut. You can suck out some of the filling if it’s dripping everywhere. Wipe your face with a napkin if you get any crumbs or filling around your mouth.

, Donuts are often eaten with a drink, and the liquid can help wash down the doughy treat. If you do have a drink, take sips in between bites when you get thirsty. Popular drinks for donut-eating include:Hot chocolate
Milk
Coffee
Tea

, Dunking is acceptable to do at home and in non-formal settings. To dunk your donut, bring the entire donut to your cup and dip a bite-sized piece of donut into the liquid. Hold it there for one to two seconds, which is long enough to saturate the donut but not so long that a piece will break off. Bite off the dunked portion of donut and eat it.


This works best for donuts that don’t have toppings. To dunk a topped donut, tear off a bite-sized piece of donut with your fingers and dunk the individual piece into the liquid.

, When you make your own donuts, you can customize them any way you like. One popular way of serving and eating donuts is with a glaze, which is a thin icing that you can drizzle on donuts, cookies, cakes and other desserts.


When the donuts are still warm, drizzle generous amounts of glaze over each donut, or dip each donut into the glaze to coat it completely.

, You can finish a donut with any toppings you like. One of the most popular toppings is sprinkles, but you can experiment with any candy or other add-ons. To top a donut properly, add a glaze or icing first that will act as a glue to hold the toppings in place. Some of the more creative toppings you can try include:Cereal
Candy-coated chocolates
Crushed cookie pieces
Candied fruit

, Any donut that doesn’t have the middle hole missing can be filled and stuffed with sweet treats like chocolate filling. Other popular fillings for donuts include:Custards and creams
Vanilla frosting
Jellies, jams, and preserves
Chocolate-hazelnut spread
Cream cheese frosting

, Donuts are dough products just like bread, so you can get creative with your donuts by using them as a substitute for bread. Cut the donut in half to separate the top from the bottom. Add your favorite sandwich toppings to the bottom of the donut, and top the whole thing with the donut top. Sandwich filling options include:Meat and cheese
Peanut butter and jam
Eggs and bacon
Strawberries and cream
Marshmallows and chocolate
Ice cream

Have some napkins handy.,
Ball up your foil.,
Don’t try to eat a burrito while walking.If the burrito isn’t wrapped tight enough, it will leak all over.,
Consider a knife and fork.,
Turn the burrito on its side if you puncture it.,
Cut it in half while it is still wrapped.",How to Eat a Burrito," The foil is going to be your key to keeping the burrito from falling apart while you eat it. The tortilla alone may not be wrapped tightly enough to hold all the ingredients in., A well-wrapped burrito should be able to stand up on its own, but this is not necessary for your enjoyment.

, Open the foil at the top end. Peel around the burrito like you are unwrapping a roll of lifesavers candy, but do not completely unwrap it. Tear off the loose piece of foil and set it aside. The remaining foil will secure the bottom of the burrito maintain its structural integrity as you eat it.


If you do end up completely unwrapping the burrito you can try to use the foil as a holder by rewrapping some of it around the bottom.

, Grab your burrito with both hands to keep it stable. If you're not in a fancy restaurant, you can keep the burrito on the table and lean in to bite it in the early stages. Eventually you’ll have to lift it to your mouth.


When lifting it from the table to bite, keep it in both hands.
Don’t squeeze the burrito too tightly. You run the risk of puncturing the tortilla.

, Most burritos are too big for you to be able to fit its entire girth in your mouth without choking. Your best bet is to start off at one of the corners.Biting the burrito in the middle will just cause the contents to spill out.

, Take even bites working to keep the top of the burrito level.

, Every second you hold the burrito suspended above the table you run the risk of it falling apart. The foil will do its job, but while you’re chewing, it’s best to set the burrito back down. Keep your hands on it to prevent it from falling over.

, As you make your way further down the burrito, being sure to keep the bites even, tear off about an inch more of the foil and set it aside., Eating the burrito properly should limit mess and spillage, but it can still be dirty business. Make sure you have some napkins or Wet Naps ready nearby., As you tear away strips of foil from the burrito, ball them up together rather than just letting them sit. This way you won’t have a lot of debris on your table that could blow away or create clutter.

, You’ll have a hard time keeping cleaning and managing to eat without the entire thing falling apart. Take a seat and enjoy.

, If you are careful, you shouldn’t have any spillage while eating your burrito. However, sometimes you can’t help it and some of the filling might escape onto you plate. Have some utensils handy so you don’t have to use your hands to scoop up lost filling as it can be very messy.


Some burritos come with cheese and sour cream on top of them. In this case the burrito will most likely not be wrapped but come in some kind of container. Here you’ll have to knife and fork it if the burrito is too large or too messy to pick up with your hands.

, A hole in the side of your burrito can get messy fast. If this happens, turn the burrito on its side. You might want to use a knife and fork until you eat down to the hole and can again even out the top and go back to eating with your hands.

, If you are sharing your burrito, or if you are just worried about wielding the whole thing on your own, you can cut it in half. Your best bet is to keep it wrapped up when you do this so that the tortilla won't unfold.


You can eat the burrito half the same way, pulling the foil down as you eat.
A halved burrito is more prone to spillage. Definitely have a fork handy to scoop up lost filling.

Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper if desired.
If you aren’t using parchment paper or a non-stick baking sheet, grease the baking sheet.;
, Mix them in the small bowl and set the mixture aside to let it foam for a couple minutes.

, Use the medium bowl and the wooded spoon to mix the two until they form a smooth, creamy batter. Add the baking soda–vinegar mixture and the vanilla. Stir to combine.


For a deeper, richer sweetness, try brown sugar instead of white sugar.
For a smooth, nutty cookie, substitute half the butter for peanut butter, almond butter, or your favorite nut butter.

, Once you’ve added all the flour, stir the mixture until it comes together to form a nice dough. If necessary, knead it with your hands to bring the last of it together.Possible additional ingredients can be added now, such as:


Chocolate or carob chips
Raisins, cranberries, or other dried fruit
Nuts, including almonds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, macadamias, or pistachios

, Use tablespoon-sized balls of dough, leaving one to two inches between the dough to allow the cookies to spread out. Bake for 15 minutes. When the cookies are ready, transfer them to a wire cooling rack and allow them to cool to room temperature.

, There are thousands of kinds of cookies throughout the world, and everyone has a different idea about what makes a perfect cookie. Some people prefer them chewy while others like them crunchy. Others still like chunky, versus those who prefer soft and smooth. There are also different styles and flavors, and it’s up to you to find your favorite!


If you have food allergies, watch out for cookies that contain common allergens, such as soy, egg, nuts, dairy products, or anything else that might cause a reaction.

, Although there are lots of special ways to eat a cookie, you can also simply eat the cookie. Cookies can be picked up with your hands. Some cookies are bite-sized and meant to be eaten in one bite, but for most cookies, take small bites. Always chew your food thoroughly.


To prevent choking and to help your body digest food more easily, you should chew soft foods about 10 times and hard foods up to 30 times before swallowing., Cookies are often served with a hot or cold beverage, such as tea, milk, hot chocolate, or coffee. To wash your cookie down with a beverage, finish chewing and swallowing your bite of cookie, then take a sip of your beverage.

, Your beverage can also be used for dunking, which should be reserved for informal settings like at home or at a friend’s house Try not to dunk cookies in a formal setting, like at a dinner party or a fine-dining restaurant. To dunk a cookie:


Hold the cookie by one end and dip the other end into a glass of milk, tea, or the like.
Hold the cookie in the liquid for a few seconds: long enough for it to absorb some of the liquid, but not so long that the cookie begins to break apart.
Put the wetted cookie portion into your mouth and bite it off. You can now eat the rest of the cookie normally, or continue dunking.
When you no longer have enough cookie left, avoid dunking your fingers into your beverage to soak your cookie. Instead, eat the remainder of the cookie and wash it down with your beverage. You’ll likely find some tasty cookie bits at the bottom!

, Cookie sandwiches, such as Oreos, have two layers of cookie separated by icing or jam. To peel these layers apart to get at the icing in between, grab each layer of the cookie with a different hand. Place your fingertips around the circumference of each cookie layer. Gently twist as you pull the layers away from each other.


Eat or dunk the top layer of cookie (the one that doesn’t have any icing).
You can lick off the icing from the other layer, or eat or dunk it normally.

, Raw cookie dough that doesn’t contain eggs is safe to eat raw,and can be eaten alone or added to other desserts. To make cookie dough balls:


Divide your favorite cookie dough into tablespoon-sized bits. Use your hands to roll the dough bits into small balls. Chill them in the fridge before serving to prevent them from becoming too soft and doughy.
Use the dough balls immediately, or store them in an air-tight container in the freezer for up to 12 months., Cookie dough balls can be added to many forms of ice cream, including sundaes and milkshakes. To add them to a bowl of ice cream, let the ice cream sit for a few minutes to soften up. When it’s soft enough, add the desired amount of cookie dough balls to the bowl and mix them into the ice cream. Serve in a bowl with a spoon, or transfer to a cone.


To add cookie dough to a milk shake, add the balls after the milk shake has been blended, otherwise they will be blended up and lost in the milk shake.

, Cookie dough can be made into cookie dough truffles by simply adding a chocolate coating.Use a double boiler to melt one cup of chocolate chips. When the chips are melted, remove them from the heat.


You can use dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, or even butterscotch chips to make the truffle coating.
Coat the cookie dough balls. One at a time, roll each cookie dough ball in the chocolate to coat completely. Transfer the chocolate-covered cookie dough balls to a parchment-lined cookie sheet.
When you’ve covered all the balls, transfer the cookie dough truffles to the freezer to let the chocolate set. Serve cold.

, Bake your favorite basic cookies and allow them to cool. Flip over half the cookies so the tops are facing down and the bottoms up. Cover the cookie bottoms with your favorite filling, then place another cookie on top with the top facing up. Popular filling choices include:


A one-inch layer of ice cream
A thin layer of icing
A thin layer of peanut butter and jam

It's usually best to follow your recipe's cooking instructions to cook the corn dog correctly.


Ensure you cook the corn dogs for the correct amount of time. Cooking it for too long will cause it to burn and blacken, but not cooking it enough will leave the insides raw and gooey.Most recipes fry corn dogs in oil because it's the way they're made at fairs and carnivals. Frying corn dogs leaves you with a golden brown, crispy-coated crust.

, In order to make a corn dog, wooden skewers (also called corn dog sticks) are used to handle and hold it.The wooden skewers should have one pointed edge to poke the hot dog with, and another edge that's not pointed to hold it well. It's usually best to get size 8.75 inch (4.5 mm) for a whole hot dog used in a corn dog.Instead of wooden skewers, large lollipop sticks can be used instead. They're not as sturdy as wooden skewers, but they work just as well., It's important to dip the hot dogs completely with batter for the corn dogs to come out completely covered and golden brown. Dunking the hot dogs in a bowl is usually difficult to do, since it's harder to completely cover it. It's highly encouraged to pour the batter in a mason jar or tall glass for easier dipping.When dipping the hot dog, dunk just enough until it's completely covered with batter. The hot dog should not show at all.
After dipping the hot dog, gently twirl the hot dog around and rub it against the jar or glass to get rid of any excess batter.

, In order to eat a corn dog, it needs to be held by its stick. Use the hand you eat with to hold onto the stick, a similar procedure followed when holding a popsicle.


This step may not apply to you if you're eating corn dog bites or mini corn dogs since they don't have a stick poked through them.

, Bite into the corn dog while you hold onto the stick. You'll be able to enjoy the sweet cornmeal batter that's covered on your favorite frankfurter., Keep biting and chewing onto the corn dog until there is nothing left but the stick. A corn dog should be eaten until it's completely gone., A corn dog is delicious when eaten with other condiments. The most popular condiments are usually tomato ketchup and mustard, but mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, cheese sauce, and ranch can work as well.Try the corn dog with a variety of condiments to find one you like the most.
You can either dunk the corn dog in condiments or drizzle them on top., A corn dog can be topped with many other foods that make it taste even more delicious. Try sprinkling on some cooked or raw vegetables (potatoes, broccoli, pickles, garlic, peppers, etc.), shredded or melted cheese, sesame seeds, and any other desired toppings.Be creative!

, Eating only a corn dog as a meal is usually not very filling for yourself or for a group. A corn dog can be enjoyed with a variety of side dishes to make a whole meal. Some meals you can make alongside a corn dog include onion rings, french fries, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, or coleslaw.


Many fried foods go great with corn dogs, since they're a type of fried food as well. Make a few fried foods to go alongside corn dogs while you eat them.

Decide what beans you want.,
Buy the beans.,
Open the can.,
Pour the beans into a pan.,
Cook the beans.,
Cook something on the side.,
Serve them up.",How to Eat a Can of Beans," If there's a certain company that you really love, you may wish to buy their beans. Otherwise, you might want to experiment with different brands of beans. Different companies might have different size beans, beans from different parts of the world or beans in different sauces which create certain flavors. If you're on a tight budget, most supermarkets do their own brands of beans which are quite cheap.;
, Now that you've decided exactly what kinds of beans you want, go to your local supermarket and purchase these beans. If they do not have them particular types of beans in store, you might have to compromise for a different brand which could be cheaper or more expensive. Before you go out shopping for beans, check in your cupboards to see if you have any left over cans that you didn't know about.

, Using a can opener - and being extra careful not to cut yourself! - open the can of beans. They will usually be in a metal tin so you won't be able to open them any other way. However, there is a ring pin on the top of some cans similar to the ones that are on drink cans. If your tin of beans has this kind of mechanism, open it the same way that you'd open a drink.

, After you've opened the tin of beans, find yourself a small frying pan. It doesn't have to be big because it will only be holding some beans. If you're cooking more than one tin of beans, get a bigger frying pan. Simply pour the beans into it and lightly tap the bottom of the tin to get any remaining beans out of it. If there's a bean stuck at the bottom, scrape it out with a spoon.

, Every can of beans is different so every can of beans has to be cooked slightly differently. Read the label on the tin for exact cooking directions. As a general rule, cook the beans for about five to ten minutes on a high heat, constantly stirring them so they don't get stuck. When they get very hot and start to bubble, that's when they're cooked. Don't overcook them though as they could all dry up and taste nasty.

, Beans could be a little boring on their own. To make them a little more interesting, cook something on the side. Beans go great on toast, so put some bread in the toaster. Other things that go well with toast include eggs, sausages and bacon. If you're a really good cook, you can even cook everything and make yourself a great breakfast. If you're not good with multitasking, ask a friend or sibling to help you out.

, When you're sure that your beans are one hundred percent cooked, pour them into a bowl. Grab a spoon, sit down and tuck in. As an alternative, you could pour them onto a large plate and put your bacon, eggs, sausages and/or toast next to them. If you're having more than just beans, using a knife and fork instead of a spoon might be a better idea.

Cut it up.,
Hold it correctly.,
Do not squeeze it too hard.,
Chew with your mouth closed.,
Don't talk with your mouth full.",How to Eat a Burger," Instead of trying to take a bite out of the burger as a big whole, cut it into halves or even quarters. Then, you can pick up the smaller pieces and eat those. You won't get that ""condiment smile"", where the ketchup, mustard, etc. is smothered all across your cheeks.;
, If, however, you'd prefer to eat the burger without cutting it up, be sure to hold it correctly. Grab the burger with both hands. A one handed ""cool"" look is when you get into trouble. However, it is helpful if you are eating in a vehicle or on the go. The best option is to have some sort of napkin, waxed paper, or wrapper, and wrap it around the lower portion of the burger. This will prevent juices and condiments from leaking out of the bottom of the sandwich.

, If you do that, that is when the juices start to get all over you. If you hold your burger correctly, you'll prevent any grease drippings from leaking out, and your condiments won't squish onto your clothes.

, Nobody wants to see chewed-up hamburger working its way around your mouth. It's not only rude but unappetizing for the other person. Avoid taking large bites as this will make it harder to chew with a closed mouth.

, For the same reason as above, this is a no-no. Try not to talk in between bites, this often distracts you, and then the burger starts dripping all over you. There is also the chance that food could fall out of your mouth, which is very unpleasant. Your dining partner won't like having little hamburger bits spit into their face. It sounds disgusting because, well, it is!

Choose a dining spot.",How to Eat a Bowl of Cereal," The amount of cereal you pour depends completely on your appetite. A big, heaping bowl of cereal may keep you full for hours, and a little bowl can be a great snack. Be careful not to overflow the bowl, because you still need room for your milk.


If you are health-conscious or unsure what a proper portion size is, check the nutrition label on the side of the box. The recommended portion size will be listed there.
Once you’ve poured your cereal, make sure you close the bag or the box completely so that your cereal doesn’t go stale. You can also place the remaining cereal into a tupperware or cereal keeper to prolong its life.;
, When it comes to this step, everyone has a personal preference. Begin pouring slowly, until the cereal begins to float a bit. If you want your cereal to have only a bit of moisture and retain its crunch, pour a small amount. If you love soupy cereal and slurping the excess milk at the bottom, pour away!

, Some people add a bit of fruit to their bowl of cereal, like chopped up banana, strawberry slices, or blueberries. If your cereal could use a little pizazz, add some cinnamon or sugar. Be creative! You can add anything that you want to your cereal, particularly if it's bland on its own.

, This is an important aspect of cereal-eating. If you eat your bowl of cereal pretty quickly, it will still have a bit of crunch. If you take your time, savoring each bite, the cereal will gradually get softer. Eat however slowly or quickly you want to. Just make sure you’re enjoying your bowl of cereal fully.

, Once you’ve eaten all your cereal, you will likely still have a little bit of milk at the bottom of your bowl, especially if you poured a lot. There’s no need to waste this delicious and now cereal-flavored liquid. You have a few options for this.


You can pick up your bowl with two hands and drink your milk.
You can add a little bit of cereal to eat with the remaining milk.

, Whether you've chosen to make oatmeal, cream of wheat, grits, or another type of hot cereal, they will all have specific cooking instructions. Make sure you read the packaging it came in to understand how you need to cook it. When it comes to hot cereal, there are usually options for people who love cooking and options for people who don't want to put much effort into making it., After you've cooked your hot cereal, you can add some fun flavorings and toppings to it. For oatmeal, you can add things like brown sugar, nuts, fruit, or even chocolate chips. Add butter to cream of wheat or grits for a savory breakfast, or even pop an entire egg into it. Adding a dollop of peanut butter onto hot cereal is a great option, as the heat from the hot cereal will warm the peanut butter, allowing it to melt and blend well. Adding cinnamon and sugar to any of your hot cereal options can make a sweet, delicious breakfast., Let it cool before diving in, because burning your mouth is a painful way to start your day. If you're eager to begin eating, blow on each bite before popping it in your mouth. If you've added yummy mix-ins and toppings, make sure to stir them throughout your hot cereal so that you have some left for your final bites.


Hot cereal can stick to the sides of your bowl, so make sure you scrape your spoon along the sides to get every bit.

, If you have ever walked down the breakfast cereal aisle, you probably know that the options are endless. Different types of cereals will give you very different breakfasts. Some are sweet and packed with sugar, while others are healthier and packed with whole grains and fiber. Not all cereals are created equally, so it’s good to explore your options.


Colorful, sweet cereal can almost taste like dessert for breakfast. These types of cereal include Fruit Loops, Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisps, Trix, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. While these kid-friendly cereals may certainly taste yummy, they’re chock full of sugar and should be eaten in moderation.For a healthier option, look for cereals that are high in fiber and list a whole grain ingredient first. Higher protein content is a plus, because it will keep you full longer. Total, Cheerios, Life, Kix, and Raisin Bran are all great choices.Don't forget to look at hot cereals. These include oatmeal, grits, cream of wheat, rice, quinoa, and more! Most come in various breakfast flavors, but you can also select plain versions and add your own mix-ins and toppings.Granola and muesli are also healthy, filling options. You can learn how to make muesli here, and learn how to make granola here!

, Just like cereal, you have a lot of options. Between the different types of cow’s milk, lactose-free milk, and nondairy milk, you will likely find something that works perfectly with your cereal of choice.


Cow’s milk is the standard milk that most people think of when they hear the word. The types you’ll see in the normal grocery store are whole milk, 2% milk, 1% milk, and skim milk. Whole milk tastes richer and has 3.25% fat. Both 2% milk and 1% milk have had their fat reduced (to 2% and 1%, respectively). Skim milk is 0% fat, and tastes the least rich, but has the fewest calories as well. You can choose amongst cow’s milk depending on your personal taste preference and diet.Lactose-free milk is perfect for anyone who gets stomach discomfort after drinking milk. Many people are lactose intolerant, and cannot break down the lactose in milk. Lactose-free milk is regular milk that has been combined with lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. This prevents the gastrointestinal problems that arise from a lactose intolerance.Dairy-free milk is another excellent option for anyone who doesn’t like the taste of cow’s milk, follows a vegan diet, or simply wants something different. Almond milk is the most popular non-dairy milk, and it even comes in different flavors like vanilla and chocolate. Coconut milk, soy milk, flax milk, cashew milk, and several others are also on the market as non-dairy milk alternatives., One way to add some flavor, texture, or health benefits to your breakfast cereal is to throw in a little something extra. Fruit, like blueberries and bananas, will add various beneficial vitamins and nutrients. Adding nuts can add a nice crunch to your cereal, as well as protein. Adding a dollop of nut butter, like peanut butter or almond butter, can add some healthy fat and protein. Cinnamon can add a big punch of flavor to your morning meal, and it has the added benefit of being virtually calorie-free., You can always grab your average cereal bowl, but there are other options. If you’ve woken up with a voracious appetite, you may want to find the biggest bowl you can. Big mixing bowls can do the trick. If you’re not particularly starving, you can use a tinier bowl, such as the ones used for side salads.


Feel free to get creative and use coffee mugs, Tupperware, or other containers to eat your cereal. Don’t feel confined to the bowl.

, The spoon you choose can have a big effect on your cereal eating experience. A smaller spoon means smaller bites, so it will take you longer to eat your cereal. Eating slowly can help prevent overeating, so a small spoon is great for anyone on a diet or just trying to eat lightly. On the contrary, a bigger spoon means bigger bites. If you’re hungry and ready to shovel in some cereal, grab a big spoon.

, For a more formal cereal experience, set your place at your dining room or kitchen table. You can use a placemat, put a napkin in your lap, and “enjoy” a proper meal. For a more relaxed breakfast, eat your cereal in front of the television, while you’re at the computer, or even in bed!


If you’re really crunched for time, pour your cereal and milk into a travel mug. Bring a plastic spoon and eat your cereal while you’re in the car, on a bus, or walking to school.

Be quiet.",How to Chew Gum," Do you want a stick of gum, a tab of gum, or even a gumball? Different brands come in different shapes and sizes, and you can experiment to find out which one you prefer.Brands like Extra and Wrigley market their gum in sticks, while Orbit, Trident, and Eclipse come in smaller tabs or mini-sticks. Double Bubble makes candy gum balls, and Big League Chew sells their gum shredded in a pouch.There is a kind of chewing gum for everyone!;
, Does your breath need freshening? If so, you should look for a minty flavor that will leave your mouth feeling sparkling clean. Try something like spearmint or peppermint and you’ll feel like you just brushed. If you want something with more of a fruity kick, there are flavors like berry and watermelon that will do the trick. People looking to satisfy a sweet tooth should check out the Extra Dessert Delights- those flavors include treats like rainbow sherbet, mint chocolate chip, and strawberry shortcake!, Regular gum contains sugar, which can lead to increased tooth decay.Sugar-free gum uses chemical sweeteners, such as aspartame.. There is a caloric difference of about 5 calories between the two types.If you're opting for sugar-free gum, look for gum with a seal from the American Dental Association. The ADA Seal on a package of gum means that gum has been proven to be healthy and safe., This step may look different depending on the type of gum you’ve selected. If you have chosen a stick of gum, you might fold the piece in half as you pop it into your mouth. With smaller tabs, you might even place two in your mouth at once. If you’ve chosen a giant gumball, you may opt to bite off half.

, You may need to chew a bit more vigorously to loosen up a new piece of gum. Use your big teeth in the back of your mouth, called your molars, to chew. Molars are the teeth associated with chewing because of their flatter surfaces., This will ensure that one side of your mouth doesn’t get tired from the repetitive chewing motion. Occasionally, draw the gum to the front of your mouth and exercise your biting teeth. This will give your molars a short break.

, If you are not in a formal setting, you can try blowing bubbles. Enjoy the flavor that you’ve chosen. As you chew, the flavoring agents in the gum will gradually dissolve and be swallowed, so eventually the gum loses its flavor completely., Urban legend suggests that swallowed gum remains in your stomach for years, but this isn’t factual. Gum is passed through your digestive tract into your stool. However, frequently swallowing your gum can lead to constipation and other minor stomach issues, so it isn’t recommended. The easiest thing is to just spit it out once you are finished.

, Because the gum is still sticky, it can make a big mess if you don’t discard it properly. It’s a good idea to save your gum wrapper so that you can wrap your gum in it when you’ve finished. If you didn’t save the wrapper, just wrap it in a tissue or a scrap of paper.

, Place the unwrapped gum in your hand and casually bring your hand to your mouth, as if to cover your yawn. Pop the gum into your open mouth. This trick is useful if you're in a place where gum is prohibited, such as a classroom. You’re probably already yawning in school anyways, so this is an easy cover-up for sticking some chewing gum in your mouth.

, Chewing gum is typically a little bit harder and tougher when you first put it in your mouth, but you will attract attention if you are vigorously chewing. Let the gum sit on your tongue while it naturally softens from your saliva. You can still enjoy the flavor of the gum by sucking on it.

, Make sure that your jaw is not tensing visibly as you do this. It is important to make tiny movements with your teeth with your mouth closed, so that the chewing is extremely discreet.


If you have trouble chewing inconspicuously, it can help to cup your face with your hand as you chew. It will appear like you are casually resting your face in your hand, while actually concealing a moving jaw.

, This should be obvious, but many people chomp and pop their gum loudly without even realizing it. Not only will loud chewing be a dead giveaway if you are somewhere that gum is prohibited, it can also be extremely irritating to the people around you. Be mindful of the noise you make while chewing gum and practice chewing quietly with your mouth closed.

Coat your mouth with dairy products.,
Have a shot of alcohol.,
Try a spoonful of sugar.,
Eat chocolate.,
Use bread as a sponge.",How to Cool off Your Mouth After Eating Something Hot1," Dissolve the spices' capsaicin with the casein protein found in milk.If you’re at home, fetch yourself a glass of milk pronto. If you're at a restaurant, flag the server down and order one right away. Or, if a yogurt dish has been served as a side to your meal, treat your mouth to a spoonful, since the dairy in that will work, too.Ice cream works even better, since the “ice” provides some blissful relief, while the “cream” provides something more or less solid to suck on for a while before it melts.;
, Pour yourself an ounce of hard liquor. Knock your shot back without swallowing. Swish the liquid around in your mouth. Unless the liquor has been chilled beforehand, the heat-on-heat sensation may feel unpleasant at first, but rest assured that the alcohol is dissolving the capsaicin and ridding your nerves of the agitating agent.Use hard liquor rather than beer or wine. The alcohol itself is needed to actually get rid of the capsaicin, so pour yourself something with a high content. Most liquors average around 40% alcohol content, while beer is typically less than 10% with wine only reaching 20% at its highest.If you’re not a drinker, don’t worry. Go ahead and spit the liquor out once you’re done rinsing your mouth with it. There is no need to swallow.

, If you’re at home, fetch the sugar bowl. If you’re at a restaurant, rip open a packet. Soak up the spice with the granules by either dumping the sugar right into your mouth,or by mixing a tablespoon with 8 ounces of water for sweet relief.Honey works just as well.

, Suck on milk chocolate if you have it, since this will contain casein, the protein in milk that dissolves capsaicin. If all you have is dark chocolate with no dairy content, fall back on that. It will be less effective, but the fat content will absorb some of the spice., Grab a roll from the bread bowl or a couple slices from your bread box. It won’t break the capsaicin down, so don’t keep it in your mouth for too long. Chew it up as you’d normally eat a hunk of bread. Let it absorb the spice in your mouth, then swallow or spit it out.If you have olive oil on hand, dip the bread in that, since olive oil will dissolve the capsaicin. Peanut butter will as well, so you can also try making a sandwich.
Other starchy foods, like french fries, may also do the trick. Just be sure they’re not spicy, too!

What are your long-term goals? Do you simply hope to live more sustainably by growing your own food and finding your place in your community? Or do you hope to become completely self-sufficient, growing your own food and living entirely ‘off the grid’? Whether you want to buy a 26-acre plot of land, or simply make your suburban home more sustainable, you will have to set goals and take time to make a plan. following steps will help you to learn the basics of homesteading, but you will also have to personalize your homestead and make it fit your goals.It is really helpful to talk to someone (or several people) that have already begun their homesteads. They will be able to offer you advice.;
, Part of homesteading is the concept of ‘living off the grid.’ In particular, renewable energy methods are important when planning out your homestead. Consider building your own solar panels, investing in wind turbines, or various hydropower systems. Consider harvesting wood from your property to burn for heat in the winter.You could also consider using alternative fuel sources such as biomass, Ethanol, or biodiesel.


, If you are planning on living self-sufficiently, you will need to winterize your home so that your homestead is comfortable in the winter. This is particularly important for those homesteaders living in colder climates. If you do not winterize your home but plan on heating your home, you will waste a good deal of energy trying to keep your house warm.

, A large part of homesteading is growing a garden that you can reap the benefits of (and feed your family with.) If you raise farm animals, particularly cows (which are covered in Part Two of this article) then you will have plenty of rich fertilizer to go around. However, there are other ways to make fertilizer, such as by creating a compost pile, and mulching leaves and grasses., Every good homestead should have a dog, particularly if your homestead is located far and away in the country. Dogs act as guards, both for your family and for your livestock. They are also wonderful company to have when you go about your daily farm chores.

, With only the financial investment of a few seeds, you can reap a harvest that far surpasses the cost of purchasing the equivalent in goods from the store. Fresh produce not only provides the best nutrition but also growing it on your own land means you have better control over the contaminants that end up on the food you eat. Any surplus can be sold, traded, or given away.Plan ahead by growing fruits and vegetables that will ripen at different times in the year so that you will have food all year round.

Plant an herb garden so that you will have fresh herbs whenever you need them. When your herbs have grown, you can dry them so that you can use them throughout the year.

Understand crop rotations. If you decide to plant crops in large quantities, you will need to understand crop rotation.

, Chickens are one of the easier farm animals to raise. However, rather than letting your chickens wander around willy-nilly, you will want to build a coop to house your birds. The best coops have space for your chickens to roam around in, as well as nesting areas where your chickens can lay their eggs. You could also consider raising ducks or geese.



You may also building a hutch for rabbits. Rabbits are relatively easy livestock to take care of. Many homesteaders believe rabbit and chicken manure work very well together, as rabbit manure is ‘cold’ and chicken manure is ‘hot.’, Of course, you can only do this if you have the land to properly sustain a cow. Generally the minimum amount of land you should have when raising a cow is one acre. The benefits of having a cow are endless. Your family will benefit from consuming fresh, completely organic milk products, your other animals will be healthier because of the milk byproducts, such as whey, that they will consumer, and your garden will be happy thanks to the enormous amount of fertilizer your cow will produce.If you have the ability and land to do so, raise both dairy and meat cows.

, Goats and pigs both make excellent livestock. Goats are especially good because you can supplement the dairy products you get from your cow with your goat’s milk. Pigs are an excellent food source and their meat can also be sold. They can also be used to help plow up land and make fertilizer., Beekeeping is another excellent way to become self-sufficient. Eat your harvested honey, make beeswax products, sell it, or ferment it to make mead (among other uses)., Nearly every fresh fruit and vegetable can be canned (though some work better than others.) If your garden has a surplus of fruits or veggies, can them and save them for a season when that produce is scarce. If you plan on doing a lot of canning, it would be wise to invest in a pressure canner, as they make canning much easier and more efficient.


You should also consider learning how to pickle food. Like canning, pickling food can be very useful in the winter when fresh produce is scarce.

, If you have a cow or goat, you will need to learn how to make their milk into dairy products that can be enjoyed by the whole family (or sold at farmers markets.) Make butter, cheese, yogurt, or ice cream, and enjoy the fresh milk that your livestock provides you with., While building up and maintaining your homestead, you will undoubtedly come across many problems that can only be fixed by diving into the toolbox. Get comfortable with the basics--hammers, screwdrivers, saws-- and learn how to use more diverse tools.


You should also buy yourself a good knife and sheath that can be strapped to your belt. On a homestead, you never know when a knife will come in handy--whether its used for cutting rope or gently slicing the wool of a sheep that’s become tangled up in a briar patch.

, Part of being self-sufficient is not needing to buy anything from anyone else. At the very least, you will need to learn how to patch clothes up, mend socks, and sew rips. If you can create your own clothes, you will be even more self-sufficient.

, In particular, llamas and sheep are excellent livestock to have on a homestead, as their wool can be made into items to trade or sell., Items like soap and candles can be easily made at home--all you need is a little practice. Learning how to make basic household goods will help you make the transition from being a consumer to a producer.You can also sell or trade your homemade products. Establish yourself as a skilled craftsperson in your community.

, Creating a cycle with your resources where you can reuse supplies or where you get to use something created from your efforts without having to go to the store to make a purchase, builds on your homesteading, making it easier and more successful. You can use the eggs that come from your chickens. You can replenish your seed stock from plants that have gone to seed. Gather and reuse rainwater.

Suck on an ice cube.,
Apply mint toothpaste to the burn.,
Breathe through your mouth.",How to Cool off Your Mouth After Eating Something Hot2," Use an ice cube instead of ice water, since water will lose its chill quicker. Hold the ice cube in place over the burned area, either with your fingers, tongue, or teeth. Keep it there for as long as the ice lasts, or until the burning sensation has faded away for good.

If all you have is cold water and no ice, by all means, use that instead.
Ice pops, yogurt, pudding, applesauce, or any other soft treat from the fridge or freezer will provide relief, too., Coat the effected area. If you’ve burned your tongue, stick it out of your mouth so the toothpaste can dry. If the burn is elsewhere inside your mouth, breathe through your mouth to help it dry the best you can. Then rinse your mouth out.Use a mint toothpaste that’s free of fluoride.
Other products with mint (gum, chocolate, breath mints) will also provide a cooling effect.

, Cool the burn with the flow of air. Work up some saliva to coat your tongue. Then stick it out into the cooler air. Draw breath over your tongue and exhale the same way to soothe the burn with the air current.If you’ve burned underneath your tongue, touch the the tip of your tongue to your upper lip as you breathe. This way your inhales have a better chance of drawing air over the affected the area.

Visit your doctor.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Rinse with mouthwash.,
Gargle with benzocaine.,
Eat and drink appropriately.",How to Cool off Your Mouth After Eating Something Hot3," When you burn your tongue or mouth, inspect it in a mirror immediately after you cool it off. The effected area will probably look a little red even if it's only a minor burn, but if there appears to be any more damage beyond that, see your doctor in case it turns out to be a third-degree burn. Do not use any sort of topical treatment beyond ice cubes or water until your doctor okays it.If it's only a minor burn, it should heal after a few days as long as you don't aggravate it. If pain persists beyond that time, however, seek medical treatment.

, To quell any pain that still lingers after burning your mouth, use aspirin, ibuprofen, or a similar medication. Read the instructions and warnings. Take the recommended dosage. Reduce the inflammation that your poor nerve endings are suffering.

Never take more than what’s recommended. If you’re on other medication, check to make sure that pain relievers are safe to take at the same time.

, Use an antiseptic formula. Read the instructions and swish the recommended amount for however many seconds the directions indicate. Rid your mouth of any bacteria. Minimize the chance of infection and the prolonged pain that comes with a slower healing process.Use a mint-flavored mouthwash for extra, cooling relief.

, Use an oral pain reliever meant for cankers and mouth sores. Read the instructions for the recommended dosage. Numb pain with a direct application of medicine to the burned area. Coat the nerve endings so they won’t be further aggravated by other food and beverages.

Continue to gargle according to the instruction's recommended intervals until the burn has fully healed.

, Stick to soft, cool foods. Avoid crunchy foods (like potato chips, pretzels, and hard-crust bread) since chewing may break these down into sharp points, which may stab the burn and increase the chance of infection. Allow hot food and beverages to cool off significantly before eating so your damaged nerve endings aren’t damaged any further.Better yet, avoid warm/hot foods altogether. Instead, stick to cold foods straight out of the fridge to soothe your burn. Fix yourself a bowl of cold gazpacho soup. Enjoy yogurt or applesauce. Or treat yourself to some ice cream for dinner.

Clean your fingers off with the washcloth.,
Use your fingers or chopsticks to pick up the sushi.,
Lightly dip sushi in soy sauce.,
Eat your sushi in one bite.,
Eat a small piece of ginger to cleanse your palate.,
Clean off your plate.",How to Practice Sushi Etiquette1," Some restaurants will place an oshibori in front of you when you sit down. It’s a small, damp hand towel you can use to clean your fingers before and during the meal. After wiping, fold it nicely and place it back in its container. Use it again as needed.Don’t wipe your face with the oishibori. It’s meant for your hands.;
, Even though most people use chopsticks, sushi is traditionally a finger food. Fingers make handling the roll easier and allow you to feel its texture. This helps you prevent nigiri-zushi from falling apart. If you’re unsure if you should use your fingers or something else, ask the staff.Try not to ask for knives and forks. Some restaurants are more forgiving than others about using utensils. Some people may also think you’re a little rude for eating this way, so offer an apology first.
Chirashi-zushi (scattered sushi) is best eaten with chopsticks or a fork, if the establishment permits.

, Aim the fish portion of the sushi towards the soy. A gentle dip will give you all the soy you need. Rice quickly absorbs soy, which overwhelms the flavor of the sushi. Also, soaking sushi in soy is disrespectful because it implies the original flavors of the roll are not good enough.Always dip nigiri-zushi upside-down in the soy sauce and eat it rice-side up.
Don’t pour lots of soy sauce into your cup. You don’t need a lot of soy, and wasted soy is frowned upon in Japan.
Some rolls, usually eel and mackerel, already have sauce on them. Don’t add soy or other condiments.Wasabi isn’t a necessity. You can place a little on your sushi before dipping it into soy for extra spice. Avoid mixing the wasabi into the soy sauce.

, Sushi is made to be eaten in one bite. Two bites is acceptable, particularly when eating large American versions. It’s better to take small bites than to have too much food in your mouth. When you do this, don’t put the sushi back on the plate. Keep the uneaten part between your chopsticks and try to hold the ingredients together until you finish., Ginger does not go on the sushi. It is used after you finish a piece of sushi to clear off the taste. This helps you experience the full flavor of the next roll or dish you sample. You do not need to eat a large slice of ginger to feel refreshed., Finishing your food shows that you enjoyed it. Waste is considered disrespectful to everyone who worked hard to give you this food. The rice takes a painstaking amount of effort to get right, so it’s impolite to leave a grain of it behind."

Use a dollop of sour cream and some chives.,
Create a Southwest style baked potato.,
Try a Thai themed potato.",How to Eat a Baked Potato," Not all potatoes are created equal, with some being better for baking. It is important to pick the right size and type of potato to ensure the correct texture and flavor.


Russet potatoes are considered the best potato for baking because their interior gets a fluffy texture and they can develop a crisp skin.;
, Eating spoiled food can result in food poisoning. Avoid eating potatoes that appear to be unsafe for consumption.

, This will remove any dirt, which can result in a gritty texture and an earthy flavor. It also keeps you from possibly ingesting any hazardous chemicals, such as herbicides and pesticides.

, The oil ensures that the skin is crispy, while the pricking makes the inside of the potato nice and fluffy. The salt and pepper add extra flavor.

, Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the potatoes directly on the rack and back them for 45 to 60 minutes. Remove them once the skin is crispy and you can cut through the potato with no resistance.You can also wrap the potato in foil to create a softer skin and make sure it stays warmer for longer.

, Wrap the potatoes in foil and place them in the bottom of a slow cooker. Set the cooker on low and cook the potatoes for ten hours. This way you can have baked potatoes when you get home from school or work. , Microwave the potatoes for five minutes on high, flip them over, and microwave them again. Serve them once they are soft all of the way through. Although quick, this method results in a soggy and, sometimes, undercooked potato., A fork and knife will be needed to initially cut the potato open and later cut it up into smaller pieces to eat. You will also need a plate or bowl to eat the potato on. You may also want a spoon to scoop out the insides of the potato if you decide to mash or mix the insides.

, Slit the potato in half lengthwise until it is split cleanly in two. Push on the ends of each potato until the sides squeeze open. Mash the inside of the potato with a fork.If you want, you can eat the skins as well. They are good for you and add extra texture.

, Slit the potato in half lengthwise, but stop before you cut it into two separate halves. Then, use your fork or hands to scoop the potato flesh (the white part) into a pile on your plate. Mash the toppings into the pile of flesh with your fork.


Grab your discarded potato skins. Butter one side of each skin. Stack them on your plate and eat them as a delicious side dish! , Slit the potato in half widthwise until it is split cleanly in two. You should now have two short pieces of potato with one open face. Scoop a little of the flesh off from the top of each potato. Make sure not to remove all of it; you just want to create a nice indent at the top. Stuff the indented top with your toppings, pressing until they fit perfectly into the space you just made. Put the extra flesh to the side to eat later.

, There is not one right or wrong way to top a baked potato, with multiple recipes and topping options. Decide what sound good to you and, while your potatoes cook, prepare and organize your toppings. Depending on what you choose, this may require some additional cooking and preparation.


If you are serving multiple people, you may want to create a potato bar with a variety of options. This may require more preparation, but it will ensure that your guests are satisfied.

, The basic baked potato requires a bit of butter or margarine and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Because it is a little bland, this style is best served as a side accompanying another dish, such as a steak or pork chop.

, Once it is prepared, top the potato with broccoli and cheddar cheese. You can either melt the cheese beforehand; let the heat of the potato melt it; or toss the entire concoction back into the oven, allowing the cheesy goodness to really melt into the spud.


If you are in a rush, you can use broccoli and cheese soup as a quick substitute.You can also make your own soup and add it to the potato., This classic topping is easy to make and takes very little time to prep. Simply dice some chives and sprinkle them on top of the potato with sour cream.


Try some bacon with this dish to add some protein and a little extra flavor.

, Prepare your potato and then top it with corn, salsa, red onions, and a dollop of sour cream. You can also add pork carnitas or beef barbacoa to add some extra flavor and a little protein to the meal.Jalapenos can also add some extra spice but should be used sparingly. They add a nice complement to the sour cream.

, After preparing your potato, cover it with peanut sauce, grated carrots, green onions, minced cilantro, and sriracha sauce. Be sure to drench the potato in peanut sauce. Substitute a sweet potato for a little extra sweetness and some extra flavor. You can make your own peanut sauce from scratch or buy some premade at your local Asian grocery. If you have a peanut allergy be sure to avoid the peanut sauce.

Drink plenty of water.,
Get some rest.,
Start sniffing.,
Eat slowly.,
Chew gum.,
Work out.",How to Control Your Eating1," When you stomach is full of water, it stops sending signals to your brain that it wants food. You'll feel fuller on absolutely zero calories. To top it off: Your metabolism gets a boost too.


Although water passes through the digestive system quite quickly, it can still help decrease your appetite. Often we mistake thirst for hunger, especially when the mid-afternoon cravings hit.10 minutes after drinking 17 ounces of water, subjects of a study in Germany saw a 30% increase in their metabolic rates.And in other studies, it's been shown that water drinkers lose more weight and keep it off.;
, Losing weight while you sleep sounds like a miracle, doesn't it? But recent research says there are definite connections. Two hormones, leptin and ghrelin, are controlled by sleep; those hormones help control appetite. So don't feel guilty about squeezing in that nap -- you're just curbing your hunger!


These two guys work together symbiotically. Ghrelin stimulates the appetite while leptin tells your brain you're full. And leptin, believe it or not, is produced in your fat cells., Suppressing your appetite is all about tricking your brain -- and using your nose is the ultimate way to do this. In a recent study, people who inhaled peppermint at regular intervals ate 2,700 calories per week less than normal -- which is almost a one-pound loss.


In addition to popping that after-dinner mint, banana, green apple, and vanilla show similar miracle-working. And in this one case alone -- more is better: the more you sniff, the fewer calories you'll intake. Put some scented candles in your snack drawer; it'll probably mask the chocolate-y aroma to boot. And if you know you're a stress-eater, try sniffing through your right nostril and your right nostril only; this goes to the side of your brain where your emotions are processed. Reducing your anxiety could reduce your desire to eat., When you eat, you should be eating, not multi-tasking. You'll be able to concentrate on your food and actually taste the flavors. And eating slowly gives time for the digestive and hormonal processes to take place and your brain time to process the chemicals sent from your stomach saying you are, indeed, satisfied .


Take half an hour to finish your meal. To prolong it, chew slowly, put your fork down between bites, use chopsticks or your non-dominant hand, and simply take smaller forkfuls., Not only is it good to control your appetite, it's good for your mind. It improves your memory, focuses you, and studies have shown that it improves grades!Recent research has found that morning gum chewers consumed 67 fewer calories at lunch and surprisingly didn't make up for it at dinner. Some believe that chewing tricks the brain into thinking we've been eating for a while. On top of this phenomenon, you'll burn an extra 11 calories an hour. Huzzah!, So you probably already know that exercising burns calories -- but did you also know that it helps you consume fewer of them throughout the day? The American Journal of Physiology says that one hour of high-intensity cardio may keep you away from the kitchen for a couple hours afterward.


The hormones that tell your body you're hungry are suppressed by aerobic exercise. To pile on the benefits, get into interval training -- do short bursts of intense workouts with short bursts of rest in between."

Avoid rubbing your chopsticks together.,
Rest your chopsticks in the chopstick holder between bites.,
Pick up communal platter sushi with the blunt end.,
Avoid passing food with chopsticks.",How to Practice Sushi Etiquette2," Rubbing waribashi, or chopsticks, together implies that the chopsticks are poor quality. It’s unlikely you’ll find a splinter in wooden chopsticks. If you do detect a problem, discreetly and politely ask the staff for a new pair., Put the narrow ends on the hashioki (chopstick rest). Placing them anywhere else may indicate that you are finished eating. If there is no holder, rest them on a clean napkin or lay them side by side across the bowl. The pointed ends should face to the left if you are right-handed and to the right if you’re left-handed.Don’t cross your chopsticks. Crossed chopsticks is symbolic of death and funerals.
Never stick your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice. This also reflects a funeral rite.

, Have someone pass the plate to you so you can reach it. Turn your chopsticks around instead of picking up the food with the end that has been in your mouth. Set the sushi down on your plate and eat it normally with the smaller ends of the chopsticks., As part of a Japanese funeral ritual, family members pass bones of the deceased to each other by chopsticks. Passing food from one set of chopsticks to another mimics this ritual and is offensive. If you wish to pass food to another person, pass the plate to them so they can pick it up themselves.


Passing sushi between chopsticks is only tolerated as a gesture of closeness between parents and children or lovers.

Ask the staff what ingredients are in the sushi.,
Ask the chef for recommendations.,
Order lighter food first and heavier food last.,
Be polite to the staff by saying please and thank you.,
Pay your bill and tip through your server.",How to Practice Sushi Etiquette3," Going to a sushi place can be overwhelming at first. Sushi comes in several varieties with different fillings. Learning the basic terms beforehand can make ordering less of a hassle. If you have questions, the chef or the staff will be happy to help. When seated at a sushi bar, you may ask the chef directly. Otherwise, ask your server.Nigiri-zushi consists of a piece of fish, shellfish, or fish roe over a rice ball. It is the best choice for appreciating the flavor of the fish.Maki-zushi is rice and filling packed together and wrapped in seaweed. Standard rolls are called norimaki, since nori means seaweed. Futomaki are thicker rolls and hosomaki are thinner rolls.
Uramaki-zushi means an inside-out maki rolls. The seaweed is around the filling and the rice is on the outside of the roll.
Temaki-zushi are similar to maki rolls but are shaped like cones.
Oshi-zushi is sushi pressed into a rectangular shape.
Chirashi-zushi means “scattered sushi.” Raw fish and vegetables are placed over a bed of rice.
Inari-zushi is wrapped with something other than nori seaweed, such as fried tofu. It typically is filled only with rice.
Sashimi is raw, sliced fish. It is not actually sushi.

, Don’t ask the itamae (sushi chef) for what’s fresh. Instead, ask for the omakase (chef’s choice) menu, what fish is in season, or for recommendations. As long as you are polite, the itamae will be glad to guide you.


If dining at a table away from the sushi counter, allow the waiter or waitress to speak to the chef. If you prefer to place your order with the chef personally, sit at the sushi counter.

, Sashimi and nigiri are lighter since they are only fish or fish and rice. They’ll fill you up less than large rolls or dinners. When ordering multiple courses, start light. You won’t fill up as fast and will be better able to enjoy the taste of all the food.The chef may prepare the food in a certain order for you. Usually this is done deliberately. It’s best to eat the food in the order presented.

, Unless you are in Japan, it is usually okay to do this in your native language. You may also do this in Japanese. Say thank you or “arigato gozaimasu” (ah-ree-gah-toh go-zah-ee-mahs) when seated at the sushi bar. You may say “itadakimasu” (ee-tah-dah-kee-mahss) when receiving your food. After you are finished, say “gochisosama deshita,” (go-chee-so-sama-de shita) which basically means “thank you for the meal.”

Another useful word is excuse me, or “sumimasen” (su-mee-mah-sen), when asking for help.
Note that if you're outside of Japan, the employees at the restaurant may not speak a word of Japanese. Use these phrases when you know they'll be understood.
Don’t disturb the sushi chef with small talk and unrelated questions.

, The sushi chef is working with raw fish, so don’t give your money to him. Let your server handle it. Tips go in a jar or are handled also by the staff. Thank your staff and allow the chef to get back to serving other customers.In Japan, tips are included. This makes it an even better idea to treat the chef to a shot of sake to show your appreciation.

Drink tea with one hand under the cup.,
Drink soup from the bowl.,
Pour out sake for others.",How to Practice Sushi Etiquette4," Remove the lid from the cup, allowing the water droplets to fall into the tea. Place the lid on the table, making sure the inside faces upwards. Grip the side of the cup with one hand. Place your other hand under the cup to support it., It’s common to drink the soup instead of spooning it. Use your chopsticks or a spoon if provided to pick up solid pieces. If your soup has noodles in it, slurp while eating them. In Japan, it’s rude not to slurp since the noise signifies that you enjoy the food., Serving yourself looks bad. Pour the sake out for anyone eating with you. Let them return the favor or allow your server to do it when you are alone. Savor the drink, smelling its scent before you begin to sip it.Consider tipping your sushi chef with a shot of sake or a beer for a job well done. This is customary in Japan. Don’t ask again if the chef doesn’t accept. Get the same drink for yourself if the chef accepts."

Opt for healthy fats.,
Go for grapefruit.,
Pack on protein.,
Pile on potatoes.",How to Control Your Eating2," It may seem like it's counterproductive, but healthy fats will keep you from eating less -- and unsaturated fats (the good kind) will give you energy and are a necessary part of any healthy diet.


Go for avocados, almonds, and olives. Note that the hunger-reducing effects of nuts tend to take about half an hour before you feel them, so eat them before you reach the point of being extremely hungry, or you’ll be tempted to eat more than you need., Although grapefruit diets are now just a relic of the 80s, research is still headed in its favor. At San Diego's Nutrition and Metabolic Research Center, a study was conducted where participants ate half a grapefruit with each meal. In three months, they lost an average of 3.6 pounds. Not bad for such little work.And that's not changing anything else about their diet.


If you're wondering why, you're not alone. It's believed that grapefruit lowers your post-eating levels of insulin, which can skyrocket after meals.







, And especially in the morning. Protein controls how much you eat by making you feel fuller faster. If you start off with it, you'll want to eat less throughout the day.


Eating lean protein (think Canadian bacon, low-fat yogurt, and egg whites) at breakfast can actually keep you fuller longer than if you were to eat it at lunch or dinner, says Purdue University. So aim to get at least one ounce (or 30 grams) of protein each time the sun rolls around., The good, healthy kind at least. It's good carbs you want, not simple ones lathered in butter -- and potatoes are just that. They take a while to break down; they stay in your intestine longer, delaying the onset of those treacherous tummy rumblings.


Substitute just about anything for a baked potato -- a medium-sized tater is only 100 calories -- if you watch your butter and sour cream. And chilled, cooked potatoes are even better -- when cold, their hunger-thwarting powers are increased (go for potato salad with vinegar). But know that eating potatoes doesn't mean super-sizing your order of fries or chowing down on a bag of chips. Anything cooked and slathered in oil has lost all its health benefits."

Top the quesadillas with sour cream and pico de gallo and serve.",How to Make Breakfast Quesadillas," For the quesadillas, you’ll need 1 pound (454 g) of thin bacon. Cook it over medium-high heat in a large skillet until the bacon is as crisp as you like.For a healthier breakfast, you can use turkey or veggie bacon in place of traditional pork bacon.
You can also substitute another breakfast meat for the bacon, such as sausage or ham.;
, When the bacon is crisp, remove it from the skillet. Place it on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb the grease, and drain off the excess grease from the skillet.You don’t have to wipe the skillet completely clean of grease. Some bacon fat residue will help grease the pan and flavor the veggies.

, After you’ve removed the bacon from the skillet, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter to it. Heat it on high until the butter melts completely and the skillet is hot, which should take 3 to 5 minutes., Once the skillet is hot and greased, add a whole, diced onion, a whole, diced bell pepper, and 1 whole, seeded, diced jalapeno. Cook the mixture until the vegetables begin to soften and turn golden brown, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.Be sure to stir the vegetables as they sautee to ensure that they cook evenly.

, When the vegetables are finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the skillet to a plate. Set them aside for the moment, and place the skillet back on the stove on medium-low heat.While the veggies will be reheated when you cook the fully assembled quesadillas, it’s a good idea to cover the plate with foil to keep them warm.

, To make the scrambled eggs, crack 8 whole eggs into a large bowl. Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of half-and-half and salt and pepper to taste, and stir well to thoroughly blend the mixture.You can use your favorite egg substitute to make the scrambled eggs if you prefer.
If you want your breakfast quesadillas to have a stronger Mexican or Tex Mex flavor, you can also mix some taco seasoning or chili powder into the eggs.
Fresh chives and/or cilantro can also be a tasty addition to the scrambled eggs.

, After you’ve finished blending the egg mixture, add another tablespoon of butter (14 g) to the skillet. Allow the butter to heat over medium-low for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is mostly melted. Next, carefully pour the egg mixture into the pan with the butter.Make sure that the skillet isn’t too hot or the eggs may cook too quickly. Keep the pan on medium-low.

, Once the eggs are in the skillet, use a wooden spoon or spatula to drag the mixture around to form curds at it cooks. Allow the mixture to cook until it thickens and there is no visible liquid remaining. Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for the moment.If the eggs seem to be cooking too quickly, drop the heat down to low to keep them from burning.

, To cook the assembled quesadillas, place another large skillet on the stove. Heat it over medium-low, and add a pat of butter to lightly grease the surface.You can cook the breakfast quesadillas on a griddle if you prefer.

, You’ll need 8 tortillas to make 4 breakfast quesadillas. Place a tortilla in the heated, greased skillet, and sprinkle a layer of freshly grated cheddar and monterey jack cheese over it. Add a layer each of veggies, bacon, eggs, and another sprinkle of cheese before topping it with a second tortilla.You can use any type of tortilla that you like for the quesadillas, including flour, corn, or whole wheat.
1 ½ cups (150 g) of freshly grated cheddar and monterey jack cheese should be enough for all 4 quesadillas.
If you like, you can add a layer of avocado slices to the quesadillas after the eggs.

, When the quesadilla is fully assembled, allow it to cook 30 seconds to a minute on the first side. Use a wide spatula to lift an edge and check to see if the tortilla is crisp and lightly browned to determine when it’s finished cooking., Once the first side of the quesadilla is finished cooking, use the wide spatula to carefully turn it over to the other side. Let it cook for another 30 to 45 seconds, or until it’s crisp and golden brown as well.If the quesadilla isn’t cooking very quickly, you can turn the heat up to medium.
When the quesadilla is finished cooking, the cheese should be fully melted and the filling should be hot.

, When the quesadilla is finished cooking, remove it from the skillet to a plate. Repeat the same assembling and cooking process with the remaining tortillas and fillings until you’ve made four quesadillas., Once all of the quesadillas are finished cooking, add a dollop of sour cream and pico de gallo to the top of each. Serve them on their own or with a side of breakfast potatoes.You can also use salsa or guacamole to top the quesadillas.
You can freeze the quesadillas if you like. Assemble and cook them as you normally would, but allow them to cool completely before transferring them to plastic freezer bags. Freeze for up to a month, reheating them in the microwave or a skillet when you plan to eat them.

Create a chocolate and brie pastry.",How to Pair Chocolate with Cheese," To get the best ingredients for your tasting, try to purchase artisan chocolates and high-quality cheese. Consider buying your cheese from a cheese counter, so you can ask questions about pairings and get helpful suggestions. For chocolate, look for chocolates with few, but high-quality, ingredients.


You may be able to find quality local chocolate. You can also ask local chocolate makers for cheese pairing recommendations.;
, Once you've selected your chocolates and cheeses, cut them into bite-sized pieces. Let them set out at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes before tasting them. This will help you taste the flavors and appreciate their aromas.This is especially important if you're offering chocolate truffles which can be very firm.

, While you can just set out a variety of chocolates and cheeses, it may be helpful to organize the pairings. This will help you guide the tasting and prevent taste buds from being overwhelmed. You could order the pairings from mild to medium in flavor or from subtle to bold in intensity.For example, you could start with goat cheese and milk chocolate for a mild pairing.

, To start the tasting, try one pairing of chocolate and cheese. Taste the cheese first and then taste the chocolate. Discuss what you enjoy about the pairing and mention any flavors you pick up on. You can also talk about the texture, color, and finish of the pairing.Offer a palate cleanser, so your guests can really taste a variety of flavors. Set out crackers, water, or grapes to eat in between bites of cheese and chocolate.

, If you're unsure what chocolates pair well with a cheese, try it with dark chocolate. Ensure that you're using a chocolate that is 55 to 60% cocoa solids. The high-cocoa content usually works with almost any cheese, but it tastes great with complex aged cheeses like:Parmigiano reggiano
Blue cheese
Aged gouda

, Since milk chocolate is quite creamy, pair it with other soft, creamy cheeses to round out the buttery flavor. You can use fresh cheeses that haven't been aged along with high-quality milk chocolate that doesn't contain many preservatives. Pair milk chocolate with:Ricotta
Fromage blanc
Cream cheese
Goat cheese

, White chocolate is usually creamy and a sweeter than most dark or milk chocolates. This makes it a great choice to taste along with other creamy cheeses that also have a hint of sweetness. You can try most semi-soft cheeses like:Swiss cheese
Emmental
Gouda
Fontina

, If you'll be serving chocolate barks or truffles that have fruit or nuts, you can easily taste them with different styles of cheeses. If you want a contrast in texture, pair them with semi-soft cheeses (like brie or soft blue cheese). Or you could build on the complexity of flavors by tasting them with sharp or aged cheeses like:Aged jack
Aged cheddar
Aged gouda

, If you don't want to try something too adventurous, start by making cheesecakes. You can easily make a white chocolate cheesecake that uses basic cream cheese and high-quality white chocolate. Or swap out the cream cheese with camembert or brie. Dark chocolate also works well with cheesecakes.You can also bake cheesecakes using Quark, which is similar to yogurt or softened cream cheese.

, You're probably familiar with fondue, thick melted chocolate or cheese that's served with foods to dip. Try dipping strawberries, blackberries or blueberries in dark chocolate. Let the berries set and dip them into melted cheese to serve. Or you can serve the chocolate covered berries with cubed hard cheese, like cheddar or gouda.If you want to melt the cheese, try etorki cheese. It melts easily and has a sharp flavor that pairs well with fresh fruit.

, Poached pears with a chocolate syrup is a classic. But if you'd like to introduce a daring flavor, melt Gorgonzola cheese into the chocolate syrup. Pour the chocolate cheese syrup over poached pears and serve them while they're warm.If you can, try to find Gorgonzola dolce which is slightly softer and creamy than traditional Gorgonzola.

, For a really impressive dessert, get a small wheel of brie and cover it with chocolate hazelnut spread. Wrap thawed puff pastry around the brie, so it's completely encased. Bake the brie and serve it warm along with crackers, toast points, or berries.For a similar pastry, make puff pastries using brie, raspberries, and dark chocolate.

Cook the eggs.,
Serve.",How to Make a Traditional Full English Breakfast," The sausages take the longest to cook (approximately 12 minutes), so it's best to start cooking them first. Place them in the pan with some preheated vegetable oil. Turn the sausages regularly.;
, Firstly, clean the mushrooms, but do not wash them. Then slice the mushrooms and add them to a separate pan with some preheated vegetable oil. Toss and stir the mushrooms over gentle heat for 5 minutes, then put them on a warm plate.

, In the same pan that the sausages have been cooking in, place the rashers of bacon in to cook. Turn them every minute or so.


English people often cook back bacon. It's a little meatier and thicker than the streaky bacon you might see in other countries. It includes both the pork loin from the back and a bit of pork belly in each rasher.

, Put the baked beans into a saucepan on the stove and stir over gentle heat.

, Melt a little butter in the pan, or add oil if preferred. You can also use the leftover fat from cooking the bacon, if you've cooked that ahead of time. Crack two eggs into a separate pan. Once the yolks have gone opaque, the eggs are done, thus signaling that the rest of the ingredients are cooked as well.

Provide utensils.",How to Make Breakfast for a Crowd," Depending on the type of event, you’ll need to figure out how many people will attend. This is important, as you won’t be able to proceed without knowing how many people you are cooking for.


Ask the organizer. The organizer of the event should be able to give you the number of guests.
If you’re the organizer, make sure your invitation is clear that people need to give you notice of if they’ll be there. In addition, they should let you know if they will bring guests. Give people at least a week notice to respond.
You should have guest information at least three days before the breakfast – to provide you with time to shop and prepare the meal.;
, After you’ve found out how many people you’ll cook for, make sure you factor in excess food that you’ll need to prepare. This is important, as you want to make sure there is more than enough food for everyone to eat. In the end, you don’t want people walking away hungry.


You may have unplanned visitors or people may take more food than you anticipate.
Generally, provide about half a pound of food for every person. This may vary based on different dishes.
One dish may be a lot more popular than you think. Some people may like your egg and bacon casserole a lot more than the spinach and tomato omelet. To avoid this, test dishes out ahead of time or cook more of dishes you think will be popular., The trick to preparing a good breakfast is to provide people with options. By providing more than one option, you'll make sure everyone has something they'll want to eat.


Consider a casserole. Include your choice of ingredients such as eggs, meat, and vegetables. Remember, though, if you prepare an egg, cheese, and sausage casserole, you may want to balance it out with a vegetable casserole.
Serve eggs and bacon as an entrée.
Offer pancakes or waffles as an option., While your entrée will anchor your meal, side dishes will compliment the meal. In addition, sides will give picky eaters something to eat if they don't like the main courses. Consider:



Grits or oatmeal.
Fresh fruit, fruit salad, or a vegetable plate.

Hash browns., Your breakfast won't be complete unless you provide a bread option. This is because bread can be paired with a variety of dishes. Think about serving:



Toast.

Muffins.

Bagels.
Pastries., While food will be the star attraction of your breakfast, you need to provide a variety of beverages for your guests. When picking drinks, consider:


Serving coffee and tea.
Offering a one or two types of juices. For instance, you may want to offer orange juice and apple juice.
Putting out ice water.
Providing 1 gallon of drink for every 10 guests.

, The most important thing in preparing a breakfast is to make something that people will want to eat. Thus, you need to gather some information about who you’re cooking for.


Think about the cultural or regional tastes. For instance, people in parts of the American Gulf Coast tend to like shrimp and cheese grits for breakfast.
Know your specific audience. If you’re cooking for people who are very health conscious, you need to prepare a meal accordingly. For instance, avoid processed and cured meats like bacon and sausage, and focus on fresh fruits, vegetables, and even fish like smoked salmon or whitefish.
If you have limited information, do your best to prepare a well-balanced and regionally appropriate breakfast., A major challenge in cooking for a crowd is making sure you provide a meal that a wide array of people with dietary restrictions can consume. This is especially challenging in a diverse society. By creating a nutritious and balanced meal, though, you’ll necessarily provide a variety of options for people with allergies or dietary restrictions. In addition, you’ll provide a meal in which people have healthy choices. Consider:


People who keep kosher or halal. In this case, avoid mixing milk and meat and don’t use pork products.
Individuals who are vegan or vegetarian. Avoid using any meat and make sure you have dairy and animal free options for vegans.
Those who are gluten intolerant or have other food allergies., Quality ingredients are the basis for any good breakfast. As a result, you should (if possible) focus on the best ingredients available. Good ingredients will improve the flavor of your dishes.


Generic cheeses have higher fat and are lower quality.Focus on quality meats, like bacon or sausage without nitrates and nitrites.
Include whole grains in your meal whenever possible.
If possible, use locally sourced and organic ingredients.
Advertise the quality of your ingredients at the breakfast. For example, include a short menu that explains how you sourced your ingredients., The basis of any quality breakfast are fresh fruits and vegetables. Whether you're serving a fruit salad or vegetable omelets, they will enhance your meal and impress your diners.


Include a vegetable tray with cream cheese.
Provide a fruit tray may. It might complement your main course.
If you serve smoked salmon and bagels, also serve lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.
Consider having a vegetable option if you include a casserole, omelet, or something similar., A great way to impress your guests is to provide a meal that is well-balanced. By avoiding a carb heavy meal that includes lots of saturated fat, you'll craft an impressive, healthy meal.


Moderate your servings of bread, cheese, and fatty meats.
Serve lean meats. For instance, consider turkey sausage, turkey bacon, or even grilled chicken., One of the biggest challenges in serving breakfast to a crowd is to make sure food is ready when people eat it. Sometimes this is difficult, as your location and the time of arrival may present you problems in heating or cooling food. To do so:


Make sure you warm foods that need to be warm. You can cover them after preparation, use chafing dishes, or keep warm foods in a crockpot or other warming/heating device.
Use ice or a refrigerator to chill food that should be served cold. For instance, you may want your fresh fruit or yogurt to be served cold. Store it in a cooler or refrigerator until just before people arrive for the breakfast., Make sure you provide proper dishware for your guests. Ultimately, without proper dishware, your breakfast will be chaotic.


Supply double the number of bowls and plates per person. This is because some people will use more than one plate or bowl -- and maybe even more.
Consider providing 3 to 5 napkins per person.
Depending on the type of event, you may want to supply paper or plastic dishware instead of ceramic or china.
If you do use ceramic or china, be aware that you may lose some to accidental breaks., Make sure to supply proper utensils for whatever dishes you provide. Without proper utensils, your breakfast will be plagued by problems.


Provide forks, spoons, and knives. Depending on the event, decide whether you want to use plasticware or silverware.
Remember serving spoons for casseroles and eggs.
Don't forget serving forks for bacon, sausage, or smoked fish.
Supply bread knives or other cutting knives. Also, make sure to provide spreading knives for butter, jelly, or honey."

, There should not be any dried up pieces or brown over-cooked egg pieces in your pan in order to keep the eggs fluffy and soft. As the eggs are done, set them on the side of the serving plate and put in microwave or oven to limit heat loss.

, Cut off the core and seeds of the tomatoes, as we want to get rid of the excess liquid. If you want mushrooms in your tomatoes, chopped canned mushrooms or fresh mushrooms into a similar size as the chopped tomatoes. Prepare black pepper, salt and sugar.

, Slowly and softly put the chopped tomatoes and mushrooms(optional) in. Be careful, some oil will splash out as the tomatoes contain some liquid. Allow the ingredients to sizzle for 30 seconds.

",How to Make a Quick Healthy Breakfast," One important component of your breakfast should be protein. Studies have shown that those people who had a decent amount of protein at their breakfast stayed satisfied longer and were able to maintain a healthy weight.To ensure you're eating enough protein at breakfast, aim for about 1 serving of a protein-rich food. This is about 3 – 4 oz or about 1/2 cup.Try these protein-rich foods at breakfast: lean breakfast meat (like turkey bacon, turkey sausage or ham), low-fat dairy products, smoked salmon or eggs.;
, Grains are a common food group found in breakfast meals. They offer a great source of energy and can be made quickly to help you get out the door faster in the morning.


Grains, especially whole grains, are great for breakfast. They can offer a little bit of protein and fiber.The body uses carbohydrates, fat, and lastly protein for fuel. These nutrients follow different metabolic pathways to provide energy (or fuel). Carbohydrates are a great fuel source and readily broken down for use, so make sure you include them in your breakfast.Try to choose whole grains at breakfast. These are less processed and have a high nutrient content (especially fiber) compared to more refined grains.
Great grain-based foods for quick breakfasts include: whole grain waffles, whole grain bread, oatmeal, whole wheat English muffins, mini whole wheat bagels or a whole grain cereal.

, Another important component at breakfast is a high fiber fruit. Fruits are an easy way to get in a source of fiber and vitamins early in the morning.


Fruit is a common and tasty breakfast side dish. Including them helps balance your breakfast meal and provides an adequate source of fiber, vitamins and antioxidants to your meal.If you choose to include fruit at breakfast, make sure to measure the appropriate portion. It's one small piece of fruit or about 1/2 cup of diced fruit.
You can have any fruit as a side to your meal, but you can also add fruit to your meals to make them balanced. For example, top yogurt, oatmeal or cottage cheese with 1/2 cup of fruit.

, Vegetables aren't always a common food group found at breakfast; however, if you include a serving of veggies early in the morning, it can help you balance your meal and meet your daily goal of five servings per day.Like fruit, vegetables are a great source of fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. Added to a lean protein, they can be a great addition to a nutrient dense meal.
You can sauté vegetables and add them to eggs or add shredded vegetables to morning baked goods like zucchini muffins.
1 serving of vegetables is about 1 cup. This is a large serving, but even if you get in a 1/2 cup of vegetables, that's a great start to your day.

, Meal prepping in advance is a great trick to get breakfast (and other meals) ready much quicker. Try to do a little meal prep in your down time to help get your weekday breakfasts started.


Plan a time during your week where you can spend a little time doing some meal prep. This might be right when you get home from the grocery store or on a Sunday afternoon.
Write out a little list of the breakfast meals that you're planning on having during the week. This will help guide you on what foods you need to get ready.
You can meal prep your entire meal if you'd like so all you need to do is eat it or heat it up. Or, you can do a moderate amount of prep work, which will require you to do minimal assembly or cooking the morning of.
For example, you can make oatmeal overnight in the crockpot and just scoop out a portion in the morning or you could just slice fruit up to get ready for a smoothie.

, If you are totally lacking on time, you might want to consider making breakfast the night before and making sure you can eat it on the run or when you get to work.


Right after dinner or when you have time in the evening, make your breakfast for the next morning. Many meals can be cooked or prepared completely so you can grab it and go.
Keep items wrapped or in an airtight container in the refrigerator if you're storing it over night.
Items you can make the night before include: scrambled egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin, yogurt or cottage cheese with fruit on top or overnight oats.

, In addition to making your breakfast meal the night before, you may want to consider using your microwave to help speed along your morning. You can make a variety of breakfast items in just a minute or two if you use your microwave.


Scrambled eggs are easily cooked up in the microwave. Spray a mug with cooking spray and scramble your eggs. Microwave for about 60 seconds and your egg is completely cooked. No dirty pan!
Mug muffins are a popular breakfast item. You mix together flour, eggs, butter, spices and additional topping items like nuts or fruit. Microwaved for 1-2 minutes and you have the perfect muffin.
Oatmeal is an easy microwave meal. Those little instant packets make a whole grain breakfast quick and easy.

, Like the microwave, your crockpot can save you loads of time on your breakfast meal. Plan to have a delicious, warm breakfast waiting for you when you wake up.


Oatmeal is not something only for the microwave. Rolled or steel cut oats take a long time to cook. Added to the crockpot overnight and you can have this wholesome grain ready and hot to go in the morning.
French toast casserole is another easy crockpot meal. Using whole grain bread, you'll wake up to a fiber filled breakfast.
Egg casseroles are another great dish for the crockpot. You can mix eggs, cheese, sausage or bacon and vegetables together in your crockpot. You'll have fluffy and flavorful eggs the next morning.

, If you're in need of quick and nutritious breakfast items, you can always get a little help from the store. This is perfect on an overly busy week or weeks where you couldn't fit in time for food prep.


Consider purchasing frozen low calorie breakfast sandwiches or burritos. There are many varieties available in the freezer section. You can pop one of these in the microwave for a low calorie, but high protein meal.
Also consider purchasing frozen sausage patties or links. You can microwave these and sandwich them in a whole grain English muffin with a piece of cheese.
Also consider purchasing individual yogurts, yogurt sticks or individual cottage cheese containers. You can grab one quickly or throw in your bag to bring to work with you.

, One super easy and tasty breakfast recipe is overnight oats. This is a newer and very popular way to get in a serving of fruit and whole grains at breakfast. Plus it takes just a few minutes to make and zero prep time in the morning.Stay by adding 1/2 cup of rolled oats to a mason jar or tupperware container.
Add in 1/2 cup of milk (or almond or soy milk), 1/2 cup of your favorite yogurt, and 2 teaspoons of chia seeds. Mix well.
To add a little extra nutrition and fiber, stir in 1/2 cup of your favorite fruit. You can try a combination of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries for a mixed berry oatmeal.
Seal your container and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow to chill at least 8 hours if you can. The next morning, all you need to do is grab a spoon and enjoy.

, Another great quick breakfast idea is to make and freeze your own breakfast burritos. You can make this for yourself plus all the other members of your family.To start, decide how many burritos you want to make. You'll need one 8"" tortilla and 1 egg per burrito.
Scrambled your eggs in a skillet over medium high heat. Remove and set aside in a bowl.
If you want, you can also cook breakfast sausage, bacon or ham. Cook 1 – 2 oz of these per burrito.
In addition, add some vegetables by sauteing some onions, peppers or spinach together. Again, you want about 1 oz of vegetables per burrito.
Mix your eggs, vegetables and meat together in a bowl. Add in your favorite cheese (about 2 tablespoons per burrito). Stir to combine.
Fill each tortilla with some of the filling. Roll up your burrito tightly and wrap in plastic wrap and stick the freezer. Morning of, defrost in the microwave for a few minutes or until heated through.

, Take a little help from the store and consider purchasing whole grain waffles. They're a great source of fiber and can be cooked up quickly in the toaster.


In the morning, pull out one or two waffles (depending on how hungry your are or if you're following a specific diet). Toast according to the package instructions in your toaster.
Top each waffle with 1 – 2 tablespoons of your favorite nut butter (like peanut or almond butter).
Then, slice up an apple or banana (or other fruit) and lay on top of the nut butter. If you'd like, you also add a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.

, Breakfast smoothies are already a somewhat quick meal to have. However, there are a few preparation steps that you can do in advance to make this go even quicker in the mornings.Start by measuring and portioning out your fruit. Per smoothie, you want about 1/2 cup of frozen fruit. Measure this out the night before or on the weekends. Place in a freezer safe plastic baggie.
You can also prep the other smoothie ingredients the night before. Place 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/4 cup of your favorite yogurt in the cylinder of the blender. You can also drizzle in a tablespoon of honey if you'd like. Keep this covered and in the refrigerator.
The morning of, take out the blender cylinder, add in 1 baggie of fruit and blend until smooth. Pour into a glass or a to-go cup and drink it on the way to work or school.

Support local artisans.",How to Eat Chocolate," Don’t waste a good chocolate bar by scarfing it down so quickly you don’t even really taste it. Take some time out of your day to sit down and mindfully enjoy each bite.Sit down somewhere where you’re comfortable and won’t be interrupted. Curl up in an armchair with some nice music playing, or sit at your kitchen table looking out at the backyard — whatever makes you feel cozy!
Some experts recommend not having any distractions whatsoever, including music, so that you can completely dedicate your senses to tasting the chocolate.;
, To full experience the chocolate’s flavor, start with a clean palate that doesn’t contain any residual flavors from your past meals. If your mouth still tastes like your previous meal, cleanse your palate with some apple, bread, or sparkling water.If you’re having a few different types of chocolate, have a glass of sparkling water nearby so that you can sip it and cleanse your palate in between chocolates.It’s helpful to wait a while between tasting different chocolates so that the flavors don’t mix on your palate. While waiting to try the next chocolate you can have a sip of sparkling water and make some tasting notes.,, Once you’ve quieted your mind, turn your attention to the chocolate’s appearance. Admire its glossy exterior, and any colors or decorations it may have on it.

, Run your fingers gently over the chocolate, paying attention to its texture. It may be smooth, chunky, or rough, for example.


If the chocolate feels cold, wait to eat it until it’s room temperature. The colder the chocolate is, the more difficult it will be to taste all of its flavors., Hold the chocolate up to your nose and take a deep inhale while closing your eyes. Cup your other hand over the chocolate as you do this so that you can really get a sense of how the chocolate smells.


If you’re eating a chocolate bar, now is the time to snap a piece off from it. This will release more of its chocolatey smell., If it’s a truffle, bite the truffle in half. If it’s been kept at the right temperature, the truffle should snap upon being bitten.You can use your teeth and tongue to break the chocolate into small pieces and spread them across your tongue. This is more commonly done with truffles than chocolate bars.
With a chocolate bar, you may just want to hold it to the roof of your mouth and let it melt for up to 30 seconds before moving it around your mouth., Let the chocolate sit on your tongue, then press it up to the roof of your mouth and experience the flavors as the chocolate melts. Many chocolates move through a variety of flavors as they melt.


As you move the chocolate around your mouth, pay attention to how it tastes. It may be sweet, salty, bitter, acidic, umami, or a combination.For example, a mango chilli truffle melted in the middle of your tongue might start with a strong mango flavor, then move to a tequila flavor, then chilli, with the chilli spice hitting the back of your throat as you swallow the chocolate., Inhale deeply through your nose as the chocolate melts on your tongue. As you inhale, imagine you are making space between your nose and the roof of your mouth (your palate). As you do this, you may notice different flavors, or at least stronger ones.


Inhaling in this way is called “aerating the palate” and helps stimulate your sense of smell at the back of your throat., Before taking the next bite, give yourself a moment to feel the chocolate’s effect on your body.Do you feel a little mood boost? A bit of an increased heart rate? Maybe you’re smiling because it tastes so nice!

, If you regularly try different types of chocolate, it’s useful to keep a record of what you’ve tried. Write down your thoughts in a notebook or text document. Do this while your memory of the chocolate is still fresh.Buy a nice notebook to write your tasting notes in. If you regularly taste other types of things as well (e.g., wine and coffee), you could buy a notebook with multiple sections. Some shops even sell chocolate tasting notebooks.

, A quick way to decide on a chocolate-drink pairing is to look at the tasting notes for both the chocolate and the drink. This goes for tea or alcohol, which are both commonly paired with chocolate. Examples:


If you’re having a cup of tea with floral notes (e.g. jasmine green tea or a floral oolong), aim for a dark chocolate with floral notes.If you’re having a Dragonwell tea or another type of tea with a nutty flavor, aim for chocolate that also has nutty notes — for example, an almond bark or dark chocolate with nutty tasting notes.Earl Grey tea has pronounced citrusy notes and goes well with dark chocolate that also contains citrusy notes., Pairing drinks and chocolates with matching tasting notes to enhance the flavors of both the chocolate and the drink is a great way to start, but you can also contrast flavors and complement them.Earthy teas (pu-erh, for example) go nicely with floral dark chocolates, while spicy teas such as Masala Chai black tea go well with milk or white chocolate.Combine teas with “toasty” notes (e.g. Hojicha green tea or Wuyi Oolong) with sweet milk chocolate or chocolate caramels., Light teas go nicely with fruity, spiced, or cream-based chocolates. Fruity teas go well with simple dark chocolates. Dark teas go well with most types of chocolate.The pairing possibilities are endless, but here are some more suggestions:Pair white chocolate with Matcha, Sencha, and Dragonwell teas.
Pair milk chocolate with Dragonwell, Sencha, Darjeeling, Oolong, and Masala Chai teas.
Pair dark chocolate with Assam, Keemun, Gyokuro, Oolong, Match, and Earl Grey teas.

, When choosing which chocolates to pair with which coffees, consider the flavor profiles of both the chocolate and the coffee. You can do this with black coffee or any milky coffee drink of your choice.Espresso roasts go well with dark chocolates, caramel chocolates, and chocolates with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon.French roasts go nicely with dark chocolates, chocolates with roasted almonds or hazelnuts, and any chocolates containing caramelized sugar.Dark roasts and dark chocolates generally go well together., You can make a wonderful hot drinking chocolate by melting a few squares of dark chocolate into some whole fat milk. For the best flavor, make sure the milk is whole fat and that it’s lightly steaming (not boiling!) before you put the chocolate in.


If the dark chocolate alone is too strong, cut it with a few squares of milk chocolate.
Note that combining chocolate with milk reduces the health benefits of chocolate, as the milk reduces the anti-oxidant abilities of the cocoa solids.

, Chocolate’s strong flavors will make dry, light red or white table wines taste like nothing.Experts recommend pairing chocolate with a sweet wine with an equally intense flavor that doesn’t buckle under the chocolate’s intensity.


Dessert wines like vintage-style ports, sweet sparklers,and robust reds are good choices, with the port being a classic choice.Banyuls is a popular wine choice for pairing with both milk and dark chocolate. Recioto, Madeira, Barolo Chinato, Fernet, and Syrah wines are also popular pairing choices., Spirits like whiskey and bourbon are generally aged in oak barrels that lend hints of caramel, vanilla, nuts, and fruits to the drink. Pair these spirits with chocolates containing the same flavors to enhance them.When pairing scotch with chocolates, consider the flavor profile of the scotch that you’re drinking before choosing your chocolate. A plan dark chocolate with little sugar or added flavors will go well with a mildly smokey scotch., One type of Old-fashoined cocktail contains bourbon, muddled cherry, and orange. Pair bourbon with a citrusy or cherry-filled chocolates to recreate that flavor combination.Rum goes well with chocolates that mimic the flavors of Tiki drinks such as tropical fruits, lime, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and almond syrup. Aged rum with marzipan chocolates is also a great pairing.A popular drink in the wintertime is a Peppermint Patty, which combines peppermint schnapps with hot chocolate. Sip a minty schnapps with a simple dark chocolate to recreate the flavor. If you don’t drink alcohol, you can replicate this with a strong mint tea.

, Cacao is the plant from which cacao beans (also called cocoa beans) are cultivated. Cocoa is the powder made from roasted, husked, and ground cacao beans, with most of the fat removed.Cacao beans are typically roasted and processed to make the solid candy, chocolate. Raw varieties of chocolate do exist too, however, and these are the healthiest., The alkalization process removes many of the nutrients contained in cocoa.Alkalized cocoa powder is also referred to as “Dutched”, “Dutch Process”, or “European Style” cocoa powder. It’s powder that has been washed with a solution that neutralizes its acidity. Alkalized powder is often darker than natural cocoa powder.Alkalized cocoa powder often has a deeper, earthier chocolate flavor compared to the more mild, fruity, acidic flavor of natural cocoa., Dark chocolate is the healthiest type of chocolate as it contains the most cocoa solids, which contain flavonols, which are compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.A study testing the health benefits of 70% dark chocolate found that it reduced blood sugar, lowered bad cholesterol, and increased good cholesterol. Another study found that it also lowered blood pressure.Other studies have suggested that chocolate reduces the risk of blood clots, helps improve eyesight, boosts moods (no surprise there), and improves cognitive performance in the elderly., The darker the chocolate, the higher its flavonoid content. Higher flavonoids means higher levels of antioxidants, and thus greater health benefits., Avoid chocolate made from fats like palm oil and coconut oil. Cocoa butter also contains saturated fat, but it doesn’t affect cholesterol in the same way as the saturated fat in coconut oil and palm oil., Aim for organic chocolates that are made by fair trade-certified producers. This not only ensures high-quality ingredients, but that the farmers and workers are fairly compensated for their work.Shade-grown rainforest chocolate that has been allowed to naturally ripen is a safe choice for good-tasting, sustainable chocolate.Fair trade chocolates will usually say so on the packaging. If you’re unsure, check the Fair Trade USA website for a list of all Fair Trade chocolate producers., High-quality chocolate will be brown or dark brown, and glossy. IF it’s greyish or has white spots or small holes on the surface, don’t buy it., In addition to seeking chocolate from Fair Trade, sustainable producers, pay attention to which country it comes from. European and South American brands are often good choices.


Swiss, Belgian, British, and German chocolates are universally famous. Dark single-origin chocolates from Ecuador are also popular., While grocery stores do carry some high-quality Fair Trade brands of dark chocolate, you’re likely to find a more exciting selection from your local chocolatiers. Do a search online to find chocolatiers near you!"

Watch out for high-calorie beverages.",How to Have a Low Calorie Barbecue," Whether it's hamburgers or steaks, beef is a common food to be served at barbecues. Make sure to choose leaner cuts of beer to help cut down on calories and fat.


Some cuts of beef are much more lean compared to others. Choose cuts of beef that are naturally lean or make sure to read packaging information to choose lower fat ground beef.If you want to make hamburgers for example, consider buying the 97% lean ground beef. This has significantly fewer calories and fat compared to the 80/20 ground beef. Or try making burgers with ground turkey meat instead.
If you want to do steaks, try these naturally leaner cuts: flank, filet, sirloin tip, tri tip and top sirloin.Also try organs and other tissues. Liver tends to have more micronutrients than muscle.
Eating a lot of red meat increases the risk of bowel cancer.If you eat more than 90g of meat a day, it is recommended that you cut down.;
, Both fish and shellfish are great to be grilled or barbecued. Like lean cuts of beef, they're a great choice if you're looking for lower calorie or healthier main dishes.


All seafood is naturally lower in calories. Plus, those that do contain a little more fat (like salmon or tuna) contain heart healthy fats like omega-3s.Great fish to grill or barbecue include: salmon, tuna, swordfish, cod, halibut or mahi mahi. Peppered tuna also ideal, full of omega 3 and 6. Fish like flounder or tilapia are much flakier and may crumble or break apart on a grill.
Shellfish like shrimp, clams or mussels can also be cooked on a grill or served at a barbecue.

, Some protein sources in particular are very lean and low in calories. Pork and poultry are generally great as a low-calorie protein for barbecues.Poultry, like chicken or turkey, are lean meats in general. Although the dark meat does have more fat, both white and dark meats are still considered lean and low in calories.
Pork, sometimes considered ""the other white meat,"" is another one that's naturally very lean. This is especially true if you trim off any visible fat on cuts like pork chops; however, pork has been found to contain a significant amount of LDL cholesterol. Make sure you are choosing lean cuts (tenderloin and center-cut roasts) and limit the amount you eat. Avoid high-fat cuts like spareribs, sausage and bacon.
If you choose to go with poultry or pork, remove the skin or any visible fat to help reduce the overall calories of these lean protein sources.

, If you want to offer a wider selection of main dishes, you may want to consider trying some vegetarian sources of protein. These are great for barbecues and are also a lower calorie item.There are a few different types of vegetarian proteins you can try. Both tofu and tempeh are great grilled or barbecued. They also stand up well to most cooking methods.
In addition, these foods are low in calories, but still high in protein. They also soak up marinades and sauces and become very tasty and flavorful when cooked.

, Whether is a hamburger or hot dog bun, you'll most likely need to serve some sort of roll or bread at your barbecue. Make sure to choose a more nutritious version of these grains.


100% whole grains are minimally processed and contain higher amounts of fiber, protein and minerals. They're much more nutrient dense compared to more refined grains (like white bread or rolls).If you plan on serving hamburgers, pulled pork sandwiches or hot dogs, purchase 100% whole grain buns. These aren't necessarily much lower in calorie, but are more nutritious for you.
If you want to avoid having a higher carb meal or just want to cut out the bread altogether, consider serving items that don't require a roll. Do barbecue chicken, pork  loin or steaks that generally are not served with a roll.
Eating plenty of fiber is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer.

, Vegetables are very versatile allowing you to cook and serve them in a variety of ways. Plus, they're an easy low-calorie side dish that you can serve at your barbecues.


Vegetables are a great idea for your healthy and low-calorie barbecue. They're naturally very, very low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.Vegetables can be grilled or smoked or cooked inside in a variety of ways. They can be served hot, room temperature or even chilled. They'll fit a variety of your barbecue needs.
Try serving vegetables in dishes like: simple grilled vegetables (try a mix of zucchini, squash or onions), you can serve a cold vegetable salad or even make a simple spinach salad. Try barbecued sweet potato jackets with bean and spinach filling or cheesy corn on the cob.

, Another great warm weather item is fruit. Like vegetables, this group is naturally lower in calories and can add a little bit of sweetness to your meal.


Fruits are not only low in calories, but they're high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants as well. Warm weather fruits, like berries, are particularly high in antioxidants.You might think that sliced fruit or a fruit salad is the only way to go; however, a great way to boost flavor of fruit is to grill it. Pineapple, peaches or plums become decadent and indulgent when grilled.
However, a simple fruit salad, fruit kebabs, or even a watermelon and feta salad is a great way to use low-calorie fruit at a barbecue.

, It's hard to throw a barbecue without some sort of crunchy chips. Many people serve the usual tortilla chips and guacamole or potato chips; however, be smart with your choices and pick out lower calorie items.


Potato chips, cheese puffs and even tortilla chips can get high in calories — especially if you have more than one serving.Choose not to serve these foods at your barbecue to help keep the calorie levels lower.
If you want to serve an appetizer or a dip, try using something a little different. For example, you can serve raw vegetables with hummus, ranch dip or guacamole instead of chips.
If you do want to have one type of chip to serve, consider using the baked chips or ones that are 100% whole grain (like whole wheat pita chips). These are slightly lower in calories and fat.
Consider making beet chips instead. Slice them as thin as possible, drizzle with olive oil and bake in a hot oven until they are crisp.

, Warm weather desserts are generally cold, creamy and high in calories. Be wary of the dessert items you serve to guests so you can keep the overall calories low.


Think outside the box of the typical ice cream, ice cream sandwich, pie or cake. This is especially true if you're buying those baked goods from the store or pre-made. These can have higher levels of saturated or trans fat compared to homemade.Consider purchasing 100% fruit sorbet or making your own sorbet or granita at home. These items are still nice and cold for a warm day, but are much lower in calories compared to ice cream.
You can also serve fruit with a sprinkle of cinnamon, chopped mint and a dollop of whipped cream for a lightened up dessert as well.
If you want, you could also make your own popsicles with greek yogurt, fruit and spices. These are perfect for warm days when you're hosting a barbecue.

, Condiments like mayo or ketchup generally make an appearance on a barbecue table; however, make sure you choose and serve lower calorie condiments.


Some of the lowest calorie condiments include: ketchup, mustard, low-fat mayo, hot sauce, soy sauce, salsa, horseradish, relish and steak sauce.Always measure out the appropriate serving size as well. It's generally 1 – 2 tablespoons per serving. 1 – 2 tablespoons is about the size of a ping pong ball.
Choosing toppings that are vegetable-based is a great idea. Ketchup or salsa are not only low in calories, but do contain nutrients from the tomatoes and other vegetables they're made from.

, If it's a hot day outside, you'll likely be feeling a little thirsty at your barbecue. Instead of filling up on sweetened high-calorie beverages, stick to low-calorie items.


Instead of grabbing a sweet tea or high-calorie alcoholic drink, try stick to lower calorie items. They'll hydrate you much better and help keep your total calories in check.Try: water, sparkling water, flavored water, diet iced tea, low-calorie beers or infused waters.
If it's a particularly hot day, make sure you stay hydrated. Aim for a total of 64 oz of water during the day. If you're planning on having some alcohol at your barbecue, still make sure to consume adequate water., Although there are plenty of great meats and protein sources that are low-calorie, there are some that you should avoid. This is especially true if you're aiming to have a low-calorie barbecue.


Some cuts of meat are overly fatty and high in calories. Serving these items can increase your total calorie intake but also increase your intake of unhealthy fats like saturated fats.Fatty, high-calorie meats to stay away from include: hot dogs, 80/20 ground beef, sausages or brats, fatty steaks like a prime rib or NY strip and chicken wings.
Also, note that when you cooked higher fat meats over high heat (like on a grill), toxic compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are formed. This comes from the fat dripping onto the coals and smoking.
The occasional meal that's high in fat is OK; however, if you eat these continuously, the high saturated fat content can lead to increased cholesterol levels over time.

, Coleslaw and potato salad are common side dishes at barbecues. They're creamy, crunchy and delicious; however, they're also sky high in calories and fat.When you're planning out your barbecue menu, you might be thinking of serving one of these types of salads. To help keep your total calorie levels lower, consider using other types of dressing or swapping out the mayo for something a little lighter.
Make healthier, lower calorie swaps for the traditional potato salad, macaroni salad, coleslaw or tuna salads.
For example, instead of regular mayo, consider using low-fat mayo or the one made from olive oil. And use less than the recipe calls for. You can also try using low-fat yogurt or greek yogurt in place of the mayo. It's still creamy and rich but with much fewer calories.
Also consider changing up your typical dressing. Although a creamy potato salad is great, try tossing it with a vinaigrette instead. The same goes for macaroni salad or coleslaw.
Also increase the vegetable ratio in these salads. Not that potatoes or pasta is unhealthy, but they are higher in calorie compared to vegetables. Increase the amount of onion, celery or other vegetables found in these recipes.

, Other sneaky ways you may end up overdoing it with calories are through toppings and dressings. Whether it's a squirt of ketchup on your burger or extra BBQ sauce to dip, it's important to watch out for these calorie-heavy condiments.You may overdo it with condiments, sauces and dressings because these are hard to measure out. In addition, you may not be aware of how calorie-dense they are.
Watch out for these condiments that are particularly high in calories: mayonnaise, creamy dressings and dips, tartar sauce, BBQ sauce and honey mustard.
Always try to measure appropriate portion sizes — even if you just estimate them. Serve yourself 2 tablespoons maximum of a condiment. That's about the size of a ping pong ball.

, When you're planning on what beverages you're going to serve at your barbecue, also be aware that some drinks have more calories than others. Be mindful of what you choose to have.


Many drinks are high in calories due to the sugar content they contain.You may not realize how many calories or sugar you've consumed when it's coming from a beverage.
Beverages that are typically high in calories include: alcohol, fruit juices, sweet teas, lemonade and regular sodas.
If you do have a higher calorie drink, stick to one only. This allows you to indulge a little, but doesn't push you over the top calorie-wise.

However, some disagree that the oil should be added to the grill, such as Meathead Goldwyn, who advises adding the oil to the meat and not to the grill.You may prefer to follow this advice.







, The grill should be hot before adding food to it. The combination of a clean grill, oil and heat will help keep the grill non-stick.


If cooking meat, it helps to warm it to room temperature just before adding it to the barbecue.






If grilling fish, it's better if the skin is left on, to keep the fish intact.

Gather your movie-buff friends to play the “7 Degrees of Kevin Bacon” drinking game.,
Play ""Name that Pig"" with your favorite beverage.,
Turn to a cooking television channel such as The Food Network for a fun-filled bacon-inspired drinking game.,
Invite pork-loving friends to play bacon toss.,
Tap into your inner “architect” and play bacon inspired Jenga.,
Play the bacon eating game based on the chocolate eating game.,
Try bacon tasting.",How to Play Bacon Drinking Games," Although you won’t need pieces of that smoky cooked goodness to play the game, this sport will keep you focused on a different kind of bacon––the theatrical kind. The idea behind this game is to name a random film actress, actor or even director, and then follow a chain of thespians until linked to actor and all around icon, Kevin Bacon––however, you only get seven links. The least number of links the better.


Play with two or more people––the more people playing the better.
Ask everyone to write down a name of one actor, actress or director on a piece of paper and place the paper in a hat.
The first player randomly selects a name and must track through that celebrity’s movie career until he or she is linked to Kevin Bacon. The idea is to link to Kevin Bacon in the least number of steps––up to seven. If the player has to name more than seven steps, he or she automatically has to drink. For example, if the player selects Tim Allen, he was in Toy Story with Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon––only two steps to Kevin Bacon and most likely this player is safe from drinking.
Each player takes a turn––keep track of the number of steps it takes to arrive at Kevin Bacon. The player who had to name the most number of steps at the end of each round has to drink.;
, Test your knowledge of famous pigs or “pork-like” analogies with a group of friends.


Depending on the number of players, divide the players into teams (team A and team B) with equal numbers on each side.
Ask everyone to anonymously write down the name of a famous or infamous pig or bacon related person place or thing. Examples include the movie Porky’s, or the pig from Charlotte’s Web, “Wilbur.” If you and your pals are feeling a little un-PC, you could also delve into cop references too––it’s your game, make up the rules at will.
Team A randomly selects a question and then provides Team B with one clue. For example, if the word is “Porky’s”, the clue could be “this place was famously patronized in a 1980’s movie series.”
Team B is allowed four, or as many times as you desire, attempts to guess the answer. Don't allow too many guesses though, as a faster pace is a lot more exciting.
If Team B guesses the answer correctly, Team A has to take a drink. If Team B does not guess correctly, then they must drink.

,


Gather around the television during a favorite chef show featuring barbecue or southern cooking, for example. The object of the game is to drink every time the chef says the word, “pork,” “ham” or “bacon”, or uses pork as an ingredient.
Designate specific keywords that will trigger drinking such as pulled-pork, barbecued pork ribs or bacon. Depending on the dish, everyone could end up quite buzzed after a half hour show.

, Inspired by games where players attempt to toss pieces of food into each other’s mouths, bacon toss involves tossing a piece of bacon into the other teammate’s mouth. If your teammate is able to catch and eat the bacon, your team is safe. However, if your teammate misses––you both must drink.


Divide your group into teams of two. Each player must have an alcoholic beverage and a plate of cooked bacon (perhaps eight to 10 pieces).
Teams must stand facing each other with approximately four feet between them.
One player will act as the “catcher” and the other player will be the “thrower.” Team members will reverse rolls after each bacon toss so everyone gets a chance to perform each roll.
The thrower will attempt to toss one piece of cooked bacon into the catcher’s mouth. The bacon can be cut in half or possibly used whole, depending on your preference. The catcher cannot use hands––just his or her mouth to receive the bacon.
If the catcher fails to catch the bacon in his or her mouth, both teammates have to drink. If the catcher manages to catch and eat the bacon, they can choose another team that didn’t catch their bacon to drink (which means that some teams may have to drink twice).

, Instead of using wooden blocks, use pieces of crispy fried bacon to build your tower, then gingerly pull away pieces. The person who pulls away the piece that makes the tower fall has to take a shot.


Cook three to four packets of bacon so you have enough “material” to build your Jenga inspired tower. Make sure each piece of bacon is thoroughly crisped and cooked so it can withstand the building process.
Decide which player goes first by performing a coin toss. After the first player has been identified, decide play order. Where you rank may be the difference between building the tower and bringing it to its knees.
Begin the game by having the first player lay the initial piece of bacon on the table. Each player takes one piece of bacon and builds upon the next.
If you create the tower without having it fall, reverse the process by having each member remove one piece of bacon from the sculpture. The person who places or removes a piece of bacon that causes the sculpture to fall has to drink.

, In this game, cooked bacon is set on a plate in the middle of the party attendees. Have disposable knives and forks ready at the side for each contestant. As with the chocolate eating game, toss the dice around each group member. Whoever gets a six has to go to the center of the group, pour and drink a shot of whatever alcohol you've chosen (this is instead of putting on clothes as with the chocolate game). Then, the person must eat bacon with the disposable knife and fork until the next person throws a six. Changeovers must be rapid once a six is thrown, don't allow delays or the game won't be as much fun. This can get very messy if a six is thrown mid pouring, so be ready with a plastic sheet over the ground.


To make eating the bacon a little more exciting, try making chocolate bacon. Have plenty on the plate, people will probably scoff it.

, Not so much a ""game"" as an excuse to combine bacon with alcohol to mark which are the best matches. You can set up food and alcohol testing anyway you like but here are some suggestions:


A beer and bacon tasting
A single malt and bacon tasting
A wine and bacon tasting
A mixed drinks and bacon tasting.
A range of different types of bacon is recommended, such as plain, smoked, chocolate covered, spicy, etc.

Apply salt to the surface of the meat.,
Never put a sauce on the meat prior to cooking as you will only cook the sauce before the meat and have a burned, sugary mess on your hands.,
Let the meat rest for about 5 to 10, even 15 minutes to re-absorb its juices (and the Barbecue flavor) prior to slicing.

,
Any sauce used after slicing that has a front-loaded flavor, such as vinegar or sugar, is usually used as a trick to cover up the taste of poor quality meat.

,
Enjoy!

",How to Make Barbecue Rub,"


Applying salt to the surface of meat is a trick to ""fool"" the water. Water will travel to the ""briny"" side of the membrane (where the salt is), dissolving the salt and creating a ""brine"" that becomes a liquid and seeps back into the meat cells, creating a brine there that draws the water back into the meat and so forth and so on...this action dissolves the structure of the meat, creating a tender steak to cook and enjoy.;
, #Place the sauce on the meat just prior to final cooking to coat the meat in the additional flavors.

",How to Eat Sushi," This is especially important for the first-time sushi eater. Poorly prepared fish can ruin the experience and make you never want to eat sushi again, especially if you're not particularly fond of seafood to begin with. You can do more experimenting with where you eat once you've had a few positive experiences with sushi, but when you're starting out, play it safe.


Ask around for suggestions. If you're unsure about a good restaurant in your price range, ask friends or other locals for a suggestion.
Don't assume price signifies quality. While sushi does tend to be somewhat more expensive than eating at other types of restaurants, you should be able to eat quality sushi without having to spend $100 dollars a person, depending on where you live.;
, At most every sushi restaurant, you should be able to order sashimi, nigiri, maki, and temaki.


Maki is also referred to as a ""sushi roll."" Typically, maki includes one or two types of fish and vegetables rolled with rice in a sheet of roasted seaweed and cut into bite-sized portions. This is usually the best starting point for people who are squeamish about eating raw fish.
Nigiri refers to slices of raw fish over an oval-shaped ball of rice. These are prepared to order by the sushi chef and are typically seasoned lightly with a tiny amount of wasabi and soy sauce before it comes to you.
Sashimi refers to slices of raw fish prepared on a plate without rice. In general, this is the most basic and cleanest way to eat sushi, but may not be appropriate for the beginner.
Temaki - Similar to maki, except the ingredients are rolled into a cone shape that you hold and bite into the way you would a taco.

, It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a good restaurant that will serve quality ingredients and one that doesn't. Asking ""Do you serve fresh fish?"" is somewhat rude, so learn to notice the signs for yourself. The following might suggest a less-than-great sushi restaurant:


all you can eat sushi for a fixed price
menu items not listed in Japanese
most of the items are rolled sushi with names like Oriental Delight
the restaurant serves mainly other styles of food, like Chinese or Thai
more than half of the available ingredients are cooked or fried

, Typically, a plate of sushi includes wasabi, which looks like a green ball of paste. Most restaurants in the US and Europe don't serve real wasabi. They serve powdered wasabi mixed with water. Wasabi powder is dried horseradish, mustard seed, corn filler, and E numbers. Real wasabi is a plant that grows in the japanese alps naturally. This spicy condiment is sometimes included in maki and nigiri, but is available if you desire more.Pickled ginger comes in thin, pink or white tan slices on the side of the plate and is used for cleansing the palate between bites. You'll also have a shallow dish to dip your sushi in soy sauce.

, This will give you the opportunity to interact with the sushi chef and inspect the quality of the fish which should be on display, and should not look dry or otherwise undesirable.

, Order non-sushi items from a server. Ask what is recommended, and if you can have whatever is freshest. Since sushi includes raw fish, the fresher it is, the better it tastes.


Asking ""Is it fresh?"" might be insulting, as it implies that some of the fish might not be. Just ask for whatever is recommended. If the recommendations don't sound good to you, order something that does. There's no ""right order.""

, If it's especially busy, or if you're unable to sit at the sushi bar, order a variety of styles and varieties of sushi to get a sense of what you like. Order a few pieces of nigiri, some maki, and try the sashimi if you're feeling adventurous. Order whatever sounds good, or whatever is recommended. If most of the fish is listed in untranslated Japanese (as it probably will be at a good restaurant), check below for some commonly available fish in translation:


Sake (pronounced ""sha-ke"") - fresh salmon
Maguro - blue fin tuna
Hamachi - yellowtail tuna
Ebi - cooked shrimp
Unagi - freshwater eel
Tai - red snapper
Tako - octopus
Tamago - sweet egg
Masago - capelin caviar

, If you want to eat something while the sushi is being prepared, popular starters including edamame (boiled soy beans), suimono (clear broth) or misoshiru (fermented soybean soup). Choose from green tea, beer, sake, or water to drink; soft drinks will overpower the subtle flavors of sushi.

, Many sushi bars will provide a hot, moist, towel for this purpose prior to serving food. Although many people choose to Eat with Chopsticks, it is entirely acceptable to eat sushi with your hands, so it's good form to wash your hands thoroughly before you begin, especially if you're sharing a plate with friends.

, Pour a tiny amount of soy sauce into the dipping bowl. Some people like to mix some of the wasabi into the soy sauce, while other's look upon this as an ""American"" thing to do and think of it as somewhat disrespectful. Ask the server or the chef if you should dip, if you're unsure and try adding wasabi directly to the fish if you want more.


Be careful when dipping Nigiri into the soy sauce. Dip the fish, not the rice, so the piece will stay together and won't become soaked with the salty soy sauce. Don't overdo it. Try it first without and use the condiments to your taste.
If the sushi already has sauce on it, do not dip it in the soy sauce. Try enjoying it as the chef seasoned it.
Alternatively, you can use chopsticks to dip the ginger in the soy sauce, and then use it to brush the sauce onto the fish rather than dip the fish directly. This also gives the ""essence"" of ginger without eating it directly.
Today, it is becoming more acceptable to dip the rice into the soy sauce.

, If the piece is too big, eat it in two bites. Pay attention to both the flavors and the textures. You may be surprised with how mild and tender the fish is. Remember that you're not supposed to be overwhelmed with strength of flavor here, but with the balance of flavors and textures. Take the time to enjoy it.

, This is particularly smart between bites of different types of sushi. Do not eat it in the same bite as sushi, and don't eat big globs of ginger all at once.

Choose a small papaya.,
Chew directly on a few seeds.Papaya seeds can be eaten whole, but for the first week or so, only chew on one or two papaya seeds a day.,
Work your way up to a larger amount.,
Try eating the seeds with honey.,
Crush the seeds.,
Use crushed papaya seed whenever you would use crushed peppercorn.,
Try seasoning meat with papaya seeds.,
Make a papaya seed salad dressing.,
Note the health benefits of papaya seed.,
Scoop the seeds out of a fresh papaya.,
Store an excess in the freezer.,
Avoid adding them to smoothies or similarly sweet foods.",How to Eat Papaya Seeds," Smaller papayas tend to have seeds with a milder taste, while the seeds of a large papaya tend to be more bitter.


As you grow accustomed to the taste of papaya seeds, you can begin getting larger fruits instead of searching out small ones all the time. Starting with small papayas can help you get used to the flavor, though.;
, If you eat too many at once, you could end up overwhelming your tastebuds and digestive system.


The bitter, pepper-like taste of papaya seeds can be overwhelming at first, and if you rush yourself too quickly and eat too many at once, you might become discouraged from eating any more.
Additionally, while papaya seeds are safe to eat, consuming anything in large quantities when your stomach is not accustomed to it can cause digestive upset. Starting slowly is the best way to avoid or minimize this upset.

, Over the second week, gradually work up to 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml), then to 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml), and finally to a full 1 tsp (5 ml) daily.


Make things even easier on your digestive system by taking the papaya seeds with a meal heavy in protein. Doing so will make it easier to get the maximum amount of benefits from the proteolytic enzymes in the seeds, thereby improving your digestive health.

, If the stronger, bitter taste of papaya seed proves too strong for you, you could try taking whole papaya seeds with 1 tsp (5 ml) of honey to lessen the effect.


When taking papaya seeds with honey, you should still chew the seeds a few times before swallowing them.
Additionally, the combination of honey and papaya seeds is thought to be an effective treatment against parasites, so taking your papaya seeds with honey has possible health benefits, as well.

, Use a mortar and pestle to crush up to 1 tsp (5 ml) of papaya seeds at a time, grinding them into a fine or coarse powder.


Alternatively, you could add the clean, dry seeds directly to your pepper grinder instead of using a mortar and pestle, if desired.
For best results, opt for freshly crushed papaya seeds instead of seeds that were crushed some time ago.

, Crushed papaya seeds work well as a substitute for black pepper and can be used in equal proportions.


Note that the taste of papaya seeds is not exactly like pepper. Some have compared it to a blend between pepper and mustard, but when used in small quantities, the difference is not usually enough to negatively affect the food you use it on as a pepper substitute.

, One great way to use peppery papaya seeds is to season steak, chicken, or pork with the crushed seeds before you cook the meat.


For instance, you could crush 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of papaya seeds and use them to season a single serving size steak. Rub the crushed seeds on the steak and let it sit for an hour before pan-frying in a little olive oil.
The papain in papaya seeds acts as a meat tenderizer. The flavor itself adds flavor to the meat, and it can also help you digest the steak after it gets into your stomach.

, Another popular way to use papaya seeds is to mix them into a vinaigrette dressing, similar to the manner in which you might prepare a pepper vinaigrette.


For one version of papaya seed dressing, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) papaya seeds, 1/4 cup (60 ml) papaya fruit, 1/4 cup (60 ml) red onion, 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh cilantro, 1 clove garlic, 5 tsp (25 ml) ginger, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) apple cider vinegar, the juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp (5 ml) honey, 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) sea salt, and a pinch of chili pepper flakes if desired.Blend all of the ingredients, minus the oil, in a blender until they form a liquid.
Slowly pour the olive oil into the blender or food processor as it runs to blend it in thoroughly.
This recipe produces 1 cup (250 ml) of papaya seed dressing. You can store it sealed and chilled for up to one week.

, Now that you know how to eat papaya seeds, you might still be wondering why you should.


For starters, papaya seeds contain high levels of oleic and palmitic acids. Both are believed to help protect your body against cancer.In traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine, papaya seeds are used to detoxify and strengthen the liver.
The flavonoids in papaya seeds are believed to help prevent germs from causing infections and are also thought to protect the kidneys.
In one study done with Nigerian children, 76.7 percent of the children got rid of intestinal parasites after consuming papaya seeds daily for one week., The simplest, most effective way to get papaya seeds would be to buy or harvest fresh papaya and to scoop the seeds out of the fruit with a metal spoon.


After digging the seeds out with a spoon, spread them out on one half of a clean tea or dish towel. Fold the towel over to sandwich them in the middle and rub the seeds quickly to remove any remaining, attached pieces of fruit.
Place the seeds in a colander and rinse them under running water. Spread them out flat near a windowsill to dry in the sunlight for a few days.
You could also dry the seeds using a dehydrator. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to avoid drying the seeds out too quickly or not thoroughly enough. When using a dehydrator, however, the total amount of necessary drying time is usually cut from days to hours.

, If you do not plan on eating or using all your papaya seeds within the first few days, you should place them in a freezer-safe, airtight container and store the seeds in a freezer.


If you eat papaya seeds on a fairly consistent basis, you can store them in the refrigerator instead of relying on the freezer. If you do not think that you can go through your papaya seeds within a week or so, though, it is best to freeze some.
When kept frozen, papaya seeds can retain their nutritional value for 6 to 12 months.
Defrost the seeds in the refrigerator overnight before use. Alternatively, you could soak frozen seeds in hot water for a few minutes until they soften.

, Even though you could technically use papaya seeds in a smoothie, many people agree that the bitter, pepper-like taste tends to be a fairly unappetizing addition.Additionally, in low quality blenders, papaya seeds may not be thoroughly ground. A mortar and pestle, food processor, or pepper grinder are your best options if you want to pulverize papaya seeds.

Buy or forage some prickly pear pads.,
Remove the spines from the pad by using a vegetable peeler or a paring knife.,
Run the pad under cool water.,
Slice or cut the pads (wipe the knife blade after each slice, as there can be small spines sticking to it), or leave them whole, depending on what you will be using the nopales for.

,
Cook the nopales.",How to Eat Prickly Pear Cactus1," See Warnings. There's a reason it's called the prickly pear cactus.


Find pads that are bright green and firm.
Small, young pads harvested in early spring are thought to be the most succulent, delicate in flavor, and have the fewest spines. The thicker a pad, the older it is. Older pads tend to be stringy and their sap will be thicker, which some people find unpleasant. Leave those for other species who use them as survival food during lean foraging seasons. The tender pads are sometimes sold as ""baby nopales"".
If you're harvesting them yourself, wear extremely heavy gloves or use tongs. Snap the pads off the plant or cut at the stem. Cutting at the stem reduces stress on the pad, and allows the cactus to recover more quickly than snapping or tearing the pad away. This helps keep your cactus plant healthy for future harvests.;
, Don't take off the gloves until the pads are completely rinsed and the peeled remnants are cleared. The pads not only have large spines, but there are also tiny, invisible and far more irritating spines called glochids that are extremely difficult to remove from the skin. The spines and glochids can also be removed from the prickly pear pads by burning them off with a small torch or by placing the pad on a gas burner and turning it with tongs. See Warnings.

, Peel or cut off any discolorations or bruises.

,, They can be either boiled or grilled, as well as mixed with other ingredients to make unique, satisfying and healthy dishes.


If you boil the nopales, you may sometimes have to drain and re-boil them once or twice, depending on how thick the sap is. The thicker the pad, the thicker the sap.
Boiling them with a copper coin (an old Mexican ""veinte"") is a common remedy to thin the sap and make it more palatable to unaccustomed diners.
The boiled nopales are then drained, washed off with cold water and served as a salad with finely diced tomatoes, onion, cilantro and jalapeños and seasoned with vinegar, salt and lime juice.
If you grill the nopales, you might want to coat generously with pepper, salt, and other spices. They're ready when they're tender and slightly browned.
Grilled nopalitos strips can be seasoned with fresh lime juice and a little olive oil. You can also add grilled portobello mushrooms to the mix.
Try stirring the cooked nopales into soup, mixing them into a salad or omelet, pickling them, or eating them alone.
A popular and traditional Mexican dish is ""nopalitos en salsa verde"", where the nopales are cut in strips and boiled in water (see above), and then re-cooked in the traditional sauce made of tomatillos (which are sometimes mistaken for green tomatoes, but are actually a completely different fruit that grow in a papery husk), onion, garlic, cilantro and jalapeño  chiles (puree the sauce ingredients in a blender and then bring to a boil and simmer). This is usually eaten in a soft tortilla as a taco or with chips.

Buy or harvest some prickly pears.,
Remove the spines.,
Skin the pears.,
Cut the pear into slices, or stick onto a fork or skewer and serve.,
Finished.

",How to Eat Prickly Pear Cactus2,"


The pears with the reddish-orange or purple skin and deep purple interiors are considered to be the sweetest, but the white-skinned varieties are more popular in Mexico.
Store-bought prickly pears are usually spine-free and sometimes can be handled with your bare hands. Unprocessed pears still have glochids that will drive you crazy if you get some on your skin. Just to be sure, always use tongs or at least a plastic bag as a glove.
If you're foraging for prickly pears, remember that while all pears are edible, only a few will actually be ripe and taste good. Get them when they are bright purple and look like rat food, just before starting to wrinkle.

,


Place the pears in a plastic colander five or six at a time under cold water. Swirl the pears around for about three or four minutes not bruising them. Doing this washes all the fine blond hairs away, now you can handle them prickly free.

,


All the hairs gone slice off the thicker skin at both ends of the prickly pear (the bottom and the top). It takes a little practice to know how much to slice off. Generally, you want to take off the skin without getting at the seed-filled center.
Cut lengthwise along the pear's top-bottom centerline just through the skin. Using that slit, use the knife to lever the skin and peel it off of the rest of the pear.

,


The flesh of the prickly pear can be used to make jam, jelly, sorbet, wine, and ""cactus candy.""
The seeds can be consumed with the fruit (but be careful not to bite into them, as they're quite hard) or spit out.
Some people eat the seeds in soup or dry them to be ground into flour.

Pull off the center leaves.,
Remove the choke using gentle strokes with a spoon.,
Eat your heart out.",How to Eat an Artichoke," This is optional, but it makes eating the artichoke much easier later on.;
, Artichokes are steamed. You may place it in a few inches of water and bring the water to a low boil, but only a low boil, then cover. Do not cover them entirely, just a few inches. If you cover them too much with water they will turn brown. Steam for about 50 minutes. You will know when it is done when you can pierce the stem with a fork quite easily - should feel like you are piercing a soft fruit. You can also microwave them, individually wrapped in plastic, for 8-15 minutes, or put them in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes. You know it is done when you pull at a leaf and it comes away with little resistance.

,, Take a look at it - you should be able to see the edible part pretty clearly. It's lighter in color and down at the base of the leaf, where it was attached to the heart.

, Some common dips are:


Mayonnaise (try mixing with a little bit of balsamic vinegar or soy sauce)
Mixture of garlic and butter
Mixture of oil, salt and vinegar
Melted butter
Ranch dressing

, The ""good part"" will detach from the more woody, fibrous part of the leaf easily and leave the tasty bit for you to savor.

,, These leaves look a bit different than the outer leaves and often have a translucent quality with a bit of purple on them.

, Depending on how well-cooked the artichoke is, you can sometimes lift off the smaller inner leaves all together for one last dip in the sauces and bite the ends off delicately (but don't eat the sharp tips). They cover a finer, almost hairy growth just on top of the heart of the artichoke. Some people call this part the ""choke,"" which is what you will do if you eat it, as it is very prickly.

, If cooked well, the choke will scrape off easily. What remains after the choke is removed is the coveted heart. Many people will try different implements, but a spoon is best and leaves a clear clean heart with no choke left on it.

, The heart of the artichoke is the most prized portion and often the only part restaurant chefs use in their recipes, but at home you can savor the whole artichoke experience. Enjoy.

Avoid developing a diet mentality.,
Pay attention to your hunger.,
Stop avoiding food.,
Stop punishing yourself.,
Pay attention to signals of fullness.,
Acknowledge the satisfaction of eating foods that you love.,
Pay attention to feelings.,
Recognize the limitations of your body.,
Exercise regularly.,
Gently change your eating habits.",How to Eat Intuitively," It's a truism that many people struggle with cycles of dieting. The reality for many following diets is frustration and often dangerous swings of weight gains and losses. Instead of worrying constantly about the latest diet fad or which diet will make you lose the most weight, discard the focus on special diets altogether. By shifting to intuitive eating habits instead, you'll never have to diet, for, eventually, you will follow a well-balanced process of feeding your body what it needs without compromising on the happiness!;
, The hunger urge is not an evil, negative instinct; sadly, it has been demonized by the diet industry to seem like something to be constantly purged and ignored. Hunger, on the contrary, is a positive instinct that evolves to tell you when you need an energy refill––vilifying so helpful and basic an instinct is neurotic. When your body feels deprived of nutrients and calories (energy), it sends hunger signals to the brain. If you try to suppress this instinct, you risk binge-eating foods that are poor in nutrition as a ""quick fix"" for that gnawing inside. By responding quickly and sensibly to your body's hunger urges, you can eat smaller portions, feel satisfied quickly and find the energy you need to keep going strong.


There is a reason for the time-proven, traditional meal set each day: By eating balanced meals every 3–5 hours, you ensure that your body maintains a steady level of energy. By fueling your body with properly balanced foods, you will not experience deprivation in nutrients, calories or energy.

, One of the most common mistakes people make when trying to change their lifestyle is to convince themselves that food must be avoided. This battle manifests itself in feelings of deprivation. When you feel deprived, you are more likely to give in to temptation. Acknowledge that your body needs food.

, Instead of constantly labeling yourself as “bad” or “good”—depending on how many calories you've consumed in a day or what types of food you've eaten—simply acknowledge that food is necessary and healthy. Trust your body to let you know what types of food it needs.


For example, if you don’t normally eat meat, but suddenly find yourself craving a meal of red meat and a fresh spinach salad, your body could be indicating to you that you are low on iron and need to supplement your daily diet with more foods that contain higher levels of iron. Instead of feeling guilty about consuming more calories in the day than you think you should, accept that you body knows what to do to balance itself.
Be grateful that you have access to what your body needs—not everyone does.

, Just as the body sends signals to the brain when it needs food and sustenance, it also informs us to stop eating.


When our stomach is full, the brain receives a message. However, many people eat without paying careful attention to their bodies and the signals they receive. Since it takes the brain approximately 20 minutes to register the food you consume, if you eat too quickly or too casually (mindlessly in front of the television or computer), you may miss the full signal and end up overeating.

Cramming food in to fit around work life isn't healthy, either. That hot dog bolted down in a five-minute break between meetings will leave you hankering for sugary, fatty snacks mid-afternoon when your energy levels crash. Find a minimum of 20 minutes for a decent lunch instead––if the meetings cannot wait, work needs rescheduling, not your diet.

, The best way to immerse yourself into an intuitive eating cycle is to acknowledge that eating gives you a sense of satisfaction, and to stop punishing yourself for feeling satisfied by food.


The guilt that many people have about eating actually creates a secret urge to binge-eat what they consider ""bad foods."" This gives food unnecessary power—which disempowers you in the process. Acknowledge that eating is satisfying, and move on.

, Many people use food as a comfort agent to deal with problems such as anxiety, depression, and anger. Know there are healthier ways to deal with these emotions. Acknowledging this behavior will help you stop using food as a security blanket.


Use food to fuel your body, not to improve your mood or let off steam. Intuitive eaters recognize the true purpose of food and strive to find alternative methods for mood improvement.
Keep a food diary to help you notice the emotional triggers in your life. This can help you to find alternative ways of coping with stressful or emotional moments—such as meditation, taking a walk, listening to music or simply relaxing.

, Not every person is capable of being a size 2 or having a 30-inch waist. Bodies are built differently. Some bodies have fat deposits that are curvy, some have block-shaped fat deposits. There is no way to change the natural disposition of your body, so it is important to stop trying. If you place unnecessary restrictions on yourself in order to achieve a physically impossible goal, you will become frustrated and depressed.

, Don't think you have to abuse or exhaust yourself. Just move regularly through physical activity and revel in the differences you experience. An active body is a healthy body, and a healthy body feels great! Physical activity is also a very effective way to release stress, which can turn into a major trigger for emotional eating if left bottled up for too long.


Match your body shape and stamina to the exercise. While one style of exercise may be all the rage, it might not be your perfect match. Try different types of exercise to find what you enjoy doing and what makes a constructive difference to your fitness. If you can't work this out alone, ask a fitness coach, doctor or physiotherapist to help. When you ""click"" with the exercise you do, it will become a lifelong passion and won't feel like a chore. Again, this is an intuitive response!

, An about-face transformation of your diet can leave you feeling hungry, depressed, anxious or frustrated. Instead of trying to revolutionize your entire diet in a few short days, simply try to gradually adjust the foods you eat. Pay careful attention to the types of food you eat, the frequency at which you eat, and the reasons why you are eating.


Notice which foods leave you feeling sub-optimal and lacking in energy. Equally, make note of those that leave you feeling buzzed and alert. Steer toward the food that makes you feel optimal and good, not the food that might be an easy option but that leads to a fast slump.

Store extra kumquats.",How to Eat a Kumquat1," Ripe kumquats range from bright orange to yellow-orange. Stay away from greenish, unripe fruits .The skin should be nice and firm, free of blemishes or shriveled areas., No matter where you got the kumquat, rub the peel under cool, running water. Since the peel is edible, you don't want any traces of pesticides or dirt on the surface. Pat the fruit dry with a paper towel.

, Some say that rubbing or squeezing the fruit between your fingers helps it release the sweet, citrus-like scent of the rind., The seeds are not poisonous, but they have the same bitter taste as orange seeds.If you're feeling dainty, slice the kumquat in half and pluck out the seeds. You can easily spit the seeds out as you eat instead, or even chew them up if you don't mind the flavor.


Pull off the nubs of green stems as well.

, Unusually, kumquats have a sweet rind and sour flesh. Nibble the end of the kumquat to taste the rind first. Once you encounter the mouth-puckering juice, you can either keep nibbling cautiously, or pop the whole fruit in your mouth. If you can stand it, the explosive wedding ceremony between tart and sweet is unique in the fruit world.


Some kumquat species are less sour than others, or have a thicker peel. If the flavor doesn't impress you, try to find a different type, or use the fruits in cooking.
If you hate the sour taste, squeeze out the juice and eat the peel by itself.

, Kumquats will last for about two days at room temperature, or about two weeks in an airtight, refrigerated container.You can eat them cold from the fridge or let them warm up first, whichever you prefer.

Once you purchase or pick your guavas, you should have about two days before they go bad, depending on how ripe the fruit is when you purchase it.In order to tell if a guava is ripe, squeeze it gently. If it gives under your fingers, its ripe.





;
, You want to try to select guavas that are blemish-free. Blemishes or bruises can mean the fruit is bad or will not taste good.

, Ripe guavas are those that have gone from bright green to a softer yellowish-green color. If you see a touch of pink on the fruit, it is in its prime. If you don't find any that are yellow, you can always buy green guava and wait for them to ripen., A perfectly ripe guava is one that you can smell without even putting it to your nose. It should smell sweet and slightly musky. If you have eaten a guava before, look for guavas that smell like they taste., You should wash the entire guava, as the rinds are actually edible. Rinse the fruit with cold water in an effort to quell any bacterial growth. Pat your guavas dry with paper towels.

, Using a knife, slice your guava in half. Serrated knives usually work best when cutting open a guava. Some guavas have pink flesh, some have white flesh.


You can either cut them in half or slice them up into thinner slices., You can either eat the whole guava (rind and all) or scoop out the insides. Either way, you’re in for a delicious treat. Some people like to put seasonings on their guavas like soy sauce, salt, sugar or even vinegar.

, You can wrap uneaten guava halves in plastic wrap and store them in the fridge for up to four days. If you don’t think you will eat the guavas within four days, you should freeze your guava. Frozen guavas can stay in the freezer for up to eight months., Make guava barbecue sauce, a delicious sweet and salt combo that will make you feel like you’re feasting in paradise., Bored with the classic berry danish? Why not try adding some excitement to your morning meal., Skip the normal jello flavors dive and into something a bit more tropical. You can even make jello with actual guava chunks in it!

, Rather than mixing orange juice with sparkling wine, try some guava juice in a Hermosa mimosa instead. Just pour the sparkling wine, a dash of guava juice and two or three maraschino cherries.

Put on gloves.,
Cut off the stem.,
Locate the seams.,
Make deep scores in the shell at the seams.,
Pry the shell apart.,
Remove the pods of flesh.,
Eat the fruit with your hands.,
Eat around the seed.,
Slice the fruit into pieces as an alternative.,
Serve durian with sticky rice and coconut milk.,
Try durian ice cream.,
Snack on durian chips.,
Try it with other fruit.",How to Eat Durian," When opening a durian, gloves are important for several reasons. For one, they’ll protect your hands from the spikes on the outside of the fruit. They’ll also keep your hands from smelling like the fruit, which some people find unpleasant. Finally, the gloves will also help you hold the durian steady as you cut into it.

You can use thick rubber gloves, clean gardening gloves, a baseball mitt, or even a clean towel to protect your hands.;
, Turn the durian on its side and hold it firmly in place with one hand. With the other hand, use a sharp knife to carefully slice the stem from the top of the fruit. Cut off the stem and a small sliver from the top of the shell. Turn the durian over and rest it on the cut edge.Cutting a sliver from the top of the fruit will give you an even edge to rest the durian on as you cut into it.

, The fruit inside a durian grows in pods, and the shell grows in sections around these pods. As such, the durian will have seams where the shell comes together, and you can open the fruit easily by locating and cutting the seams.


The seams of a ripe durian will actually start to tear apart on their own, so you may not even have to cut into the fruit., For durians that aren't perfectly ripe, use a sharp knife to carefully cut along the seams of the fruit. Start with a shallow cut, and then cut progressively deeper until the sections of the shell start coming apart. Cut the entire length of the seam. Repeat with each seam in the shell.


Cutting in progressively deeper slices will ensure you cut deeply enough to crack the shell, but not so deeply that you score the fruit underneath., Once you’ve made cuts deep enough in the seam that you can open the shell, put the knife down. Pick a seam to start and stick your thumbs or fingers on both sides of the opening. Pull the seams away from each other to open the shell and reveal the pod of fruit inside.Repeat with all the seams to reveal all the pods of flesh.

, When the shell has been fully cracked open, the sections of the shell will come apart in wedges. Inside each wedge will be a pod of fruit. You'll be able to pull the fruit away from the shell easily if the durian is ripe. Otherwise, use a sharp knife to cut away the fibrous parts attaching the pod to the shell, and then remove the fruit.

The edible fruit of a durian is the soft and yellowish pod-like flesh at the center of each wedge., Durian fruit is soft and custard-like, so you'll be able to tear pieces off the pods easily. Remove a bite-sized chunk from one of the pods and eat the fruit with your hands. Continue tearing off bites and eating the fruit with your hands.


A single cup (243 g) of durian contains over 350 calories, and it’s also high in fat and sugar. However, durian also contains lots of nutrients, including vitamins C and B6, iron, manganese, fiber, and potassium.Some people find durian to have a pungent fruity flavor, while others think it tastes like onions, rotting, or turpentine. Durian is an acquired taste, so don’t worry if you don’t like it.

, Inside each pod of flesh will be a dark seed that’s similar in size to a date.This seed isn't edible. You can either cut out the seed before you start eating, pull it out with your fingers, or eat around it like you would with a cherry., Instead of eating durian with your hands, you can slice the pods into thin slivers to serve them on a platter or with other foods. After you remove the pod from the shell, place the fruit on a cutting board. Use a knife to slice the durian into small sections. Remove the seed when you find it., Fill a bowl with freshly made sticky rice. Layer a few slices of fresh durian on top of the rice, and drizzle coconut milk on top. For a sweeter treat, top the rice and fruit with mildly sweetened coconut milk.You can also combine the durian with mango and other fresh fruits.

, Durian ice cream is a popular treat in many Asian countries. If you're not able to find this chilled dessert, you can always make your own ice cream and flavor it with chunks of fresh durian.

If you don’t like the taste of durian right away, try durian flavored snacks like ice cream and chips to help you acquire a taste for it., Durian chips are pieces of durian that have been sliced and deep fried. You can buy these in many Asian markets, Asian grocery stores around the world, or online from specialty grocery sites.

Durian chips have a milder flavor, and taste like slightly fruity potato chips., Durian is a great addition to a fresh fruit cocktail. Cut the durian into small chunks and combine it with other tropical fruits, such as mango, papaya, guava, coconut, and pineapple. You can even add in some nuts and toasted coconut to make a more substantial snack."

Make a no bake s'more with Nutella filling.",How to Eat Nutella3," Use Nutella to spice up your favorite cookie recipe, or try these Nutella inspired cookies using hazelnut extract and cocoa.


If you are using Nutella in an existing recipe, be mindful of the additional fat being incorporated into the cookie dough. Try replacing some of the butter with Nutella. For example, if you plan on adding 1/4 cup of Nutella to a recipe that calls for 1 cup of butter, try using 3/4 cup of butter instead.
Once the cookie dough is fully mixed, you can gently stir in a spoonful of Nutella to create a Nutella swirl.Nutella can also be used as a frosting for sugar cookies.

, Spread a layer of banana bread dough in the bottom of a loaf pan. Then, using a spatula or the edge of a wooden spoon, spread a layer of Nutella on top of the dough and swirl it throughout making an ’S’ shape. Alternate layering dough and Nutella, swirling after each addition of Nutella.

, For a nice hazelnut flavored brownie, try adding Nutella to the dough.


Add Nutella with the other “wet” ingredients (butter, sugar, eggs) and fully incorporate.
As with the cookies, be mindful of the added fat!
Try swirling Nutella through the brownie batter instead.

, These s'mores technically aren't ""baked,"" but they are an excellent way to use Nutella.


Replace the chocolate bar normally used in s'mores by spreading Nutella on one side of a Graham cracker. Grab another cracker and spread marshmallow fluff on it to avoid melting marshmallows over a campfire. A wonderful way to get your s'mores fix indoors.

Slice and add to salads.,
Make kumquat marmalade.,
Pickle the kumquats.,
Add the kumquat to meat dishes.,
Infuse vodka with kumquat flavor.,
Stew kumquats.,
Freeze the rinds into cups.,
Finished.

",How to Eat a Kumquat2," Their intense flavor makes kumquat a good pairing for bitter or peppery greens, such as endive or arugula. Slice into thin rounds with a sharp knife. Remove the seeds, then layer the slices on top of the salad to show off the color.

, Kumquat marmalade is much sweeter and less bitter than regular marmalade. The recipe is similar to most marmalades or jams.


Since the kumquat seeds contain pectin, you can boil them along with the fruit to thicken your preserves. Keep the seeds in a cheesecloth bag while boiling, so they don't end up in your jar., Pickling takes at least three days, but the result is quite unique. This particular recipe keeps some of the kumquat's sweet flavor.

, The acidic kumquat adds a nice flavor to lamb and poultry dishes. Add it 30 minutes before the meat is done braising or simmering.Seafood pairs especially well with kumquat, but it doesn't need to marinate in it. Add the fruit at the last minute instead, either as a garnish or blended in a vinaigrette.

, Wash plenty of kumquats and cut them in half — at least 10 fruits per cup (240mL) of vodka.Cover with vodka and let sit in a cool, dark place, shaking once a day. It should pick up a faint taste after a couple days, a strong taste after a week or two, and steadily continue to infuse for many weeks or months.


If you enjoy sweet liquor, add some sugar as well, up to ¼ cup (25g) sugar per cup (240mL) of vodka., In the United States, the first appearance of kumquats coincides with Thanksgiving preparations. Take advantage of this to add pizazz to your holiday cranberry sauce, or use the same basic approach to make chutneys and desserts:


Slice 1½ cups (360mL) kumquats. Discard the seeds and stem.
Simmer in a covered saucepan with ¼ cup (60mL) water, until the kumquats soften.Add one of the following:

A can of cranberry sauce

Or dried cherries, grated ginger, black pepper, and cinnamonOr ¾ to 1 cup (150–200g) sugar to make candied kumquats



Simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes, until chutneys become a little translucent. Add more water whenever the pan starts to look dry.

, Cut large kumquats in half horizontally. Scoop out the sour, juicy flesh with a narrow teaspoon or grapefruit spoon, and add it to smoothies, fruit salad or ice cream. Freeze the hollow rinds in airtight containers, then use the rinds to hold sorbet or other desserts.


Alternatively, leave the flesh in the cut kumquats. Dip the ends in a beaten mix of egg white and honey, then in a mixture of raw sugar and cinnamon. Freeze and eat as a fancy dessert.,"

Look for the cane in the grocery store.,
Identify the sugar cane.,
Choose a healthy and flavorful stalk.",How to Eat a Sugar Cane1," Look for raw sugar cane in many grocery stores. Find the raw stalks in the produce section.


Check Latin grocery stores, farmers markets, or any other place that sells fresh produce.Find sugar cane more commonly in areas known to grow it, which are typically temperate in climate. In the United States, this includes Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Texas.;
, Look for the long stalks of raw sugar cane. The product that appears in stores is a leafless and hard stalk, typically cut to under a couple feet long.


Many people often recognize sugar cane for its resemblance to bamboo, with jointed, green to brown stalks.
Expect the sugar cane to be one to two inches thick, with a hard exterior., Look for the best quality in a sugar cane by examining the color, weight, and moisture of the stalk and inner flesh. Find the best stalk of what’s available for the best taste.


Choose stalks that are light green fading to yellow, with reddish-brown patches. Avoid ones that are white, cracked, or blackened in some areas.
Pick up stalks in your hand to feel the weight. Favor thinner, heavier stalks over thicker, lighter ones for more moisture. Also choose a stalk with longer jointed sections for easier cutting and eating.
Ask a produce clerk to make a cut at either end of a stalk for you. Pick one that has off-white, moist, opaque flesh inside. Avoid dry flesh that is brown or red in color."

Sit down for each meal.,
Try to eat with others.,
Do not do anything else while you eat.,
Get a drink for yourself.,
Chew more.,

Set down your utensils between bites.,
Time yourself.,
Eat every 2 to 3 hours.,
Do not let yourself get too hungry.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Snack on shelled foods.",How to Eat Slowly," If you're eating on the run, or in front of the TV, you're more likely to scarf your food. You will not pay as close attention to your food in an area filled with distractions. Make a point of sitting down at your kitchen table for every meal.Even if it's just you eating, make a point of setting the table. This can make the experience of eating feel more personal and intimate, which may encourage you to eat slowly.
You can also do something to make meal time feel special. For example, light a candle or set down flowers. You can also cook your own food. If you made a meal yourself, you may be more likely to savor each bite.;
, If you're engaged in conversation while eating, this may slow you down some. Whenever possible, try to eat with other people.If you live with your family, try to make family meal nights a regular occurrence. Not only will this slow down your eating, it can also increase the feeling of family togetherness.
If you live with roommates, consider having a dinner with your roommates a few nights a week. Everyone can agree to prepare a dish.
If you live alone, try inviting friends over for dinner or eating out at a healthy restaurant a few nights a week.

, If you're watching television, reading, or doing something like a crossword puzzle, you're unlikely to pay attention to your food. This can encourage you to scarf your food down instead of taking the time to enjoy it.Eliminate distractions before meal time. Leave your phone in the other room, turn off your laptop, and turn off your television set.
Do not bring reading materials to the table. Try to make meal time into a ritual where you make a point of appreciating your meal.
Try to look at your food just before eating. Strive to appreciate the meal in and of itself.

, Never neglect a beverage when eating. Drinking can help slow the pace of your eating as you'll have to stop to take sips of a drink. Liquid can can also help fill you up, which can prevent overeating. Before sitting down for a meal, make sure to pour yourself a drink.It's a good idea to go for low calorie or calorie-free beverages, especially if slow eating is part of a weight loss regimen. Water, diet soda, and seltzer water are good options.

, Chewing your food more will help bring your focus back to your meal. It will also help you delay the time between taking a bite and swallowing. Try to chew between 10 to 15 seconds before swallowing.It can also help to opt for meals made from foods that are difficult to swallow. For example, try to eat a diet rich in vegetables, fresh fruits, and lean proteins. Softer foods, like casseroles and mashed potatoes, may be harder to chew for prolonged periods.
Concentrate on the flavor and texture when you chew. Try to be aware of the fact you are eating, and stop to think about how much you're enjoying your food.

, This is why pouring yourself a drink before a meal can help. Water is especially helpful, as it contains no calories. Between each bite, make sure to take a sip of water. This will slow down the pace of your eating and help fill you up faster.It can help to flavor your water to make it more enticing. You can buy flavored water at the supermarket. You can also add pieces of fruit or vegetables to tap water to give it extra flavor.

, This is a small change, but it can really slow down the pace of your eating. If you hold onto your utensils for the entire meal, you will go into shoveling mode. Setting down your utensils between each bite will force you to stop and savor the meal a little more.You can also try eating with smaller utensils. This can encourage you to take smaller bites.
Try switching up the utensils you use. You can, for example, eat with chopsticks for a change to slow down the pace of your eating.

, If you're really struggling with the pace of your eating, try actually setting a timer. This will challenge you to increase the amount of time you spend eating your food.


Ideally, it should take you around 20 minutes to finish a meal. Try setting the kitchen clock for 20 minutes. Keep an eye on the clock as you eat, and strive to take 20 minutes to finish your plate.You can try to eat your food in servings. For example, eat your salad first, then your side dishes, then your main course.

, Waiting long periods between eating can leave you feeling starved. If you're extra hungry, you're more likely to wolf down food. Instead of eating 3 large meals a day, make a point of eating a small meal every 2 to 3 hours.Make sure to be aware of calories. If you're eating every 2 to 3 hours, you need to keep the caloric content of your meals lighter than you would when eating 3 meals a day.
In addition to helping you eat more slowly, this can rev up your metabolism.

, If you end up starving by the end of the day, you're likely to binge eat. If your stomach is growling and you're feeling extreme hunger pangs, you've let yourself go too long between meals. When you feel a small amount of hunger building, start planning on what to eat. Strive to have a snack within the next half hour or so., Small portions can force you to savor your food and eat more slowly. Work on being aware of serving sizes. Strive to eat nutrient dense meals in smaller portions.Make sure to read nutrition labels. This will give you the idea of an actual serving size. A bag of chips may say it's only 150 calories, but the serving size may be half the bag.
Use small visual cues to determine portion size. A serving of carbohydrates is about the size of a hockey puck. A serving of protein should be no bigger than a deck of cards., If you feel hungry between meals, have a snack. Stick to something like peanuts or pistachios. If you have to open the shell of a food to eat it, you will have to slow the pace of your eating.Be careful, however, when eating nuts. They tend to be high in calories.
You can also try eating foods that you eat one at a time. For example, snack on blueberries but don't eat them in handfuls. Focus on one blueberry at a time.

Hold your fork in your left hand.,
Use the fork with the tines facing down.,
Pick up knife in your right hand.,
Eat your meal.",How to Hold a Fork1," Most European eaters keep the knife in their right hand for cutting, and they keep the fork in their left hand for eating. In the American style, eaters switch the fork over to their right hand to eat the pieces that they have cut. Traditionally, this is the main difference between the European and American forking styles. The European style is often considered more efficient because you don't have to remove the fork from you hand until you are done eating.








If you're setting the table for ""European-style"" eating: make sure to arrange the fork on the left-hand side of the plate, and the knife on the right-hand side.;
, This is traditional European etiquette. Be aware, however, that many modern Europeans not longer pay much heed to which way their tines are facing.Hold the handle between your thumb and your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Place your index finger at the end of the handle where it meets the base of the fork tines. Let the end of the handle rest in the crease of your palm.









The lower you place your index finger on the fork handle, the more leverage you'll have as you eat your food.

, Hold it in your hand in the same closed-fist manner that you hold your fork. Use it to rake the food onto your fork. Fold or push the food onto the tines of your fork with your knife if it is a salad or soft food. Use a gentle sawing motion with the knife if you are cutting meat, pizza or a similar food. You can actually push more food securely onto your fork with the European method than with the scooping American method.








, Insert the fork into your mouth with the tines still scooping down. Don’t turn the fork or put it into your right hand. When you are finished, rest your fork and knife parallel on the plate with the tines facing down. If you see the plate as a clock face: the tines and blade should be at 10 o’clock, and the handles at 4 o’clock.

Squeeze to pop out the fruit.,
Remove the seed.,
Eat the fruit.,
Consider roasting the seeds.,
Make rambutan jam.,
Refrigerate extra rambutans.,
Freeze rambutans for a special dessert.",How to Eat a Rambutan," Rambutans start out green, then turn red, orange, or yellow as they ripen. The hair-like ""spines"" are green when the rambutan is fresh picked, but after the spines turn black, the fruit remains good for at least a few days., Hold the rambutan firmly on a flat surface, gripping both tips. Place a sharp paring knife along the middle of the fruit, as though cutting it in half. Cut gently, severing the hairy, leathery skin without piercing the flesh. Carve halfway around the fruit to extend this slit.You can tear the skin with your thumbnail instead, or even bite open a slit. The spines are soft and harmless, but the skin is inedible and may taste bitter.

, The cut skin should tear apart easily. Pull one side completely off the fruit, as though opening a hinged lid. Inside sits a fruit similar to a grape: oval, slightly translucent, and white or pale yellow.

, Squeeze the remaining skin gently to pop the edible flesh into your hand.

, The seed in the center is not edible while raw. Cut into the flesh without severing the seed, and try to pull it out. Some rambutans (""freestone"" varieties) have seeds that slide out easily, while others (""clingstone"") stick to the flesh.If you have a clingstone rambutan, just leave the seed in and spit it out when finished.

, If you removed the seed, just pop the flesh in your mouth. If the seed is still there, note that a tough, papery coating surrounds it. Nibble the flesh around it instead to avoid biting into it.


Most rambutans are sweet and juicy, but some varieties are acidic or slightly drier.Most rambutans have bitter seeds, although some may have a little sweetness. While a minority of people do eat the raw seeds, they contain traces of potentially toxic chemicals.Eating them is not recommended, especially for children and animals.

, In some areas, the seeds are roasted and eaten, similar to how you would roast nuts. Although edible in this form, the seeds are slightly bitter and may have mild narcotic properties.More research needs to be done before this is officially approved as safe to eat., Peel 1 pound (or 500g) rambutans, and two cloves, and boil them in water until the flesh separates from the seeds. Discard the seed coatings, then transfer the seeds to a little water and cook until soft. Cook the flesh, softened seeds, and 1½ cups (or 350g) sugar. Simmer for twenty minutes or until jam-like, remove the cloves, and seal in sterilized jars.For a faster dessert, stew the fruit after peeling and boiling.

, Rambutans are only good for two weeks at most, and usually only a few days after buying them from a store. Refrigerate them whole and unpeeled in a perforated plastic bag to extend their lifespan., Freeze whole, unpeeled rambutans in a zip-locked bag. Peel them and suck on them directly from the freezer for a milky, candy-like treat."

Don’t eat it plain.,
Use it sparingly.,
Experiment with it.,
Pair Vegemite with salty foods.",How to Enjoy Vegemite1," Although it may be common practice when trying a condiment to taste just a bit on your finger or on a spoon, doing so with Vegemite will likely result in you never wanting to eat it again. Vegemite is meant to be used as a condiment or a seasoning, not as a stand-alone food. This is part of why it has such a strong taste, because it’s meant to add flavor to other foods., This is the most important thing to remember. Vegemite has a strong taste and it can be pretty unpalatable at first. To enjoy your first taste or to acquire the taste over time, be sure to start with a small amount. Because it is so strong, a little bit will go a long way in adding taste. If you overdo it when first trying it out, you may cause yourself to not want to try it again.Vegemite is like any other seasoning or condiment, too much of it will overpower the food you’re putting it on and probably ruin it. Go with just a little at first and then add slowly if you feel your food needs more.

, If you begin to enjoy the taste or you want to enjoy it more, don’t be afraid to try adding it to dishes that you already like. Think of it as any other seasoning and experiment with using it. The worst that can happen is you find out it isn’t good on certain things, but if you are lucky you might stumble upon a great combination that you wouldn’t have thought of before.


Still remember the rule of using it sparingly. Don’t add a big spoonful to the pot of stew you cooked for the family dinner because if it is too much or doesn’t add the right flavor, you’ll be out of luck.

, Vegemite is salty and savory, so it pairs best with other salty foods. Don't mix it with something sweet. It mixes well with beef and chicken dishes.

Trim the ends.,
Test for ripeness.,
Eat it skin and all.,
Spoon it out.,
Use a vegetable peeler.",How to Eat a Kiwi1," Before you dig in, check the outside of your kiwi. Note that most of the skin’s surface is a fuzzy brown, with a raised bumpy pit at the top, which is where it grew from its vine. This is the only inedible part of the kiwi, so either trim it off or eat it around it., To test kiwi, gently press it in your hands. If the flesh yields under the skin, it’s ready to eat. If it still feels hard, let it sit at room temperature until it softens. Expect underripe kiwi to taste too tart to really be enjoyed., Take the easiest approach and take sink your teeth right into it, as you would with an apple or peach. Enjoy the contrast in textures between the tougher skin and the soft flesh within. Reap the kiwi’s full nutritional value, since the skin contains a large part of its fiber, mineral, and vitamin content, as well as antioxidants and flavonoids. However:As with all produce, be aware that the outside may have traces of pesticides used in farming. Wash it under cold water while gently scrubbing the skin with your fingertips to remove trace chemicals.Organic kiwi reduces the risk of ingesting pesticides, but should still be washed in order to remove any dirt or other chemicals that it may have come into contact with by chance.

, If you don’t like fruit skins, simply chop the kiwi in half. Treat each half as a readymade bowl and spoon yourself out some bite-size chunks. Alternatively:Slice off both ends, where the kiwi was attached to its vine, and hold the kiwi in one hand.With your other hand, insert the tip of your spoon between the flesh and skin along your cut.
Press the spoon deeper into the flesh and twist the kiwi around in your hand.
Remove the flesh and cut it into slices.

, Peel the skin off as you would with a potato. Once you’re done, eat the flesh as it is or slice it up into bite-size bits. However, keep in mind that:You should still wash the skin before peeling. Even though you won’t be eating it, your vegetable peeler may transfer dirt and chemicals from the skin to the flesh as you go along.

Cut a small part off from each end.,
Cut the cane into sections.,
Cut off the outer layer.",How to Eat a Sugar Cane2," Use a sharp knife and cutting board to remove a section of at least an inch from each end of the stalk. This will remove the dried-out portions from older cuts.


You may need to score the tough outer edge of the stalk by cutting or gently sawing a few millimeters in all the way around the stalk, then breaking it along the scoring, rather than trying to chop all the way through.You may need to cut more from each end if the ends have become very hard and dried and you cannot access the juicier flesh.

, Divide a long stalk into several smaller pieces that are easier to work with. Score and break or chop through the stalk to make pieces of about six inches.


It will be easiest to cut through sections of the stalk in between the thicker joints. Keep in mind, however, that the sections between the joints will also be the easiest to chew or use for other purposes, so it’s best to keep them intact.
You can also cut the stalk lengthwise into two, four, or more thinner sticks for consumption. Do this before cutting off the outer layer, or afterwards if it’s easier to do so.

, Stand a piece of the cane on its end and cut downward to remove the outermost layer of the stalk. This eliminates the hard, green “bark” that cannot be chewed.


Cut in about a millimeter from the edge, or wherever you see that the tougher green bark is distinguished from the inner white flesh.
You may be able to peel the outer layer down and off the stalk with your fingers after making an initial cut, depending on how easily your cane’s bark separates from the flesh.

Chew the fiber to extract sweetness.,
Use the cane as a skewer.,
Try the cane as a swizzle stick.",How to Eat a Sugar Cane3," Stick a small piece of the peeled sugar cane into your mouth to chew. Biting the fibrous inner flesh, called bagasse, will release the sweet flavor.You can also try squeezing or muddling the stalk to release the sweet juice of the plant, but it may be difficult to do so, or to collect the resulting juice for consumption.Once you have chewed the fibrous material and extracted all of its sweetness, spit it out and dispose of it.

, Try using a thin section of the peeled stalk as a skewer for fruits, meats, etc. This can impart the sweet flavor of the sugar cane into other foods.


Cut sugar cane pieces into thin sticks with a sharp point on one or both ends for optimal use as a skewer. You can leave the bark on for greater strength when skewering tougher foods.
Use skewers for dessert items, like fruit kebabs or to dip strawberries in chocolate. Or freeze the skewers to more easily stick them into fish and meats for cooking or grilling the sweet flavor into proteins., Use the peeled sugar cane as a swizzle stick in any sort of beverage. This can give alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages a natural sweetness.


Try dropping a stick into unsweetened tea. You can leave it in hot or iced tea for a few minutes to extract the sweetness, or just enjoy the gradual sweetening of the stick stirred in over time.
Use a sugar cane swizzle stick in a rum-based cocktail like a mojito or planter’s punch for a gentle sweetener."

Cut food with the knife in your right hand and the fork in your left.,
Point the tines down.,
Switch your fork to your right hand to eat.,
Decide which way is more efficient.",How to Hold a Fork2," Hold the food in place with the tines of your fork. Then, saw with the knife to slice the food item into a bite-sized piece. This part is essentially the same as the European method.








, According to traditional ""etiquette,"" your tines should face down, with your palm wrapped around the end of the handle. Extend your index finger to the base of the fork.









Don't worry about which way the tines are turned. It may be easier to pick up food if you turn your tines upward, like a shovel. Most modern Americans do not pay much heed to which way the tines are facing., After you've cut the piece of food, place your knife on the edge of the plate. Switch your fork to your right hand. The end of the fork will rest in the area between your thumb and index finger. Use your right hand to bring the food to your mouth, and then switch the fork back over to your left hand so that you can cut another piece with the knife in your right hand. Repeat, switching hands each time you take a bite.









The American method may be more efficient if you cut your entire meal into pieces before you switch the fork to your right hand. This way, you won't have to keep switching the utensils back and forth.

, Many modern eaters and etiquette critics claim that the European style is less formal and more efficient than the American method. It is less disruptive to the eating process. Know that archaic social rules notwithstanding, there is truly no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to hold a fork as long as you can eat your meal."

Understand what spiciness is and is not.,
Determine how much heat you can handle.,
Add spicy foods to your daily meal plans.,
Push your limits.,
Ease your pain.,
Expand your horizons.,
If peppers, sauce, or spicy meals are just too spicy, or you just plain dislike the taste, see if you can buy spicy chips at a nearby grocery store or deli.",How to Enjoy Spicy Foods," To truly appreciate spiciness, you should know what goes on. A common misconception is that spiciness is actual heat. It is not. Rather, it is an irritation. What causes spiciness? A chemical known as capsaicin. This capsaicin causes a burning irritation. The level of capsaicin in a pepper or sauce is measured in a unit called a Scoville. Pure, undiluted capsaicin is 16,000,000 Scovilles, the spiciest anything can be. Other than that, all capsaicin is diluted by something else, be it water, oil, or whatever. This spiciness is perceived by the body as pain. Capsaicin in peppers is mainly for defense from mammals. Only mammals feel this heat, however, as they are the only animals that can detect capsaicin. Birds spread spicy pepper seeds, since they don't feel the heat, capsaicin passes harmlessly through them.;
, Try a mild sauce or pepper, and work your way up. A good thing to start with is a poblano pepper, with a very mild Scoville rating of 500.Some stores have a brief ""spicy meter"" posted near their peppers.

, If you eat spicy foods only once a week, you may be missing out. Splash some hot sauce on everything you can think of. Keep chopped or whole peppers lying around the house somewhere, or better yet, grow them yourself. By incorporating spiciness into your regular diet, you get used to it, and that helps you to eat even spicier foods.

, Part of the fun and lasting appeal is when you continually try spicier things. Keep track of its Scoville rating to track your progress. However, hurting yourself isn't recommended.

, Once you've had enough, help yourself! Contrary to popular belief, water doesn't do well in easing pain. Instead, reach for the milk. A chemical in milk, casein, disengages the capsaicin from your mouth to help it get washed away.

, Try different things, like a new sauce, or a spicy dish you've never tried. Spicy food is a great way to expand your knowledge of different cultures. Find a dish that is spicy, but also fits your taste, such as a spicy vegetable dish or a meat oriented dish.

, Very spicy, but good tasting chips include Flaming Hot Cheetos, First, Second, or Third Degree Burn Doritos, Red Hot Herrs, etc... The list is endless!

Enjoy a blackberry as part of a fruit salad.,
Bake a blackberry pie.",How to Enjoy a Blackberry," Believe it or not, there are plenty of different ways to obtain blackberries. Some people prefer to go to their local grocery store, while others prefer picking them straight off the vines.


Some people can tell a taste between organic and non-organic blackberries, but organic fruits do offer added health benefits. Non-organic blackberries use pesticides to keep the bugs away, and preservatives to prevent mold from growing.;
, In the grocery store, blackberries most often come in clear plastic containers pre-picked, with holes on the container for air to pass through. It’s best to check all around the container at all sides of the visible blackberries to avoid choosing a container with moldy berries on the bottom.


When picking from the vine, look for fully ripe, black berries with no mold. Blackberries do not ripen after they're picked.Blackberries are seasonal fruits that peak in the summertime in the United States.When not in season, you have to look carefully for signs of unripe blackberries.

, Although other fruits like bananas and avocados may be safe to pick before they’re fully ripe, blackberries will just remain unripe and unappetizing. Some signs of moldy or unripe blackberries include:


Temperature. (Berries mold more quickly when left at room temperature.)
Fuzzy growths on the berries.
Dis-colorization.
Bruising or dents in the fruit.
Soft spots and wrinkles.
Leaky juices.

, If you don’t use all the blackberries at once, then the berries can spoil very quickly. Leaving berries out at room temperature can cause them to mold overnight.


Leave only 1-2 days’ worth of berries in the refrigerator. They’ll spoil after that.
If you want to keep more for longer periods of time, you can freeze blackberries for several months without air. (Be sure to wash them first!)
Wash the berries right before you are about to consume them.Once they're washed, berries are more likely to go bad.

, It’s also wise to rinse the blackberry before freezing them, too. If you rinse before storing them in the refrigerator, you risk allowing the berry to mold quicker.


Don’t press too hard while rinsing, as blackberries can be easy to squeeze.

, There are many different uses of blackberries. They are flavorful and can enhance an entree or dish, or they can be enjoyed alone as a fruit or on a salad. You can also create blackberry jams. Adding blackberries to yoghurt can also enhance the taste of a plain but healthy dish.


You can find more recipes and uses for blackberries on recipe sites such as Allrecipes., You can start by taking a small bite out of the side of the berry, and work your way around the center, avoiding the seeds. The center and seeds of blackberries can be bitter to some.


Alternatively, you can put the whole blackberry in your mouth and enjoy the full taste, including the center and the seeds.
For the most health benefits, eat the entire blackberry. Blackberries are very high in Vitamin C and other essential nutrients., If you have some blackberries left over, you can easily make a blackberry jam with leftover or frozen berries. Sometimes, it can be easy as mashing up the leftover berries and using it on toast.


Berry jams can be made from virtually any berries. All you need is a pot, stove, mason jar, berries and sugar. Place the berries and 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the pot over medium heat, and watch until the sugar dissolves. Leave the jam to simmer for 15 minutes, then remove it from the heat., Many times, blackberries can complement a fruit salad alongside blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.You can add mangos and cantaloupe for more color and a different texture. This dish is nutritious and refreshing, especially in the summertime.


You can add blackberries to nonfat yoghurt and muesli, or just put them on top of a crumpet with a dollop of yoghurt.Blackberries can naturally sweeten and enhance your breakfast or mid-morning snack.
Remember, you can enjoy the blackberry whole, or eat around the center or the seeds if you want to avoid a bitter aftertaste.

, Similar to apple or strawberry pies, blackberries can be used as a primary ingredient for a summertime dessert pie. Add some whipped cream and enjoy as you would any other fruit pies.


Most recipes for blackberry pies are as simple as blackberries, sugar, flour, milk, and pie crust. Combining the berries, sugar and flour into the pie shell and placing it in the oven for 15-35 minutes can emerge a wonderfully baked blackberry pie."

Eat from a smaller plate.,

Slow down.,

Stay hydrated.,

Increase Your Intake of Soups and Salads.,

Have your treats.,

Eat smart when dining out.,

Get enough sleep.,

Use a food diary.",How to Control Food Portions," Studies have shown that eating from a smaller plate tricks your brain into thinking you have a bigger meal to consume. A bigger plate will allow us to eat more; and we can easily underestimate the calories in our over-sized portions.
, It is a known fact that it can take your body up to 20 minutes to register that you had enough to eat. Rushing down your meal will only have you reaching for that second helping in no time., Consuming plenty of water and herbal tea will help keep you satisfied throughout the day. Staying hydrated will prevent you from eating when you are not actually hungry, since hunger is very easily confused with thirst., Filling up on lightly dressed salads or a bowl of vegetables or low fat chicken soup before main meals is an effective way to keep you from overeating. The fiber in the vegetables will help to curb your appetite and leave you feeling satisfied sooner. Try combining a salad as a starter and a nourishing soup as your main meal., We all have foods that are simply too irresistible to avoid. Whatever your temptation, it’s very important for you to occasionally treat yourself. However, try to limit this to once a week. These days there are a lot of products that come in bite-sizes, so it’s best to indulge in one of these small servings when needed., Eating at a restaurant does not mean you should consume the largest portion available. Rather share a meal with your dining partner, or try ordering a starter meal as your main meal. You can also order a half portion or a children’s portion. Although not all restaurants will charge less for half portions, your waistline will thank you later., Have you ever noticed how you tend to eat more when you are tired? We use food – especially carbohydrates – to deal with energy slumps and while you might get a quick burst of energy, this will soon fade. Being well rested will keep that “afternoon slump” at bay and keep you away from temptation. Studies also indicate that fatigue stimulates the production of the hunger inducing hormone, Ghrelin in the human body. If you tend to eat when you are not hungry, try doing something to distract you from the temptation to eat., Writing down when, what, where and why you eat will make you aware of the foods you consume and the amount. This will help you to identify the times you eat too much and why, so that you can adjust your diet accordingly. You can also rotate your food schedules each week to break up the monotony."

Smell the durian.,
Shake the durian.,
Check for any holes or rot on the shell of the durian.",How to Choose a Durian," First, do a smell test. Smell along the indentations of the durian where the durian seeds are nearest. If the smell is strong, it's ripe. If it smells raw, that means it’s unripe. Some unscrupulous dealers will try to unload unripe ones to you. It happens when winds or heavy rain are so strong that it causes the durians to fall even when they are not yet ripe. There is no point in buying an unripe durian because it does not have any taste at all.

, You may want to wear gloves or hold two pieces of cloths to protect your hands for this one. Give the durian a sudden jerk. There should be a slight knock if it’s just right. If there is no knock, then it’s probably overripe and if it’s very shaky, then it’s not ripe at all.

, It could mean that the durian is ripe but has been attacked by parasites or eaten by squirrels. If you do not want to share your durian with parasites, or buy it half eaten, check for holes on the shell. One thing to note is that if a durian is attacked by parasites, it would also mean that the plantation does not use any pesticides which could be better for health.

Foods shipped long distances are often picked while they are unripe, stored for long periods of time, and handled extensively.
Even fruits and vegetables undergo processing. Waxes and dyes may be added, and fruits picked unripe may be ripened with ethylene gas. Because of this extra handling, they may not be as fresh as locally grown foods, and they may be at greater risk of carrying diseases and contaminants.
Buying fresh, locally grown food supports local farmers.
Locally grown foods are ""greener"", since less energy is required for shipping, handling, packaging, etc.;
, It need not be all or nothing, especially at first.


Decide what you consider local. A 100-mile radius is a good, approximate number to aim for, but depending on where you live, it may not be possible or practical to choose only those foods grown that close.
Decide whether to make exceptions for foods that simply don't grow in your area. Depending on the climate where you live, you'll probably need to make exceptions or do without certain foods. You can favor local foods that are available while still including more exotic foods for variety.

, In many cases, you can purchase good produce directly from the growers. If you have any questions about where things come from or how they are grown, ask the sellers.


Look for unusual varieties and be open-minded about trying new foods. Ask to sample fruit you are considering, especially if you are unsure about an unfamiliar variety.
Ask for advice on preparing and caring for the vegetables being offered, especially if you find something you don't normally purchase or use.

, Get to know the proprietor(s) and ask questions. You can learn a lot about what went into your foods.

, It's less and less economical to ship stuff long distances, so even your grocery store may have local foods. The produce manager, if you can find him or her, should know where the foods there came from.



Asking good questions can also help remind your grocer that fresh, local foods are their customers' preference. They may be more inclined to favor local sources and post information about foods if they get such inquiries frequently.

, Those little stickers with the produce code may be annoying, but they often mention where food is grown. Bags, cartons, and other packaging materials around the foods may also include information about the source of the foods.

, Many foods are both, but one does not necessarily imply the other.

, Since apples are a late summer to autumn fruit, an apple purchased in June might have been in storage since last October. You'll get the freshest, ripest foods at the best prices by buying foods when they're in season. If you have the chance to talk to growers at a produce stand or farmer's market, ask them. Otherwise, read some gardening books and look up seasons for particular foods of interest.


Many fruits and vegetables have been cultivated to mature over a wider season, so strawberries for sale in August may still be fresh picked even if the ones you grow at home ripen in June. If you'd like to know, ask.

, Even a pot on an apartment balcony can yield some of the best-tasting foods you'll ever eat, and there is no place more local than your own garden. If you grow your own foods, you control exactly what goes into them.


If you have no garden space of your own, find out if there is a community garden in your area or start one.
Get together with neighbors and trade crops, especially if you find yourself with too much of any one thing.
Some food banks accept donations from home gardeners. If you have an overrun of something from your garden, find out whether you can share it with others.

, You may be able to find local sources of many things besides just fruits and vegetables. You could even raise your own chickens.

,


Choose foods that are locally processed (canned, baked, and dried goods are often available at produce stands and farmer's markets) or homemade.
Do your own cooking whenever possible. Restaurants and prepared meals might contain ingredients from anywhere.

Can, dry, and freeze your own foods.
Prefer fresh foods to preserved foods when they are available. Use foods preserved by natural methods to fill in when fresh foods are not in season or when you lack the time or resources to prepare fresh foods.

Generally, the package instructions of most foods contain a description of how it should be prepared. Use the package instructions to guide you in the preparation.

, Some recipes may call for supplemental ingredients, like eggs, to be cooked or boiled before being served with the base. However, many toppings can be added straight to your bowl, like fruits, berries, and nuts.

",How to Dip Oreos in Chocolate," Chocolate melts more easily if it’s cut into pieces rather than in a solid block. Use a sharp knife to roughly chop the chocolate of your choice into pieces. Place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl.You can use good quality milk, dark, semisweet, bittersweet, or even white chocolate to dip your Oreos in.
You may find it easier to use candy melts to coat your Oreos. They are chocolate discs that are made to melt easily, and come in a wide array of flavors and colors so you can create dipped Oreos for holidays and special occasions.
Chocolate chips also work well for dipped Oreos because you don’t have worry about chopping them beforehand.;
, The easiest way to melt the chocolate is in the microwave. Heat the bowl of chocolate on high in 30 second intervals, making sure to stir the chocolate well after each interval. Continue heating the chocolate until it’s fully melted and smooth.Stirring the chocolate after each 30-second period in the microwave is important. The chocolate can sometimes still look lumpy until you give it a good stir and it smoothes out. You don’t want to burn the chocolate by heating it too long.

, Once the chocolate is completely melted, add 2 teaspoons (10 g) of unsalted butter that’s been melted to it. Stir the mixture well until the butter is fully incorporated and the chocolate has a smooth, even consistency.Adding the butter is optional. It helps thin out the chocolate so it coats the cookies more evenly. If your chocolate mixture appears thin enough to cover the Oreos on its own, you can omit the butter if you like.
You can flavor the melted chocolate. For example, mix in ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of peppermint extract into the chocolate for minty dipped Oreos.

, When you dip the cookies in the chocolate, you’ll need some place to put them where they won’t make too much of a mess. Take a large cookie or baking sheet, and line it with a piece of parchment paper to keep the Oreos from sticking to it.You can substitute a silicone baking sheet for the parchment paper if you prefer.

, Place the bowl of melted chocolate on your work surface beside approximately 24 Oreos. The easiest way to dip the cookies into the chocolate without getting your hands dirty is to sandwich one between two forks and carefully lower it into the melted chocolate until it is fully coated. Set the dipped cookies on the lined baking sheet.The melted chocolate shouldn’t be too hot or too cold when you dip the cookies. If it’s too hot, it will slide right off the Oreos. If it’s too cold, it will create a lumpy, uneven coat around the cookies.
If the chocolate starts to thicken up as you’re dipping the cookies, reheat it in the microwave in 10-second intervals until it’s the right consistency once more.
Be sure to tap the forks against the side of the bowl before placing it on the baking sheet. That will knock off any excess chocolate that might create bumps on the Oreos as they cool.
When the chocolate is still soft on the Oreos, you can add toppings if you’d like. For example, you might sprinkle chopped nuts, sprinkles, sea salt, or crushed peppermint candies on the dipped cookies.

, Once you’ve dipped all of the Oreos, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator. Allow the cookies to chill for approximately an hour so the chocolate can set up. Serve the cookies or package them to hand out as gifts.The cookies will keep in an airtight container for up to a week.
When the dipped Oreos are chilled, you can drizzle additional melted chocolate over them if you’d like. For example, if you’ve dipped your cookies in dark chocolate, you might want to drizzle melted white chocolate over them.

, To get more even, smooth dipped Oreos, it helps to use a plastic mold meant for candy-making. Fill the wells in your mold with approximately 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the melted chocolate. Use a spoon to smooth the chocolate into place.You can find molds that are designed for Oreos and other sandwich cookies at a variety of stores and websites that carry candy-making supplies.

, With a layer of melted chocolate in the mold, set one cookie in each well. Press down on the cookie gently so the chocolate comes up around its sides.While the chocolate should come up around the sides of the Oreos, it shouldn’t cover the tops of them completely.

, Once the Oreos are pressed into the melted chocolate, use a spoon to carefully add a little more chocolate to the top of the cookies. Spread the chocolate with the spoon to fill in any gaps.You just want to add enough chocolate to the cover the tops of the cookies. Don’t pile too much chocolate on the tops of cookies or they can wind up lopsided.
If the melted chocolate starts to thicken up as you’ve covering the Oreo, reheat it in the microwave in 10 second intervals until it’s the right consistency to spread.

, After you’ve covered all of the cookies with more melted chocolate, place the mold in the refrigerator to chill them so they set up. It can take as little as 5 minutes for the chocolate to harden, but you may want to leave them in the refrigerator for up to an hour., When the chocolate has set up, remove the mold from the refrigerator. Turn the mold over over a cooling rack and carefully pop the cookies out of the wells. Set the Oreos on a serving plate or place in bags to give as gifts.If you want to give your molded, dipped Oreos an even fancier look, use chocolate transfer sheets to add patterns to the smooth top of the dipped cookies. The transfer sheets, available where candy-making supplies are sold, come in a variety of patterns and colors that suit virtually any holiday or special occasion.
To use the transfer sheets, add a dollop of melted chocolate to the top of the set cookies. Press a piece of the transfer sheet to the Oreo over the melted chocolate, and pull away the sheet. The pattern will be imprinted on the top of the cookie.

Add chocolate to your oatmeal.,
Serve red velvet pancakes.,
Bake cupcake muffins.,
Try dipped fruit slices.",How to Eat Dessert for Breakfast2," Stir a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder into your oats in place of the usual honey or sugar. Raw chocolate has many dietary properties that are good for your overall wellbeing. You'll still get all the beneficial fiber and carbohydrates of the oats, just with a little extra sweetness.You could also use a spoonful of Nutella for a more decadent hazelnut flavor.
Top chocolate oatmeal with other delicious additions like chopped walnuts, crushed peppermint candies or shredded coconut.

, Mix up pancake batter, then add a tablespoon of cocoa, a few drops of vanilla extract and dash of red food coloring. Grill the pancakes as usual and finish with cream cheese frosting and powdered sugar. When you dig in, you'll hardly be able to tell the difference between your decked-out pancakes and the real deal.Thin out the cream cheese by blending it with milk and butter. This will make it spreadable., Muffins and cupcakes are made the same way, so this one's a no-brainer. It's your favorite morning muffin recipe, only dressed up like a decadent dessert.

Include a source of healthy protein.,
Brew some coffee or tea.,
Don’t overdo it.",How to Eat Dessert for Breakfast3," Pair your sweets of choice with a few slices of bacon or sausage, an egg white omelette or cup of Greek yogurt. The dessert will satisfy your sweet tooth, while the protein will fill you up and keep hunger under control longer.Choose dessert food items that are also rich in protein, like eggs, nuts and milk.
Without protein, you’ll be more likely to get hungry again after just a couple of hours.

, A little caffeine can help you perk up when you first roll out of bed. The acidity will help offset the sweetness of the dessert so that it isn’t overpowering. Caffeine is even good for aiding digestion, which may be useful in the event that all that sugar gives you a slight stomach ache.Turn your morning coffee into its own dessert by adding whipped cream, marshmallows, chocolate shavings, crushed graham crackers and other goodies.There are also caffeine-free options available, such as decaf coffee and herbal teas.

, Unlike what your mother used to tell you growing up, having dessert for breakfast isn’t necessarily a bad idea. Just keep your portion sizes modest and make sure you’re getting other essential nutrients along with the plentiful carbohydrates. Otherwise, you may find that you lack energy or have trouble sleeping.If you choose to have dessert for breakfast, take a pass later on in the day.
Studies have shown that eating a small dessert with your breakfast can actually help you lose weight by keeping you satisfied and reducing intense cravings."

",How to Choose Toppings for Crumpets," Check that they are in date and that they are soft. Harder crumpets will stay hard when you toast them, although whether or not this bothers you is a question of personal taste.

, The most simple way to have a crumpet is to toast it and eat it without a topping. Few people enjoy this state, however, and add some butter, which is also very simple. If you don't enjoy butter, try soy or bran rice margarine.

, Savoury toppings are delicious on crumpets. Here is a selection of ideas (and butter/margarine is optional in each case):


Vegemite, Marmite, Our Mate or any other yeast extract spread
Peanut butter, macadamia nut butter, cashew nut butter, almond butter
Slice of tomato topped with salt and pepper
Melted cheese with slices of tomato, salt and pepper
Cheese and gherkin slices

, Owing to the fact that crumpets are fairly bland, sweet toppings work really well also. Here are some suggestions (again, butter/margarine optional):


Jams and jellies
Banana slices or mashed banana (cinnamon or nutmeg sprinkled on is delicious)
Nutella or similar sweet nutty or chocolate spread
Marmalade or lemon curd
Golden syrup, honey and maple syrup

Stock up on protein-rich dairy foods.,
Purchase no-prep required whole grains.,
Keep fruit and vegetables on hand.,
Choose leaner breakfast meats and protein.,
Keep your kitchen stocked with easy to prepare foods.,
Do some meal prep in your free time.,
Make foods in advance.,
Take some help from the freezer aisle.,
Make a batch of overnight oats.,
Layer up a breakfast parfait.,
Try a peanut butter bagel.,
Whip up a high-protein chia seed pudding.,
Make an open-faced smoked salmon sandwich.",How to Choose Healthy No‐Cook Breakfast Options," One of the best food groups for a no-cook and nutritious breakfast is the dairy group. High in protein and calcium, many of these foods work perfectly for rushed mornings.


Dairy products are great for breakfast because of their protein content. A high-protein breakfast will give you the energy you need to fuel your day, but also helps keep your appetite in check throughout the day.Dairy foods are also great for breakfast, because most of them do not require any preparation or cooking to eat.
The best items are yogurts, cottage cheese, regular cheese, kefir and milk. To make breakfast even quicker, purchase individual servings of these items (for example an individual yogurt).
To make sure you stick to the right calories and serving size, measure your portions. For dairy, measure out 8 oz or about 1 cup per serving.;
, Dairy products aren't the only food group that can make for a no-cooking required breakfast. Grains are another easy food to make your mornings easy.


To keep in line with a healthier and more nutritious breakfast, make sure to choose more nutritious grains. 100% whole grains are the best choice compared to refined grains. Look at the ingredients list — the first ingredient should say 100% whole wheat.
Whole grains are minimally processed and contain higher levels of protein and fiber compared to more refined grains (like white bread).Most breakfast grains are ready-to-eat. The best options for a no-cook breakfast include: whole grain cereals, whole grain bread, whole wheat frozen waffles, whole grain bagels, whole wheat English muffins or whole grain tortillas.
Keep servings in check with these foods as well. Measure out 1/2 cup of cereal, 1 oz of grains, one slice of bread, one English muffin or 1/2 bagel per serving., The two food groups that are the best when it comes to no-cook meals are fruits and vegetables. Both can be eaten raw so they're perfect for a nutritious and no-cook breakfast.


Fruits and vegetables are great if you want to increase the nutrient content of any meal. Both of these food groups are exceptionally high in nutrients — especially fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.The best fruits and vegetables for a no-cook breakfast include: individual canned fruit cups, small whole fruit (like an apple, orange or banana), avocado, tomatoes, or onions.
Measure out your serving sizes of these foods as well — even though they're low in calories. Fruits should be 1/2 cup or one small piece per serving and vegetables should be about 1 cup or 2 cups of greens per serving.If you're choosing canned fruit, look for choices that are not in heavy syrup. They should be in water or fruit juice.

, A common breakfast food is the protein group. Although many of these foods need to be cooked, there are some tricks to incorporate these foods without spending your morning cooking.


Like dairy foods, other protein-based foods (like eggs, bacon or sausage) have high amounts of protein that will help fuel your morning.
However, many of these common breakfast meats are high in fat, sodium and additives. Although they do have protein, these generally aren't considered the most nutritious breakfast item.Instead, stick to leaner, more nutritious protein sources at breakfast. These are the best options for a no-cook meal: pre-cooked turkey bacon, pre-cooked turkey sausage, Canadian bacon, hard boiled eggs, lox or smoked salmon, nuts and nut butters and ham.
Always measure the portion size of these foods as well. Measure out 3 – 4 oz per serving or about 1/2 cup., Whenever your goal is to make quick meals or do little to no cooking, you need to make sure your kitchen is stocked with the right type of foods.


Keeping your refrigerator, pantry and freezer stocked makes meal prepping and mealtime a lot easier.
Every week, set aside some time to evaluate your stock. Take a look through your refrigerator, pantry and freezer to see what you need. Then write up a corresponding grocery list to help you at the supermarket.

, If you don't want to spend time each morning cooking breakfast, you'll need to do meal prep in your free time. Doing this regularly will help make mornings a lot easier.


In addition to having a stocked kitchen, carve out some time from your weekly schedule to do meal prep.
Meal prepping can be very minimal or more extensive depending on what you want to eat through the week and how much work you want to get done ahead of time.
For example, meal prepping could consist of just washing your produce. Or, it could consistent of making a full breakfast meal (like yogurt parfaits or oatmeal) a few days before so all you have to do is serve them. Another example would be to put the ingredients of a smoothie in a blender the night before and keep refrigerated. Then, the next morning you can quickly blend it up for an on-the go, no-cook breakfast.
Egg dishes can be prepared in muffin tins and then frozen. You can microwave them in the morning right out of the freezer.
Plan an hour or two each week to have set aside to do your meal prep. You'll see after just a week or two how helpful this will be.

, If you want to, consider making your breakfasts completely ahead of time. So instead of just doing a little prep, your breakfasts are already done and ready to eat every morning.There are a variety of breakfast meals that you can make 100% in advance.


You can make anything ahead of time. For example you can make: oatmeal, muffins, egg sandwiches, yogurt parfaits or homemade granola in advance. Normally, these foods would require you to cook them the day of.
If you do want to make foods in advance, you need to make sure you store everything correctly. Keep most items in a sealed airtight container in the refrigerator.
Also, don't prep for more than one week a time if you're only refrigerating items. If needed, freeze items so you can have multiple weeks of meals ready.

, Don't think that the only nutritious or healthy breakfast meal is one that you make from scratch everyday. There are plenty of nutritious items that you can get right from the store.


Food manufacturers are making mealtime a lot easier by having complete, frozen or refrigerated meals ready for you. If you don't enjoy cooking and don't want to do a lot of meal prep, take some help from the store.
Consider some of the following frozen or refrigerated meals: frozen individual breakfast sandwiches, frozen breakfast bowls, frozen breakfast burritos, frozen and cooked breakfast sausage or bacon, pre made yogurt parfaits, individual yogurts or cottage cheese cups or frozen waffles.

, Overnight oatmeal is the perfect no-cook breakfast meal. Prepare this meal the night or weekend before so you have a high-fiber meal ready to go the next morning.In a tupperware container, bowl, or mason jar, add the following ingredients: 1/2 cup of rolled oats, 1/4 cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of your favorite sliced fruit and 1 teaspoon of chia seeds.
Mix together, cover, and place in the refrigerator for at least 4 – 6 hours, but preferably overnight.
Serve cold the next day. You can add a drizzle of honey or add a dash of cinnamon if you'd like.

, Another nutritious no-cook breakfast meal is yogurt parfaits. You can make these the night before or the morning of depending on your time.


In a small bowl or mason jar, place 1/4 cup of vanilla greek yogurt. You can use regular yogurt, but greek yogurt has more protein.
On top of the yogurt, drop in a few raspberries and blueberries. On top of the berries, sprinkle on 1 tablespoon of chopped nuts. Repeat these layers two to three times depending on the size of your jar.
Place yogurt parfait in the refrigerator and cover it if you're not going to eat it right away. Once you're ready to eat, top the parfait with 1/4 cup of granola for some extra crunch.

, If you really want to do minimal work when preparing a breakfast meal, nothing is quicker or easier than a peanut butter bagel. Plus, this can be eaten on the go.


To keep this meal nutritious, look for bagel thins. Also, try to go for the 100% whole wheat bagel thins if you can find them. If you like, you can toast the bagel, but this is especially good with a softer bagel.
Spread 1 tablespoon of all natural peanut or almond butter on each half of the bagel.
Then, slice a banana into 1/4 inch rounds. Place one half of the banana rounds on each half of the bagel thin. Sprinkle on a dash of cinnamon for extra flavor. Enjoy.

, Similar to overnight oats, this chia pudding is a great no-cook and make ahead breakfast meal. Plus, the chia seeds provide a nice source of protein and fiber.In a small bowl or mason jar, mix together the following ingredients: 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of chia seeds, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of honey.
Transfer your chia seed pudding to the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, however overnight is best.
When you're ready to eat, take out your chia seed pudding and give it a thorough stir. Sometimes a few of the seeds stick together.
Top your pudding with 1/2 cup of your favorite sliced fruit, an extra drizzle of honey and a dash of cinnamon if desired. Enjoy cold.

, If you want to get some healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids into your morning meal, trying putting together this open-faced smoked salmon sandwich.To start, toast one piece of whole grain, dark rye bread. You can serve this on non-toasted bread, but a little crunch as the base is tasty.
Spread on 1 – 2 tablespoons of light whipped cream cheese. Press 1 teaspoon of capers into the cream cheese so they don't roll off your sandwich.
If you like, you can top the cream cheese layer with a few thin slices of tomato and red onion.
Lastly, layer on 3 oz of thinly sliced smoked salmon or lox. Grind a little fresh black pepper on top and serve.

Obtain a box of Oreo cookies from the local grocery store or gas station.,
Once you have safely arrived at home, place the Oreo cookies on the table.,
After the milk has been poured, open the box of cookies.,
Lower the cookie gently into the milk until about half the cookie is submerged.,
Be patient!,
Once the cookie has been removed from the milk, gingerly raise the cookie to your mouth, careful not to break the soggy cookie in half.,
Or, you can be very daring and gently hold the Oreo between your thumb and index-finger and dunk the whole Oreo inside the milk to just past your fingernails.",How to Dunk an Oreo Cookie," Make sure they are the original cookies and not the new vanilla Oreos. While at the store, pick up a gallon or half gallon of milk. (2 L - 4 L) If you think you are going to spill much of the milk, go with the gallon (4 L), but if you are a neat and tidy eater, go with the half gallon (2 L). If you already have milk, make sure it's fresh.;
, Grab a glass from the cupboard and fill the glass with milk to about a half an inch (12.7 mm) from the top. This is the optimal height for dunking the cookie.

, Pick one cookie up gently so as not to break or chip it. Raise the cookie until it is positioned approximately 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) from the rim of the glass.

, If you submerge the whole cookie at once, air will become trapped inside the cookie and will not allow the milk to soak in.

, Do not swirl the cookie around or move it around in the milk. You could risk breaking the cookie and losing it forever in the depths of your glass of milk. After exactly 6 seconds have elapsed, slowly remove the cookie from the milk.

, Place the cookie on your tongue, chew, and enjoy!!

, Small bubbles will then rise to the surface. When it stops bubbling quickly take the Oreo out of the milk and place it in your mouth. Always keep a napkin close to you so you can wipe the excess milk off your fingers. This is a time sensitive maneuver but it creates optimum milk cookie ratio for the greatest taste! You can also try ""Peanut butter Oreos"" the same way...very delicious!

Confirm that cocoa byproducts are the top ingredients.,
Buy chocolate that has been made recently.,
Expect to pay more for high-quality chocolate.,
Do not buy chocolate that has been “Dutched.” If chocolate has undergone “Dutching,” the raw cacao beans have been processed with alkali.,
Buy semisweet or unsweetened chocolate for baking needs.",How to Buy Good Chocolate1," Good chocolate will have cocoa solids (the actual chocolate) and cocoa butter (the creaminess of the chocolate) as top ingredients.High-quality dark chocolate consists simply of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and possibly vanilla, lecithin (an ingredient that keeps the chocolate from separating), and sugar.


If you browse the list of ingredients and see many ingredients you do not recognize, consider purchasing a different chocolate.
Milk or milk solids may be an ingredient in milk and white chocolates. Avoid chocolates that have sugar as the top ingredient or include additional fats or Dutch cocoa.;
, Check the date the chocolate was made: the more recently the chocolate was made, the fresher it will be. Aged chocolate will lose some of its quality and taste. Dark chocolate should be eaten within 1 year after purchasing, and both milk and white chocolate should be eaten within 6 months after purchasing.The production date is a bigger factor for retail chocolates that are expected to have a longer shelf life than handmade or specialty chocolates.

, Good chocolate will cost more than commercial grade chocolate, as it should. If you are looking for top-quality chocolate, expect to pay more for the quality.If you’re buying a well-made bar of dark chocolate, for example, you will likely pay three or four times what you would for a mass-produced milk chocolate bar.


A high price doesn't guarantee high-quality chocolate, though. Some sellers may try to sell commercial grade chocolates at a higher price. Price inflation can be especially prevalent if the chocolates are “pretty,” such as bonbons or truffles.

, Treatment with alkali results in a lower-quality chocolate, which you should avoid purchasing.Treating chocolate with alkali substantially reduces its health benefits. The process removes many of the compounds in chocolate (especially flavanol) that are good for your heart., If you’re purchasing chocolate to put in baked goods—like brownies or chocolate cake batter—you’ll most likely need a semisweet or unsweetened dark chocolate. Baking chocolate is typically sold in bars and will have a very high cocoa percentage, often over 70% cacao. Follow your recipe's directions, and buy a variety of baking chocolate that corresponds with the suggested cacao percentage.Baking chocolates will be located in the baking section of any grocery store. If you’d like to find an organic or all-natural brand, check the organic section, or visit a health-food grocery store.
Depending on the recipe you’re following, you can also bake with semi-sweet chocolate chips, wafers, or cocoa powder."

Smell the chocolate.,
Evaluate the surface of the chocolate.,
Listen to and watch how the chocolate breaks.,
Taste the chocolate for a bitter flavor.",How to Buy Good Chocolate2," High-quality chocolate will have a strong, pleasant aroma. A lack of discernible smell indicates old or poor-quality chocolate. Chocolate that smells of anything else means it has not been stored well. Chocolate absorbs the odor and flavor of its environment, so pay attention to whatever is on display nearby.In some high-end chocolate establishments, the owner may allow you to open a bar or package of chocolate that you’d like to buy so that you can evaluate the chocolate. In most stores, of course, opening chocolates prior to purchasing them is discouraged.

, Good chocolate will have a glossy surface. The surface should also be consistent with no blemishes. If the surface of the chocolate you’re inspecting seems uneven or flaky, you’re likely looking at a low-quality confection.If a wrapper is impeding your ability to see the surface of the chocolate, you will have to use one of the other tips on buying good chocolate to help you determine the chocolate’s quality.

, In order to determine if the chocolate is of high quality, you need to break it in half. The action will result in a clean snapping sound in a high-quality chocolate. The chocolate should also break clean and in a straight line.If the chocolate bends or falls apart when you break it, the quality is inferior.
Milk or white chocolates will also often bend, rather than snap, when pressure is exerted.

, A high-quality dark chocolate will have a strong, bitter taste, since it has not been diluted by milk or unnecessary add-ins.Beyond taste, high quality chocolates will begin to melt in your mouth immediately. The texture should be creamy and smooth.


Personal preference also comes into play at this point. The quality here can only be decided by tasting the chocolate to see if it is of the variety you are looking for. Some people like a very dark, bitter chocolate (over 80% cacao), while others like a milder dark chocolate.
Chocolate that is inferior will taste a little off or feel grainy in your mouth.

Look for a gourmet food store or chocolatier.,
Shop at a natural-foods store.,
Special order from a supermarket or online.",How to Buy Good Chocolate3," Both of these types of establishments will focus on selling exclusively high-quality dark (and possibly milk) chocolate. The owners or managers will know a great deal about where their beans are sourced, how the chocolate is produced, and what ingredients it contains. Often these shops are locally owned and operated, so you’re unlikely to find a chocolatier chain.Gourmet food stores likely import their chocolate from around the world, giving you access to a huge variety of high-quality products. Check out Cost Plus World Market, if there’s one in your area.

, Natural-foods or health-foods stores are more likely to stock high-quality, high-cacao, non-Dutched chocolates.The majority of these chocolates will probably be sold as individually packaged bars which have been made with fair-trade ingredients. Check out stores like Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Vitamin Cottage, or Wild Oats.

Your local supermarket, on the other hand, will stock primarily mass-produced, low quality chocolate in all varieties.
However, some supermarket chains are stocking more natural, high-quality foods—chocolate included. If your grocery store has a “natural” section, look for good chocolates here.

, If you’re a more experienced chocolate shopper and you have an idea of what you’d like to try—or if you’re starting out and want to sample a dozen different brands of dark chocolate—special ordering may be your best option.Most supermarkets and natural-foods stores will be happy to accommodate your requests.

You can also find a great deal of good chocolate vendors online. Check online stores like Worldwide Chocolate, Chocosphere, or even Amazon.

Read the labels on chocolate packaging.,
Watch out for milk-related terms in chocolate ingredient lists (This includes filled chocolates or chocolate-flavored products).,
Look for chocolate that has been specifically made dairy-free.,
Start with your local supermarket.,
Look for specialty stores, especially those carrying health food or vegan food supplies.",How to Buy Milk Allergy Free Chocolate," The ingredients list and associated informative language will help you to work out which brands or styles of chocolate are milk-free. Look for such words as ""dairy-free"", ""milk-free"", ""suitable for vegans"", or similar. Equally, look for ""made in a place that uses milk"", ""processed on the same machinery where milk is used"", etc.; if you are highly allergic to milk (meaning that you have an extremely low tolerance to milk proteins), these phrases provide an indicator to avoid that brand or type of chocolate altogether because there is a real risk of some milk protein being transferred to the chocolate during manufacturing.;
, Some of the more common ingredients to be concerned about include:Whey
Milk solids (curds)
Casein, often written as sodium caseinate
Lactose, galactose (and most ingredients beginning with ""lact""-)
Caramel coloring; unless indicated otherwise, this is often derived from milk.

, Fortunately, there are a few possibilities here, including:


Dark chocolate varieties. Many dark chocolate varieties do not add milk because it reduces the bitterness or strong and delectable taste of dark chocolate. You do need to be able to handle the more bitter and stronger flavor that comes with dark chocolate varieties. (Also be aware that not all dark chocolate is milk-free; quite a few dark chocolate brands will still contain milk or milk derivatives, or will include milk in the filling or additives.)
Vegan chocolate. Any chocolate marketed to vegans must not contain dairy milk.
Soy, rice, coconut or other plant milk chocolate. Plant milk chocolates are on the increase and are even found in some supermarkets. This type of chocolate will taste different from dairy milk chocolate but you may find the flavor is even nicer, or at least comparable. Rice milk chocolate tends to be quite smooth and does not overpower the chocolate flavor.
Kosher pareve chocolate is milk-free.

, Check the labels, as explained above, for all of the brands that it stocks. You never know which ones might be milk-free. If there are none, consider asking the store manager to get some milk-free chocolate in, at least on a trial basis.

, These stores may stock dairy-free chocolate, especially if they have vegan clientele or they already cater to allergy-free customers. As well as walk-in stores, you may be able to find these stores online, either via their own websites or through an intermediary website such as an auction site.


Don't forget boutique chocolate makers. Many such makers pride themselves on using the very best chocolate from some of the renowned chocolate growing areas of the world, and they are less likely to adulterate fine quality chocolate with milk.
Check which manufacturers are happy to send their dairy-free chocolate products overseas to you if you don't find local stores (either real shopfronts or online stores) in your area or country. Be sure to check with customs about any charges on such foods coming in to your country.

Cleanse your palate.,
Examine the dark chocolate’s surface and color.,
Break the chocolate in half.,
Smell the chocolate.,
Rub the chocolate.,
Don’t chew the chocolate.,
Pay attention to the chocolate’s texture.,
Concentrate on the chocolate’s flavors.,
Write down your thoughts.",How to Taste Dark Chocolate1," Be sure that your mouth is free from residual flavors from a previous meal. This will help you taste the all of the dark chocolate's complex flavors.


Drink some water, eat an apple or some bread, or chew on a piece of ginger to help cleanse your palate.;
, Quality chocolate should have a smooth, blemish-free, shiny, and even surface. Old chocolate will appear to have a hazy surface, which is referred to as blooming. Observe the color of the chocolate, and make sure the color is even throughout.The color of the chocolate is determined by the roasting process of the cacao beans and where the beans originated. Chocolate can have a tint of pink, purple, red, or orange.

, Break the chocolate in two and listen for a loud snap. High-quality dark chocolate with higher levels of cocoa will break with smooth edges and create a loud snap. Look for smooth, fine gradients along the broken edges., Hold the chocolate up to your nose and inhale deeply through your nose. Aroma is an important component of flavor. It helps prep your other senses and enhances the various flavors., Use one finger to lightly touch the surface of the chocolate. Quality chocolate will have a smooth, even surface that is free from dimples, dents, and other imperfections. The chocolate may melt a bit from your body heat. This will help release some of the aromas and enhance its taste., Place a sizable piece of chocolate in your mouth, but don’t chew it immediately. Chewing may release some of the bitter flavors that are more common in dark chocolate. Chew it only to break it into small enough pieces that it begins to melt on its own. The cocoa butter in the dark chocolate will melt and will mask any bitter notes., As the chocolate melts in your mouth, think about its consistency and how it feels on your tongue. High-quality chocolate will have a velvety texture, while poorer quality chocolate may feel oily, waxy, or grainy., Focus on the flavors of the melting chocolate. Does the chocolate taste similar to the way it smells? Does the taste change over time as it melts and continues to coat your mouth? Notice what flavors are the strongest and what flavors linger the longest.

, As you continue to taste more and more dark chocolate, consider writing down your thoughts and observations in a notebook. Be sure to jot down your reflections soon after tasting the chocolate. Keeping a handy record of your tastings will make it easier to reflect on the tastes, textures, and types of dark chocolate you like best!

Your local grocery shop may have some popular chocolates in the candy isle. A local specialty candy shop or food market will have a wider selection of dark chocolates to choose from, while an online vendor may provide you with access to excellent chocolate from around the globe.

, Next time you are searching for a new chocolate bar to try, take a look at the dark chocolate selection and read the labels. Try to choose a dark chocolate that has only a few ingredients on the label.


Quality dark chocolate should have chocolate liquor or cocoa listed as its first ingredient.Chocolate liquor is the paste that is created while grinding cocoa nibs and it does not contain alcohol.You may also see cocoa powder, cocoa nibs, and cocoa butter listed on the label.
Sugar is usually added to dark chocolate to balance its bitter taste. When choosing dark chocolate, be sure that sugar is not the first ingredient., You may find that many dark chocolate bars list percentages on the front of the wrappers. These percentages describe the amount of cocoa in the chocolate bar. Quality dark chocolate typically has around 70% cocoa or higher.Dark chocolate with 70% cocoa or higher is full of antioxidants and may help lower your blood pressure and cholesterol., When buying chocolate, look for fair-trade chocolate brands to ensure that you are receiving a quality chocolate bar from an ethical company. A fair-trade certified company provides fair wages and a safe working environment for its employees.Plus, a company that puts a lot of effort into supporting its employees will most likely produce a delicious, quality product., If you keep your chocolate in the refrigerator, you may be missing out on some of its flavors. When chocolate is cold, it does not release its flavors and aromas as rapidly as it does when it is at room temperature. Plus, room temperature chocolate will melt in your mouth immediately, enhancing the overall experience."

Be realistic and don't be pessimistic.,
Allow yourself to truly love the chocolate that you do eat.,
Change the type of chocolate that you eat.,
Schedule occasions when you can indulge in eating a little quality chocolate.,
Stop tempting yourself with chocolate.,
Eat other food before chocolate.,
Drink water.,
Consider whether your daily chocolate cravings may be a form of food addiction.",How to Stop Eating Chocolate All of the Time," If you make a decision to completely deprive yourself of chocolate, your habit may well escalate! Any time you make a decision to give up something totally, you totter on the edge of falling back into your old way any moment and then finding even more excuses as to why the old habit is perfectly justifiable and doesn't need changing. Rather than taking an all or nothing approach, make a decision to cut down on, rather than cut out, chocolate from your way of eating. Since chocolate makes most people feel good, it has its own way of making us want to come back for more..., In an era of ""nutritional philosophy"" as Michael Pollan terms it,we're heavily focused on taking the pleasure out of eating food and we've stopped savoring it. In other words, it's much easier to scoff down a large bar of chocolate unthinkingly than it is to eat just a few squares and truly immerse ourselves in the experience of how it tastes, what its aroma is like, feeling the texture, etc. And the moment you start to feel guilty about your chocolate eating, there is a risk of becoming stubborn, sneaky, and making excuses instead of finding a more gentle way to enjoy chocolate. Research at Northwestern University's medical school has even shown that different parts of the brain are activated depending on whether we view eating chocolate as rewarding or something to be avoided.Decide to change your mindset about how you eat chocolate and you will find yourself eating less of it but enjoying it more:



Savor every piece of chocolate. Notice its various tastes from cocoa bean to flavoring in the chocolate. Notice its texture. Notice its aroma. Slowly eat each piece and avoid wolfing down piece after piece as if you can't wait to get the bar out of your sight. Instead, keep the chocolate in your sight for as long as possible, consuming it mindfully, slowly, with a passion for it.

, Reducing chocolate intake can be achieved by improving the selection of chocolate you do eat. Out with the over-sugared, fat-saturated common chocolate bars (""candy chocolate"") available everywhere, and in with the more expensive, refined, and darker, more pure chocolate brands. The increase in cost will benefit you considerably because you just won't be able to afford quality chocolate as often as the run-of-the-mill junk chocolate and this is a good thing, for chocolate turns into an occasional treat.


Go for quality in small amounts rather than eating large amounts of poor quality chocolate. Quality chocolate high in cacao content and low in sugar and fat is good for you in small amounts as the cacao beans contain a high level of antioxidants.It should only be eaten as a condiment, and one to two squares of quality dark chocolate after a meal each day rather than as a snack is acceptable nutritionally speaking.Good quality chocolate is high in cocoa and generally lacks fillings and artificial flavorings and colorings. If you avoid ""candy chocolate"", suddenly a lot of chocolate choices are off the menu and you will find it easier to enjoy quality chocolate properly on suitable occasions.

, Instead of blindly turning to chocolate when you feel an energy slump or you're bored or it just happens to be sitting in front of you, choose your chocolate eating times with purpose and intent. As part of this choosing instead of reacting to unconscious triggers, map out the times when you will eat chocolate, such as after a sports game or a hike, during a weekly family movie night, on the weekend only, or when having friends over, etc. Also map out the times when you're likely to reach for it, such as during the afternoon slump or when you feel bored, and reach for a glass of water or a handful of nuts or sultanas instead. Do something rather than letting boredom be the source of your desire to munch away.

, A simple response to preventing your Pavlovian salivation is to remove chocolate from sight and to cease stashing it in large quantities in places where you can easily access it, such as at home, in your bag, or in the office. Don't keep chocolate in the house – temptation is only at the reach of a hand when you keep chocolate stashes in the home. As an added bonus, if you don't have chocolate but have to make the effort to get it, you'll not only think twice about going to get it from that delightful boutique chocolate store on the other side of town but you'll burn up calories getting there!


Avoid places where chocolate is on display. Walk on the other side of the street rather than by the window of that sweet little chocolate shop. When you go to the grocery store, avoid walking by the chocolate aisle. At the checkout, try to go for the checkout that is confectionery free, or simply look elsewhere.

, If it's mealtime, eat your meal first. If it's snack time, eat healthy snacks such as carrot sticks, nuts and seeds, gum, fruit, small amounts of dried fruit or celery sticks before having a piece or two of chocolate. You may not even want the chocolate with the other flavors in your mouth.

, Sometimes it is easy to confuse being thirsty with a craving for sweets or chocolate.

, Chocolate contains chemicals that make us feel good, namely the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and phenylethylamine.If you're in need of a psychological boost, chocolate can often fit the bill because it gives you a brief boost that increases your sense of well-being and acts like natural Prozac.The challenge for you may be unearthing the reason why you need a constant psychological boost rather than masking it with chocolate popping. If you are relying on this aspect of chocolate regularly, it may be that you need to face underlying reasons as to why you seek chocolate as a source of medicating or calming yourself on a daily basis. If you are stressed, suffering from anxiety disorders, feel overly shy, or you aren't quite sure what's wrong, seek professional assistance to deal with the root of the problem.


It may be the fat and/or the sugar, it may be the caffeine or theobromine, or it may be other elements in chocolate that cause the addictive nature. To test this, cut out candy chocolate (high in sugar and fat), then proceed to switching from chocolate to cacao. In this way, you might discover which part of the chocolate eating has caused the addition and you find chocolate or cacao that you can consume without ending in a chocolate addiction. Try raw cacao nibs. With cacao, you get all the benefits of chocolate (high magnesium content, the neurotransmitters, and a chocolate high) without the unhealthy additions of sugar and fat.Keep a journal that records both when you eat chocolate and the feelings associated it. If you can identify the eating pattern, this will go a long way to identifying problem feelings that need to be dealt with through other methods than chocolate sedation.
You might like to consider chocolate perfume, chocolate bubble baths, chocolate soap, chocolate scented candles or other sources of chocolate scents as a way of meeting your need for the uplifting side of chocolate without actually having to consume it as well.

Make eggs for breakfast.,
Drink tea or coffee.,
Eat whole grains.,
Include blueberries, grapes, and apples in your fruit medley.",How to Eat a Breakfast That Is Good for Your Brain1," By making eggs for breakfast, you can provide your brain with all kinds of benefits. Eggs are a great source of protein, as well as choline, a B vitamin found in eggs. Choline improves brain function and memory, while protein stabilizes your blood sugar, which will help you concentrate.Scramble, boil, or cook your eggs sunny side up.


Omelets, made with vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes, are a great way to provide nutrients to your brain in the morning. For example, spinach and broccoli are great sources of vitamin B.Try adding a side of avocado or guacamole to your eggs. Avocados are a healthy, monounsaturated fat. Monounsaturated fat contributes to healthy blood flow, and a healthy blood flow means a healthier brain.;
, Tea and coffee contain caffeine. By drinking tea or coffee you can get the benefits of caffeine for your brain, which are enhanced memory, focus, and mood, as well as the benefit of healthy antioxidants. Antioxidants promote healthy blood flow.Drink black tea, green tea, or any other tea that suits you. You can drink your tea either hot or cold; no matter the method, you will still get the same benefits.
Drink a cup of tea or coffee per day. If you want, you can also drink two cups of tea per day. Avoid drinking too much tea or coffee, however. Drinking too much tea or coffee can cause you to urinate often.

, Whole grains, such as oatmeal and whole grain breads, promote cardiovascular health. By having good cardiovascular health, you are promoting blood flow to your organs, including your brain. Whole grains also provide your brain with energy in the form of glucose in your blood. By adding whole grains to your diet, you are ensuring that you get a constant flow of energy to your brain. This ensures focus and concentration.


Opt for whole grain toast, muffins, and oatmeal when planning what to eat for breakfast.

, Blueberries, grapes, and apples are shown to promote brain health. Because blueberries are rich in antioxidants, tannins, and phytochemicals, they are especially good for promoting brain health. Studies show that blueberries improve learning, thinking, and memory. Grapes are a great source of antioxidants and are shown to counteract oxidative stress and prevent age-related brain diseases. Apples are a great source of quercetin, an antioxidant that helps protect brain cells from free radical attacks.Eat an apple with the skin on after you finish eating your eggs or oatmeal.
Add blueberries and grapes to your yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies, and muffins.
For added benefits, add almonds to your blueberry oatmeal as well. Almonds are a great source of vitamin E, protein, fiber, and healthy fats; nutrients that prevent cognitive decline. These nutrients also help your body maintain your blood sugar levels, which helps with focus and energy."

Identify the symptoms.,
Identify why it is a problem in your life.,
Identify the cause.,
Solve the root problem.,
Know what to expect as you minimize your chocolate intake.,
Be careful not to substitute chocolate for something else as unhealthy.,
Sort the myths from the realities when it comes to assessing the so-called health benefits of chocolate.",How to Overcome a Chocolate Addiction," Not all researchers in the field of psychology perceive chocolate addiction as a ""true addiction"",. However, some researchers believe that the release of endorphins brought about by consuming chocolate creates a physical dependency to obtain that mood high again and again, thereby suggesting it is possible to be addicted to chocolate.Any way you look at it, your addiction to chocolate is definitely real and very hard to resist if you have become accustomed to consuming it. If you have uncontrollable cravings for chocolate, these may be some of the signs:


You feel ""conditioned"" to need it at certain times of the day (the post-lunch afternoon dip being one good example).
You salivate more in the presence of chocolate, or at the thought of it.
You feel negative or anxious without it, and feel better for having it.;
, If you think chocolate might be a problem, it is important to understand what challenges your chocolate addiction might be bringing into your life:


It has become a source of too many nutritionally-empty calories in your diet, adding to weight woes and reducing your nutritional intake. (While chocolate has some benefits, the fat and sugar content do not).

Neediness - you are not happy until you have consumed chocolate during the day. You will even go out of your way to purchase and stock up on chocolate, feeling panic if you don't have it in a ""stash"".
You're getting headaches, even severe ones, after consuming chocolate but you still eat it anyway.Feeling under par, lacking in energy half an hour or so after eating chocolate (the sugar crash). To counteract this, you're eating even more chocolate.
Binge-eating, defensiveness or lying about eating chocolate if other people near to you disapprove, or if you're trying to cover it up out of shame.
Sub-optimal skin or complexion (likely in combination with a generally unhealthy diet, and chocolate's sugar and fat content is adding more nutritional strain).
Financial - if you've suddenly developed a penchant for imported European chocolate, or you're stocking up on lots of chocolate regularly, it can hit the wallet!

, There are a number of possibilities that might be fueling your chocolate addiction or cravings. Consider whether any of the following apply to you:


Emotional problems: You are feeling down, anxious, depressed, disappointed, angry about unresolved issues, etc., and chocolate has become a major source of lifting your mood.
Staving off hunger: You are hungry and chocolate is handy, readily available, and cheap. This can be especially tempting if there is chocolate readily available in your workplace or college. Or, perhaps you are on a diet and you feel deprived of pleasurable foods that you'd normally enjoy, so you're sneaking it without counting its calorie burden on your diet.
Sense memory: Perhaps the simple memory of the taste of chocolate is enough to trigger your desire for it, or seeing a photo of chocolate online, in a painting, or in a book sets you off.

Boredom: Chocolate fills in time and provides a pleasurable distraction while you're waiting, or while you're procrastinating over a report or essay that you aren't enjoying but have to finish.

, Once you have identified the cause, tackle it in a healthy and self-compassionate way. Unless you're allergic to chocolate or your doctor has sworn you off it for medical reasons, you don't need to give up chocolate completely; simply minimize it. Here are some methods for solving your out-of-control chocolate cravings:


Make a decision to stop craving chocolate or using it as a crutch. It's important to want to make a change for the better, otherwise, you won't.Find an alternative energy boosts. Eat more protein and grains for lunch to give you afternoon energy. Eat fruit and veggies for snacks, have a few nuts and seeds, try fat-free crackers, and drink more water. Eat chocolate only as an occasional treat rather than as a snack.
Lessen the amount of chocolate consumed every week. Get more from your food experience by treating yourself to smaller portions of better quality chocolate. Concentrate on enjoying and prolonging the experience. Try a bar of 80 percent cocoa chocolate (this will contain a lot less sugar) from a health food store, and make it last a week.
Stop going down the confectionery aisles in the supermarket. Usually there is nothing nutritionally healthy in this aisle anyway!

Use aromatherapy to give your senses a boost. Choose favorite scents, but preferably not chocolate!
Find something else to do. When boredom, procrastination, and frustration set in, feed your need for energy release rather than your emotions. Go for a power walk, do some stretches, wash the dishes, feed the cats, take some time away from anywhere that has chocolate.
Keep your chocolate supply low or non-existent. That means replacing home and work chocolate stashes with other snacks (healthy ones, like fruits, are better!). If you are not able to resist eating chocolate when it is in the house, stop buying it for stocking up. Tell friends not to give you chocolate, and ask family members to hide their stashes somewhere else!
Try new foods with plenty of flavors. Cook up some Thai food, or try African cuisine. Hopefully you'll find some new favorite foods from this.
See your dentist. Ask for a check-up and perhaps a whitening treatment or a polish. The check-up might reveal that chocolate hasn't been kind to your teeth, and the whitening treatment or polish might inspire you to not spoil your teeth with more sweets., You might experience withdrawal symptoms and you might be tempted to replace chocolate with other sweet treats such as cookies and cake. Some things that might accompany minimizing your chocolate intake include:


Expect the possibility of some caffeine withdrawal symptoms. This will be even more marked if you have been eating coffee chocolate products, such as chocolate coated coffee beans.
Expect the possibility of some sugar withdrawal symptoms. If you do experience this, it might manifest itself in lower energy levels (initially but these will bounce back), irritability, depression, mood swings and even flu-like symptoms.See How to Stop Sweet Cravings for more advice.
Expect the possibility of feeling irritable, out of sorts, and reaching for the chocolate stash as a matter of habit.

, Don't listen to anyone who insists that chocolate substitutes such as carob or yogurt treats are healthy–they are not because they still have high sugar and saturated fat content. You are better off eating small amounts of top quality chocolate than resorting to such sweet alternatives.


Be ready for chocolate cravings by having healthy standbys readily available at all times (fruit, nuts, vegetables, dip, etc.).

, It can be all too easy to use ""health-benefits"" as an excuse to keep consuming large quantities of chocolate. Chocolate is not a health food. In the right state, it has some healthy properties but only when unadulterated and in small doses:



Catechins: Cocoa beans contain catechins, an antioxidant that can help guard against cancer and heart disease. While dark chocolate is a good source of these catechins, only eat in moderation and only quality dark chocolate. Another method for getting the catechins without the fat and high calorie intake is to drink cocoa.Cocoa butter: While pure cocoa might be a beneficial food in small amounts, most processed chocolate contains an array of ingredients including sugar, corn syrup, milk fats / dairy cream, hydrogenated oils, etc., detracting on the whole from its nutritional benefits. If you continue to consume chocolate, stick with dark chocolate only, and check that it has not been adulterated with dairy, sugar, or other products. Cocoa butter itself (rather than added fat) is considered to have no effect on cholesterol levels, so look for chocolate with only cocoa butter (not vegetable fat/oils/butter fat).Remember though that all chocolate has the potential to be fattening.

Boil the sausage links for 10 to 15 minutes before you grill them.,
Grill the par-boiled sausage links immediately, or wrap them and store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before grilling.,
Choose a spot on the grill where the sausage links can brown slowly.

,
Turn the links frequently as each side turns golden brown.,
Test the sausage with a meat thermometer to make sure it is done.",How to Grill Sausage1," This process is called parboiling: it reduces the amount of time the sausages have to be on the grill and simplifies the grilling process. You can parboil sausage in advance so it is ""grill-ready.""


Place the sausage in a heavy skillet on the stove. Add just enough water to cover the links. Use chicken or beef broth, beer or wine instead of water for unique taste combinations. If you are using water, add onions, garlic or your favorite seasonings.
Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a low boil until the links are gray throughout.;
, Par-boiled links can also be frozen for 2 to 3 months.

,, Use tongs, taking care not to puncture the sausage skin. The skin on the sausage holds the juices inside and promotes even cooking.

, Cook sausage made with pork to an internal temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 Celsius) and poultry sausage to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 Celsius).

Eliminate sugary breakfast foods.,
Avoid processed fruit juices.,
Watch out for processed gluten-free breakfast foods.",How to Eat a Breakfast That Is Good for Your Brain2," High amounts of sugar have been shown to spike your blood sugar levels, which ultimately slows down the function of your brain and decreases focus. Avoid sugary breakfast foods like bright, sugary breakfast cereals, i.e., fruit loops, cocoa puffs, and cinnamon toast crunch. Also avoid toaster pastries, like pop tarts and toaster strudels. Other sugary breakfast foods to avoid are doughnuts, pastries, Nutella, sweetened yogurt, waffles, and pancakes.Eat healthier versions of these foods by making your own healthy substitutes. For example, you can make healthier pancakes by substituting the flour with oats and cinnamon, and by reducing the amount of sugar you put in the mixture or how much syrup you pour on top. You can also make your own muffins and pastries with whole grain flour instead of white flour, and sweeten them naturally with fruit, like blueberries.

, Processed fruit juices such as, apple, orange, grape, cranberry, and other juices, are shown to have high levels of sugar, and sometimes even higher than soda. Instead, make your own natural fruit juices. For example, squeezing fresh oranges in the morning is a healthy alternative.Make sure to limit juice to 4-6 oz per day, even when it is fresh squeezed. You won't benefit from the fiber in fruit if you are only drinking the juice.

, Gluten-free diets have become very trendy in the last couple of years, but there is no reason to eat gluten-free unless you have celiac disease. However, consuming many of the gluten-free processed breakfast foods can cause potential problems. For example, rice, potato, and tapioca flour replace the wheat flour in these products. These flours are shown to have a high glycemic index. This means they raise blood sugar rapidly. A rapid rise in blood sugar can cause an insulin spike and a resulting sugar crash. The side effects of a rapid rise in insulin are hindered focus, memory, and brain function.Watch out for gluten-free pancakes, muffins, and other baked goods.

Eat a balanced breakfast.,
Use fresh ingredients when possible.,
Cook more often.",How to Eat a Breakfast That Is Good for Your Brain3," Remember to eat a balanced diet. A balanced diet will provide you and your brain with the energy it needs to function properly. A balanced diet consists of a diet that is 45 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 35 percent healthy fats like avocados and nuts.Make sure you eat a balanced diet by eating a combination of oatmeal or whole grain bread with eggs, fruits, nuts, or avocados for breakfast.

, Whenever possible, buy fresh ingredients like fresh fruits, vegetables, eggs, and bread. Fresh ingredients mean nutrients, and nutrients mean good brain health.

, Buying fresh ingredients will ensure that you cook more often. By cooking more often, you will spend less money on pre-packaged, processed foods. To cook more often, set a cooking goal for yourself. Tell yourself that you will cook a fresh breakfast at least 3 times a week, for example. This can include cooking eggs, making oatmeal or an omelet, or even quiche for breakfast.


You can also prep your breakfasts the night or weekend before to save time. For example, you can bake your own whole grain muffins on Sunday night so you can have them available for the week ahead.
Try making overnight oats. Soak your oats in any kind of liquid, i.e., milk or yogurt, overnight. The oats will absorb the liquid. The most common method is equal parts rolled oats and milk or yogurt (or a combination of milk and yogurt)."

And if you'd like to set up a romantic evening consisting of a little wine and a lot of chocolate tasting, read How to pair wine and chocolate, just so that you can do it all properly.;
, The most romantic chocolate is the best quality chocolate available. Failing that, choose the chocolate that pleases both you and your partner, regardless of its provenance.


Consider taking your partner to the best chocolate store in town. Spend at least quarter of an hour making your selection. This is a special event! Choose chocolate bars, single handcrafted truffles, and other types of chocolate on display. Chocolates with cream centers have a sensuality all of their own; perhaps get a mixture for a varied experience.
Don't forget chocolate coated cacao beans and coffee beans. These can bring a sensual pleasure all of their very own, and have a very interesting crunchy texture.

, Weave your beloved a tale of chocolate seduction; perhaps that you just cannot wait to taste the chocolate, to feel the plumpness of its texture against your teeth, and to run your tongue across its smooth lines.


For the more daring, unwrap the chocolate bar using your teeth alone.

, Take a deep breath and smell the aroma of the chocolate. Invite your partner to smell it too.


Can you determine any special flavors through this initial sniff?
If it's a cream or liqueur filled chocolate, can you tell the filling by smell alone?

, Rather than going straight for the bite, use your tongue to gently lick the chocolate and to detect an initial taste. Invite your partner to do the same.


Does the taste match the smell?

, This is no occasion for stuffing it all in and chewing! Instead, hold the piece of chocolate on your tongue for a time. Then gently roll it over and over in your mouth to savor the flavor. Hold it to the roof of your mouth. Let it drop back onto your tongue. Continue enjoying the full taste without biting it again; eventually it will melt away completely; it's the melting process that creates a long-lasting sensuous buzz.If you're enjoying a cream or liqueur centered chocolate, you'll need to vary the eating method. One way might be to suck the center out gradually and use your tongue to lick out the rest through the hole you've made. Decide on the rules with your partner before eating it!

, Here's where it gets really interesting – did you know that chocolate produces a longer brain and body buzz than kissing, lasting four times longer than the most passionate kiss?Fortunately, chocolate doesn't care whether you're male or female; it's very generous in sharing its buzz. So, for this step, have you and your partner devise new ways to enjoy the pieces of chocolate together, including sharing it and finding ways to maximize that buzz:


Gently push a sucked piece of chocolate out of your mouth to rest on your lips and have your partner gently kiss it away from you.
Be more daring and have your partner French kiss the chocolate back and forth.
Lick pieces of chocolate off your fingers. Let some chocolate melt on your lower lip as you eat it, then suck it off seductively.

, Let your partner know how enjoyable it is by making comments as to how tasty, delicious, smooth, etc. the chocolate is. Emit joyous noises to back up your enjoyment of the chocolate. A few ""mmm's"" and ""ah's"" can add to the appreciation. It's an entire experience; go with the flow and say whatever comes to mind. Preferably something that could apply favorably to your partner as well as the chocolate, not something like ""om nom nom nom""., Perhaps change rooms to reflect your change in mood. Luckily for you, chocolate is very portable and is considered perfectly acceptable from the lounge to the boudoir..."

Lick out the filling.,
Eat the filling with a spoon.,
Suck out the filling.,
Pop the whole thing in your mouth.,
Nibble away slowly.,
Eat it like an oyster.,
Eat the yolk last.,
Eat it like an ice cream cone.",How to Enjoy a Cadbury's Creme Egg1," The majority of people who eat Creme Eggs do so by licking out the filling and eating the chocolate last.The trick to this method is biting a hole into the top of the egg first, which allows you to access the filling inside. To eat a Creme Egg using this method:


Use the tip of your front teeth to bite off the top half-inch (1.3 cm) from the Creme Egg’s pointed end.
Use the tip of your tongue to lick out the filling.
Bite off small pieces from the remaining shell and eat them.;
, This is a good method for people who like to lick out the filling but don’t like getting a sticky face. Bite off the top half-inch (1.3 cm) of the cream egg shell. Remove a spoonful of filling with a skinny spoon and eat it. Repeat until the shell is empty.


Once the filling has been removed, you can eat the shell., This method of eating a Creme Egg is similar to the method where you lick out the filling. The difference is that now you make a small hole in the chocolate shell and suck all the filling out. To eat a Creme Egg this way:


Use a thin, pointy object to poke a small hole in the top of the Creme Egg. You can use the tong of a fork, the end of a chopstick, or a skewer, for instance.
Place your lips over the hole and suck all the filling out of the egg through the hole.
Eat the empty chocolate shell in several small bites, or in two or three large bites.

, Eating a Creme Egg like this requires care and caution, because a whole Creme Egg is a choking hazard. Eating an egg in this way is simple: unwrap the egg, pop it in your mouth, and carefully chew the egg and filling until you can swallow the mouthful.If you're going to eat a Creme Egg like this, make sure there's somebody nearby in case you happen to choke.

, To eat a Creme Egg like this, take a small bite from anywhere on the egg, making sure you get a bit of filling as well. With each bite, increase the size of the hole in the egg, and continue until the entire thing is gone.The slow and steady method requires will power and patience, because it can be tempting to take a few small bites and then eat the rest whole.

, To start, break the egg in half by dividing it at the seam that seals the two halves of the chocolate shell together. You can do this by holding one half in each hand and pulling the two halves apart while you twist gently.


Once the egg is separated, slurp the filling from one half and eat the half-shell. Repeat with the other side., The best way to do this without making a sticky mess is to freeze the egg before you eat it. Place the Creme Egg in the freezer and let it chill for at least two hours. When the egg is frozen, eat away the chocolate shell, leaving the filling intact.


When you’ve eaten the shell, move on to the filling. You can eat it in small bites, pop the whole thing in your mouth, or wait for the filling to thaw and then eat it with a spoon.

, Bite off the top half-inch (1.3 cm) of the chocolate shell. Use your tongue to lick out the top layer of filling, until the filling is even with the top of the chocolate shell. Then, nibble away the top quarter-inch (0.6 cm) of the chocolate shell to expose more filling. Lick out the filling and repeat.


Continue nibbling away at the top section of shell to expose the filling below until you’ve eaten the entire egg.

Choose the kind of wood chips you want to use to smoke the meat.,
Immerse the wood you choose in water for 30 minutes.,
Heat up your grill.,
Grill the ribs.,
Brush the slab with barbecue sauce.,
Finished.

",How to Grill Ribs," The 2 most popular types are baby back ribs and spare ribs, but there are significant differences between the 2 cuts.


Baby back ribs come from the top of the rib cage. They range in length from 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 6 inches (15.2 cm) and are meatier than spare ribs.
Spare ribs are from the section of the rib cage under the back ribs. Spare-rib meat often is tenderer than back ribs because of its high fat content.;
,


Cut the excess tissue from the ribs and discard it.
Rinse the ribs in cold water to remove any loose material.
Pour the dry rub onto both sides of the ribs. You can either make your own rub using brown sugar, black and white pepper, paprika and other spices, or simply buy dry rub at the grocery store.
Rub the mixture into the meat and place meat on a plate.
Cover the ribs with tin foil and refrigerate for 1 hour.

, Mesquite and hickory are popular and give the meat a distinctive flavor.

, If you have a gas or propane grill, use chips. If you're using a charcoal grill, use larger wood chunks.

, You want to cook your ribs slowly to make the meat tender. Follow the procedure below for the type of grill you're using.


Gas or propane grill: Create an indirect heat source by lighting only about half of the burners. Put the wood chips in a smoking box and place the box between the flame and the grill surface.
Charcoal grill: After ash forms, move the briquettes to one side of the grill. Place 2 or 3 wood chunks on the coals. Put a small baking pan with about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of water in it on the cool side of the grill. The steam from the water helps keep the rib meat moist and tender.

, Pay attention to how the ribs are cooking, particularly with charcoal grills, where regulating the intensity of the heat can be difficult. Recipes vary in the amount of time it takes to grill ribs, but spare ribs often take longer than back ribs. Ways to tell if you ribs are ready include:


Meat thermometer: Rib meat should be about 180 degrees F (82.2 degrees C) when it's done. However, it can sometimes be difficult to get an accurate reading because the meat is so thin.
Visual inspection: Ribs should be a rich brown color and slightly crusty.
Tenderness test: Use tongs and pick up the ribs at the center of the slab. If the meat slumps and cracks from the bone, your ribs are ready.

, Give the ribs another 10 minutes on the grill to let the sauce cook into the meat.

Gather your supplies.,
Freeze and chop the Creme Eggs.,
Make the base.,
Make a cornstarch slurry.,
Combine the ingredients.,
Chill the mixture.,
Process in the ice cream maker.,
Freeze before serving.",How to Enjoy a Cadbury's Creme Egg2," Making Creme Egg ice cream is just like making any other ice cream. Make sure you read the manufacturer’s instructions for the ice cream maker before you begin. Many ice cream maker buckets have to be frozen for at least 24 hours before you can make ice cream. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need a few kitchen supplies, including:


Sealable plastic bag
Rolling pin
Knife
Large saucepan
Whisk
Small bowl
Large freezer bag
Large bowl
Ice and cold water
Pre-chilled ice cream maker
Plastic storage container

, Place the Creme Eggs in the freezer and let them chill for at least two hours. When the eggs are frozen, remove the foil and place the eggs into a sealable bag. Use a rolling pin or hammer to break the eggs into small chunks.


For 8 ounces of Creme Egg ice cream, you'll need about seven eggs.

, In a large saucepan, combine the cocoa, sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 2 cups (474 ml) of the cream. Heat the pan over medium heat, stirring regularly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot.Stir in the chopped chocolate and half the crushed Creme Eggs.


When the eggs and chocolate have been incorporated, remove the pan from the heat.
Return the remaining crushed Creme Eggs to the freezer for later.

, Combine the cornstarch and ¼ cup (59 ml) of the cream in a small bowl. Whisk the two together until the cornstarch is completely incorporated and there are no lumps.The cornstarch slurry will be used to thicken the ice cream base.

, Return the saucepan to medium heat and pour in the cornstarch slurry, vanilla, and the remaining cream. Heat the mixture, whisking regularly, until it begins to thicken.


It will only take about five minutes for the mixture to heat and thicken.

, Fill a large bowl with equal amounts of ice and water to create an ice bath. Transfer the ice cream base to a large freezer bag. Seal the bag and plunge it into the ice bath. Chill the bag in the ice bath for about two hours.


Check on the mixture every 30 minutes. When the ice begins to melt, add more to keep the bath cold.

, Transfer the chilled base to the pre-chilled ice cream maker. Add in the remaining Creme Egg pieces and process the ice cream in the maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Most ice cream makers will require a processing time of 20 to 30 minutes.

, When the ice cream maker has finished its cycle, transfer the chilled mixture to a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Let the ice cream harden in the freezer for an additional four hours before serving.Alternatively, you can also serve the ice cream soft-serve style fresh out of the ice cream maker. Transfer leftovers to a plastic container and store in the freezer.

Experiment with your own recipe.,
Deep fry them.,
Cook them into baked goods.,
Break them up and use them like sprinkles.",How to Enjoy a Cadbury's Creme Egg3," You can actually make your own Creme Eggs at home. Not only are they fun to make, but you can also experiment with different recipes and spices if you want to customize the taste.


Homemade Creme Eggs are a great Easter activity for kids, who can help with coloring the filling, assembling the egg filling, and covering the filling in chocolate.

, Just in case Creme Eggs weren't decadent enough, you can also batter and deep fry them to transform them into a warm, crunchy, gooey dessert.


Make sure you use fresh oil to prevent the eggs from tasting like fish, fries, or other foods.

, Brownies, pies, cakes, and cupcakes will never be the same again after you add Creme Eggs to the mix. These treats are perfect for single-serve desserts like croissants and cupcakes, but you can also bake entire eggs right into cakes, squares, and other treats.


When you make cupcakes, place a whole Creme Egg or Creme Mini Egg in the center of each cupcake after you pour the batter.
For brownies, cakes, and squares, pour the batter and use your eye to divide the brownie into individual portions. Then, place a whole Creme Egg or Creme Mini Egg at the center of each portion before baking.
For croissants, roll a whole Creme Egg or Creme Mini Egg up inside each pastry before baking.

, Crushed Creme Eggs make a delightful topping for desserts and treats. Freeze four or five Creme Eggs for a couple hours, until they're frozen through. Remove the foil and transfer the frozen eggs to a sealable plastic bag. Use a rolling pin or hammer to crush the eggs into small chunks. Sprinkle the chunks onto your favorite desserts, such as:


Cakes, cheese cakes, and ice cream cakes
Ice cream cones and sundaes
Milk shakes
Pancakes and waffles
Sweet sandwiches, such as peanut butter and jam or chocolate-hazelnut spread sandwiches

, There's two methods of doing so:


Place the mushrooms in a large freezer bag or container. Add about 3 ounces to 1 pound mushrooms. Coat thoroughly; avoid soaking.
Use a glazing brush to brush on extra virgin olive oil.

, Large cap mushrooms, such as Portabella, can easily be grilled on top of the grill. For smaller mushrooms, such as shiitake, there are lots of methods to use:



Skewer them onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers. Make sure the mushrooms are all the same size to get the best results of cooking.
Use grilling baskets. Grilling baskets allow mushrooms of any size to cook thoroughly and it's simple to remove the basket as a whole from the grill. This method also prevents mushrooms from slipping through the grill grates.
Create a foil basket to sauté them. Cut out a good size of foil (6 to 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters) and lift the sides. Crumble up the tops and place the seasoned mushrooms inside.

, Cook them for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on size. Turn them frequently to cook all sides. To avoid sticking, be sure to brush them lightly with olive oil while grilling. Remove from the grill when the mushrooms are light golden brown.

",How to Grill Meat,"


If using a gas grill, leave the hood down/closed for about 10 minutes to burn off all excess residue and to get the grills nice and hot.
If using charcoal, make a nice pile about the diameter of 75-80% of the total grill space, a couple inches high, and light with a match. Allow the coals to all catch, turn red, and stop emitting flames. Once most coals are glowing red and are silver/gray, you're ready.;
,, A popular way to do it is: Pat the meat dry, season it with salt and pepper, and rub a light coat of olive oil on it. Note: If you drench the meat in oil, you will cause flare-ups, which will cause the meat to unnecessarily burn and carbonize - imparting a very unpleasant flavor - ash. So, keep the coat of oil light.

,, Try not to use a fork at this punctures the meat and results in loss of juice.

, A steak will cook a little after you remove it from the grill or oven, so stop broiling when the steak tests slightly less done than desired.


Use a meat thermometer and insert it into the thickest part of the steak. Thermometer readings should be: 120 °F (49 °C) to 125 °F (52 °C) for rare; 130 °F (54 °C) to 135 °F (57 °C). for medium rare and 140 °F (60 °C) to 145 °F (63 °C) for medium. Or...
Press the meat with your finger. Rare meat will be soft and wobbly, medium will have a springy firmness and well done will feel very firm and unyielding.

Select your type of grill.,
Consider heat output.,
Consider the size of grill you want.,
Consider the materials used to make the grill.,
Pay attention to additional features.,
Determine your grill’s location.",How to Grill1," There are two options to choose from: gas or charcoal.Gas grills are the most commonly used grill today. Many find them more convenient than charcoal as they start instantly and fuel purchases are needed less often. When selecting a gas grill, be aware of heat output (BTUs), and construction.

Charcoal grills are still popular, and preferred by many purists. Charcoal offers better heat control (which means more versatility), and many find that good charcoal gives food a better ""grilled"" flavor. Look for heat control, construction, and style. There are two main styles of non-portable charcoal grill: Kettle and traditional. Kettle grills are great for straightforward grilling and small smoking applications. More traditional, rectangular charcoal grills are more versatile when it comes to setting up different zones of heat and smoking of larger products, but also typically take up more space.

The grill needn't be yours. Public park grills avoid mess, expense, and fire hazard. But they typically have a simple design without a charcoal grates straight air path and ash discharge. A simple but less efficient larger bed of burning charcoal or a small grate to stack the charcoal on (cleaning the ash from underneath first) can mimic this; an accessory blower can bring a little pile to a quick start and searing glow.

;
, Heat output is what defines a proper grill. You want a grill that can put enough heat out to quickly sear a piece of fillet mignon, or keep a low heat to thoroughly roast a piece of meat.Heat output in gas grills: Since most grills allow for fine adjustment of gas flow, it's best to get the highest output you can afford. This will allow you to put a quick sear on food that you don't want to cook through (think of a really good cut of beef, a tuna steak, or scallops).

Heat output in charcoal grills: Heat control is achieved by charcoal amount, placement, air flow, and level. It's best to find a grill that allows for adjustment of the height of the charcoal tray. Crank mechanisms are the best option, but hook and lever methods also work fine. Look for at least two adjustable vents, as well. Opening them for more oxygen makes for a hotter fire, closing them cools the fire somewhat, and also deprives flames of oxygen, helping to stop flare-ups.

, Will you be cooking ""for an army"" or just for a family of 2 or 4? It's relatively easy to cook a small meal on a large grill, but the opposite is not true. Look for how much ""cooking area"" your prospective grill has. The average grill has around 600 square inches of cooking space, and will serve a small party fairly well. If you host big cookouts, shoot for 800 square inches or more, if you really only want to toss on a few burgers once in a while, the smallest you'll find without going ""hibachi"" style is maybe 400 square inches.

, In particular, look closely at the grill grates. Most grill grates are made from either cast iron, porcelain, or stainless steel.


Cast Iron is the best for conducting heat, but it requires care to keep it from rusting.
Porcelain coated metal (steel or cast-iron) grates do well at conducting heat, but must be cleaned with something other than steel (typically, a brass brush is used) to avoid damaging the porcelain and leaving the metal underneath vulnerable to rust.
Stainless steel grates are easy to clean, without the worries of cast-iron or porcelain, but can wear out faster than well-maintained cast iron or porcelain.

, Do you want a rotisserie? A smoker box? An external burner? Infrared cooking?


Pay close attention to the number of burners a grill has. More burners equals more versatility.
Look for good wheels, preferably larger (not tiny casters), if you're going to be moving your grill around at all.

Features found on gas grills: Most gas grills have a built-in thermometer, while charcoal grills do not. Thermometers are quite useful for smoking and roasting applications. They can, however, be purchased separately and installed if your grill does not come with one.

Features found on charcoal grills: Helpful features in the construction of charcoal grill include easy access to ashes, be it through a drawer or a dumping mechanism.

, There should be a couple of feet of clearance between the hot box and anything flammable. Your grill should not be directly underneath low-hanging trees or a low roof, and it should not be against deck rails, as all of these things could potentially catch fire.


Place a fire extinguisher or hose near your grill in case of emergency. Keep flammable materials far from the fire and never leave your grill unattended.

Think about how much time you want to spend in preparation.,
Consider clean-up.,
Consider how much control you want over the process.,
Think about taste.,
Crunch your numbers.,
Try to avoid thinking too much, and ask yourself what you actually have to have .",How to Decide Between a Charcoal or Gas Barbecue," Almost 40 minutes are required in order for the initial flames of charcoal to die down, giving you with the whitened cinders essential for your 1st hamburger. Gas is virtually instant, needs no real warm-up time (five minutes may be helpful to get the griddle nice and hot in the event you need to though) and you probably won't be burning an entire box of matches trying to light the thing on a breezy day.


One concluding consideration is convenience – if you might have quite a few folks arriving in staggered shifts you may generally stop and start gas barbecues with ease, whereas charcoal is a lot more problematic to keep going or restart.;
, Dirty coals that would need to be cleared away afterwards lead quite a few people to consider gas, the cleaner option. However, more intricate gas barbecues have tricky parts to wash just like those annoying kitchen gas hobs you hate washing.

, Even though both types can utilise a higher rack for lesser heat, gas barbecues have genuine adjustable heat control. Gas is thus far more food friendly, as you are able to adjust the temperature to your own needs and not overcook things. For that reason far more challenging or fragile items can generally be cooked with ease on gas. Furthermore, more substantial gas barbecues have increasingly more burners, divide the whole cooking area into individually adjustable zones. However, you'll find frequently many “dead” locations on less costly models, so unequal cooking could be a challenge. With charcoal, you will be the person in charge, and can spread the coals out for equal cooking, but piled up locations for many types of heat is just much too tricky to bother.

, Gas barbecues rely on heat distributing materials which work to vaporise drippings and cause a delicious smoke. Gas devotees will tell you that this produces a flavour just as fine as charcoal, but then it does not explain why people make a great deal of money supplying packs that you just burn on a gas barbecue to try to create a far more “woody” flavour. You can find animated and conflicting opinions on whether you can tell the difference between meat grilled on gas or charcoal, but it is normally a question of if gas tastes as good as charcoal, never the other way around. As the debate rolls on, it's obvious that it's actually the natural smokiness discovered in charcoal grilling that all BBQs hope to achieve.

, The initial expense on a gas barbecue is normally considerably more than with charcoal. Having said that, the price of every single sack of charcoal is really considerably higher than the quantity of gas you will use in contrast. As a result it truly is a balance concerning the regularity of barbecuing and the size you want. Modest amounts of people every now and then? Go charcoal. Lots of folk frequently? Gas may perhaps save you a lot more in the long run.

, If the straightforwardness and flexibility of gas may be the most tempting characteristic, then possibly you don’t even need to have a barbecue, and the simple kitchen grill will carry out the exact same work for no additional charge. On the other hand, if you happen to be set on that backyard grilling appliance then you need to visualize your self manning the station. Do you need to fire it up quickly, have minute heat control to obtain that flawlessly cooked steak, and not need to faff with coals? Go gas. All the same, quite a few of you are picturing the watering eyes, the white hot smoky coals along with the strangely delicious over-done beef that exclusively charcoal will provide. In the event you take pleasure in the usual image of a cluster of men huddling around and disagreeing over the very best time to start off grilling, then gas will just be no fun. Finally, when you are just in search of a fast blast every now and then and do not definitely care an excessive amount then an inexpensive,small-scale charcoal barbecue will save you a great deal of hassle, and nobody will shout at you when you leave it out virtually all winter to go rusty.

Eliminate bread.,
Take advantage of fruit.,
Avoid chips or choose baked or no-salt chips.,
Choose salad without dressing.,
Replace soda, fizzy pop and alcohol with water.",How to Eat Healthy at a Barbecue," By eliminating bread from your burgers and hot dogs, you can cut the calories by about a quarter and you'll have more room for other foods. You can also cut up your hot dog into pieces and dip it in mustard or ketchup (whatever you prefer) like nuggets. For burger, you can also try eating it with just one bun on the bottom. Alternatively, choose whole grain bread.;
, No barbecue is complete without fruit. By piling half your plate with assorted fruit like watermelon, pineapple, grapes, strawberries, etc., you'll feel fuller longer and won't be craving those salty chips.

, No chips are good for you, but some are worse than others.

, Instead of eating potato salad, slathered in mayonnaise, choose a green salad.

, This is one of the most efficient ways to reduce your calorie intake at a barbecue. It can be hard though when everyone around you is drinking what they like. A lot of people like soda and would hate to trade it in for water, but drinking soda (yes, even diet soda) could ruin your whole healthy barbecue lunch. If you think water is too boring, try adding a lemon or lime slice to it to give it some zest.

Prepare the chicken pieces.,
Pound boneless chicken breasts flat until they are about ¾ inches (1.91 centimeters) thick.,
Consider butterflying a whole chicken to cut down on cooking time.,
Consider marinating chicken breasts in the fridge for 4 to 12 hours.,
Consider using a rub on chicken legs and thighs.,
Consider brining the chicken for 2 to 3 hours in ¼ cup (25 grams) salt and 4 cups (950 milliliters) water.,
Make sure that the grill is clean.,
Start up the grill.,
Oil the grill by wiping it down with an oily brush or paper towel.,
Place the chicken on the grill and replace the grill cover.,
Consider searing bone-in chicken pieces if you are using a two-zone fire.,
Grill the chicken, covered, until it is done.,
Consider adding a glaze or barbeque sauce in the last 10 minutes of grilling.,
Test for doneness.,
Remove the chicken from heat and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.,
Consider serving the chicken with some sauce or glaze.,
Remember to wash everything that came in contact with raw chicken before using it again.",How to Grill Chicken," Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Use a knife to trim off any skin and/or excess fat. Wash the chicken pieces using cold water, and pat them dry with a paper towel.


If the chicken pieces, such as wings, thighs, and legs, still have the bone in them, consider leaving the skin on.
If you need to defrost the chicken, do so in the fridge or in the microwave. Do not defrost chicken at room temperature.;
, Place the chicken breasts inside a plastic, re-sealable freezer bag. Seal the bag, then whack the chicken with a rolling pin or meat pounder. The bag will keep the juices from splattering all over your kitchen. When you are done, take the chicken breasts out of the bag and rinse them.Pounding the chicken breasts flat ensures that they cook evenly.

, Butterflying the chicken involved taking out the backbone and breastbone. This will allow the chicken to lie flat on the grill, and speed up the cooking process. To butterfly a chicken, do the following:Cut off the neck and remove the giblets.
Place the chicken breast-side-down and cut down both sides of the backbone. Pull out the backbone and discard it.
Pull open the chicken, like a book.
Cut away the breastbone, then pull it out. Discard the bone.

, Combine all of the ingredients for your marinade in a plastic, re-sealable bag. Add the chicken, seal the bag, and leave it in the fridge for 4 to 12 hours. For a classic lemon and herb marinade for four chicken breasts, you will need:6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 large garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1½ teaspoons lemon zest, from one lemon
1 ¼ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

, You can put the rub onto the chicken just before you grill it, or let it marinate for one hour. Simply mix your rub together, and pat it into the chicken. For a simple rub, you will need:4 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons dried cilantro
2 teaspoons dried onion flakes

, Combine the salt and water in a large pot, then add the chicken breasts. Unlike with marinating, the longer you brine is not better. Leave the chicken in the brine for only 2 to 3 hours; any longer, and the chicken will turn rubbery., Chicken is more likely to stick to a dirty grill than to a clean one. If you have not yet already done so, get out that grill brush, and scrub the grate clean.

, If you are cooking bone-in or different cuts of chicken, consider having a two-zone fire. This means one half of the grill will be very hot while the other half will be less hot. The hot part will have ""direct heat,"" and the less-hot part will have ""indirect heat."" You can do this by piling the coal on one side of the grill (for a charcoal grill), or turning up the flames on one side (for a gas grill).For breasts and wings, use a direct medium heat, about 350°F (176°C).
For legs and bone-in thighs, use indirect, medium heat.
For boneless thighs, use direct, high heat 450 - 650° F.
For whole chicken and bone-in chicken (breasts, legs, and thighs), use indirect medium heat.

, Chicken is more likely to stick to a dirty grill. Oiling it will protect the chicken from sticking., If you are using a two-zone fire, make sure that you are placing the boneless pieces over direct heat, and the bone-in pieces over indirect heat. The one exception to this rule are chicken wings, which should be placed over direct heat.

, Place the bone-in pieces to the hottest part of the grill, and cook them over direct heat for 3 to 4 minutes, turning once. When you are done, transfer them to the cooler part of the grill, so that they can finish cooking over indirect heat. This will give the pieces that nice, crunchy texture on the outside.

, Covering the grill is very important, because it traps the heat and helps the chicken retain moisture. Listed below are the different cuts of chicken and the recommended cooking times. Keep in mind, however, that the times may vary, depending on the weather, the grill you are using, and how large/thick the chicken pieces are.Cook chicken breast for 8 to 12 minutes, turning once. Thinner pieces, such as cutlets, will need 2 to 3 minutes.
Cook boneless chicken thighs for 8 to 10 minutes, turning once.
Cook chicken wings for 18 to 20 minutes, turning once.
Cook a whole chicken for 1 ½ to 2 hours (3 ½ to 4 ½ pounds), 40 minutes if you butterflied it.Cook bone-in pieces (breasts, legs, and thighs) for 30 to 40 minutes, turning occasionally. Larger pieces may require up to 50 minutes., Brush some glaze or sauce over the pieces, and grill them for 5 minutes, covered. Turn the pieces over, brush on more glaze or sauce. Cover the grill, and cook for another 5 minutes.If you plan on using some of the sauce for dipping/serving later on, set aside however much you need before you brush the sauce onto the chicken. This will prevent any cross-contamination., Unlike steak, chicken must be fully cooked, and cannot be eaten rare. There are two ways you can check chicken for doneness:


Stick a meat thermometer into the chicken. The chicken is done if the temperature reads at least 165°F (74°C) for boneless pieces, and 180°F (82°C) for bone-in pieces.Cut one of the chicken pieces open. The meat should be opaque, and the juices should run clear.

, This resting period will allow the juices to sink into the meat, making it even juicier. Keep the chicken breasts warm, about 140°F (60°C) while they rest. You can do this by placing them on a plate and covering them, or transferring them to a warm, flameless part of the grill.

, If you have any sauce or glaze leftover from grilling, consider pouring it into a dish, and serving it alongside the chicken. Just make sure that none of the sauce came in contact with the raw chicken.

, If you have not already done so, wash all of your knives, brushes, and cutting boards using hot water and soap. This is vital, especially if you plan on using these utensils again to serve the chicken.

Stay hydrated.",How to Enjoy Barbecue Season Without Gaining Weight," Barbecue season generally lasts for about 3-4 months depending on your local climate. It's not wise to indulge without moderation at each event or picnic. Otherwise, you may gain weight.


You'll need to indulge in moderation during barbecue season. If you go to or host a barbecue on a weekly basis, there are multiple chances for you to eat to much or go over your calorie budget.
To prevent this, determine what moderation is for you. It'll be helpful to have a definition and guideline to follow during this season.
For example, if you're going to indulge in a dessert, the rule is to split it with a friend or family member. Or, allow yourself to have one sweet drink or alcoholic beverage.;
, Since barbecues may make it more difficult to stay on track with your diet or regular eating plan, make sure you pay close attention to how you're eating during the week.Staying on track with a diet or healthy eating plan 100% of the time make not be totally realistic - especially at a barbecue.
To keep yourself in check weight-wise, concentrate on making the other days during the week more healthy and nutritious.
This means sticking to your exercise routine and making smart diet choices as well.
Also, save up ""treats"" for your planned barbecue. For example, if you're in the mood for a sweet treat during the week, skip it and save that indulgence for when you're at a barbecue that weekend.

, One important component of your lifestyle that you should always keep consistent is your activity and exercise routine. Falling out of your exercise routine in addition to eating higher calorie foods is a recipe for weight gain.


Aim to continue to meet the goal of 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. You should aim to do activities that are moderate intensity like walking, jogging, cycling, swimming or dancing.Also do 1-2 days of strength training each week. Do 20 minutes of activity and aim to work every major muscle group.
Increase lifestyle activity if you can as well. Barbecue season is usually during the warmer months, so that means you can be more active outside. Increasing your lifestyle activity can help burn even more calories during the day.

, It's not only diet and exercise that will determine your weight. Adequate sleep is equally important in the equation for healthy weight maintenance.


During barbecue season, you may find yourself going out more often to parties, picnics and outdoor events. These might have you staying up later than normal and be cutting in on your valuable sleep time.
When you're sleep deprived, even a little bit, you end up feeling more hungry the next day. In addition, you may crave foods that are higher in fat and carbohydrates.This can make sticking to your definition of moderation more difficult when you're at a barbecue with tempting treats.
Aim for at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Try going to bed earlier or getting up later to get in those necessary hours of rest.

, If you want to keep your weight in check during barbecue season, one of the most essential things you need to do is weigh yourself regularly.


Studies have shown that those who weigh themselves and track their weight on a regular basis lose more weight and are able to keep it off long-term.If you avoid getting on the scale (maybe because you've been to a lot of barbecues), you won't notice small weight gains. However, if you avoid it the whole barbecue season, you may have gained 5 or 10 pounds in that time frame.
To avoid unwanted weight gain, get on the scale regularly. It's typically recommended to get on the scale about 1-2 times per week.
Track your weight in your phone or on a piece of paper. If you notice that it's starting to get higher, watch your diet more closely, revisit your definition of moderation and consider how much exercise you've been doing.

, One of the worst barbecue foods is the protein. Whether it's a hamburger or ribs, many of these tasty foods are seriously high in calories and fat.Foods that should be limited and only eaten in moderation include: ribs, pulled pork, fried chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers and sausages.
These meats in particular are not only high in calories, but are also very high in saturated fats.
If you do indulge in some of these foods (when it fits into your definition of moderation), make sure to measure the portion sizes. This can help keep the overall calories in check to some degree. Protein should always be portioned to 3-4 oz or about 1/2 cup per serving., Another common diet downfall are the appetizers and snacks at barbecues. Not only is it easy to overdo it on these items, but many times they're also higher in calories.Appetizers and snacks that you should limit include: potato chips, crackers, dips, chicken wings, sliced cheese, sliced dry salami or cocktail sausages.
Since it can be difficult to only have one serving of some of these foods, consider filling a small salad or appetizer plate with just a few pieces of these foods. Don't go back for seconds.
Try not to just grab handfuls of these items. It's easy to have a few too many handfuls which can blow your total calorie intake way too high.

, Creamy coleslaw or potato salad are other foods that can completely overdo it with fat and calories. Since these are common barbecue foods, limit your intake of these items.


Potato salad, coleslaw, macaroni salad and other creamy dishes are laden with calories and fat.This is because they are typically made with mayonnaise, sour cream, buttermilk and sometimes even added sugar.
These foods can pack a big calorie punch even for a small serving. Always measure portions to keep the calorie content in check.
A serving of these items would be about a 1/2 cup.This is about the size of half a baseball or half the size of a woman's fist.
Also, don't go back for seconds on these salads. Stick to one small serving of these items.

, Other common foods that can get you calorie-wise are desserts. Barbecues are known for delicious desserts, but these can also push your weight up during this season.It's common to see cupcakes, pies, ice cream, s'mores, cookies or fruit bars for dessert. Most of these are high in sugar and fat which causes them to be higher in calories.
If you're going to have a dessert, split a portion with a friend or family member. That way you can enjoy a sweet treat in a portion controlled serving.
Also see if there are some lower calorie treats you can have. Fruit salad or sliced fruit is a great sweet alternative.

, Whether it's sweet tea or an alcoholic beverage, these drinks can get really high in calories. Keep your calories in check by limiting how many of these sweetened items you enjoy.Drinks to be mindful of include: sweet tea, lemonade, Arnold palmers, beer, wine spritzers, juice cocktails or frozen mixed drinks.
If you have one of these beverages, stick to one only. It'll keep calories in check and if its an alcoholic beverage, will keep your total alcohol consumption in check as well.
Also, if you do drink more than one alcoholic beverage, it may make you more susceptible to overindulging in foods. Prevent that from happening by only having one beverage.

, Since burgers, fried chicken or ribs can be way too high in calories, choose leaner cuts of protein. These are still tasty, but help keep you on track.


Lean protein sources are naturally lower in fat and calories. Plus, they can help fill you up and keep you feeling satisfied longer.Look for lean protein options like: grilled chicken, grilled porkchops or pork loin, burgers made from ground turkey or lean beef, grilled fish or shellfish.
Still measure the portion sizes of these foods to 3-4 oz total per serving.In addition, if you want, make half of your protein choice lean and half a little more indulgent so you can have the best of both worlds.

, Both fruits and vegetables are also common barbecue contenders. Instead of going for creamy salads or snacks, try filling up on these items instead.


Fruits and vegetables are great foods to fill up on if you're trying to watch your weight. Not only are they naturally low in calories, but they help provide bulk to your meals so you feel more full with less food.Whenever you're serving yourself food at a barbecue, start with fruits and vegetables before putting anything else on the plate. This will help make sure they actually make it onto your plate.
Find a variety of items you and enjoy. Aim to fill about half of your plate with these nutritious and low calorie foods. This will physically limit how much other foods you can add to your plate.

, Although it may be difficult to say no to seconds, it's important to try to avoid this. Since some foods may be higher in calories or you may have indulged more than you should, keep your calories in check by only having one serving.Many times you can stick to a relatively good calorie range or choose relatively good foods. But it's when you go back for seconds, that you push yourself too far.
To prevent yourself from getting seconds, throw your plate, napkin and utensils away (or put them away) after you're done.
Also, move away from the area where the food is being served. Socialize and chat with friends or family members, play outdoor games or sit and relax while you enjoy the nice weather.

, Another trick that can help you stick to smaller portions at barbecues is by using a smaller plate. Pick up one of these instead to help you stay on track.


If it's available, look for a small appetizer or salad plate. These are usually much smaller than dinner plates. They will physically limit how much food and therefore how many calories you're able to eat.If you cannot find a smaller plate to use, try to only fill up the center of a regular sized plate. Avoid filling it completely as this is usually way too much food.
Even with a smaller plate, make half of it a fruit, vegetable or both. That way half of your smaller meal is still lower in calories.

, It can be tempting to sip on sweet tea and lemonade or a cold beer at barbecues. However, stick to hydrating fluids during these warmer months.


Most of your fluid intake should be coming from clear, sugar-free and decaffeinated beverages. These are the most hydrating which is important during the warmer months.
Stick to items like: water, sparkling water, flavored water, decaf and unsweetened iced tea or iced coffee.
You should aim to consume about 64 oz of these fluids. However, you may need 80 oz or more depending on your age, gender and activity level.Drinks like sweet tea or alcohol will not count towards your 64 oz. They should be consumed in addition to all your clear fluids.

Start your fire ahead of time.,
Turn your grill on or light your charcoal.,
Close the grill.",How to Grill2," You don’t want to have to wait for the grill to heat up when everyone else is ready to eat and all the side dishes are prepared. Keep in mind that charcoal takes longer than gas to heat up. Shoot for 10 minutes of preheating with gas, 20 to 25 with charcoal.

, If you have a charcoal grill, there are several different ways you can start your fire. Know that when the coal is lightly ashed over and gray, you can begin cooking.


Ever popular lighter fluid works, but it is imperative that you let it all burn off before cooking, unless you like the taste of petroleum.
Electric starters are also available, which use a cal-rod style heating element placed under the coals. They work very well, but do require a source of electricity, and cords can present a trip/burn hazard if not carefully monitored.
Chimney starters use a metal cylinder with perforations to hold the charcoal on top, and a couple of sheets of newspaper on the bottom. They work quickly and are inexpensive. Light the newsprint and the heat flows upward, igniting the coals. Have a place to put the chimney after use, as it will be red-hot. Another benefit to chimney starters is that they can be used to prepare extra charcoal if you need to refresh your pile. Just be sure to do it on top of a very heat-resistant surface, such as a cinder block or the bottom of an upturned galvanized steel bucket.

, Allow the bars to heat for a minute or so to be able to make nice grill marks on whatever you are grilling.

Brine or marinate your meats before cooking.,
Add the food to the grill.,
Pay attention to hot spots.,
Stop ""flame-ups"".,
Flip the food when it is halfway done.,
Ensure that your food is cooked all the way through..,
Remove your food from the grill.,
Serve your food immediately after the resting period is over.,
Turn your grill off (if it is a gas grill).",How to Grill3," This is optional but brining or marinating meat and then placing the meat on the grill will result in a whole lot of flavor.Brining will especially make for more juicy pork, chicken, or turkey. A basic brine is about 1/8 cup of table salt to 1 quart of water. Make sure you have enough to cover the meat. Broth may be used instead of water (adjust for salt), a little sugar (honey, brown sugar, molasses) may be added if desired, seasonings (almost anything) can also be added for more flavorful meat.
If marinating, be sure your marinade does not have too much sugar, or else it will burn on the grill.

, Placement is key when grilling, particularly if you are feeding a large party. If you're cooking for a lot of people, try to be deliberate in your placement of food, so that you can maximize the amount cooking all at once. That said, do not crowd the food together, as it needs some space both for better cooking and for you to be able to snatch it out or flip it.

, Some grills will have sections that get hotter than others. Keep that in mind when grilling, particularly if someone you are cooking for has a special preference regarding how rare he/she like his/her food. Once you've added the food, do not flip it or move it (unless you want to turn it slightly for cross-hatched grill marks) until you believe it's halfway done.If someone likes their burger more rare than the rest, put theirs on the side that's cooler. If your grill is pretty evenly heated, just put the food on slightly later than the rest to make it rare.

, Flame-ups are caused by fatty foods dripping onto the fire. You can stop flame-ups by removing the meat from the grill once the oil has risen to the surface of the meat. Shake the meat of it's grease then put it back on the grill at a lower heat.

, Try to limit flipping the food as much as possible. Frequent flipping can lead to uneven cooking, ugly food, and or losing a piece of food to the flames below.

, Experienced grillers don't need to check the food very often, but until you're comfortable, a thermometer plunged into the center of the food is the best method to be sure (instant read for small items, probe style if you're grilling a large item such as a whole chicken or pork tenderloin). If you don’t have a thermometer you can cut into the food, but keep in mind that slicing, piercing, or breaking a piece of food in half will make it dry out very quickly, as all the juices will run out of it.



Grilling burgers: Burgers made of beef are best cooked to medium or well-done because of the risk of bacteria being ground into the meat. If you grind your own beef from carefully trimmed cuts, this precaution is not necessary. Burgers made of chicken or turkey should be cooked fully. Veggie burgers should be cooked so that they are heated all the way through.

Grilling hot dogs: Grill hot dogs on a medium-high heat grill. They should cook for five to seven minutes before they are ready to be taken off.Grilling steak: Steak is often eaten raw when it's provided by a trusted source. Cook your steak to the desired doneness over a very hot grill. The internal temperature of a rare steak should be 130ºF (54.4ºC).

Grilling poultry: Chicken and turkey must be completely cooked before eating. If any of the meat is not opaque, it must be cooked further. In the case of a whole bird, a probe thermometer plunged into the deepest part of the breast must register that the bird is done. The internal temperature of a whole chicken or turkey should be 165º - 170ºF (73.8º-76.6ºC.) Another classic way of checking a bird’s doneness is to pierce the meat and ensure that the juices run clear. Keep in mind that when piercing the meat you will lose some of that yummy juice.

Grilling Pork: Pork in the United States no longer has to be cooked well done to be considered safe. A slight pinkness in the meat is both desired and delicious. A medium done pork roast has the internal temperature of 145ºF (62.7ºC). In other regions of the world, it may be wise to continue cooking until the meat is opaque.

Grilling vegetables: Grilling vegetables is a great way to make a hot side dish without heating up the kitchen. Most veggies do just fine on the grill if sliced, tossed in a little oil, salt, and pepper, and grilled. Keep in mind relative cooking times, as, say, carrots will take a lot longer than zucchini. Purchase a perforated metal grill-topper if your veggies are narrow enough to fall through the grates. You could also wrap your veggies in tinfoil and place them on the grill (just know that they won’t get any grill marks that way.)

Grilling with sauces: Most sauces, especially high sugar ones, such as barbecue sauce, should be added at the last minute, to avoid burning. Baste, turn the food over, and baste the other side. Wait for a minute or so for the sugars to caramelize, if you wish, but do not leave it too long, as burnt sugar is not very tasty.

, Put the food on a plate, platter, or other vessel and cover it with heavy-duty aluminum foil (if you don't have starving guests hovering already) for at least 5 minutes. Doing this allows juices to redistribute so that they do not run out as soon as the food is cut or bitten into.


In the case of large cuts, taking the food off the grill and covering when the thermometer registers 5 degrees (10 for an exceptionally large item) less than the recommended or desired doneness is a good idea, as resting it will allow ""carryover cooking"" to finish the job. The meat continues to cook after it is taken off the grill, as it is still incredibly hot. A large piece of meat cooked to exactly the right doneness temperature on the grill will invariably be overcooked by the time that it hits the table.

, A successful meal will, of course, have side dishes and beverages that you prepared ahead of time or alongside the main course. Don't forget the condiments.

, Do not forget to turn the propane off or else the tank will continue to leak propane.

Take care of your grill once it has cooled down.,
Use a damp or oiled cloth and tongs to do the fine cleaning.,
Keep your grill area clean.,
Keep your grill safe while in disuse.",How to Grill4," Use a wire brush to scrub off the bars.

, If your cloth was wet, not oiled, be sure to use some cooking spray on the grates afterward.

, Keeping your grill and grill area clean, dry, and uncluttered is not just aesthetically pleasing, but safer and cost effective. Grills will deteriorate quickly if left wet and out in the rain, especially charcoal ones (because wet wood ash is caustic and will rust through the grill very quickly).

, Wheel your grill inside as soon as it is cool, or purchase a grill cover.

",How to Cook Ribs So Tender They Fall Off the Bone," Preferably the St. Louis Style.;
, Pick any flavor you like.

Find jicama.,
Peel the jicama’s skin.,
Cut the jicama.,
Even though jicama is white on the inside, you don’t need to worry about it discoloring when exposed to air the way an apple would.,
Eat the jicama raw.,
Saute the jicama.,
Eat jicama chips.,
Make creative dishes with jicama.,
Get the facts on jicama.,
Know the health benefits of jicama.",How to Eat a Jicama," You may or may not find jicama at your local grocery store or farmer’s market -- it depends upon your location. General grocery stores are more likely to carry jicama in areas with sizable Hispanic or South Asian populations.


If your local grocery store doesn't carry jicama, your best bet is specialty produce shops or Mexican, Asian, and Latin American grocery stores.
You are most likely to find jicama in the spring and summer, as they are often imported from Central American countries at that time. Avoid tubers that are soft, shriveled, or have dark spots.;
, You need to peel the skin of the jicama before you eat it. It might be hard to peel with a regular vegetable peeler. Do not eat the peel.


Instead, try using a chef’s knife. First, cut a thin slice from both the top and the bottom to create a flat top and flat bottom on each end. Before you peel the jicama, though, wash it in cool running water and then dry it off like you would a potato.
Set the jicama down on its broadest cut end. Work from top to bottom, and slide your knife beneath the jicama’s skin. Peel it while following the jicama’s natural lines.

, After you peel the jicama, place it down on its widest cut end, and make even, vertical cuts in it. Then cut these pieces into sticks. Dice the sticks by cutting across them.Dicing means you cut the jicama into small cubes.


You can also shave the jicama on a mandolin slicer. First, cut the vegetable in half or in quarters, then use the mandolin to slice off thin shavings., Thus, you don’t need to store it in anything special if you plan it eat it the same day.


However, if you have, say, half of the root left, you should store it in the refrigerator in a plastic bag or resealable plastic container. It should be fine to eat even several days later.
It might be a bit dry on its cut end, so you might have to cut that part away before you prepare it to eat.
Before it's cut, you can store jicama for two to four weeks if you keep it in a cool, dry, dark place. Don’t store it in temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius, as this will cause changes in color and texture.

, You can eat jicama without cooking it. In fact, it tastes very good this way. You can eat it like a carrot stick, putting it in dip or just eating it plain.


People also use jicama to make salsa, by mixing diced jicama with corn or diced tomato, black beans, red onion, minced jalapeno, lime juice, and cilantro.
Turn the jicama into slaw by adding thin strips of it to shredded red cabbage and shredded carrots.
Put jicama in spring rolls or stir fry it. Cooking it briefly will add a crunchy texture to your stir fry. You could cook it with broccoli, garlic, ginger, scallions, cashews or toasted sesame seeds.

, You can also saute the jicama with other vegetables, like broccoli, zucchini, onions, and sweet peppers. Jicama works well with other vegetables because it resembles the crunchy texture of water chestnuts.


First, brown the jicama in a little bit of olive oil. Add a small sliced onion and ½ of a red pepper cut into strips. Cook until tender. You can also roast jicama by cutting it into cubes and putting it in a baking pan. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, sprinkle the jicama with olive oil, rosemary, parsley, and ½ teaspoon minced garlic, and roast it for an hour.

, Jicama chips make a healthy snack. To make them, you should peel 1 pound of the jicama.


Slice the jicama with a mandolin slicer to about 2 mm. Brush olive oil on both sides of the jicama slices, and add salt and pepper. Put the slices on parchment lined baking sheets. Make sure they are in single layers.
Bake them at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for about 100 minutes. You will want to make sure they are crisp, and you should turn them every 20 minutes.
You can also make raw jicama chips. Simply peel the jicama and thinly slice it. Squeeze one half of a lime onto the chips, and sprinkle them with salt, sugar, and chili powder. Chill for 20 minutes before serving.

, One way to eat jicama is to put it in fruit salad. This is common in Mexico, where street vendors will combine it with fruit.


Mix diced jicama with chunks of mango, pineapple, watermelon, and cucumbers, and add lime juice and chili powder.Add jicama to canapes for a cocktail party. Or use it instead of papayas in a shrimp salad. In a large bowl, mix jicama, sprouts, herbs and scallions. Whisk chili-garlic paste, lime juice, fish sauce and sugar, as well as salt and pepper. Mix together. Add shrimp and peanuts.Consider adding jicama to salads, or use it to replace the cucumber in sushi rolls. It works best in quick-cooking recipes where it retains its crispness., Jicama is a vegetable, not a fruit. This round, fleshy vegetable can grow to be quite large, and its skin has a bark-like texture.The jicama’s taste has been described as similar to an apple. Sometimes called a Mexican turnip, jicama is a starchy, slightly sweet root vegetable popular in Mexico. It has the texture of a firm pear or raw potato.
Jícama is a species in the genus Pachyrhizus in the bean family. Plants in this genus are referred to as yam bean, although that term can be another name for the jicama root itself. It grows in Central America, South Asia, and the Caribbean., There are many reasons to eat jicama. For one, it has very few calories, only 35 per 100g. Jicama also is good for lowering cholesterol and has very low sodium.It is a great source of dietary fiber. It is considered a good snack for people with diabetics or people who are on diets. However, you should also know that jicama contains an organic toxin called rotenone that has been lined to Parkinson’s disease in some studies. The toxin is mostly found in the leaf tops, stems, and seed pods, so don't eat those. The peeled roots are considered safe for human consumption.
Jicama is rich in vitamin C. Jicama also contains important minerals like magnesium, copper, iron, and manganese."

Buy some bubblegum.,
Chew one piece or strip of bubblegum for starters.,
Chew the bubblegum until it is soft and smooth.,
Roll the gum into a ball with your tongue.,
Push your tongue through the flattened gum.,
Breath air into pocket of gum around your tongue.Blow gently until you can feel the air begin to fill the gum and start to push the gum out of your mouth in a bubble shape.,
Pull your tongue out of the layer of gum.,
Keep blowing as long as you can, or until the bubble bursts.,
Seal off the bubble.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Blow a Bubble with Bubblegum," You can buy gum at pretty much every corner store. Chewing gums can be used to make bubbles, but they won't be as big, and they'll usually pop too easily. To start off, select a pack of bubblegum like Double Bubble or Bazooka.Generally, if there is a picture of a bubble on the package, it's a good choice.


Some gums are also stickier, making them harder to remove from your face when they pop. Usually, if you chew these gums a little longer before blowing a bubble, they won't be quite as sticky.
Gums with less sugar often have a stronger gum base for making bubbles. Gum bases contain a long molecule that adds elasticity to the gum. The right amount will make for the best texture for bubbles.Avoid old gums. If your gum is stale it will be more dry, harder to chew, and bad for making bubbles. Use fresh gum to get the best results.;
, More gum does not necessarily equal more bubble.At this stage, you're just learning how to blow a bubble, so you don't want to overdo the amount of gum in your mouth. Unwrap one piece and pop it into your mouth.








, Work it around your mouth. Chew until the flavor and sugar crystals in it mostly disappear and the bubblegum is very pliable (soft and easily bent). This can take a few minutes, so be patient.









Don't wait too long. After a long time, perhaps half an hour, the bubblegum will deteriorate, becoming stiffer and brittle, and won't work as well.

, Use the roof of your mouth to steady the gum in place while you work the ball shape. It doesn't have to be a perfect circular shape, just so that the gum is a compacted wad.









Move this ball of gum so that it sits right behind your front teeth. Use your tongue to flatten the ball into a small, flat circle. Use the back of your teeth to help flatten it by pushing the ball into them.

, Open your teeth slightly, and extend your tongue until it extends out of your mouth and is covered by a thin, stretched layer of bubblegum. You'll need to be very gentle or you might poke your tongue right through. If that does happen, just form the ball again and start over. Keep practicing as this step can be difficult.









Practice in front of a mirror so you can see when the tip of the gum is in the right position.

,









Many people make the mistake of blowing just out of their lips rather than using breath from deeper within. Lip breath is not strong enough to produce a proper bubble so be sure to put more energy into it. The appropriate way to push air into the gum is like producing a heavy sigh. Use your diaphragm to push the air and exhale.

, Once the air pressure starts expanding the gum you can remove your tongue. The edges of your teeth will help to keep the gum in place. Keep blowing, slow and steady, as you gradually expand the gum.









Keep your mouth open. Resist the urge to close your lips after removing your tongue. Keeping your mouth in an open position will give you a larger area to push air through.

, Use slow, even breaths. This will allow your gum time to expand.See how big you can make a bubble before it pops.









For the biggest bubbles, blow bubbles inside. Stay away from wind and hot or cold temperatures. Cold air and wind can pop your bubble early, while hot air can make it so pliable it gets limp.

, Press your lips together slightly to close the bubble. This will prevent the bubble from getting more air and becoming bigger than desired, or from allowing the air in the bubble to escape.









If you want to avoid the mess of a bubble popping in your face, you can draw the bubble back into your mouth and pop it with your tongue.

, You may not succeed the first few tries but that's all part of the fun. Just keep trying until it happens for you and you get the hang of what it feels like. Blowing bubbles can take some getting used to for your jaw, mouth and diaphragm. With practice you will strengthen the muscles and the process will become easier.

Such areas include:Food chemistry
Food engineering
Food processing

, Think ahead to college graduation. Choose your undergraduate school based on which one will provide you with the most qualifications for acceptance into masters’ programs afterward. Favor those schools that offer internships and opportunities for independent research.Other criteria to consider is the quality of their labs in terms of equipment and software, as well as any job placement programs that the school might offer.

, Earn the minimum qualification for entry-level positions in the field. Attend general courses like food analysis, food chemistry, food engineering, and food microbiology.Other coursework may include subjects such as agricultural economics, packaging and distribution, and quality control and management.A Bachelor of Science degree alone can earn you employment as a research assistant or food science technologist.

Complete an application and submit it at the proper time. , Assist in research for any professors of yours who may be conducting their own research projects at school. Seize the opportunity to possibly score a credit in the published work. Strengthen your resume with even more job-related experience.


Speak with your professors directly about possible opportunities, or search online for postings at your school or elsewhere., Expect your potential employer to only skim it. Keep it short so that they can get the gist of it in one glance.Regardless of what format you choose to follow, begin your resume with a brief summary that encompasses the thrust of all that follows. In a few lines, highlight your experience, accomplishments, and ambitions, and how you wish to apply them to the job at hand. Aim to make your strongest impression here, in case the reader doesn’t bother with the rest. After your summary, include the following:Work experience: Include internships and any paid employment. For each position, list those duties that have the most direct bearing on your desired job to indicate a transferable set of skills. Use strong verbs to define them as personal accomplishments, rather than the general expectations of your former employer. For instance, write that you “advanced research” instead of “I was responsible for research” to suggest a proactive approach to your work.

Education: Include those schools from which you have already graduated, as well as any that you are currently enrolled in. For each one, mention your graduation date, the degree that you earned, and any honors you may have received. If you are still attending school, include your projected graduation date and major. If you were valedictorian with a 4.0 average, feel free to share that, but otherwise leave out any mention of your class ranking or grade point average.

Other experience: Detail skillsets and accomplishments gained from volunteer positions, academic clubs, training or coursework undertaken outside of a school curriculum, or other examples not covered by your academic and job histories. List them in the same manner as your work experiences. Limit yourself to just those that have some direct connection to the job at hand in order to stay on topic. For instance, describe how you organized river cleanups as a demonstration of your leadership skills, but leave out this volunteer work in favor of something more impressive if all you did was participate in the cleanup itself.

, Use the same resume to apply to multiple positions if they are similar in nature, but be sure to write a new cover letter for each single position. Limit yourself to one page so that the reader is more likely to read it in full. Include how your experiences, education, and ambitions make you an ideal candidate for that exact position.Address the cover letter directly to the person who is doing the hiring. Use their title (Dr., Mr., Ms., etc) while omitting their first name to make your letter more personal while still maintaining a professional tone.State the specific job opening to which you are applying as either a subject line in your email or as a lead to your letter’s first paragraph. Avoid making your cover letter seem like a vague, all-purpose letter.
Mirror the language used by the company on their website and publicity materials. Create the impression that you are an ideal fit for their company by speaking the way they speak.
Refer directly to your attached resume to ensure they read it. Request them to contact you in order to set up interviews. Use assumptive language, as if you know for a fact that they will do these things, such as: “The attached resume will detail my experience more extensively,” or “I will be readily available for an interview once you have made your decision.”

, See if they would mind being listed as references on your job applications. Also ask for written recommendations to include with your resume if they have are well known and respected in the field and/or have strong relationships with organizations that you plan on applying to.

, Use contacts from school, internships, and/or former employers to find out about potential openings or upcoming projects that they might know about. Search online or through your college career center for job postings. Public and private entities seeking food scientists include:Academic institutions
Research companies
Local, state, federal, and international food agencies

Choose a kiwano that is fully ripened.,
Give it a rinse.,
Cut the fruit in half short-ways, across the equator.,
Hold one half of the fruit up to your mouth.,
Eat them.,
Consider scooping out the fruit.,
Add kiwano to a fruit salad.,
Garnish roasted meat with kiwano.,
Make kiwano salsa.,
Garnish cocktails with kiwano.,
Make the Intergalactic Nebula.",How to Eat a Kiwano (Horned Melon)," It'll have an orange rind with orange spikes. Squeeze it slightly to make sure it has some give and isn't rock hard and green. If you can't find a fully ripened fruit at the store, wait for it to turn orange before eating it.;
, While you won't be eating the outside, it's always a good idea to rinse fruit you're planning on cutting, to avoid any pesticides or other chemicals on the outside when you cut into it with a knife.

, Set one half aside. This is the best way of cutting the fruit for eating it by itself.


If you want to scoop the seeds out for use in a recipe or fruit salad, it can be easier to scoop if you cut it lengthwise. It's up to you.

, Slowly, but firmly, squeeze the fruit from the lower end. Each tiny greenish sac will contain a cucumber-like seed, and they should come to the cut surface of the fruit easily with a little pressure.

, Like a pomegranate, the seeds are perfectly edible, but are somewhat bland. What you're after is the sweet green flesh around the seed. You can take one at a time into your mouth and separate the seed before spitting it out, or take a whole mouthful and chew it up.


If you don't like the seeds, try pinching the sac of fruit gently with your front teeth. Suck the sac of fruit through your top and bottom teeth, pinching enough to hold the seed on the outside of your teeth, yet still allowing the fruit to pass through.

, You can also scoop out the seeds into a bowl and eat them with a spoon if you prefer. Its easier to break the little green kernels that way, but can be somewhat easier if you don't want to bury your face in the fruit.

, Like kiwi, kiwano can make a nice colorful addition to a fruit salad, and an unexpected treat for guests. Mix bananas, mango, and melon with a sprinkling of kiwano for a beautiful summer fruit salad., Grilling steaks or chops? Instead of topping with rich cheese or mushrooms, consider sprinkling some kiwano kernels on top of your meat a few minutes before serving for an exotic and tangy highlight., Seed one kiwano melon into a bowl and mix it with:


the juice of one lime
a clove of garlic
a palm-full of fresh chopped cilantro
one green onion, or a 1/8 of a white onion
a quarter-teaspoon of cumin
Mix in a small amount of vegetable oil to coat the mixture and use the salsa as a garnish for meat, grilled vegetables, or eat it with chips for some surprising nachos.

, Sprinkle a few green kernels into a champagne flute before mixing up a mimosa or to highlight a gin and tonic instead of a lime slice.

, Remove the Kiwano melon seeds and place in a cup. Fill the cup with sparkling red grape juice cocktail 3/4 of the way to the top of the cup. With the remainder space, add half and a half (optional), Serve in layers for the best look before stirring.

Buy extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO).,
Buy pure or “regular” olive oil.,
Buy light olive oil.",How to Add Olive Oil to Your Diet1," This is the highest quality oil you can buy. Because this version of olive oil is unrefined (not treated with chemicals or altered by temperature), it retains more of the true olive taste.Extra-virgin olive oil also has a lower level of oleic acid (an unsaturated fatty acid), and contains more natural vitamins and minerals found in olive oil, like vitamin E and K.While you can use this oil in cooking/frying/grilling, keep in mind that it has a lower smoke point. EVOO is great for dips, dressings, and dishes that will not be cooked.;
, This version of olive oil may be simply labeled as olive oil or pure olive oil. This oil is a blend of virgin olive oil and refined olive oil (heat and/or chemicals are used to extract oil and flaws from the olive for a more commercial taste).This version of olive oil is an all-purpose cooking oil and is great for frying vegetables or meats. Use this oil to sauté instead of EVOO to avoid a smoke filled kitchen.
In comparison to EVOO, pure olive oil is lighter in color, more neutral in flavor, and has more oleic acid (3-4%). It is lower quality oil., Contrary to popular belief, the “light” does not refer to lower calories. Instead, it is used to describe the oil's lightness in flavor and taste. Light olive oil also has a higher smoke point.Because light olive oil has a higher smoke point, it is great for for baking, sautéing, grilling, and frying.

Stir-fry with olive oil.,
Marinate with olive oil.,
Bake with olive oil.",How to Add Olive Oil to Your Diet2," Instead of using butter to cook your vegetables use olive oil. Depending on how much chopped vegetables you have, use ½ tablespoon to 1 tablespoon of olive oil to cook your vegetables. You can add the oil to the pan prior to adding your vegetables or stir the vegetables in the oil in a bowl or Ziploc bag.


While cooking your vegetables, you can also add in meats like chicken, fish, or beef. If adding in meat, start with a tablespoon of olive oil.

, You can also make a marinade for your meat with olive oil. This marinade works well with poultry, meat, and seafood.Place your meat in a pan and pour the marinade over it. Then, allow it to marinate for at least one hour. You can even marinate the meat overnight for a stronger flavor. Combine the following ingredients by whisking or blending:


¼ cup of fresh lemon juice
½ teaspoon of pepper
½ teaspoon of salt or to taste
3 crushed cloves of garlic
¼ cup of coarsely chopped fresh parsley
¼ cup of coarsely chopped basil, cilantro, dill, oregano, or other herbs you like.
½ cup of EVOO.

, Extend the life of your cake and baked goods by using olive oil instead of butter. The vitamin E in olive oil preserves the freshness of baked goods. Substituting olive oil in your baked goods increases the monounsaturated fats, decreases saturated fats, and decreases cholesterol in the baked goods.


If a recipe calls for a certain amount of butter, simply use ¾ cup of olive oil for every cup of butter.For savory breads and sweets such as cakes, cookies, and other desserts, use the lighter version of olive oil instead of EVOO. This lighter version has a neutral taste and can withstand high-heat cooking methods."
"
Make a dressing.,
Make a homemade mayo.,
Make a pesto.,
Make a dip.",How to Add Olive Oil to Your Diet3," Dressings can be used on vegetables, salads, sandwiches, or anything else you like to eat dressing with! Depending on the recipe, use 1 - 1 1/2 cups of olive oil in your dressing.

, Homemade mayo with olive oil is healthier, tastier, and a lot fresher than store-bought mayo, since it has fewer additives. Slather the mayo on sandwiches or mix it in with your chicken and tuna salads. Use 6.7 oz. (200 ml) of olive oil for this simple homemade recipe.

, Pesto is great for pastas, seafood or poultry dishes, and sandwiches. You can rub it on seafood and poultry as a marinade, cook with it in your pasta dishes, or spread it on a sandwich. You can buy pesto at your local grocery store or make it at home with 1/2 cup of olive oil.

, An olive oil dip is great for dipping bread (preferably a sliced loaf of bread or pita bread) or vegetables (assorted vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, and radishes). Whisk the following ingredients in a bowl to make a simple olive oil dip:1/2 cup of olive oil
1/2 teaspoon of pressed garlic
1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon of parsley
1/2 teaspoon of oregano
Salt and pepper to taste

Stretch out your stomach.,
Develop techniques of eating them that will work for you.,
Suppress the ""gag"" reflex.,
Time yourself.",How to Win a Hot Dog Eating Contest," Hot dog eating legend Takeru Kobayashi begins a unique training regimen 2 months before an event. Be sure that you are training and competing safely to avoid dangers such as acid reflux, choking, stomach rupture, and inflammation or even tearing of the esophagus;see Warnings below.


Make room by stretching your stomach. Gradually eat more and more every day, eating bulky, fibrous foods like watermelon or cabbage and drinking plenty of water. The human stomach has the capacity of about 1 liter (a little more than 1 quart) but can be distended up to four times that capacity (more than a gallon).Write down your goals for consumption and run them by your doctor or dietitian before you start--a hot dog eating trophy is not worth a trip to the hospital or a permanent medical condition.






Exercise to avoid gaining weight. Most eating champions are lean, and many contend that having fat on your stomach actually impedes its ability to expand, referring to it as the ""band of fat theory"".Also, exercising will keep your eating regimen from jeopardizing your health. Kobayashi weight trains in order to build muscle and increase metabolism.;
, Find one that puts that hot dog down fast and smooth. The intuitive approach is to eat the hot dog all at once. Alternatively, you can eat the frankfurters and the buns separately. You can also dip the bun into water before eating it.


Kobayashi uses what he calls the ""Solomon method"" in which he separates the frankfurter from the buns, breaks the frankfurter in half, puts the two pieces in his mouth simultaneously, dips the buns in water, 7Up or Sprite and eats them next. This is done to cut down on chewing time.
Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas, who holds over 20 world records for speed-eating, stresses the importance of coordination. Use your hands to eat and drink as quickly as possible, and watch videos of hot dog eating champions to see how they coordinate their movements to speed up the process.Pack it down. Wiggle your body as you're eating to help the food down and encourage it to settle more compactly in the stomach. Some people refer to this as the ""Kobayashi wiggle""., Vomiting during the competition will guarantee a loss. Just like the sword swallower, train your mind to ignore the urge to upchuck. Hot dog eating contests are not about taste or appetite. They're about control. Remember, however, that gagging is your body's defense against choking, so do not take steps to overcome it unless you're striving to become a competitive speed eater and you never eat without someone else present to help if you choke.

, Find out how much time the contest will give you. For example, Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest lasts 12 minutes. Clock yourself as you practice eating as many hot dogs as you can within that time frame. Track your progress and try to break your previous record.

Be in good physical and mental shape.,
Look for eating contests that are close to you.,
Practice at home briefly before you enter a contest so that you know how it feels and what to expect when eating the food quickly.,
Train your brain.,
Eat normally before the contest.,
Try to exercise regularly before the contest.,
Learn to breathe through your nose if you don't do this normally.,
Prior to the contest, consume as few liquids (water, soda, alcoholic beverages, etc.)",How to Win an Eating Contest1," It is important to ensure that you're healthy and fit before trying an eating contest. Consult your physician before the contest and get their advice. Make sure that you aren't on medication that shouldn't be taken with food. Check with contest officials that EMTs and an ambulance will be present in the event of choking or allergic reactions, or third-degree burns on the roof of your mouth from searing hot taco beef.;
, Find out how to apply and what things you need to know to be involved by phoning or calling in person to see the event organizer. Besides the local news, you can look online at the sites of the professional eating bodies, such as Major League Eating and the Association of Independent Competitive Eaters, to see what contests they are running or supporting. As an amateur, things that you might like to look for in the competition include:


Short length (no more than 7-8 minutes)






Food that you like eating (there's not much point eating food you detest)






Picnic-style eating (this means eating without making a mess, at a good pace and not disrespectfully)A fun occasion, with people not taking it too seriously but wanting to enjoy it.







, Try the same foods that are used in the contest, and importantly, these should be foods that you enjoy eating and are already familiar with. Don't overdo this ""practice run""–just treat it as a familiarization exercise. When trialing, it can be helpful to look for ways to make the food go down faster and more easily. For example (and subject to the contest rules):


Can you fold the food to make it easier to swallow?






Can you tear it into pieces to make it go down faster? Practice coordinating your hands and mouth so that your hands can be tearing food into more edible portions, while your mouth keeps chewing. You won't have time to think about it.






Can you make some of the food propel other parts of the food down faster, such as using cheese to help pizza base slide down?






Check your chewing and swallowing techniques and see if you can do anything to improve these for the contest.







, It can't hurt to do some mental limbering up to help you prepare for the contest. Visualize succeeding and enjoying the occasion in the lead-up. Professionals also train to try to overcome our brain's natural ""stop-eating"" signals, but this not a healthy approach for amateurs to take and could lead to unhealthy eating habits in your everyday life.

, Starving yourself is unhealthy for the body, so eat light meals up until the contest day. Fasting can also cause your stomach to tighten up, which you definitely don't want!

, Exercise will keep you flexible, focused, and in good shape.

, You won't have time to mouth breathe while you are eating.

, as possible. Too many liquids will only fill the stomach, creating less room for food. However, some professionals do advise that it is fine to drink up to a liter of water to help expand the stomach, and to have herbal tea for calming and cleansing. In addition, do not drink milk during the contest because you risk vomiting through your nose.

Buy a ripe banana.,
Peel the banana.,
Remove the ""strings."",
Eat the banana.,
Get rid of the skin.",How to Eat a Banana1," for a banana that is yellow and lightly speckled with small brown or black spots. Some people prefer the firmer yellow-all-over stage; some prefer the softer, sweeter, stronger-flavored yellow-and-brownish stage.


If the banana is not ripe, you can leave it on a warm counter for a day or two.;
, Some people prefer to peel the entire thing and then eat it, while others peel as they go. There's many ways to peel a banana. If you have not peeled one before, you might find one of these methods easy:


Peel the banana from the stem end. Snap back the stalk at the top of the fruit, then pull it downwards alongside the fruit. Pull the rest of the skin off in similar strips.
Peel the banana from the blossom end. This is the flat, brown stub at the end of the banana. Pinch just behind the blossom end to break it apart, then peel bits of it downward.
If you don't want the whole banana at once, cut it in half before peeling. Cover the half you won't be eating right away with plastic wrap, and store it in the fridge.

, Bananas have fibrous strands between the skin and the fruit. These usually come off along with the peel, but sometimes they may stick to the fruit. Gently peel these off before eating the banana. They are not bad for you, but many people find them to have a bitter taste and odd texture.

, You can eat the banana bite by bite, peeling a little bit of it as you go. You can also peel it all at once, slice it with a knife, and eat it with a fork. You can even use it in smoothies, dip it in chocolate and freeze it, fry it, or even grill it! Here are some ideas to get you started:


Add a sliced banana to cereal or oatmeal.
Drizzle some honey over banana slices for extra sweetness.
Make a peanut butter banana sandwich on whole wheat bread.
Cut a banana in half lengthwise, and fill it with peanut butter. Put the banana back together, and eat it like a sandwich.

, If you are in an in-closed area, such as a room, throw it away in a closed bag or closed trashcan, otherwise the banana will feel the room with its odor. Alternatively, you can also save the banana peel to use as compost in your garden.

"
"
Start out ""soft"" when you begin.,
Avoid entering any competition where the food is not right for you.,
Know how to eat the food the best way possible.",How to Win an Eating Contest2," If you're new to eating contests, it can be a good idea to begin with soft items such as pancakes, grits, meatballs, and funnel cakes.You can progress to harder and multiple foods as you feel more confident.

, If it makes you feel sick, if you're allergic to it, if you just plain hate it, where's the fun or sense in that? Be selective!

, Knowing how food behaves when eaten is important, and if you've practiced at home already, you should have a good idea of what works and what does not. For some additional tips:

Add a peeled and sliced banana into a blender.,
Add the milk and yogurt.,
Top it off with peanut butter.,
Blend the ingredients until smooth.,
Pour into two tall glasses and serve immediately.",How to Eat a Banana2," Slicing the banana up first will make it easier to blend and give you a smoother drink in the end. For an extra-thick smoothie, use a frozen banana.

, For a thicker smoothie, omit the milk and use ⅔ cup (165 grams) yogurt.

, If you don't like peanut butter, you can use another type of nut butter, such as almond. You can also use some chocolate sauce instead (start with 2 tablespoons, then add more if needed).

, If the smoothie is not thick enough for you, toss in 5 to 7 ice cubes.

, You can garnish each glass with some whipped cream, or a swirl of chocolate and/or caramel sauce. "

Cut the banana into ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices.,
Freeze the bananas for 1 hour.,
Melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a small bowl.,
Set the mixture aside and take out the bananas.,
Dip the banana slices in the cooled chocolate.,
Place the coated banana slice back onto the wax paper lined baking sheet.,
Put the bananas back into the freezer until the chocolate is set and the bananas are frozen.",How to Eat a Banana3," Peel the banana first, and remove any fibrous strands. Cut the banana into thin slices with a sharp knife.

, Cover a baking sheet with wax paper and spread the bananas across it in an even layer.

, Place the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a small bowl and heat for 30 seconds. Give the mixture a stir, and heat for another 15 seconds. Stir it until all the chocolate chips have melted and the mixture is smooth. If necessary, heat the mixture for another few seconds., If you'd like, you can glue two banana slices together with some peanut butter to make mini banana sandwiches. This is completely optional, but it makes quite the treat!, Once the chocolate has cooled, spear a banana slice onto a fork, and dip it into the chocolate. Use a spoon to help you pour chocolate onto any hard-to-reach areas.


For an added touch, you can dip the banana slice into some crushed walnuts for extra protein.

, Keep dipping banana slices until you have none left.

, At this point, they are ready to eat. You can store them in small, plastic sandwich bags for easy snacking.

Toss in the banana slices and fry them for 4 minutes.,
Flip the banana slices over and fry them for another 4 minutes.,
Serve the fired bananas immediately.",How to Eat a Banana4," Set the bananas slices aside, but have them ready for frying.

, Stir them with a spatula as they melt so that they get mixed together. Once the butter is melted and bubbling, you are ready for the next step.

, As the bananas cook, they will start to caramelize and turn a golden brown color. If they start to burn too fast, however, turn the heat down.

, They are ready when both sides are a golden brown color. Be sure to have a plate ready for serving.

, You can serve them on their own, or with other foods, such as: French toast, ice cream, pancakes, or yogurt."

Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.,
Slice a peeled banana open, lengthwise, and place it on a sheet of tinfoil.,
Fill the banana with the mini marshmallows and chocolate chips.,
Wrap the foil around the banana and grill it for 5 to 6 minutes.,
Unwrap the banana and top it with the crushed graham cracker.,
Let the banana cool, then eat it with a spoon.",How to Eat a Banana5," If you don't have a grill, you can preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C) instead.

, Be sure that you are slicing the banana inside the curve. Do not slice it all the way open, however; you want the two halves to be connected at the bottom, like a hot dog.

, The chocolate and mini marshmallows will make a small pile on top of the banana. You can layer them, like making s'mores, or you can mix them together first.

, If you are using an oven, bake it for 5 to 6 minutes, and then broil it (uncovered) until the marshmallows are golden brown., This is that final touch that will make the banana more s'more like. If you don't have any graham crackers, you can use any cinnamon-honey flavored crackers or cereal.

, The s'more like flavor makes it an ideal camping trip treat!

Read up on the rules before attempting the eating contest.,
Take it easy.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Relax that evening and eat very lightly, if at all, and drink only water.",How to Win an Eating Contest3," There are some basic things that apply to many competitive eating competitions:


Find out if ""chipmunking"" is permitted - this is the practice of stuffing in as much food as possible before chewing it and swallowing - usually there will be a time limit on how long you can keep this in your mouth;






Find out if ""dunking"" is permitted - this is where you are allowed to dunk your food in water to make it softer and easier to swallow; be aware, however, that doing this is considered fairly disrespectful of the food;Know whether or not you can make a mess eating. Some contests insist that you keep the area clean (picnic-style), others let you make a mess. It all depends on the type of food you're eating and how much mess you think you might make. Picnic-style is probably better for amateurs, as it encourages you to pace yourself and be conscious of the eating process as it is happening, rather than simply gorging yourself silly.Understand that vomiting is considered to be a disqualification in most eating contests. If you get to this point, you're probably not enjoying yourself anyway!







, While that may sound odd, it is important not to panic or rush, but to eat steadily with speed. If you panic or rush, you will make mistakes and be less successful.

, While it's competitive, it's meant to be ""fun competitive"" and if you're taking it too seriously, then it's probably better to play a ball game to release your pent-up energy.

, Let your body settle back into its normal routine and eat as usual the following day, or when you feel ready.

Create a theme for your tea tasting party.,
Consider where you'll hold the tea party.,
Send out invitations to your tea tasting party.,
Choose the teacups, cutlery and other accompaniments.,
Select the tea varieties.,
Organize the tea for tasting.,
Offer food and sweeteners for tea.,
Hold a quick tea tasting class.,
Have guests rate the teas.,
Know your teas.",How to Arrange a Tea Tasting Party," A tea tasting party could be a fun way to celebrate a marriage, birthday or ""just because"". By following a theme for your party, you can make it even more special. Suitable themes that still focus on the tasting aspect include: floral garden, Japanese, Russian, tropical, winter wonder, Southern style and Moroccan. Each of these themes could easily incorporate a range of tea varieties for tasting.


Fantasy themes are also a great choice. For example, if you are a huge Alice in Wonderland fan, try a “Mad Hatter” tea party for a bit of an edge.
The time of day may influence your theme. For example, mid- to late-morning could be brunch, mid- to late-afternoon could be an early light dinner, etc.

, During the colder months, it will have to be indoors or in the morning room/conservatory. For warmer weather, the garden provides more opportunities, from the patio to the rose garden or herb patch. If you'd rather hold the party out of your house, try renting a room in a suitable clubhouse, hotel or restaurant, keeping an eye on your budget of course.


Your choice of where to hold the tea party will also be determined by your ability to boil the water for tea (and keep it warm). If you hire a place, check that they'll do this for you, or provide a space for you to do it.
Think about whether you'll need helpers; if you're hosting and serving, it can be a bit hectic. Friends or family may be willing to do some of the organizing and tea serving with you.

, Handwritten is nicest, it has something in keeping with the centuries-old art of tea drinking. Let guests know that this is a tea tasting party, and not just an ordinary tea party.


If you would like to specify any special arrangements, such as dressing up, bringing anything, etc., add this to your invitation.
Use your imagination for making the invitations. Anything from vintage postcards to teabags attached to a card will work well.

, Use your best teacups where possible––fine bone china or high quality teacups are best. If you don't have any, visit a secondhand or thrift store and purchase an eclectic set of old but beautiful teacups. Even though they may not match, the fact that they have a history and have been chosen for their prettiness will make for a great vintage tea party theme in keeping with the tea drinking spirit. Some of the things you'll likely need include:



Teapots: You'll need a teapot per each type of tea.

Teacups: As mentioned above, the best quality you can find. For Chinese or Japanese tea tasting, you'll need to use the appropriate non-handled small teacups made in China or Japan (visit local Asian grocery stores for stock).
Heatproof glasses: For Moroccan mint tea or for fresh herbal teas, if serving.
Tea strainers: Find pretty ones in good condition, or purchase new ones (they're usually inexpensive).
Milk jugs, sugar pots: Choose ones of good quality.
Teaspoons: The prettier, the better. Polish up that silver!
Dainty cake or dessert plates: For the food accompanying the tea (if any).

, The type of tea that you'll use will depend on the theme (if you have one) or on your own preference. It does pay to be a bit daring and throw in some tea varieties that are new to you, as you may be surprised to discover new flavors that please you and your guests. Consider offering teas from various regions and kinds to make the party extra interesting.


Visit a store dedicated to selling tea. Browse through the varieties on offer, chat with the salesperson about their opinions and try a few samples if possible.
Read about different tea varieties. You can find a lot of information in books and online, as people have devoted much time to writing about drinking tea.
See the brief rundown of major tea varieties set out below for more help.

, Include a wide variety of tea, with a minimum of six tea varieties for tasting. Use tea leaves, not teabags for the best taste and impact.


Six different teas may be the norm for a tea tasting party, however you can go with four or even eight depending on the crowd and the amount of time. Like a wine tasting party the idea is to soak in and appreciate the tea so, while you want to provide guests with enough tea to savor, you want them to have enough gastronomical room to accompany each flavor.
Decide how you'll present the tea. Teas will need to be in a serving container, usually a teapot (or a thermal drink container). Display ideas might include lidded mugs (see image for concept) or bowls of tea with tea leaves on small square plates.
Clearly label and provide background information about each tea. In some cases, providing a bowl of the original tea leaves can be helpful for tasters to see the original tea and smell it in its dry state.
Using your background research on the tea you're serving, let your guests know about the tea’s origin. It can also be fun to share information about the tea's health properties, historical tidbits of interest and any other fun facts.
Provide each guest with a quarter cup sample of each tea.

, Although including honey or sugar may considered to be somewhat sacrilegious by some tea drinkers, it’s always a good idea to provide condiments and some food during a tea tasting party.


Offer nearly every kind of sweetener including artificial for diet-conscious guests. Instead of sugar or sweetener in small packets consider a bowl of sugar cubes, honey in a tiny honey pot or a bowl of sugar with a dainty spoon.
Have trays of small, delicate sandwiches and cookies displayed on tables. Sugar wafer cookies and scones are considered to be traditional sweets for a tea tasting party. Also, cucumber or watercress sandwiches may be a lovely addition to your party. Keep the snacks light in order to maintain focus on the main attraction––the tea.
Don't forget to place pitchers of ice water and glasses on each table. Even though tea is not as heavy as wine, provide enough ice water for your guests in the event they want to clean their palate.
Some tea drinkers enjoy a slice of lemon with their tea. Leave some slices of lemon on a pretty plate, with some dainty tongs for selecting.

, For fun, instruct your guests on proper tea drinking etiquette. While you may not be having tea with the Royals, knowing proper English-influenced (or Southern-style) tea etiquette can be a fun way to host your tea tasting party.


Show your guests how to hold the teacup correctly. Cups with handles should be held with the thumb at the six o'clock position and the index and middle fingers at the twelve o'clock position. When tea drinkers use their pinkie it’s raised slightly in the air for balance.
Show your guests how to use the teaspoon. Instead of rapidly stirring your tea in a circular motion, tea drinkers should carefully move their spoon gently through the tea in a wave motion before placing the spoon on the saucer.
Demonstrate how to serve tea. Traditionally, tea is typically served with milk, not cream. However, in the event of a tea tasting party you should instead just serve it plain so guests can appreciate the tea’s true essence. Note that the method of serving tea changes depending on the cultural angle you're taking; for example, Japanese and Chinese tea serving ceremonies tend to be more elaborate than those of the English tea serving. Read up on the style you're planning to introduce.
Explain the proper way to drink tea. Proper ladies and gentlemen never slurp or chug their tea. Instead it should be delicately sipped and savored.

, Ask guests to rate the tea on small index cards. Help your guests describe the tea by providing questions on each index card such as, “what did the tea smell like, describe the color, how did the tea taste and did the smell and appearance match the flavor?” Hold a discussion at the end to see which teas rated the most highly.


If you like, send guests home with sample packs of the teas that they tasted during the party. If you have the time, add some notes on the tea varieties to further their knowledge.

, While there are many varieties of tea for you to choose from (and you're strongly encouraged to roam widely in your tea selection), this list provides a basic starter to help you:



Assam tea: This tea comes from the largest tea-growing region in the world. It is a rich tea, with a malty taste. It tends to be best drunk with milk.

Darjeeling tea: This is considered to be the ""champagne"" of Indian teas. It is the classic afternoon tea variety and has a very fine taste.

Earl Grey tea: This tea is a blend of China black tea and the essential oil of bergamot (orangey-flavor). This blend is very popular and the tea has a citrus after-taste. It is often served with a slice of lemon.

Flavored tea: There are many flavored tea varieties available, including hazelnut, rose, caramel, vanilla and more. The suitability of these teas depends on the quality of the tea, the skill of the tea blender and the personal taste of the tea drinker. Keep these to a minimum for a tea tasting party.

Formosa oolong: These teas can range considerably in flavor from a light, floral taste through to very earthy flavors for the darker varieties. This Taiwanese tea variety has a slightly spicy peach/apricot flavor, is bright golden in color and doesn't taste bitter.

Jasmine tea: This is a delicate tea with a floral flavor. Made from jasmine flowers layered in green tea, this tea is much loved. Do not add milk!

Keemun tea: This is a classic black, China tea. It has a delicate flavor, a light aroma and tastes both smooth and sweet. Adding milk can cover up its delicate floral tones.

Eat breakfast within one hour of waking.,
Avoid simple carbohydrates.,
Aim for a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fat.,
Consume complex carbs.,
Include some protein.,
Eat healthy fats.,
Fill up your plate.",How to Boost Your Metabolism at Breakfast1," You have probably heard the famous saying that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day,” and it’s true! That is because when you wake up, you likely haven’t eaten for 8 to 10 hours. Your blood sugar is low, and so are your energy levels. You need to “break” the “fast” within one hour of waking up. A healthy breakfast will jump start your metabolism and your day, but waiting too long to eat can actually slow you down., Typical breakfast choices (such as a bagel with cream cheese or toast with jam) can give you some quick energy, but they will spike your blood sugar and leave you to crash. This can lead to insulin resistance, plus it will leave you feeling hungry again soon. Stay away from white bread and sweets in the morning.You'll want to stay away from donuts, waffles, pancakes, and white toast. Opt for 100% whole wheat toast instead.
Watch out for added sugar in oatmeal or breakfast cereals.
Refrain from adding sugar (or sweetened creamer) to your coffee.

, Instead, you need to eat a balanced breakfast that includes complex carbohydrates, protein, and fat at the same time. This nourishes you, and gets your metabolism rolling.Good sources of protein include eggs, plain Greek yogurt, beans, chicken, or fish.
Your carbohydrates should come from fruits, veggies, and whole grains.
Good sources of healthy fats include avocados, eggs, coconut oil, nuts, and seeds.
A veggie omelet (especially one cooked in coconut oil) is a great example of a balanced breakfast with carbs, protein, and healthy fats.

, Instead of simple carbohydrates, you want to start your day with complex carbs. The best carbohydrates to boost your metabolism should come from whole grains and vegetables. These complex carbohydrates will keep you full longer and give you sustained energy throughout your day.

Try having steel-cut oatmeal or brown rice porridge, with a side of carrots dipped in natural peanut butter.

, You metabolism works the best when it is fueled by protein and complex carbohydrates simultaneously. Be sure to include some lean protein in your breakfast! Include a side of turkey sausage or add some Greek yogurt to your oats. Eggs are an excellent source of protein too!, To really get your metabolism started in the morning, you must also include a serving of healthy fats. This can be as simple as adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to your brown rice porridge, cooking your omelet in clarified butter, or enjoying a spoonful of peanut butter. Add some healthy fat to your meal to rev your metabolism and feel full.

However, keep in mind that there may already be fat in your breakfast from things like yogurt, milk, and breakfast sausage.

, Not only does breakfast help jump start your metabolism and help give you energy all day, but the heartier your breakfast is, the better! A recent study shows that getting 22 to 55% of your total calories at breakfast may help you stay slim, whereas getting 0 to 11% of your calories from breakfast may lead to weight gain. So fill up your plate and get full at breakfast.

Pour the egg mixture into the tin.,
Bake the eggs until they are just set.",How to Bake Eggs in Muffin Tins1," To make sure that the oven is hot enough to bake the eggs, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Next, grease a 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray so the eggs won’t stick.If you prefer, you can grease the muffin tin with butter or margarine.;
, Break a dozen eggs into a large bowl. Use a whisk to beat them as you would if you were making scrambled eggs.If you prefer, you can use an egg substitute in place of the eggs. Follow the instructions on the packaging to determine how much you need to replace a dozen eggs.
To reduce the calories and cholesterol, you can also replace a few of the whole eggs with egg whites.

, After you’ve beaten the eggs, mix in ½ cup (75 g) of diced onion, ¼ cup (45 g) of diced green pepper, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder, ½ cup (58 g) of shredded cheddar cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir until the mixture is well combined.You can use any vegetables that you like in the eggs, such as mushrooms, greens, and/or tomatoes.

You can substitute another cheese in the muffins, such as swiss or pepper jack, or use a combination of two or more cheeses.
If you want to make the egg muffins heartier, you can also mix cooked meat into the eggs. Sausage, bacon, and ham are all delicious options.
Mixing frozen shredded hash browns into the egg mixture can help make more filling muffins too.

, When the eggs are completely mixed with the vegetables and seasonings, use a spoon to fill the cups in the greased muffin tin. Aim to fill the cups with approximately ⅓ cup (80 ml) of the eggs., Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven, and allow the muffins to bake until they eggs are set, which should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes.

Start small.,
Eat slowly.,
Learn the types of heat available.,
Gradually increase the amount of spice in your food.,
Study up on different cuisine.,
Eat foods that help absorb heat.,
Eat dishes that mix heat with other flavors.,
Keep a glass of milk nearby.",How to Adapt to Spicy Food," Begin eating foods that are only slightly spicier than what you are currently accustomed. For example, add more black pepper to your meal than you normally would, or garnish something with a few sprinklings of red pepper flakes.There are hot varieties of candies and other small snacks that can help inject a regular helping of heat into your day. Check your local Latin market for a good selection of spicy candies.;
, Devouring an entire plate of peppers at once will not do you any favors when trying to acclimate to spicier foods. Doing so will more likely turn you off of spicy food altogether. Instead, add just a bit of spice to each meal over a long period of time. Savor the spice to get the full experience of the heat.Be patient. Don’t get discouraged if your palate doesn’t seem to be adjusting to the heat. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to months to get accustomed to the new level of spice., Not all types of heat in food are the same. The heat found in dishes with hot peppers are a much different experience than dishes that are heavy in garlic or wasabi. Education will help you branch out into hotter foods that are appropriate for your level of tolerance.


Some foods, such as garlic and radishes, have a natural spiciness to them that don’t stem from the heat-causing agents of chili peppers. These can be a great gateway into spicier foods, without necessarily packing the physical sensations that dishes featuring hotter substances possess. If you are just starting out, you might start with these foods, as they cannot physically damage your mouth with their oils.When cooking with peppers, look into each pepper's heat index rating (referred to as the Scoville Scale). Measure which peppers you can handle as a baseline, and move up from there. Go for broke! , As you adjust to the level of heat you can tolerate, increase the heat level of your meals. As you do so, you will open up a wide range of food options you might never have considered trying. You can achieve this in a variety of ways.


Increase the quantity of the spicy food you are eating. Eating larger quantities of spicy food at a faster rate increases the reaction your body will produce to the heat.
Add a hotter variety of the type of spice you enjoy. Many spicy foods come in a variety of heat levels, including chili peppers, onions and mustard.
Add foods that provide a different kind of heat. Mustard, horseradish and wasabi, for example, produce a shorter heat located in the nasal passages, rather than the mouth.Cut back on the bread and milk. Rather than fight the heat, allow it to work its course! The goal is to build your tolerance.

, Many different types of cuisine throughout the world utilize a few staple spices in their dishes. Become familiar with the go-to spices of each regional cuisine to prepare yourself for a particular level of heat.


Indian cuisine, for example, often employs a few specific peppers in a spice mixture called a masala. Most common in these masalas is the green finger chile. Chefs will often adjust the spice mixture of the masala, so ask ahead to gauge the spiciness featured in the masala.
Ethiopian food often contains a spice mixture called “berbere,” which features not only red chili peppers, but ginger, garlic and cloves. This mix of heat can create a much different (and hotter) experience than a dish featuring only capsaicin-based spices., During your quest to improve your tolerance, keep a selection of foods nearby that absorb the oils that create the spicy sensation. These side dishes can help lower the overall heat experienced with the food while still helping your taste buds acclimate.


Starchy foods, including bread, crackers or potatoes, are a few examples of foods that can absorb capsaicin, the oil that causes the heat in spicy foods., A particularly hot spice or pepper can be diluted into a more tolerable state by mixing it into a dish with other strong flavors. Lime and cilantro, for example, both have cooling effects and can help counteract the spice. Medleys featuring a mix of vegetables or meat can also help dilute the spice.Sugar also helps dilute the heat associated with spicy foods. A spicy dish with a little sweet on the side will help create a well-rounded dish., Milk is a classic reliever of heat thanks to a compound called “casein” that binds with capsaicin and washes it away. If you are entering new territory in terms of heat, or simply need occasional relief in between bites, take a few sips of milk.Dairy, such as yogurt or sour cream, works similarly to milk when it comes to relieving heat, and can make for a great side item in many spicy dishes.

Get a tray that has small sides on it.,
Decide what you'll make for breakfast.,
Prepare the breakfast as quietly as possible, if there's a chance you might wake the person up.,
Pour any liquids only 3/4 of the way.,
Add some nice touches:


Lay a single flower down on the tray, or sprinkle flower petals across the tray.,
When you bring the breakfast, put it aside while you prepare the area.,
Turn on the television, play music, or give the person something to read while they eat.,
When they're done, clean up.",How to Make Breakfast in Bed," This will contain the food securely, and keep any spillage from falling onto the bed. There are specially made small tables intended for this very purpose. If you can't find one, use a laptop desk.;
, Here are some ideas:



Make a Tropical Breakfast. This is both healthy and refreshing.

Make One Egg Waffles. These are a little healthier than most waffles, but if you really want to spoil someone, make French toast waffles.

Serve a Bagel Breakfast. Be sure to include a variety of delicious condiments as well as a choice of bagels.

Make a Traditional Full English Breakfast. An English muffin with some eggs, and orange juice, coffee, or tea on the side is good.

, If you can chop or mix any ingredients the night before, do so. If you're making coffee, put a towel along the crack at the bottom of the bedroom door so that they don't smell it. (This is assuming that you want the breakfast in bed to be a surprise.)


Be sure to clean up after yourself, too. If the person you're treating comes into the kitchen to find a pigsty, that might kill their delight over what you just did for them.
See also the articles on How to Make a Good Pot of Coffee and Make Tea. Don't forget to supply cream and sugar, if the person being treated likes it in their hot drink.

, This is especially important with hot liquids, as you don't want them to spill onto the person or the bed linen when the tray is moved.

,
On the plates, around the food, add some edible flowers (perhaps some candied violets).
If using a cloth napkin, fold it into a pyramid shape.
You can also fold a paper napkin into a rose (not the one they will be using, just an extra one for decoration).

Make a card with a nice note written in it.

, Use a stand such as a coffee table, or a folding table already assembled. Puff up the pillows, and add extras, so as to make sitting up more comfortable. Straighten the bed covering, so that you can place down the tray's legs (if any). If the tray is flat, add some books or something strong under the tray for support.

, Or, of course, feel free to stick around and talk with them!

, Take the tray from them and clean the dishes. Another excellent touch is to run a luxury bath and while they're enjoying it, make the bed!

Crack an egg into each cup of the muffin tin.,
Bake the eggs until the whites are set.",How to Bake Eggs in Muffin Tins2," In order for the eggs to poach properly, the oven must be hot enough when you place them inside. Set your oven’s temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure you know how your oven alerts you that it’s finished preheating. It may beep or flash an indicator light.

, Before you break the eggs into the muffin tin, you need to place some water in each cup for the eggs to poach in. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water into each of the tin’s cups that you plan to place an egg in., After you’ve added the water to the muffin tin, break an egg into each cup of the muffin tin. You don’t necessarily have to fill all of the cups in the tin, so you can just poach one or two eggs if you prefer.While it means fewer dishes if you crack the eggs directly into the muffin tin, you may find it easier to break them into a small, shallow dish, such as a ramekin, and then carefully pour them into the tin.

, Once you’ve added the eggs to the muffin tin, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the eggs to bake for 11 to 15 minutes, or until the egg whites are set.If you prefer runny yolks, bake the eggs for 11 to 13 minutes.
If you like your yolks a little more cooked, bake the eggs for 14 to 15 minutes.
When you remove the muffin tin from the oven, you may see that some of the water has risen and is sitting on top of the eggs. Make sure that you know the difference between that and egg whites that haven’t fully set.

Exercise before breakfast.,
Allow enough time for breakfast.,
Drink juice at the very least.,
Don't snack at night.,
Drink plenty of water before bed.",How to Feel Like Eating Breakfast First Thing in the Morning," Sleep deprivation or a bad night's sleep can make us feel nauseated and bloated. This will starve off feelings of hunger until later in the morning when tiredness begins to be mistaken for hunger. You are more likely to eat candy bars and fatty baked goods later in the day to quell the queasy stomach if this is why you skipped breakfast.;
, Some of us dislike the same breakfast food on our plate every morning. If the thought of cornflakes, pop tarts or toast has you reaching for the car keys with an empty stomach, it's time to vary your choices. Check wikiHow on breakfast for lots of suggestions. Consider the following possibilities:


Fruits - sliced into your cereal, tropical platter, smoothies, etc
Cereals - oatmeal, homemade granola or berry granola

Breads - scones, crumpets, bagels, French toast waffles, homemade biscuits

Spreads - exotic jams and ""spreads"" such as marmite
Eggs - the manner of preparing them is endless; add sauces such as salsa, soy sauce, and Tabasco for variety
Beans - baked beans and sausage, beans and rice, refried beans in a breakfast burrito, etc.
Meats - bacon and eggs, ham and eggs, sausage, chorizo, smoked fish, etc.
Drinks - smoothies (fruit/milk/soy), freshly squeezed juice, blended drinks, vegetable juices
Ethnic specialities such as breakfast tacos or Arroz Con Leche, idli (steamed rice cake popular in southern India), dosa (a type of pancake made with rice and pulses), chapati (roasted Indian bread made from whole wheat flour) with vegetables, etc.
Frozen Foods - Although frozen foods do not tend to be as healthful as fresh foods, there are endless varieties of pastries, breakfast pizzas, and other things that you can prepare quickly and easily.
Leftovers or foods that are more typically thought of as dinner foods can be good options if you are not a fan of breakfast foods.

, There is a saying: ""Eat like a king for breakfast, a queen for lunch and a pauper for dinner."" This makes sense if you are hauling hay or tilling crops with a hoe all day. It makes less sense if you are stumbling off to a desk and making minimal moves in front of your computer. If you have a more sedentary job, you are more likely to benefit from ""grazing"" - eating smaller amounts more frequently during the day. This might just make breakfast a palatable option for you as you will only need to consider eating half an apple or a cupful of strawberries or one piece of toast etc. to start out your day. As the day progresses, nibble on healthy portions here and there and have your larger meal later in the day. Of course this is opinion. There is another school of thought which considers mental exercise particularly energy consuming and says that a large breakfast keeps you sharp.

, For many workers, dinner often ends up being the main meal. This could be having an impact on your breakfast desire. If this meal is very important in your household (e.g., it is the only time the family sits together) or you simply enjoy making this the largest meal, make sure that you finish it before 7 or 8 pm at the latest. That way the food will digest before you go to bed and your body can then begin to work its way towards morning hunger.

, If you are having both large lunches (especially in a business environment) and a large evening meal, you are probably removing your morning's hunger as the food is still being digested. Try eating a larger breakfast combined with making healthy choices both eating out and at home; while this will probably be hard at first, it might help to lessen the amounts you consume later in the day, thereby making it easier to eat more at breakfast. It will also make weight maintenance easier.

, This might help you to work up an appetite. At the very least, drink a smoothie or a multi-fruit juice to give your body some vitamins and a small amount of fiber.

, If you are feeling stressed or in a rush in the morning you may be less inclined to spend the time on a good breakfast. Try to prioritize sitting down for a relaxed meal (this can be true for all meals of the day.)

, If you really feel too nauseated or averse to chewing, down a glass of juice (such as orange juice) to give your body some energy. Try it before you take a shower, get dressed etc.; it may increase your desire for eating something afterwards by waking up your stomach after a long fast. Avoid drinks with fat in them (such as milk) which takes longer to digest, and may give you a feeling of fullness/satisfaction, leading to skipping breakfast altogether. If your stomach is sensitive to the acid in, say orange juice or apple juice, try grape juice.

, Some people, especially those who tend toward bedtime heartburn, stop eating a few hours before they retire. This makes them hungry enough to eat breakfast, and may also help them cut back on ""empty"" calories. If you absolutely need late night snacks, try small portions such as cheese cubes, apple slices, a banana or hot drinks.

, At least two to three cups. This helps keep your stomach acid diluted and will remove that queasiness that some people experience.

Understand what beef back ribs are.,
Choose rib size.,
Consider price.,
Calculate amount needed.",How to Buy Beef Ribs1,"


The back ribs are cut from the top section of the rib and contain some of the flavorful and fatty rib roast meat. There are 13 ribs to each side of the steer and they can be cut from the rib roast or loin portion of the steer. The ribs cut from closer to the rib roast are often trimmed close to the bone with little meat on them except for what is between the bones. Ribs cut from the loin section are often slightly meatier, though they are slightly less flavorful.;
,


Beef back ribs can be cut to any length, from dino ribs which are about 18 inches (46 cm) long to a more manageable 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm). They can be packaged in groups of 13 bones all the way to packages of single bones. Most home cooks don't have the equipment to cook the dino ribs, so you may need to special order those from the butcher.

,


Ribs requiring the least amount of butchering are generally the least expensive. Single portion ribs are typically the most expensive. Ribs that come from the rib roast (closer to the head of the steer) may also be more expensive than those cut from the loin.

Due to the varying cuts of rib bone length, it is difficult to say how much each person might eat in rib bone weight. Consider instead that each person might eat 2 to 3 bones, perhaps an additional if the bones are cut shorter than 6 inches (15 cm) long.

Choose bone-in or boneless.,
Inspect the package.,
Consider the amount needed.",How to Buy Beef Ribs2,"


Short ribs are cut from the short plate section on the steer. This area is near the bottom of the animal, and the short ribs are cut from near the flank and brisket areas. These ribs are much shorter in length, usually around 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. They have much more meat attached to them compared to the longer back ribs, but unless they're braised they're nearly impossible to chew.

,


Short ribs are often available boneless. Boneless short ribs have the benefit of having less connective tissue and sinew, but they lack the flavor that comes from being on the bone. Boneless short ribs can also be more expensive, though you're getting more meat for your dollar.

,


All short ribs are not created equal. While most short ribs have a good layer of meat on them, those toward the flank end of the steer have less meat. Butchers slip 1 or 2 of these lean bones into each package. Inspect the package carefully to ensure that each bone has a good portion of meat on it. Boneless rib packages should not have excess layers of fat on the meat.

,


Allow 3 to 4 very meaty short ribs per person, slightly more if they are not especially meaty. For boneless short ribs, you should allow about 6 oz. (170 g) per person.

Choose between select, choice, prime and kobe/waygu.,
Choose from organic, grass fed or conventional beef.",How to Buy Beef Ribs3,"


Both beef short ribs and back ribs are available in various grades. Most standard grocery stores will carry select grade meat. This meat is perfectly acceptable for consumption, and is the least expensive. Choice and prime cuts are often available only at specialty grocers and butchers, but they have additional marbling through the meat, which adds flavor and tenderness. Kobe, or waygu, may only be available if you special order it through your butcher.

,


Organic beef comes from steer that were raised and slaughtered according to that area's organic certification standards. It is typically the most expensive compared to grass fed or conventional beef. Grass fed beef is raised on grass and may or may not have any hormones or other additives. Conventional beef is mass produced and available at the lowest price.

",How to BBQ Brisket," For a moist, juicy barbecued brisket, choose a piece of meat that has a layer of fat approximately ½-inch (1.27-cm) thick on one side. Purchase a 5 to 6 pound (2.25 to 2.75 kg) brisket with a thick layer of fat to ensure a successful barbecue.For best results, opt for a brisket that's USDA Choice or better meat. Your butcher may not have those pieces of meat on display, so you may need to ask for it. In some cases, you may even need to special order it.Look for a brisket with visible fat striations to ensure a moist piece of meat.;
, Unwrap your brisket, and allow it to rinse under cold, running water for several minutes. Carefully pat the meat dry with paper towels, and set it aside for a moment.If the layer of fat on the brisket is thicker than ½-inch (1.27-cm), use a sharp knife to trim it down. You can go as thin as ¼-inch (0.6-cm).

, In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (17 g) of coarse salt, such as kosher or sea salt, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (7.5 g) of chili powder, 2 teaspoons (4 g) of sugar, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground black pepper, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of ground cumin until well combined. Rub the spice mixture all over the brisket so it’s completely coated.You can add other spices or seasoning to your rub, depending on your preference. Some options to consider include dry mustard, granulated garlic, cayenne powder, dried oregano, and paprika.

, Once you’ve rubbed the brisket with the spice mixture, cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to cure in the refrigerator for 4 to 8 hours so the flavors of the spices have time to penetrate the meat.You can skip this step if you’re short on time. The brisket will still be flavorful if you cook it right after applying the rub.

, To give the brisket a delicious smoky flavor, you need to barbecue it with wood chips. Take 6 cups of hickory or mesquite chips, and soak them for an hour in enough cold water to cover the wood. When the hour is up, drain the water from the chips so they’re ready for the grill.If you’re using wood chunks in your grill, it isn’t necessary to soak them beforehand. In fact, soaking wood chunks can actually make it take longer to get them burning.

, When you’re ready to start your grill, place your charcoal in a chimney starter. Use an electric starter or lighter fluid to ignite the coal and allow the pieces to burn until they are red., Once the charcoal pieces are hot and red, add them to the bottom of the grill. However, make sure to create two piles, one on each side of the grill with the center area free of coal.Some grills have special baskets that are designed for holding the charcoal in piles on either side of the grill. If your model has them, you can place the coals in the baskets.

, Fat may cook off the brisket as you barbecue it, and you don’t want it to reach the charcoal. To catch any fat or other debris that may fall off the meat, place a drip pan between the two piles of coal in the center of the grill.An inexpensive foil pan works well as a drip pan for your grill.

, When the charcoal and drip pan are in place, toss ¾-cup (177 g) of the wood chips on each of the piles of coal, for a total of 1 ½ cups (354 g). Next, place the grate over the charcoal and wood chips to prepare for barbecuing., When you’re ready to barbecue the brisket, remove it from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Set it in an aluminum pan, but be sure that the side with the fat layer is facing up.If you don’t have a pan for the brisket, you can make your own using two sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil.

, Place the pan with the brisket in the center of the grate, so it’s not directly over either pile of charcoal and wood chips. Cook the brisket until you can shred it with your fingers, which usually takes between 6 and 8 hours, depending on the size of the brisket.Make sure to close the grill’s lid to trap the smoke from the wood chips and flavor the meat as it cooks.
It’s important to check on the meat regularly while it barbecues to avoid overcooking it. Pay closer attention when you reach the 6-hour mark, and the meat is closer to being done.
While the brisket is barbecuing, periodically baste the meat with the juices from the bottom of the pan to help add flavor and keep it moist.
You’ll need to add fresh charcoal and wood chips to the grill every hour while the brisket is barbecuing. Throw approximately 10 to 12 fresh coals on each side of the grill to keep it hot. Add about ¾ cup (177 g) of wood chips to each side when you reload the charcoal for the first three hours of grilling.

, When the brisket is tender enough to shred easily, remove the pan from the grill. Allow it to rest on a heat-safe surface for approximately 15 minutes so the juices have time to redistribute throughout the meat.To keep the brisket warm, wrap a piece of foil over the top of it while it’s resting.

, After the brisket has rested, transfer it a cutting board. Cut the meat in thin slices, going across the grain. You can use your favorite sharp knife, cleaver, or electric knife to cut the meat., Once the brisket is cut, set the slices on a serving platter. Carefully pour some of the juices from the pan that it barbecued in over the top of the meat, and serve while still warm.You may want to serve the brisket with a side of your favorite barbecue sauce.

",How to Barbeque a Fish Directly on Charcoal," Use branches from trees that are used for firewood. Do not use lumber because they might be chemically treated.;
,, Save your prized catch for home cooking and pick a fish that is average to good in taste because there will be some wastage. Do not pick a fish with thin skin and small scales like a mackerel. An average tasting fish will taste good when cooked on charcoal and outdoors.

, The scale or thick skin will protect the meat from burning. After a while, the aroma of wood burning and fish cooking will be quite appealing.

, After turning the fish over, do not cook it too long. Like cooking in a pan, the first side takes longer to cook. Poke at the fish with a fork to test if it its cooked, if the fork does not go in - let it cook longer.

, Discard the charred exterior.

Determine the size of the grill you need.,
Determine the construction of the grill you desire.,
Decide on the ""extras"" that you want with your grill.",How to Buy a Charcoal Grill,"


Charcoal grills come in many sizes-from the tiny hibachi to huge kettle grills. To determine the best size for you, think about the kinds and amount of food that you'll be cooking. You may simply be cooking burgers for 2 or you may be cooking for a crowd.
Unless you are in the market for a hibachi-style grill, you should consider at least 300 square inches (762 square cm) of cooking space. Grills are available with cooking space as large as 1,400 square inches (3,556 square cm) for those who need a very large cooking area.
Indirect grilling is when the food is cooked on one side of the grill, opposite the hot coals. If you will be grilling indirectly, you will want to consider enough cooking space to accommodate this technique.
Often you may be grilling large items--grill-roasting a turkey or making beer can chicken, for example. You should consider the height of the lid to be sure that there is enough room to house items of that size.;
,


The body of a quality grill is made of heavy gauge or stainless steel. This is especially important if the grill will be kept outside where it could be susceptible to rust.
Charcoal grilling requires moving coals around or shifting food on the grate. Sturdy legs will assure that the grill remains steady and secure during these tasks.
The best grill grates are made of heat-conducting cast iron or stainless steel. Some are coated with enamel. Grates should be sturdy, be able to withstand scraping with a grill brush and be rust-resistant.
Airflow controls should be easy to adjust and be located on the lid and the bottom of the grill. Dual airflow controls allow for easy control of the interior temperature.
The ash catcher should be large and easy to remove, making the task of cleaning out your grill a simple one.

,


Some grills come with a built-in thermometer. Knowing the temperature inside the grill helps, especially when using a cooking technique such as grill-roasting. Some of these thermometers can also be used as meat thermometers.
An insulated handle makes opening and closing your grill lid a safe and painless task.
Hinged grates allow you to add charcoal or move coals around without having to lift the entire grate off of the grill or disturbing the food that is cooking.
Side tables give you built-in counter space to place dishes, ingredients and other necessities.
Some grills include a built-in smoker box that allows you to add smoky flavor to your food as it grills simply by adding soaked wood chips.
Utensil holders allow you to keep your grill brush, spatula, tongs and other grilling equipment within reach while you're at the grill.
A locking lid on portable models gives you assurance that moving your grill around will not result in spillage.

Remove the kebabs from the grill when done.,
Serve alone or with a suitable side.",How to Grill Kabobs," Usually, kebabs contain meat and/or vegetables, though seafood, fruit, and other ingredients are also sometimes used. Choose a selection of ingredients that suit you - there's no ""wrong"" answer here. Popular choices for kebab meat are chicken, steak, pork, sausage, lamb, shrimp, and fish; for vegetables are onions, mushrooms, green or red peppers, courgette, and tomatoes; and for fruit are pineapples, peaches, or apples.


While any combination of the ingredients above should work well, certain kebab dishes with set recipes can also be attempted. Many traditional kebab recipes use lamb as their main meat. Below are just a few traditional recipes and their key ingredients

Kofta kebabs - lamb pieces seasoned with many spices
Chelow kebabs - boneless lamb served over saffron rice
Sheekh kebabs - ground lamb seasoned with cilantro and mint and prepared in a tandoor (traditional Indian oven)

;
, If you plan to grill meat, you may want to prepare a marinade, though it's certainly not essential. Soaking your meat in a marinade before grilling can give it the flavor of your marinade ingredients, creating new taste combinations that wouldn't be possible with un-marinated meat. Typically, to marinate meat, the meat is put in an airtight container (like a ziplock bag) with, at the very least, oil and an acid (for instance, vegetable oil and lemon juice). Usually, additional seasonings and herbs are added to these base liquids to build more complex flavors.


For example, here are the ingredients an all-purpose teriyaki marinade that's suitable for beef, chicken, and more:Vegetable oil
Soy sauce
Lemon juice
Garlic
Pepper
Worcestershire sauce



, When it comes to kebab grilling, you generally have two options in terms of skewers - metal or wood/bamboo. The former are sturdier and more durable, but more expensive, while the latter are cheaper and more convenient. If you choose to use wooden or bamboo skewers, soak the skewers in water for at least 30 minutes prior to cooking. This will help keep them moist during cooking and prevent them from catching fire or burning.

, Place your ingredients on a cutting board and use a sharp kitchen knife to slice them into roughly 1-inch (2.54 cm) thick cubes. Obviously, these dimensions won't be possible for certain types of food - for instance, bell peppers will have to be cut into small squares, rather than cubes. The most important thing to remember is to cut your ingredients into small pieces that are roughly equal in size so that they cook at roughly the same rate.


If you're using meat and you haven't marinated it, you may at this point want to consider the use of a dry rub - a combination of powdered spices and seasonings meant to give the meat a flavorful outer layer. To apply a dry rub, simply mix the seasonings and coat the meat generously with the mixture. Here's an example of the ingredients in an all-purpose paprika rub that's great on steak:Paprika
Salt
Onion powder
Garlic powder
Black pepper
Thyme
Oregano



, Once your ingredients are just how you'd like them, it's time to make skewers! Use the sharp skewer sticks to pierce each piece of meat or vegetable and slide it to the end, building a ""stack"" of skewered ingredients as you go. Typically, kebabs alternate pieces of meat with pieces of fruit or vegetables, as this creates great flavor contrasts. Obviously, this is not an issue with vegetarian kebabs. When you've skewered all of your ingredients, you're ready to grill!

Leave a small gap in between each piece to allow the kabob pieces to cook thoroughly on all sides.

, For a delicious outer ""sear"" on your kebabs, it's important to have a nice hot grill before you place your kebabs on it. For gas grills, this is easy - simply set the grill's burner(s) to a medium level, close the grill, and allow it to heat up. For charcoal grills, this is a little trickier - you'll want to light the charcoal and allow it to blaze freely until the flames die down and the briquettes ash over and emanate an orange glow. This can take 30 minutes or longer.


Generally, for about a pound of meat, you'll want to use roughly 30 charcoal briquettes.

, If your grill is hot, you should immediately begin to hear a sizzling sound. As you lay your kebabs on the grill, leave space between each to ensure even cooking.


To prevent your kebabs from sticking to the grill, it's a wise idea to paint the grilling surface with vegetable or olive oil immediately before laying down your kebabs. Use a grilling brush for safety's sake - don't attempt to paint a hot grill with a paper towel or similar improvised tools.

, Be sure that all the sides of every kabob touch the grill - not only does this ensure done-ness, but also gives the meat (if you're using any) an all-over crisp exterior. As a general rule, most kebabs will require approximately 10-15 minutes to cook, which is 2.5-3.75 minutes for each of the 4 sides.


For vegetarian kebabs, you won't need to worry about the meat being done, so, instead, turn as desired to give the vegetables and fruits a pleasing brown or black exterior and a softened texture.

, Remove one of the kebabs from the grill. If using meat, cut into a piece of meat to check if it's done or not. Look for the classic signs of done-ness - clear juices, lack of a pink interior, ease of cutting. If the meat is very pink on the inside, bleeds reddish juices, or has an inside that resists cutting, it needs to cook longer.


For more information on telling whether a piece of meat is done or not, see:

How to Check if Steak Is Done Using the Finger Test
How to Test Whether a Chicken is Cooked
How to Know if Food is Undercooked



, When your ingredients have finished cooking, remove the kebabs from the grill and place them on a clean plate or platter. Don't use any of the plates you used to hold your un-cooked kebabs, especially if you used meat - germs from uncooked meat can contaminate cooked food, leading to serious illness.

, Congratulations! Your kebabs are ready to eat either on or off the skewer. Most kebabs make a delicious dish on their own, but for a full meal, consider serving with a side that pairs well with the ingredients on the kebab.


For traditional kebab recipes, seasoned rice and/or a piece of flat bread often serve as the sides. These basic sides have hundreds of regional variations. For instance, chelo kabobs traditionally are served with rice mixed with raw egg yolk.
Grilled kebab ingredients can also be used in other dishes. For instance, Turkish Doner kabobs are often served in a pita bread with salad as a sandwich.

Choose a thick cut of meat.,
Season your steak liberally with salt at least 40 minutes before grilling.,
Allow the steak to come to room temperature before grilling.,
For best results, choose a hardwood coal, such as mesquite, for your fuel.,
Arrange the coals on the grill so that one half contains no coals and the other contains all the coals.,
Start the steak on the cool side of the grill, keeping the lid closed.,
Flip often.,
Use a thermometer to tell you when you're done cooking.,
Sear the steak quickly about 15° F before it reaches its ideal temperature.,
About 5° F before it reaches its ideal temperature, take the steak from the grill and let it rest.,
Enjoy your steak with some summer fare.",How to Grill Steak1," Generally, the thicker the better, especially if you like steak that has a perfectly brown, crispy outside and a juicy, pink center. See if you can't get steak that's 1 1/4"" or 1 1/2"" thick. If a single cut is too large for an individual, it's perfectly acceptable to share the steak with someone else or even to save it for later.









Why is thicker steak better than thinner steak? Thicker steak takes longer to cook through than thinner steak. With thinner steak, you're risking overcooking the steak in the center by giving them a nice crust on the outside. With thicker steak, you can cook the outside for longer without worrying about overcooking the steak in the center.
Especially when grilling, where high heat is often used, thin steaks become a problem. Best to choose a thicker cut, especially if you can't adjust the heat on the grill with a knob.
;
, Salt draws moisture out from meat, which is an incredibly bad thing is you choose to salt right before you grill. Instead, apply the salt at least 40 minutes before grilling, and up to several days (yes, days!).








What happens when you salt at least 40 minutes before grilling? The salt draws the moisture out of the meat, but with nowhere to go, the moisture eventually ends up seeping back into the newly tenderized meat. The longer you let the salt sit on the meat, the more tender it becomes and the more moisture it draws back in.

, Steak that is room temperature cooks more evenly than steak that has recently been refrigerated and is still cold in the center. Steak that has been brought up to room temperature created a more evenly-cooked final product. Plus, you won't have to cook it as long on the grill.









, If you don't have a hardwood coal, you can also employ briquettes, but briquettes burn at lower temperatures for longer. (Hardwood coal burns at higher temperatures for shorter.) Instead of using lighter fluid, always use a coal chimney.









If you don't have a natural-burning barbecue, don't fret. Gas is fine. Just don't expect the exquisite smokiness that's standard in natural-burning 'cues. Gas 'cues also don't get quite as hot as charcoal 'cues, meaning that you'll probably have to cook your steak for a tad longer.

, This will create a hot side of the grill and a cool side of the grill. You'll be cooking primarily on the cool side of the grill to ensure a juicier, tastier steak.









, Many grilling guides advise cooks to ""seal in"" the juices by searing the steak over high heat first. This is a myth.In fact, juices run out of the meat depending on what temperature you cook the meat to, not proportional to what temperature you cook the meat at.









Searing the steak first cooks the outer layers to the point where they start to lose juices immediately. It also leaves the outer layer nearly fully cooked before you've really begun cooking the rest of the steak.
In contrast, cooking the steak over indirect heat for longer periods cooks the whole steak while developing a nice crust (slowly). Then, when you're just about ready to take the steak off the grill, you can place it over direct heat and develop a golden brown crust, if necessary.

, Flipping often, especially if you're cooking over low heat, helps cook the meat more evenly. When flipping, be sure to use tongs or a spatula. Do not use a fork, as you will begin to lose juices.









, Sure, it's not real manly to use an electronic device to tell you when your steaks are done cooking, but it sure works. That's because you want to ""peek"" into the middle of the steak, which you can't really do by just looking. You can, however, use the finger test to determine whether your steak is done if you don't have a thermometer.









120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done


, If you've cooked it long and slow, it should already be well on its way to having a wonderful crust. Searing shouldn't take longer than one or two minutes on each side.









, It's very important to let your steak rest. Right after your steak has finished cooking, the muscle fibers on the outside are still relatively tight, which sends the juices toward the inside of the steak. If you cut it open right now, the juices — which are compacted in one small area — will leak all over the place, leaving you with a relatively dry steak.









If, however, you let your steak rest before you cut into it, the muscle fibers relax and allow the juices to travel back through the rest of the steak. Instead of a hockey puck, you have a perfectly cooked steak.

, Why not accompany the steak with some potato salad, grilled zucchini, and homemade chips.

Keep Hot Food Hot!",How to Barbecue Safely1," It is important to keep the food refrigerated until you cook it. This means that it is better to barbecue in batches rather than leaving meat and other barbecue foods sitting out waiting in the open, uncooked. Bring each new batch for cooking direct from the fridge to the barbecue every time it is ready to be cooked. If you are marinating your meat be sure to let the meat marinade in the fridge. Don't re-use the marinade.;
, Cover the cooked food to keep the insects landing on it.

, Ensure that all meats are cooked through. In particular, ensure that pork and chicken are properly cooked. It can be a little deceptive sometimes to see a charred outer casing of the meat, only to have uncooked flesh inside. Follow the cooking times suggested for each meat type.

, It is important that you keep raw foods and cooked foods apart from each other. In particular, raw poultry, raw pork and raw eggs should be handled very carefully on separate boards or work spaces and kept on separate dishes in readiness for cooking. Always clean preparation areas and items thoroughly before using with other food.

, Once you have cooked you meat to the right temperature keep it hot until served— 140 °F (60 °C) or warmer."

",How to Apply a Steak Rub," Thicker cuts of steak will stand up to the assertive flavors of a dry rub better than a thinner steak. If you are grilling a thinner cut, you should either choose a milder rub or apply a lesser amount of a stronger-flavored rub.;
, There are thousands of rub recipes. Choose one that features the flavors that you enjoy or that will complement other foods you will be serving. Rub recipes are very forgiving. Ingredients are easily substituted or left out if they are not available.

, Ideally, a rub should be ground by hand in a mortar and pestle. This brings out the essential oils of the herbs and spices without over processing them. A spice or coffee grinder also can be used. Pre-ground will work fine if grinding your own spices isn't an option.

, Liberally sprinkle the rub over one side of the steak and, with your fingers, massage the rub into the entire surface of the steak. Repeat this process on the other side of the steak.

, Wrap the steak tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a few hours or up to 24 hours. Steaks that are cut more than about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) can rest for longer, if desired. This resting time allows for the flavors to penetrate into the flesh.

, As with all grilling, you should preheat your grill. Use a grill brush to clean the grates of any burned on food from previous grilling. Using tongs, dip a paper towel in some vegetable oil and wipe the grates to prevent the steaks from sticking. Remove the plastic from the rubbed steak and grill until they reach the desired doneness.

Keep the area well lit; if necessary, bring out a cord and floodlight, making sure to hang up or tape down the cord so that nobody trips over it as they walk around. The light will ensure that you do not burn items, that you can tell when they are adequately cooked and that you do not burn yourself by misjudging where to place your hands and utensils.

Make tasty, succulent barbecue ribs.",How to Barbecue," Get used to cleaning your grill lightly before each cook, and then heavily about once or twice a year. Grease and oils can build up on the tops and bottoms of the grate, becoming rancid in warmer weather and imparting ""off"" flavors to your food. Use a putty knife and wire-bristle brush to clean food and debris from the tops and bottoms of grates or rods. Use a scraper on solid grill panels.


In your heavier cleaning sessions, try using an enzymatic cleaner specially designed for grills. Enzymatic cleaners will do a quick number on soot, ash, and particulate buildup without leaving any soap residue for you to taste when you bite into your first pork chop.;
, Gas grills are convenient, cheap, and easy to clean — and there's nothing wrong with them. But if you want to elevate your game and really barbecue, resign yourself to using a real grill, a charcoal one. Charcoal grills have at least four distinct advantagesover gas grills:


They get much hotter. Hotter grills mean quicker cooking times when you're ready to put food to grill.
They burn wood, which imparts more flavor. One recent study found that burning charcoal released a compound called guaiacol, which has a smoky, bacon-y aroma.They seamlessly allow for smoking, which imparts even more flavor.
They offer the primal thrill of actually burning wood.

, Assuming you're not trying to cook really big pieces of meat — more like porterhouse steaks and pork chops — thicker is better. Why? Thicker cuts give more of the perfect bbq combo: Crispy, seared outsides and tender juicy insides. A thicker steak, for example, has time to develop a nice brown sear over lower heat while the inside of the steak cooks. By the time a thin steak develops a hearty crust on the outside, the inside has cooked completely. Simple rule of thumb: Buy steaks that are between 1–2 inches (3–5 cm) thick., Salt and pepper are the two seasonings you'll get to know best on your quest to become a better griller. These are the two necessary ingredients for most cuts of meat. Everything else is incidental. Sometimes, a smoky rib rub is just what the doctor ordered. If you bought a nice cut of meat, a lot of crazy seasonings and flavors will just detract.


Salt your meats about 40 minutes in advance of grilling.Salt draws moisture out of the meat. This occurs almost instantly, so, if you apply salt just before you grill, the salt pulls moisture out of the meat as you cook it. This does not create succulent meat, but, if you allow enough time before searing the meat, the salt-flavored moisture re-enters the meat, leaving it succulent and properly seasoned. This is one of the the bits of knowledge that will help you achieve grilling success!
Consider adding pepper after you finish grilling. Pepper can burn easily, giving an ""off"" flavor. To avoid this, crack pepper over your steak while it's resting, just before you serve it.

, The key to getting rich, smoky flavor when you barbecue is to cook food slowly over a low, indirect heat until it is almost ready; then, finish it off by searing it over direct heat. To do this, you want to keep your coals or briquettes on one side of your grill — the direct heat side — and keep the other side — the indirect heat side — free of coals.


Cooking over indirect heat with the lid closed will produce both convection and radiant heat. The outside of the meat grabs convection heat from all sides of the covered grill, converts it into conduction heat, and sends it evenly into the center of the meat, cooking it gently., A pair of tongs will be easiest to use and least invasive when it comes flipping your steaks. But one prevailing barbecue myth is that you shouldn't stab your meat with a fork in order to flip it because it will accelerate moisture loss. In fact, the moisture loss is really small when you get down to brass tacks. That's because a steak is like a collection of a thousand tiny water balloons, each filled with moist juices, and stabbing the steak with a fork to turn it only ruptures a few of those water balloons.Bottom line: Get tongs if you can, but don't sweat using a fork if you need to.

, A thermometer is the most surefire way to test whether a piece of meat is done. It's fast, simple, and reliable. Sure you can poke the steak with your finger, or (even worse) guess about doneness, but nothing will give you surety like a trusty digital thermometer. Here's a guide you can use to reference temperature to doneness:


120° F (50°C) = Rare
130° F (55°C) = Medium rare
140° F (60°C) = Medium
150° F (65°C) = Medium well
160° F (70°C) = Well done

, Heat causes the muscles of meat to contract, sending the juices to the center of the meat, where it's not as hot. If you cut into a steak right after it's been removed from the grill, all those juices will simply spill out. If, however, you give the steak time to ""rest,"" the muscles will relax again, allowing the juices to float freely back through the whole piece of meat. Let the meat rest for a better, juicier meal.

, Just because you remove a steak from the grill doesn't mean that it will immediately stop cooking. In fact, meat can continue to cook for as much as 15 minutes after it's removed from the heat, gaining as much as 20°F (10°C) in internal temperature.Plan accordingly and remove your meat from the grill — early enough that it doesn't overcook, but not so early that it's underdone. This takes practice and experimentation.


The thickness of the cut and the temperature the meat is cooked at will affect how much carryover heat you'll be working with. Hotter grill temperatures increase the carryover effect and thicker steaks hold more heat than thinner ones, so plan accordingly.

, A water pan, not to be confused with a drip pan, can help improve your barbecue results. Water in the pan will absorb heat and never exceed 212°F (100°C); this will help you stabilize the temperature around the magical 225°F (105°C), mark where meat cooks but the tendons and muscles don't seize up, squeezing out juices and generally toughening the meat.Place the water pan either directly over the meat or under the fire. When placed correctly, the water pan blocks direct heat from overcooking the meat, becoming a radiant heat source on its own.
While you can use beer, wine, apple cider, or other liquids to fill the water pan, the best liquid to use is water. The flavor molecules that evaporate from the liquid and hit the surface of the meat are so few and far between that you're better off not wasting precious alcohol and just drinking it instead.

, Instead of basting from the beginning, try to apply sugar-based sauces at the very end. Chances are you won't be able tell the difference, and your presentation will improve dramatically.

, Smoking meat is a time-honored tradition that's building modern steam — pardon the pun. Smoky flavor and grilled meats go together like like peaches and cream.

Don't bother soaking wood chips in liquid before you throw them on the coals. Wood doesn't absorb water easily, which is one of the big reasons we use wood to build boats. Throwing slightly damp wood chips on the fire is likely to cool your coals and produce steam instead of smoke.

, Grilled veggies alongside your juicy flank steak are delectable and barbecued fruits for dessert are heavenly.—Who can ask for any more?

, The king of steaks, while delicate, stands up surprisingly well to the barbecue. Be sure to get thick cuts and cook mostly over indirect heat until the very end, when you sear the steaks and remove them from the grill at about 125°F (50°C)

, Swordfish is a hearty fish steak that's easier to grill because it holds up well and doesn't flake apart like more delicate fish. Sear over medium to high heat for a short time on one side and an even shorter time on the second side, being careful not to overcook., A popular finger food for a Sunday football game, chicken wings are easier to cook because they don't have the girth that chicken breasts do.

, The secret to the best ribs is a simple rub, a trusty mop, and an even cooking temp of about 225°F (105°C)for 5-6 hours.

Buy quality meat.,
Season your fresh ground beef.,
Form your patties.",How to Grill Burgers1," Start with the right kind of meat and you're well on your way to making a delicious burger. For any type of grilling, you want to start with fresh quality meat. If possible, ask your butcher to grind the meat for you while you wait. Look for 75 to 80 percent lean for the juiciest burgers.You can choose leaner meat if you prefer. Leaner meat isn't ideal for burgers as they are often cooked at very high temperatures. Meat with a low fat content can become dry when grilled.
If you can't get freshly ground beef, choose beef with a bright pink color. Ground meat that is starting to turn gray has likely been sitting on the shelf longer.
Try ground chicken or turkey if you are looking to avoid beef.
You can also use pre-formed frozen burger patties.;
, Crumble 2 lbs (32 ounces) of ground beef into a large bowl and sprinkle in about 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Use your hands to mix the ground beef and take care not to overwork the meat. Gently toss the ground meat until the seasonings are just combined.


Handle the meat as little as possible. The heat from your hands can actually melt the fat of the burger resulting in a denser patty.Vary the amount of seasoning based on your preference. Try adding some ground sage or chili powder.
If you have started with frozen patties, you can season them as they cook.

, Grab about 1/4 pound (6 ounces) of ground beef and shape it into a ball in your hands. Carefully flatten it between your palms until it's about 3/4 of an inch thick (1.3 cm). Flattening your patty evenly as possible.









Use your thumb or a spoon to make a shallow indentation (about 1 and 1/2 inches wide) in the center of your patty. This can help your patty cook more evenly and prevent it from puffing up in the center.
Your patty will shrink a little when cooking. Use your hamburger buns as a reference and form the patties to extend just a little bit past the diameter of the buns. This will create even patties that better fit your buns when cooked.

"
"
Arrange the coals.,
Light your charcoal.,
Light your coals with lighter fluid (optional).,
Let the coals heat up.,
Grill your burgers.,
Flip your burgers.,
Make it a cheeseburger (optional).,
Toast your buns (optional).,
Cover and cook.,
Enjoy!",How to Grill Burgers2," Configure your coals into a two-zone fire. This means that you will cast your coals to cover about half of the grill to produce medium to high-temperature zones.


You can use any coals for grilling. Self-lighting coals are generally easier to work with.

, Use a match or lighter to light the edge of a few of the coals. The flame will spread to the other coals in the pile.







, If your coals call for lighter fluid, carefully squirt lighter fluid on the top and sides of the charcoal mound. Squirt the lighter fluid gently and wait a minute or two for the fluid to sink into the coals. This will prevent all the lighter fluid from burning off immediately. After waiting a minute, squirt a second layer, followed by a third before lighting your coals. Avoid squirting lots of lighter fluid into your coals during each application. Less fluid is better than more. Lighter fluid can add a chemical taste to your burgers if you use too much.It doesn’t take a lot of lighter fluid to get your fire going. You will only need about 1.6 ounces of lighter fluid per pound of charcoal.

, Your coals need time to produce heat and won't be ready immediately after lighting them. Wait for the flames to subside and the edges of the coals turn a light gray. Your coals should be covered completely with gray ash after about 10 minutes. Now you can grill your burgers.








, Add your patties to the grill and sear them directly over the pile of coals. This is the hottest part of the grill. Cook your patties for about 5 minutes or until they are brown and crispy at the bottom.









Avoid charring the meat and pressing it down with a spatula. This will squeeze all the delicious juices out.
During the cooking process, you will see flare-ups. Don't be alarmed. Flare-ups result from fat dripping into the flame. Move the burgers to the cooler side of the grill if the flames get too high. Move them back when the flames go down.

, Use a long-handled metal spatula to flip your burgers once. Sear the other side on the hot part of the grill for about 1 minute to lock in the juices.








, Now that your burgers are in their final stage of cooking, it's the perfect time to add a slice of cheese and allow it to melt to perfection. Place your cheese slice centered on each patty and continue to cook your patty as the cheese melts.








, Toasting buns is quick and easy. Simply split your buns open and place them on the grill with the cut side down. Make sure to place them on the cooler side of the grill to keep them from burning or cooking too quickly. Grill your buns for about 10 seconds and flip if desired..


You can lightly butter the inside of your buns before toasting if you'd like.
Watch the buns closely as they can burn easily.

, Once you have seared your patties, move the burgers onto the cooler side of the grill, so they are no longer over direct heat and cover the grill with a lid. Continue cooking for 3 to 5 minutes until done. Here are two ways to check your burgers:









Remove one burger and cut into it. For medium-rare, the inside should be pinkish, but not bloody.
Use an instant-read meat thermometer. The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C).

, Take your burgers off the grill as soon as they are done to avoid overcooking. Remember that they will cook a little bit after they are taken from the grill. Serve your burgers with a variety of condiments

"
"
Preheat your grill.,
Grill your burgers.,
Flip your patties.",How to Grill Burgers3," Ignite your grill and turn the heat to high. Close the lid and give your grill about 10 to 15 minutes to get hot. Scrape the hot grill rack clean with a wire brush. Brush the hot rack of your grill with oil to prevent sticking (optional).

, Place your patties into the grill and sear on one side for about 3 minutes. Avoid pressing down on your burgers while they are grilling.


You may see flare-ups during cooking. Flare-ups are caused by the burger fat dripping into the flames below. Carefully move your patties to a higher rack or cooler side of the grill until the flames subside.
On a gas grill, you will find the cooler areas on higher racks, or along the edges of your grill, away from the flame.

, Using a metal spatula with a long handle, flip your patties and sear them on the other side to lock in the juices. Continue grilling until you have reached your desired doneness. Here are some guidelines to consider:


Cook for about 3 1/2 minutes for medium-rare. Your burger is done when you reach an internal temperature of 130 to 135° F (55 to 57° C).
Cook for 4 minutes for medium. Your burger is done when you reach an internal temperature of 135 to 150° F (57 to 65° C).
Cook for 4 minutes or longer for medium well. Your burger is done when you reach an internal temperature of 150 to 165° F (65 to 74° C).
Your burger is well done when it's internal temperature reaches 165° F (74° C) or greater. Serve immediately.
Add cheese to your burgers in the last minute or so of the cooking process so the cheese has sufficient time to melt.
Toast your buns on a cooler side of the grill or a higher rack during the last minute of grilling. Lightly butter the inside of the buns if desired.

"
"
Preheat your skillet.,
Test the heat of your pan.,
Grill your burger.,
Flip your burger.",How to Grill Burgers4," Cast-iron skillets are recommended for the best results, but you can use any frying pan you have.If you are using a cast-iron pan, you can speed up the heating process by placing it into a preheated 350° F (176° C) oven for about 20 minutes and removing it with an oven mitt. Starting with a piping hot cast-iron pan is key.

, Add a small amount of cooking oil to the pan. Don't use more than 1 tablespoon (0.5 ounces). If your oil smokes, your pan is a little too hot. Take it off the burner for a couple minutes and try again. When the beads of oil spread evenly and shine, the pan is ready for cooking!

, Place your patty in the middle of the pan and let it cook. Your burger patty will sizzle once it hits the pan and it might even smoke. This is good. Cook it for about 4 minutes.


Resist the urge to poke and prod at your patty. Don't push it down into the pan. Leaving your patty alone will allow for it to form a delicious thick crust that will seal in the flavor.

, Once and only once, when you see the underside starting to turn brown, flip your burger. Cook for an additional 4 minutes on the other side.


The last few minutes of cooking is the perfect time to add a slice of cheese. Place a slice of cheese onto your patty and let it get perfectly melted in the last minute or so of cooking.
Your burger is medium-rare at an internal temperature of 130 to 135° F (55 to 57° C).
Your burger is medium at an internal temperature of 135 to 150° F (57 to 65° C).
Your burger is medium well at an internal temperature of 150 to 165° F (65 to 74° C).
Your burger is well done at an internal temperature of 165° F (74° C) or greater.

Experiment with a variety of condiments.,
Use wood chips in your charcoal grill.,
Finished.

",How to Grill Burgers5," You can try ground turkey, chicken, or even buy an Italian sausage; cut it open, and use the seasoned meat mixture inside to form your patties.


If you are using chicken, turkey, or extra lean meat, mix a few bread crumbs into the patties to help them hold together better on the grill.
You can even mix diced onion, garlic, or bell pepper into your patties. Get as creative as you want!

, Add sauces or other seasonings to the patties before cooking. Experiment with plain burgers or try adding your favorite flavors before cooking. Here are some classic burger seasonings many people enjoy (try adding just a few tsp. or 0.5 ounces when learning how much you like; you don't want to over-season):


Salt and pepper
Finely chopped onion
Soy sauce
Worcestershire sauce
Barbecue sauce
Steak sauce

, Make sure you have the usual toppings, like lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. Don't stop there. Try grilling some mushrooms, bell pepper, or onions. Add some sliced avocado or jalapeno peppers. The options are almost endless. Get as creative as you want.

, Condiments can make the same burger patty into a totally new taste experience. Popular choices for a beef burger include ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, hot sauce, or even steak sauce.

, Toss a handful of Black Cherry chips onto your charcoals once they get hot. This will give your burgers a smoky taste. If you are using a gas grill, place Black Cherry chunks on the grilling surface, not the flame. Or, using an aluminum pie plate with holes punched in it, fill with black cherry chips and put on grilling surface.


Many people prefer the flavor or meat grilled over hardwood charcoal to traditional briquettes.

If you already have a working desktop or laptop computer, then you should try doing following:-


Set the brightness on the screen to the minimum point.,
Take care of your computer.",How to Go Green With Computing," If you want a laptop with great battery life, look for netbooks with LED screens and power - modest components, like an Intel Atom dual core processor. Asus are very good at making lightweight netbooks that don't draw a lot of watts.


You can also buy a really high-performance computer and underclock (throttle) it, just in case you ever need the power.;
, When out looking for computers, pay attention to the '""Energy Star""' label. Computers with that mark have power supplies that waste maximum 20% of the energy of their consume. In short words, these computers are very power effective.

, On laptops this is usually done via a keyboard combination. Take a look at the laptop keyboard and make use of your common sense or take a look in the instructional manual.
Open the Control Panel and then double click the icon ""Power options"". From there, make sure you are running on power saving mode. Set the screen to turn off after one minute of inactivity, the hard drive(s) to spin down after 15, and the computer to standby after five minutes of inactivity.
Print smarter! To do that you simply have to limit the amount of printing usage and stick to reading or showing off information on the screen instead. But there is a program called Greenprint that can easily remove unnecessary stuff on a page you want to print out. Make sure to use both sides of a paper when printing.
Replace with newer graphic cards. The newest graphic cards are more energy - frequent than older graphic cards.
When not needed, turn your Bluetooth and internet adapter off.
Get a flat panel monitor. Newer flat panel monitors are not more stylish than old CRT monitors, they are also better at making use of energy.
Power the computer on and off again at the end of each day. It is actually a good habit for proper PC maintenance. Also, make sure the computer is turned off when leaving home.
Unplug any kind of external peripherals you don't need. Flash drives and USB mice draw a lot of power.


For businesses: Simply mailing documents that are saved as PDFs between each other instead of doing that old print and fax - dance saves you both time, money and trees.

, This really helps to Mother Earth.


Keep the hard drive fast and healthy by always having at least 20% free space. De-fragment it now and then.
Add on more RAM whenever you feel the need for it. Make sure to find a card that matches your motherboard.
When the machine finally retires, if you are able to, you may take it apart and sell working components on eBay. If you manage to rescue the hard drive, you can always keep it for yourself and jam it in a USB docking station, as long as there still is information there worth rescuing.

Reduce your use of plastic.,
Reuse plastics.,
Refuse plastic as often as possible.,
Buy locally.,
Recycle what you can’t reduce or reuse.",How to Conserve Fossil Fuels1," Unless it’s marked “compostable,” plastic is made from petroleum. It can linger in the environment for hundreds of years and never break down completely, polluting the soil and ground water. When plastics are not disposed of properly, they kill animals who mistake them for food.You can help to prevent this from happening by:


Buying or making reusable bags. Leave a couple in your car/on your bike for shopping. Tuck a small one into your purse for unplanned trips to the grocery store.
Asking your local grocery store to replace plastic bags with recycled paper bags or cardboard boxes. Even “biodegradable” plastic bags can end up in landfills, where they don’t break down properly. This makes them just as dangerous as regular plastic.;
, Use old hummus tubs and coffee jars to store dry goods. Make sure the resin identification code (the number inside the recycling arrows) is 2 or 5. You can usually find these codes on the bottom of the containers. Plastics with these codes are generally safe to be reused for storing food. Any other number is either unsafe or not durable enough for reuse., Take the time to examine product packaging when you go shopping. Avoid goods packaged in plastic (including polystyrene) whenever possible. If your grocery store sells products in bulk, take advantage of it and fill up using your own containers., Food and other household goods often travel in fossil fuel-powered vehicles over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from their points of origin to store shelves. If possible, buy food from your local farmer’s market, join a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program, or grow your own food., Making new containers and paper products uses more fossil fuels than recycling old ones.Check online for the guidelines of your local recycling center. Search for what they will and won’t recycle. Check their sorting requirements, as well.


For example, most recycling plants won’t recycle tissues, wax paper, or polystyrene. Unless they offer single-stream recycling, you’ll likely have to separate paper, plastics, glass, and metals.In some cities, recycling plants pay money for aluminum cans. Search online to see if your city offers this service. If it does, look for what kinds of aluminum cans are accepted. For example, some centers accept beverage cans but not pet food cans."

, Sweating, while great for your skin and an excellent way of purging toxins, will dehydrate you. At minimum, you should bring a bottle of water to sip on during your time in the sauna. Drink your water at regular intervals throughout the process.


Some indications of dehydration include extreme thirst, infrequent urination, urine that is especially dark, confusion, and tiredness. If you exhibit any of these symptoms, leave the sauna and drink water or a specially formulated rehydrating drink.If you’re a heavy sweater, have low water intake, or are especially physically active, you may want to bring a sports drink or a specially formulated rehydrating beverage to the sauna. These are fortified with electrolytes, which are necessary for rehydration., There are plenty of ways you can make your infrared sauna experience more relaxing. For example, you might use your phone to play your favorite tunes. In some cases, you may even be able to hook up your phone to a sound system in the sauna. Other techniques you might use to improve relaxation include:


Variable lighting. Some saunas may have lighting you can adjust. Try different lighting schemes available and select the one that puts you most at ease.Aroma therapy. Saunas may provide you a spray bottle with some lavender water or some other essential oil/water combination. If not, you might ask an attendant if you can bring essential oils of your own and use these during the process.

Meditation. By closing your eyes, clearing your mind, and focusing on your breathing, you can significantly reduce stress and improve relaxation while in the sauna., Generally, even after your first time in an infrared sauna, you should notice a positive difference in your skin. Wash your face and take a look at the results in a mirror. In some cases, it might take a few sessions before you notice a difference.


Infrared saunas aren’t necessarily for everyone. If you find the sensation uncomfortable, or if you don’t see significant results, infrared saunas may not be the right activity for you.If you experience pain, discomfort, an erratic heartbeat, difficulty breathing, or severe lightheadedness, you should stop using the sauna immediately and consult a doctor about further use."

Use energy-efficient computer models.,
Use laptop computers instead of desktop computers.,
Modify the power management settings on your computers.,
Use liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors instead of cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors.,
Modify the brightness of each computer monitor.,
Power off your computers completely when not in use.,
Turn on hardware only when in use.",How to Save Energy Automatically With Your Computers," Some computers have been manufactured and tested specifically to ensure that they consume less energy.


Verify that your computers have an Energy Star logo or other government-supported logo, which indicates that the computers save costs on energy bills and are designed to help reduce pollutants that are harmful to the environment.;
, The majority of laptops only burn between 15 and 60 watts when in use; whereas desktop computers burn between 70 and 200 watts when in use.


If possible, use tablets or smartphones such as Android devices and iPhones instead of laptops and desktops. Tablets and smartphones consume the least amount of energy in terms of wattage.

, When you enable settings that allow your computers to become idle after you have not used them for several minutes, you may consume up to 50 percent less energy per year.


On Windows computers, modify your power management settings in the Power Options menu within your Control Panel.
On Macintosh computers, modify the power management settings in the Energy Saver menu within your System Preferences.
Set your computers' monitors and hard disks to turn off after 5 minutes of idle use.
Enable the hibernation and standby modes on every computer to go into effect after 15 minutes of idle use.
If you have computer monitors that contain buttons or switches that turn off the displays immediately, perform this procedure in place of screen savers, which do not save energy.

, An LCD monitor only uses approximately 28 watts whereas a CRT monitor uses approximately 100 watts.

, This process will save the amount of energy output it takes to keep your computer screens brightly lit.


Consult with the manuals or manufacturers of your computer monitors for guidance with modifying the brightness of the screen. In most cases, you will either have buttons on your keyboard that control the screen's brightness or a dial attached to the monitor that controls the brightness.

, The combined watt usage that is consumed each time you power a computer on and off is still lower than the watt usage a computer consumes when it is left on 24 hours per day.


Turn your computers off when you are done working for the day and when you go to sleep.

, If you have hardware such as scanners or printers that are connected to your computers and turned on indefinitely, your computers will consume a higher amount of energy.

Use energy-efficient light bulbs.,
Reduce lighting use.,
Unplug small appliances and electronics.,
Turn down the heat and air conditioner.,
Ditch the clothes dryer.,
Use cooler water.,
Power up with renewables.",How to Conserve Fossil Fuels2," Opt for compact fluorescent (CFL) or light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs. These options use an average of 75 percent less electricity (usually sourced from coal). They also last much longer (5 to 20 years), saving you lots of money in the long run.CFLs and LEDs shine brighter than incandescent bulbs. This can cause problems for people with light sensitivity issues. If you’re sensitive to bright lights, look into fitting your lamps with darker lamp shades. For ceiling fixtures, consider installing LED-compatible dimmers., Turn off the lights in rooms you’re not in. On sunny days, open the curtains for some free solar lighting. Consider switching to timers or motion sensors if you need lights on in unused areas for security or safety reasons. Use dimmers and less lighting later at night to help your body get ready for sleep. If you’re reading or sewing, use a direct lamp rather than overhead lighting.

, You might think your coffee maker or computer is switched off. However, if it’s still plugged in to a wall outlet, it’s consuming energy. Unplug these devices when not in use. If unplugging is too time-consuming, invest in power strips for appliances that don’t need to be plugged in 24/7. When you want to power everything down, simply flip a switch to cut the power to the wall outlet., Central air often uses coal-based electricity. Central heating often uses oil or natural gas. Adjusting the temperature just one or two degrees can help to conserve resources. To maximize your comfort, dress warmly and use thick blankets during colder weather. When it’s hot outside, close the blinds on east-facing windows in the morning and west-facing windows in the afternoon.


Insulate your home with weather stripping, caulk, and eco-friendly insulation. This will prevent cold winter air and hot summer air from making your home uncomfortable., Most clothes dryers are electricity hogs. You can solve this problem by opting to air dry your laundry. On hot sunny days, hang your laundry outside to dry. If it’s cool and/or rainy (or if you’re drying your undergarments), dry your clothes indoors on drying racks. Your clothes will take slightly longer to dry, but the planet and your wallet will thank you., Do this when you’re showering, washing dishes, or doing the laundry. Cool or cold water reduces fossil fuel consumption by about 90 percent. In the washing machine, it also preserves your clothes longer than hot water does.Don’t worry about germs surviving in cool water. As long as you’re using soap, you’ll still kill germs., In many locations, the prices of solar and wind energy are competitive with fossil fuels.Although many national governments in Europe and North America have ended subsidies, some local governments still provide tax breaks for solar panels and/or wind turbines.Check with your city or state/provincial government to see if they offer these incentives.


Solar panels come in a variety of sizes for rooftops and yards.If you prefer wind power, you can build or buy a turbine small enough for your backyard.If you’re an apartment/condo dweller or if you rent your home, look into buying offsets. Check online for power companies that match your energy consumption with clean power. You can stay with your current utility company, and it only takes a few minutes to sign up."

Choose zero-carbon transportation.,
Use public transportation.,
Don’t let your car idle.,
Look into hybrid or electric cars.,
Reduce your number of flights.",How to Conserve Fossil Fuels3," Try cycling or walking to your destination. These are the most eco-friendly means of transportation because they don’t use fossil fuels. Find bike lanes/cycleways wherever possible. They’re safer than dealing with vehicles and getting hit in the face with their emissions. If your community doesn’t have bike lanes/cycleways, contact your city council and campaign for them to be added., Cities are increasingly using clean energy for their mass transit systems. However, even systems that still use fossil fuels can carry many passengers at once. In most cases, each passenger equals a vehicle that’s not consuming fossil fuels.If your city doesn’t have mass transit, try to organize a carpool or vanpool in your neighborhood. This can reduce fossil fuel consumption by taking up to 15 vehicles off the road., Unless you’re in traffic, turn off your engine if you don’t plan to move for 10 seconds or more. Idling wastes fuel, increases smog, and endangers people with respiratory conditions. In a growing number of cities, it’s also illegal and can cost you a hefty fine., Depending on where you live, you could greatly reduce fossil-fuel emissions with these options. Electric vehicles (EVs) run entirely on electricity. Hybrid vehicles use gas-powered engines as a backup after the battery loses its charge. Plug-in hybrids are charged by plugging them into a wall, while traditional hybrids are charged by an on-board generator.If you live in a location that relies on coal-based electricity, you’ll still be using fossil fuels when you charge your car. However, you can reduce your impact by charging overnight when the grid is under less pressure., Planes burn jet fuel at high altitudes, which causes chemical reactions that worsen climate change.Make a list of the places you absolutely must visit by plane. For example, a trip for business or an important family occasion is important. On the other hand, flying off to an exotic island on a whim isn’t all that crucial.


For business trips, ask your employer if you can telecommute instead of flying. The company will save money on airfare, and you’ll cut back on your carbon footprint.
If you have family members who live thousands of miles away, download video chat software like Skype. If your relatives also have it installed on their computers, you can talk for hours “face-to-face” without spending money or burning fossil fuels."

Talk to your friends and neighbors.,
Contact your elected officials.,
Join the divestment movement.",How to Conserve Fossil Fuels4," Educate them on the benefits of recycling, conserving energy, and eco-friendly transportation options. Appeal to their concerns as parents, older siblings, or aunts/uncles. If they don't consider themselves environmentalists, ask them to take these measures so that the children in their lives will have a decent future.

, It only takes two minutes to send an email to your state and national representatives, but why stop there? Attend town hall, city council, and school board meetings to voice your concerns in public. Ask your senator/representative/MP why they voted to expand oil drilling. Tell your city council you'd like to see a bus or light rail system. Ask your school board to adopt an anti-idling policy on school grounds., Search online for organizations urging corporations to divest (remove their money) from pipelines and other fossil-fuel projects. This includes banks, credit card companies, and boards overseeing pensions. If your bank or credit card company funds these projects, tell them you will do business with more responsible companies if they don't divest."

, Take away the stairs, ladders, rafts, toys and other items and store them properly.

, If you have an above-ground pool, you likely can thoroughly drain your pump and store it in a protected shelter. Remove the flexible water hoses and cap the water line openings to prevent drainage.

, Starting the winter with the proper chemicals helps to protect your pool from scale (hard water buildup) and corrosion. Test and adjust the pH, calcium hardness, chlorine and total alkalinity levels as necessary.

, Add a shock product, following the product instructions to determine the proper amount according to the pool size. Shocking raises the chlorine levels.

, Allow the pump and filter to run for several hours – a minimum of eight to 12 if possible.

, Specially packaged pool chemicals for winter closing make it simple to add the included items according to the pool size. Broadcast these chemicals from the deep end or by walking around the pool.

, Wipe down or brush the sides first and then the pool floor to loosen dirt, algae and other contaminants. Skim the surface of the water and vacuum the floor to remove the debris. When left in your pool, algae and other contaminants can stain the surfaces and leave lasting damage.

, Remove remaining chlorine from the chlorinator. Clean out the skimmer basket. Backwash or clean the filter to type: Both cartridge filters and D.E. grids – filters made with diatomaceous earth – can be flushed thoroughly with a garden hose fitted with a sprayer nozzle to create enough water pressure to remove contaminants. Sand filters, on the other hand, require backwashing according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

, With above-ground pools, you must lower the water to allow you to remove the pump. Drain to below the return line, but never more than 18 inches (45.7 cm) to prevent stress on the pool cover. To prevent structural damage, never completely empty your above-ground pool. It is important to keep about 1–3 inches (3–8 cm) of water on top of the winter cover to prevent damages caused by wind. You can help secure your liner in place by using “quick clips”; as they are called; in order to hold your cover to the pool frame.

, Snow and ice, if allowed to weigh on the pool's cover, will eventually damage it. As most pool covers are kept on by a cord that runs around the pool; excessive weight will cause the cover to stretch and the cord to tighten further. Don’t let the pool cover get heavy. Depending on whether your pool is above-ground or below-ground, the damage caused by winter ice and snow accumulating on the surface differs:


With an above ground swimming pool, the weight of snow or rain weighs down on the cover essentially pulling the walls of the pool in towards the center, potentially causing damage to the walls and / or top rails of your swimming pool.
If you have an in-ground swimming pool, heavy snow or an excessive amount of rainwater can cause the safety cover anchors to pop out or damage the pools coping.

, When it begins to accumulate, do either of the following:


Immediately remove excess water from the top of your pool cover with a small electric pool-cover pump. You can use a Frisbee to keep the pump from sucking up leaves and other junk. It is also a good idea to keep leaves and other debris from weighing down your cover further. Remove them whenever necessary.
If the accumulation of snow gets to a point where it might be too heavy for the cord to hold; simply cut the cord and let the cover fall. This is your last-step-scenario, of course. However, cleaning the pool from debris is easier than dealing with insurance companies.

, Pool damage will occur when weight is added and allowing this to happen can displace water, thereby mixing non-chemically treated water in your pool.

, During the winter months, water displacement is a huge concern.


Double check on the water level; especially before heavy snow events.
Look under the cover and record the water level. If the level is lower than when you closed the pool then you will need to do some snow removal.
Do not add water to a frozen pool. Getting the snow off the top is the best thing that you can do to save your pool.

, A frozen pool is better left alone. Unless it gets covered with a fresh layer of snow, in which case this is the best time to remove (see above). With the ice below, it should be easier to remove most of the snow. However, use utmost caution when getting snow off your pool.


Do not risk walking atop the ice.
To remove snow, gently use a long broom to push snow off the cover. Do not use anything with sharp edges such as a shovel, as this can cause damage to the winter pool cover.
Use a roof rake to pull the snow off the top. If the snow is lightweight, even a leaf blower will serve the purpose.

, Remove snow from inside and on top of the drain, to keep it from cracking.

, For in-ground pools, either use pool antifreeze (not car antifreeze!) or blow out all valves and water lines with either a powerful reverse vacuum or an air compressor. You can also use both in combination, first blowing and then cycling antifreeze through the lines.


To add antifreeze: Add the product as instructed and circulate at least two minutes or as directed.
Plug all lines with special winterizing plugs.
Finally, blow out the drain underneath the pool from the opposite end before capping. When bubbles appear, immediately cap the drain line. The vapor lock caused will prevent the drain from gathering water and freezing in harsh climates.

Turn down the thermostat.,
Decrease the hot water temperature.,
Wash economically.,
Reuse water coming out of the tap that would drain otherwise.",How to Save Energy in Your Home1," Turning your thermostat down by just 1 degree can reduce your energy consumption by over 5%. You won't even notice the difference in room temperature. On the same note, don't heat rooms when you are not using them.;
, Your hot water thermostat needn't be higher than 60 degrees centigrade (140 degrees Fahrenheit). Any higher and you will only be mixing it with cold water to cool it back down for use.


Give your boiler regular checkups, especially if you have had it for a few years.

, Only use the washing machine when you have collected a full load. If you must wash a partial load, use the economy or half load setting. Also, modern washers work just as effectively at 40 degrees Centigrade (100 F) as they do at 60 (140 F), but the reduced temperature will make a difference in terms of energy used.


Tumble dryers use up a huge amount of energy. If possible, hang your clothes on a line instead. This is better for your clothes as well.
Washing economically doesn't just apply to your clothes. Taking a shower instead of a bath uses around 50 percent less energy.

, When you turn on the tap to wait for hot water, for example, put a container under the tap until the water is warm enough and then use the water in the container to water plants or use for other purposes.

Create a ""bright room"" in your household.,
Replace electric lights with candles.,
Embrace natural light.During the day, think of the sun as your primary light source, and rearrange your home or workplace to take advantage of its rays.,
Replace your incandescent light bulbs.,
Minimize your use of outside lights.",How to Conserve Energy1," When the sun goes down, turn on the lights in just one central room in your house, and encourage your family to spend the evening hours there instead of scattering around the house and lighting up every room. Lighting just one room will save a lot of energy and money over time.;
, Conserving energy means taking a new approach to everyday conveniences we take for granted, like the ability to flip on all the lights and keep them burning all night long. You don't have to completely stop using electric lights, but using candles instead a few nights per week is a great way to save energy, money and provide inspiration for reevaluating your approach to energy. In addition to these practical reasons for turning out the lights, breaking out the candles provides an instant atmosphere of either romance or spooky fun, depending upon who else is around to enjoy it.


Start by choosing just one night a week to use candles instead of electric lights. Stock up on sturdy, slow-burning candles that will cast a fair amount of light for several hours.
On ""candle night,"" try to do activities that don't require electricity, such as telling stories or reading by candlelight.
Be sure to store your candles and matches in a safe place when they are not in use.

, Open the shades or blinds and let the light pour in instead of automatically flipping on the overhead switch.


If you work in an office, try to arrange your desk so that it's lit by natural light, so you won't have to use a desk lamp or overhead lighting.
In your home, set up your family's main daytime activity area in the brightest room that gets the best sunlight. Drawing, reading, using the computer, and other activities that require good lighting can take place in this room without the need for electric lights.

, These old-fashioned lightbulbs burn off most of their energy as heat instead of producing light. Replace them with compact fluorescent bulbs or LED bulbs, both of which are much more energy efficient.


Compact fluorescent bulbs use about 1/4 the energy of incandescent bulbs. They're made with a small amount of mercury, though, so be sure you dispose of them properly when they burn out.
LED bulbs are more expensive than the other types, but they last longer and they don't contain mercury.

, A lot of people don't think about how much energy is being used by porch lights or path lights that stay on all night long. Decide whether it's really necessary to leave the lights on past your bedtime.


If you want outside lights for security purposes, consider buying an automatic light that operates using a motion detector, rather than one that burns constantly.
Turn off decorative holiday lights before you go to bed, rather than waiting until morning.
Replace path and garden lights that charge during the day and glow warmly at night.

Search for a location with infrared saunas.,
Call or visit the sauna facility to learn more about it.,
Shop around to get the best deal.,
Schedule and go to the appointment.",How to Try an Infrared Sauna2," Though you might not have heard about infrared saunas until recently, they’ve been used in sports medicine, injury therapy, and neonatal care for years.Do an online keyword search for “infrared saunas near me” to find potential locations.


You may be able to find an infrared sauna facility through your medical provider. Talk with your doctor about whether he knows where you can try this kind of sauna.

, Each facility will likely be slightly different. Some may welcome walk-ins, others may require you to schedule an appointment some weeks in advance. Talk with the attendant to determine how you’ll need to schedule your appointment.


Ask about the kind of sauna facilities provided. Some might be designed to provide a luxury experience. These will likely be more costly. Others may use an infrared sauna pod, which will likely be more affordable but less indulgent.Some saunas may provide towels, water, and other niceties. If these are important to you, make it a point to ask whether or not they are included in the sauna experience., Some upscale establishments might charge considerably more than others for the use of an infrared sauna. If you’re interested in the most affordable sauna experience, call around to local sauna facilities and inquire about the cost. Compare these to find the most affordable one near you.


In some cases, your insurance might cover trips to an infrared sauna, especially if you go for therapeutic purposes or because of a lingering injury.
Some facilities may offer more affordable group rates or package deals. When speaking with an attendant, ask about these to see if they’re available.

, Call the facility at which you want to have your sauna experience and schedule an appointment. To ensure you don’t forget about your appointment, you may want to put the date in your calendar or set an alert on your phone for it. When the day arrives, go to and enjoy your infrared sauna session.

Research models online.,
Budget for your sauna.,
Install the sauna.",How to Try an Infrared Sauna3," There are many different kinds of home saunas. If you have a smaller space, you might want to invest in an infrared pod sauna. These saunas form a chamber about the size of an overlarge chair. If money and space aren’t an issue, you may want to convert a room in your home to an infrared sauna room.While you’re doing your research, note down the costs associated with each sauna, including potential installation fees. In some cases, you may need an expert to help with installation. Tracking this information will help with budgeting.

, The cost of infrared saunas will vary greatly depending on the kind you want to purchase. Generally, for a standalone infrared sauna booth, you can expect it to cost between $700 and $2000. Save a little bit of money each month, and make the purchase when you’re ready.You may be able to find a used or refurbished sauna for less through online classified ads, like Craigslist and eBay Classifieds, or through online auction sites.

, Most personal infrared saunas come in the form of booths. These require little in the way of installation, but can be quite heavy. For this reason, you might need help maneuvering it into place. Once it is, hook up its power attachments and set it up according to the user instructions, then enjoy your home sauna.

Prevent drafts.,
Turn off appliances and lighting.,
Insulate.",How to Save Energy in Your Home2," In an average house, up to 50 percent of heat is lost through drafts. To test an area, simply hold the palm of your hand up against a door or window. If you feel cold air coming through, warm air is escaping. This is simple to fix and can save you hundreds on your yearly heating bill.


Fit draft excluders around all exterior doors and interior if needed.
Fill in any cracks or crevices on window frames, skirting boards or floors with a filler or sealant.
Close the curtains or shutters after dark fall to trap in the warm air and prevent drafts.
If your door has a large crack under it, consider covering it with something (some stores sell cute 'door-crack blockers').

, Turn off any appliances you are not using, especially by switching off lights when you leave the room. Don't leave fridge or freezer doors open for longer than necessary, and don't forget that your freezer needs to be defrosted regularly for it to run efficiently.


Turn off your computer. Leaving the screen saver on will not save any energy. Screen savers can use more energy than when you are using the computer yourself and can reduce the life of your monitor. Instead, enable the display blanking feature to automatically turn off the monitor when your computer is idle. You can save $50-$100 per year by enabling your computer to 'sleep' automatically when you are not using.

, Up to a third of your home heating escapes through the roof. Prevent this by insulating. Not only is it simple to do, but it's also the most cost efficient energy saving measure you can make. If you don't already have it, invest in cavity-wall insulation. This will prevent another third of your heat escaping.

Decide which appliances you really need to use.,
Unplug everything.Electronics and appliances continue sapping energy while they're plugged in, even when they're switched to ""off."",
Replace old appliances with newer models.",How to Conserve Energy2," Your first impulse might be to say, ""I need them all."" However, you'd be surprised how much energy you can save by reducing your use of appliances, and how much satisfaction comes from being self-reliant.Consider changing your habits regarding the following energy-sapping appliances:


The dryer. If you have access to outside space, hang a clothesline and start drying your clothes outside. You can also get a drying rack to use indoors - just place it in your bedroom or bathroom near a window. If you must continue using the dryer, reduce your usage to once a week or so, rather than throwing in small loads every other day.
The dishwasher. Make sure each load you do is completely full. If you have time to wash dishes by hand using the water conservation method, that's even better.
The oven. Heating an electric oven requires a lot of energy. Plan to do all of your baking on one day of the week, while the oven is hot, instead of heating it every few days for various purposes.
The vacuum. Sweep whenever you can instead of using a vacuum. Even a carpet can be swept between vacuuming sessions to remove larger pieces of debris.

, Make a habit of unplugging everything that's not in use, especially computers, TVs and sound systems, which use up the most energy.


Don't forget small appliances like coffee makers, hair dryers and phone chargers.
Determine whether it's really necessary to keep plug-in air fresheners and night lights.

, Older appliances weren't always designed with energy conservation in mind. If you have an older refrigerator, dishwasher, oven, or dryer, you may be using more energy (and paying more money) than strictly necessary for the chores you need to do. Conduct research to find newer models that are more energy efficient.

Turn off the air conditioner.,
Keep your house a few degrees cooler in the winter.,
Insulate your house.,
Use less hot water.Taking shorter, cooler showers reduces the amount of water your water heater needs to heat on a daily basis.",How to Conserve Energy3," Conserving energy sometimes requires making small sacrifices, and getting more familiar with the heat of summer is one of them. Leaving the air conditioner on all the time is a great way to use loads of energy and keep your electricity bills high.


Turn off the air conditioner when you aren't home. There's no reason for your house to stay cool while you're at work.
Use the air conditioner in just one or two rooms where you spend the most time. Close the doors in the air conditioned rooms to keep the cool air inside.
Cool off in other ways. Take a cool shower in the heat of the day, go to the pool, or spend time under a shade tree. Try to limit your use of the air conditioner to just a few hours a day.

, Heating a home is another big energy drain. It's possible to reduce the amount of energy you use by simply lowering the thermostat by a few degrees in the winter. Keep warm by wearing multiple layers of clothing and  throw blankets over you.

, Keeping the cool or warm air in, depending on the season, is an important way to save energy. If a window gets left open, your air conditioner or furnace has to go into overdrive to keep things at a steady temperature.


Hire a contractor to take a look at your home and determine whether better insulation is required around the basement, foundation, attic, and other areas.
Use caulk and seals to seal the cracks around your doors and windows. Use plastic sheeting over your windows during the winter to keep drafty air out of the house.

, Washing your clothes on the cold setting is another way to avoid using too much hot water.

Use a big enough diameter for the wire into your batteries.,
Put the cover on.,
Consider the connection from the batteries into the inverter.,
Set up the wire from the inverter into your house breaker box.",How to Stay Safe While Making Your Own Electricity," Electricity is energy -like fire- but is invisible, odourless and when you touch it, you have made a mistake. If you want to make or amend any electrical construction you must protect against:


1. electrocution, the 'electrical shock',
2. inflammation, combustion or smoke and gas generation
3. cost ineffectiveness;
, Electric energy is tied to metal, always to two separate pieces, called 'poles'. Electrocution will happen, if electricity finds a way from one pole to the other through a biological entity, e.g. you. You can prevent this with insulation. These are materials which do not conduct electricity. Unfortunately water does, which makes the task much more difficult, because one can not use spongy materials, which may harbour water. The material of choice is 'plastic', which nearly always is waterproof. Your best friend in your own constructions will be 'silicon', which can applied around any metal, will harden to a rubbery consistency, and will make the metal beneath safe against contact and water.

, Electric energy needs strands of metal to go from one pole to another, 'wires'. This is called 'current'. Unfortunately it leaves a fraction of energy in the wire itself. This will heat up the wire, and lead sometimes to a vicious circle, because warmer wire will use a bigger fraction of the current, which makes the wire even hotter, until all energy is consumed by the wire. This will cause the wire become so hot it may melt and burn anything around it -the insulation- to a crisp and produce a lot of smoke and sometimes poisonous gas.


You can prevent this happen only by using the right size of wire, because luckily double size wire means half amount of heat, until all heat will be absorbed in the surrounding of a wire.
The most critical part of installation is making a connection between two ore more wires. Here the loss of current problem described above is aggravated by so called 'oxidation'. Oxidized contacts will pick up even greater amounts of current and conversion into heat, which will cause more oxidation and the predictable catastrophic outcome.
You can prevent this happen by driving out all air by replacing it with solder material, in principle soldering wires together. This has drawbacks, so often just the stranded wire ends are soaked with solder ,'tinning'. Your best friend in your own constructions will be a measuring instrument called 'multimeter' which can tell you the amount of energy lost in a wire.

, As much as you will like electricity in modern life, is does not come cheap. Although somebody on a 'electrical grid' will only pay very little for useful amount of energy, this is only possible by a massive investment over generations and the political protection for the energy merchants, with well documented results. On your own you have to calculate precisely the balance of investment and desired consumption to come to a satisfactory solution.

, Necessary tools not found usually in a handyman’s box are wire cutter and wire stripper, fully insulated screwdrivers, a multimeter and a soldering station with solder. You have to add one new pair of probe wires with 2.5mm² and one very long probe wire 0.2mm² with a clamp additional to the multimeter probes, which come with the purchase. This modification will enable you to make measurements crucial to avoid the fire hazard from electric wires.

,


To avoid the contact hazard, the number one priority is that you need switch-boxes, trunking or ducting materials, insulation materials like tape and neutral silicon.
To avoid the fire hazard, you need wires in different diameters and preferably different colours, connection bars, fuses, switches and watchdog devices.
Only if you can avoid the above hazards should you worry about economy and affordability. Put your safety above your wallet, and don't attempt the project if you can't get safe materials.

, Most solar panels will come with two wires with special connectors. Let's assume type MC4. You have to make sure you get extra connectors with your purchase of your panels. Connect these to wires in the length to your first switch-box. This has to be weatherproof.

, There is a label on the panel, which will say, how much current it will give in favourable conditions. Lets assume 8A ('Ampere').

, This maximum current has to go safely into your first breaker box 2m away near the mount. What diameter of wire will you need?  Page 16 of these guidelines shows a table with diameter vs. current content. The answer is deceptive: Although a 1.5 mm² wire will be able to withstand 18.5A, but a safe connection into your first breaker switch needs at least a 2.5mm² wire.

, It may look like a unnecessary expense, but if something goes wrong, you will have a crucial measuring point and the chance of disconnecting your solar panels completely. Mind you, the panel will try to give current, as soon it is illuminated.

, This is much longer and needs more attention for heat dissipation. Let's assume you have 2 panels of 8A = 16A to send into your batteries. These are 10m away from your first breaker box, into your first breaker box 2m away near the mount. What diameter of wire will you need?  Page 21 of above document shows a table with permissible current vs. length.


Your wires are in a irrigation tube to protect from solar radiation, but it will get rather hot in this tube. The answer is 28m of 2x2.5mm² will withstand 27A, but page 17 shows a table of temperature vs. permissible load.
So at 45C you can use only 66% of that 27A, and the wire will be at 60C. Every meter more in length will push the specification to the limit, so you use 2x4mm² or 4x2.5mm². You will be able to measure the actual loss of power in that wire.

, Measurements are still possible with probes onto the fixing screws.

, The current there depends on the power converted and the voltage of the battery. 100A is a typical value. You will see, your inverter comes with a very thick cable, with the terminals tightly fixed. Your job here is to make a matching counter piece, so you can put screws through the eyes of the terminals. Maybe you need help from a metal workshop. If there is one battery stack, every single wire has to withstand the current, so every connection has to be oxidation free and has to be maintained to stay free.

, These carry 16A, the length is 2m, so 2.5mm² is sufficient at 35C.

Observe the following regulations for fences:

required setback from your property boundary
maximum height
obstruction of sight on thoroughfares
zoning restrictions


These may vary for the particular fence type, so it is best to contact your local building inspection department and your homeowner's association before you finalize your plans.
If you are not absolutely sure where the property line is located, it is prudent to have a site survey done before you layout the fence line(s). You might also want to check with your neighbors to make sure that they are okay with the particular fence you plan to install.;
,


You might need a local building permit, so check with local authorities before starting your project.
You may be required to get a COA (Certificate of Appropriateness) in historic districts. This type of fence will, typically, not fall within the guidelines for a historic district, though.

, Call a local locator service if you are not absolutely certain that there are no underground utilities crossing your proposed fence line(s) or if you do not know their location(s).

,


Sketch a site diagram if necessary. Include the structures, trees, underground utilities and any potential obstructions.
Make sure to consider the terrain and any large trees or obstructions. Either go beside the obstructions or plan to remove them. Plan to step-down and step-up the slopes-- each fence section will be level, with the top edge of the panel horizontal.

,, Drive pegs into the ground at either end of the proposed fence line(s). Run a mason's line to ensure the fence is perfectly straight. The line gives you a guide as you set your fence posts and erect the panels.

, Follow the spacing recommended by the manufacturer of your fence.

, Use a post hole digger, auger or a double ended shovel. Depending on the soil type, you may have to dig the hole shallower or deeper. A good rule of thumb is to dig each hole 600mm (two feet) deep.

, Make sure they are plumb and in-line, then provision temporary bracing to keep them in position as you dry fit the fence.

, Use two or three panels held in place with temporary fasteners (removable clamps). As you work your way along the fence line(s), prepare the grade, excavating and filling as needed. When you are satisfied with the grading, double check by going through the dry fitting process a second time.

, While maintaining plumb, drive the posts to the appropriate depth using a specialty post driving tool (available at hardware stores and home improvement centers) or use a block and sledgehammer. You will want to set the posts so that the height is just right for your panel. Remember, too, that each post will need to be capped, so the posts can be just a tad higher than the fence sections to allow for the cap. Alternatively, the caps can be put on before the panels are secured to the posts and rails.


Another option is to set the posts a bit high and plan to cut the top off of each post.

,, If you are using Portland cement, you will also need sand and aggregate (most often medium size gravel).

, Stop at least one inch below ground level.

, The curing time will depend on the particular mix and on the dampness of the ground. One day should be adequate, but allow two or more days if it fits your schedule.

,, For an ordinary fence 48"" to 60"" tall, a bottom rail 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the panel bottom and a top rail 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the panel top is sufficient. For taller fences, an intermediate rail is needed, centered between the top and bottom rails.

, You can fasten these with No. 12 self-drilling screws or 1/4"" bolts with nuts and lock washers.

,, Ensure that they are plumb and level or sloping uniformly to match the existing grade. Some types of metal panel fencing is designed to overlap, while other panels are installed with spacers, and yet another type has narrow vertical panels staggered on opposite side of the rails.

, This will not be necessary if you set your posts to the proper depth before you poured the concrete.

, Tap the caps into place using a hammer and wooden block to prevent damaging their coating/paint.

, Recycle or reuse excess material.

, It is best to keep plantings away from the fence as they tend get larger and will hinder fence maintenance.

Fill in the spaces.",How to Build a Landscape Border Around a House1," Formal styles tend to have symmetrical designs while informal styles tend to have asymmetrical designs. Instead of contrasting these features, compliment them. If, for instance, you have a formal style home, like a Colonial Revival, you should choose a fairly formal landscape garden that closely frames the perimeter of your house. For less formal styles, like ranches, curvy casual landscape borders are the way to go., The exact amount of space your border should take up will depend on how large your yard is, but the average suburban home can handle a border that is about 2 to 3 feet (2/3 to 1 meter) out from the house.


The border can follow the entire perimeter of your house, or you can choose to highlight certain areas. You can also add visual interest by creating a curved, uneven path rather than one with straight lines and sharp corners.

, Clearly marking where the border begins will make it easier to work with. Hammer wooden stakes in the ground, several feet (approximately 1 meter) apart from each other or by using enough to clearly form the necessary curves of your design. Tie plastic tape or rope around the stakes, connecting them together to create a visible yet temporary border.

, Use a shovel to dig out the grass and weeds about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep, sliding the shovel beneath the turf and lifting it out gently.

, Use a spade to make the ground as even as possible.

, Position the first brick so that the top corner rests against one of the wooden stakes. The brick should be perpendicular to the side of the house. Place other bricks at each stake to gauge the right distance. Then, move the stakes and the tape back so that they are at the bottom of each brick, measuring out the brick border itself.

, Cut into the ground another 1 inch (2.5 cm), removing the soil and leveling the area out as much as possible.

, Remove the guide bricks and fill the area in with wet mortar.

, Place the bricks directly over the mortar, just below the level of your lawn. Leave a little space in between each brick rather that packing them together closely. Pack them in place with a hammer or mallet.

, Pack dry mortar in between the bricks using a trowel. Clean of the extra with a small brush.

Fill the hole with tamped crushed stone or soil.,
Finish with a small hillock.",How to Install a Wood Fence Post1," You can install your posts directly into the soil as long as it's dense and has good drainage. The installation is more labor-intensive and a bit less stable than concrete, but also cheaper and (often) more decay-resistant.


Due to additional strain, gate posts work better when installed in concrete.;
, Follow local advice if possible, since climate and availability will affect this decision. Unless you live in a desert, it pays to choose durable lumber, which comes in two varieties:









Posts made entirely from durable heartwood. Western juniper, black locust, and Osage-orange are excellent choices. Pacific yew, redwood, and most cedar and white oak species can last 20+ years in most conditions.Pressure-treated wood with about 1 inch (2.5cm) sapwood surrounding a core of heartwood. Aspen, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and Douglas fir are suitable examples. Buy this from a trusted source to avoid poorly treated wood.

Note — All lumber should be labeled as suitable for ground contact. Not all pressure-treated wood is intended for burial.

, The sawn-off ends of the fence post are vulnerable to moisture. Consider these precautions if you live in a damp climate:









Bevel the top of the fence post to a 45º angle to encourage rain runoff, or plan on installing a post cap.Treat the two ends with a non-water-based, brush-on wood preservative, such as copper naphthenate. Wood preservatives are toxic, so follow safety recommendations on the label.Apply multiple coats of the copper naphthenate and make sure to let it dry for 24 hours after each application.

, As a general rule, an 8 foot post needs to be placed so that two feet of it are in the ground. If you plan to anchor the post in soil, the hole diameter should be as close to the fence post size as possible. If you plan to anchor the post in gravel, dig a bit wider — roughly 8 inches (20cm) across for a standard 4x4 post.








Use a post hole digger to dig a straight-walled hole. If the soil is hard, cut through the sod with a shovel and/or let water soak into the dirt.
Keep some dirt (or dirt mixed with gravel) nearby to backfill the hole.

, A couple inches (few centimeters) of pea gravel or crushed stone improves soil drainage. Tamp it down well. This is especially important if your soil has poor drainage.









You can use a wooden stick or broken wood tool handle as a tamping bar, or a piece of scrap lumber.

, Center the post in the hole, and get it level and in line with the other posts. An assistant will be useful to hold this in place during installation. However, if you are going to yourself have some 1""x 4""x 4' or longer material available. Then, drive wooden stakes into the ground on two sides and attach them with screws to the 1""x 4"" to brace for “plumbing"" (vertical level).









Make sure that you measure the distance between your posts to ensure that the top and bottom rails will fit.

, Crushed stone offers better drainage than soil, and may improve stability as well if well tamped and installed in dense soil. Whether using crushed stone or ordinary soil, shovel it in 3–5 inches (7.5–12.5cm) at a time, tamping well after each batch.Repeat until the hole is filled.









Before each tamping, hold a level against the post and adjust until level.
If you'd like to plant grass at the base of the post, use soil for the last couple inches (several cm), not gravel.

, Build up the soil at the base of the pole to make a small ""hill"" sloping away from the post in all directions. The spot where the post leaves the ground is the most common location for rot. Good drainage here is extremely important.

Add and prep the soil.,
Choose plants that do not require much water.,
Decide on a color scheme.Many traditional border landscapes rely on evergreen shrubs and tall green grasses.,
Place tall plants near the corners of your house.,
Add mulch.",How to Build a Landscape Border Around a House2," After the mortar has finished drying, fill the ditch in between the bricks and the house with garden soil. You can use soil that you removed previously or specially purchase garden soil. Regardless of what soil you use or which plants you choose for your border, you should also enrich the soil by digging compost into the top foot (30.5 cm).

, Having too much sitting water near the foundation of your home can cause problems. Water can leak into basements and bottom floors, especially on older homes, and moist soil can also draw insects that could later find their way into your house from your border garden.

, If you want a few flowering shrubs, though, you should make sure that the ones you choose have flowers with hues that will complement one another rather than compete, especially if the flowers will be blooming at the same time.

, Tall plants soften the edge of a home, making smaller homes look larger.

, After you have finished planting, apply a layer of mulch over the area and around the base of your plants. Even though mulch retains moisture, it also helps to prevent it from leaking into the house. Mulch regulates the soil temperature, preventing it from becoming too hot or cold, as well. Moreover, mulch also prevents weeds and grass from poking through the soil.

Seal the gap between post and concrete.",How to Install a Wood Fence Post2," Concrete may be necessary if you are installing a fence in sandy soil, or in very soft, muddy soil. It's also a good idea when installing gate posts to provide extra stability. The main downside to concrete is its ability to trap water around the post. This can reduce the lifespan of the post by many years. The installation described here avoids this problem with a gravel base and an open-bottomed concrete sleeve.








, All fence posts should be made from durable lumber labeled for ground contact. For more information on selecting and prepping your fence posts, see the method above.








, A typical 4x4 fence post requires a concrete sleeve about 12 inches (30cm) across.Plan to bury ⅓ of the post, then allow a few inches (several cm) for the base beneath it. A large post hole digger or post driver will make this job much easier.









Power tools can be dangerous if the soil is rocky. You may need to use a clamshell digger instead, plus a long digging bar to lever out rocks.
The width of the hole should be consistent the whole way down, not cone shaped.

, A base of gravel or crushed stone will greatly improve drainage. Pour 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) into the hole and tamp it level.








, Position the post in the center of the hole, using a level to guide you to a vertical position. To hold the post in place, drop two stakes into the soil near two adjacent sides of the post. Nail or screw scrap lumber between the stake and the post. Don't pound the nails or screw the screws all the way into the post, so you can easily remove them later.







, Dig every post hole and brace each post so you can pour the concrete all at once. Use a string between corner posts to ensure that all fence posts are in line with each other.








, Another layer of tamped gravel will further improve drainage.








, Put on safety glasses and waterproof gloves.Pour a full bag of concrete mix (or as much as you can transport) into your wheelbarrow and mix in about 90% of the recommended water according to the label. Mix for a few minutes to check the final consistency, then slowly add more water until the concrete feels like paste.








To save effort, you can rent a portable concrete mixer or the services of a concrete truck.
To save money, make your own concrete mix: 1 part Portland cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts coarse gravel, by volume.Some fast-setting concrete mixes can be poured in dry, then mixed with water in the hole. These mixes tend to be weaker and more expensive, so speed comes at a high price.Be careful not to make the concrete too runny. Add the water in small increments until the concrete comes off of the shovel easily.

, Shovel concrete into the hole up to soil level. Work quickly enough to use each batch of concrete before it hardens. Take care not to splash cement onto the post.








, Smoothly cap off the top of the cement with a trowel, grading it outwards from the post. Aim for a slope roughly ½ inch (1.25cm) above ground level, dropping to about 1 inch (2.5cm) below ground level. This pitch will allow the water to flow off the post, preventing pools of water that promote decay.








, Give the concrete some time to dry and harden before building the fence or putting any weight on the post.








, Once the initial curing is complete, seal the gap around the base of the fence post. This gap will widen with natural expansion and frost, allowing water to pool here and cause rot. Seal it with a sealant that bonds to concrete and wood, such as some silicone sealants or exterior acrylic latex caulk.

, A snow fence belongs upwind of the area it's protecting, roughly perpendicular to the wind. For example, if your winds blow from east to west, you'll want a snow fence on the east side of the area, running north–south.This doesn't need to be perfect, so feel free to vary the angle of fence sections by up to 25 degrees if terrain requires it.If the object you are protecting runs roughly parallel to the prevailing wind, your fence should still remain perpendicular to the wind, not the area you are protecting. Lay several shorter fences bisecting the wind direction at an angle upwind of the object.

, If your fence will lie on other people’s property, consult your homeowner’s association, municipality or county. Some public works departments install snow fences as a public service, since plowing snowdrifts costs about 100 times more than snow fences., For most projects, you can multiply the height of the fence by 12, and extend the length of the fence by this amount in both directions. This makes up for the fact that the ends of the fence are less effective at blocking snow, since wind wraps around them. If you need maximum protection, multiply the height of the fence by 20 instead.For example, if you are building an 8-foot (2.4m) fence, extend it by 100 feet (30.5m) past the protected area in both directions. If you are protecting a busy road, play it safe and extend each side by 200 feet (61m) instead.
If you don't need full protection, you can compromise to save money or space. Just make sure the total length of the fence is at least 25 times the fence height. Any shorter than this and the wind can wrap around to the center from both ends, making the fence even less effective.

, A snow fence's job is to slow the wind enough to deposit the snow in a drift downwind of the fence. This means that a fence too close to the area you want protected will actually make the problem worse. As a general rule, a snow fence will quickly cause a drift up to a distance 20 times the height of the fence, so this is the minimum distance you want between the fence and the protected object. If enough snow builds up, the drift will then slowly extend to a distance 35 times the height of the fence. Install the fence at this distance if you need to keep the area completely clear of snow in all conditions.


For example, an 8 ft (2.4 m) fence should be placed at least 160 ft (49 m) from the area you want clear. If it is vital to prevent even shallow snowdrifts (on a busy road, for instance), install the fence at least 280 ft (85 m) away.
Measure this distance parallel to the wind.
If you do not have enough space, look for a less porous fence (with smaller or fewer holes). These numbers are based on a 50% porous fence. The drift from a 25% porous fence maxes out at about 24 times the fence height instead of 35 (with the downside that less total snow is blocked).

, As a rule of thumb, an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall fence should protect an area with up to 29 inches (74 cm) of annual snowfall. It may handle much more snow in areas where low wind or dense snow reduces the horizontal distance snow can travel.If you're not sure whether that's enough, consider contacting a government office (such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service in the U.S.) for a recommendation specific to your area., Taller fences are much more effective: one 8-foot (2.4 m) fence blocks about as much snow as five rows of 4-ft (1.2 m) fencing. However, multiple rows of fences may be necessary in extreme weather, or if you prefer short fences. To calculate the spacing between rows, multiply the fence height by 30. This prevents the drift from one fence from burying the one below it.


For example, two 4-ft. (1.2 m) rows of fencing should be placed 120 ft. (36m) apart.
Place the rows closer together where the wind travels up a steep slope, and place them farther apart on steep, downhill slopes.

, A snow fence is a lightweight fence, usually plastic or wood, with holes or slats covering much of its surface. The ideal snow fence is 40 to 50% porous, meaning these openings cover about half the surface area.A fence with a much lower or greater porosity will be much less effective.


Each hole or slat is usually 2 to 2.5 inches (5–6 cm) wide. Openings wider than 6 inches (15 cm) are not effective.Before buying a fence, read on to learn about truss-type and sheet fencing.

, This is a series of wooden panels supported by a rigid framework. Truss-type fences are cheaper to install and easier to remove (for temporary fences), but take up more space and are less effective on slopes. There are several different designs for this type of fence, so refer to the manufacturer's instructions if possible. Here's a common example of what this installation might look like:


Drive rebar posts into the ground at a 30–45º angle. These posts can typically be shorter and more widely spaced compared to the standard set up described below.Set the framework against these rebar posts.
Set the panels at a 15º angle to the ground over the framework. Overlap the panels.

, The other main type of snow fence comes in rolls of sheeting or slats, to be strung across standard fence posts. This is the best choice for slopes, and for areas with limited horizontal distances available. Keep reading for detailed instructions on this type of fence.

, You can spray paint the ground, or secure a line of brightly colored string to keep the fence to a straight line.

, Although the fence is light, these are load-bearing posts that must stand up to the weight of a snowdrift. First, add 10 to 15% of the fencing height to allow for a gap between the fence and ground. Next, choose posts that are tall enough to support this fence when 2/3 of the post is above ground.


For example, if your fencing is 4 ft (1.2 m) tall, the top of the fence will be 4 x 1.1 = 4.4 ft (1.3m) off the ground. Your posts should be 4.4 x (3/2) = 6.6 ft (2 m) tall.Drive #5 rebar into the ground every couple of feet and weave it through the sheet of fencing.

, Use a post hole digger to create holes deep enough to bury 1/3 of the post height. The taller the fence, and the stronger the wind is in your area, the closer the posts need to be to resist wind force. Consult local building codes for a recommendation, or follow these guidelines for a strong fence (withstanding winds up to 100 mph or 160 km/h):


Space steel T-posts 8 ft (2.4 m) apart to support a 4 ft (1.2m) tall fence.
Space them about 4.5 ft (1.4 m) apart instead to support a 6 ft (1.8 m) tall fence.
Wooden post spacing varies with type of wood and circumference. Consult a lumber store employee or a local handyman.
If the ground has already frozen, digging will be much more difficult. You can thaw the ground by building smalls fires over the post hole locations, contained under vented metal containers.You can also rent ground-thawing equipment for large jobs.

, Bury each post 1/3 of its height and secure it firmly. Pack in about 6 inches (15 cm) of soil at a time. Between each layer, tamp down the soil firmly and confirm the post is level.


A layer of pea gravel at the base of the hole will improve drainage.
You may use concrete instead of soil.

, Leave a gap above the ground about 10–15% the fence height. Paradoxically, this gap lets the fence trap more snow. If the gap is too small, a deeper upwind snowdrift will partially bury the fence, making it less effective and potentially damaging it.

, Pull the fencing taut and secure it to the posts with cable ties. In high wind areas, reinforce this attachment by sandwiching the post between the metal post and a wooden slat before tying them together.Fasten ties about every six inches (15cm) along the height of each post.


For even more security, slip foam insulation over the post, then sandwich the fencing between that and a wooden batten.

, Pull each length of fencing taut and secure as you go. Keeping the fence in the correct position off the ground may require several workers.

Building one in an unapproved way can get you a fine and require you to tear the whole thing down. Before building, check what your local neighborhood rules or homeowner’s association rules are regarding fences.

If the fence will be built on a shared property line, then try talking with your neighbor to find out if they’d be willing to share the cost of the fence with you.;
, Cities often also have rules about building fences. You will need to check what they are before building one. Some cities require permits to build a fence of any height, some only above a certain height. Find out if you need a permit or if there are any other restrictions on your building.
, If you find out that you do need a permit, get one before building. These usually cost a little money and can be obtained from your local City Hall or Planning Department.









Make sure to call the Digline at 811 before you start digging., It is important to decide what kind of fence you want. There are many different types of materials, all with different benefits and downsides. You will need to consider how much time you want to spend on upkeep, how much money you have to spend to build the fence, and how long the fence will need to remain in its location.










A wood fence is the most common. These last between 5-20 years, depending on the type of wood (cedar will last longer than pine, for example), and are they relatively inexpensive. Wood fences may be difficult to clean, however, if they get paint on them.

Vinyl fences will last much longer than a wood fence, up to a lifetime if using quality vinyl. They can come in a variety of colors that should not fade over time and are easily cleaned if they get paint on them. They are, however, slightly more expensive in terms of upfront costs.

Brick is an option if you dislike the look of wood or vinyl fences, or if you feel the need for something more sturdy. You can use actual brick or you can use concrete block. The concrete block can be further covered in cobble or plaster for a ""Southwestern"" look. Concrete blocks can also be turned perpendicular to each other to create planters in your wall. Any kind of masonry construction, however, will be much more expensive than the other options, although it will last longer than wood.

Growing or green fences are a great option if your city is very restrictive about permits or permits are very expensive. They are also good if you would prefer more greenery in your yard, rather than looking at a fence. You can plant Arborvitae, an evergreen shrub which grows three feet a year, put in an iron or chain fence and train ivy on it, or grow more standard hedges like holly., Using string tied to stakes, determine the perimeter of your fence and mark the corner locations, as well as measuring and marking the locations of the intermediate posts (if they are needed). The distance between posts is up to you but keep in mind the normal spacing is 8 feet (2.4 m) from center to center. Mark all locations with spray paint or stake holes.








, Using a post-holer, dig holes at least ¼ to ⅓ the height of your intended fence. Make sure you follow the rules stipulated in your permit, as many cities have rule regarding hole depth. You don’t want to hit a water main!









Remember to call the Digline at 811 before you dig!Water mains are usually placed at least 4 ft in the ground so in most cases a 16 to 24 inch deep posthole should be safe.
You can use a manual digger or a motorized auger. Both can often be rented from your local hardware store.

, You will want to put a few inches of gravel in the bottom of the hole, to provide drainage and ensure that the posts do not rot.








, Use 4x4 posts at your preferred height (factoring in the depth of the hole) and place them one at a time. This may require a helping hand.









Varying the depth of the hole to keep the height of the posts the same is much more labor intensive than digging the post hole to approximately the same depth of each hole and cutting off the top of the posts after they have set for 24 hours. It is also important to seal the tops of posts to protect them from rainwater damage.

, Before setting the concrete, use a post level to ensure that the post is plumb and double check the height to make sure it’s what you want. Pour in the concrete, mix with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and continue to use the level as it sets to be sure that it stays straight.









Alternatively, mix the quick-set concrete in a bucket or wheelbarrow and then pour it in.
You will want to continue to use string to make sure the posts are in line with each other.

, Get in all the posts before moving on. Use temporary cross bracing to hold posts in place while the concrete hardens. This will take at least 24 hours.








, These are the boards (we recommend 2x4s) set between the posts, in a perpendicular alignment. You will attach the main boards of the fence to these rails. They should be measured and cut to fit between the posts.









You will probably need two or three rails, depending on the height of your fence.

, Next, take a 1x4 and cut it to be the same height as the posts. Mark the spots on the board where you would like your rails to go. With that marked, nail the 1x4 flat to the end of the top and bottom (and possibly middle) rails. The rails should then be perpendicular and as a 90° turn from the 1x4 board, looking a little like a T (if viewed from the side, you should see the 1” side of the 1x4 and the 4” side of the 2x4). Do this for each end of the rail.








, Fit the frame in between the posts and fasten from the inside edge into the posts using deck screws. Use rust proof hardware so the fasteners do not “bleed” over time and discolor the fence.








, Use slats or pickets of any width you prefer, but they should not be more than 1” thick. Nail or screw them into the rails using 2” (or similar) screws or nails, using a spacer between each board to ensure that they are even and that the space between them is slightly less than their width. Continue the entire length of the fence.








, Now attach the boards on the inside of the fence. These should be placed so that they cover the gaps created by the outside boards.








, You may or may not wish to add a fence gate to provide you entrance to the yard. Follow the linked instructions for adding a gate.








, With this done, you can paint or stain your fence as you wish. A decorative top can be added or shrubs planted along the baseline.

",How to Replace a Broken Fence Post1,"


Farm fencing usually only has the corner poles set in cement while suburban wood fences may have every wood post set in cement.
Tubular metal posts such as those used with chain link fence, are generally set in cement.;
,, If it is firmly set, proceed to the next step.

, If leaving the bottom of the post in the ground is a problem, do not cut off the post, proceed to the next step.

,


Dig around the post to look for cement.
Use a probe close to the post to feel for cement.

,


If it’s not set in cement push the post back and forth in the hole until it loosens, then lift it up. If it is stubborn you may need to dig around the post on all sides until the post loosens.
A post anchored in cement will need to be pulled out. Cut a notch near the top of the post. Attach a heavy duty chain or cable under the notch. Attach the other end of the chain or cable to a tractor or truck and pull it out.

,, A post hole digger or a narrow spade works best.


Dig as close to the old hole as possible, exactly even with it.
Make the hole about 6 inches wider than the post on all sides.
To determine depth measure the old post from the top to where it set in the soil. Subtract that from the length of the new post. The answer is the depth you need for the new hole.
Rent a powered auger that can make holes for fence posts if you have a lot of posts to replace.

, Make sure the depth is correct by measuring as you would for a new hole.

, Place a small level on top and adjust the post until it sits level in the hole. Have someone hold the post level or use props to hold it in place.

,


Mix a bag of ready mix cement according to package directions. Pour it around the post to the top of the hole. Let it dry 24 hours.
If you don’t use cement, and are replacing a wooden post put small gravel in the bottom 6, inches,(15.2 cm), of the hole, then fill the hole with soil to the top and pack it down firmly. Metal poles do not need gravel.

Trim and tie back plants.,
Cover tender plants with a tarp or invert buckets over them.,
Set the power washer on a lower pressure setting such as 1500 to 2000 psi.

,
Stand about 2 feet (0.6 m) away from the fence and hose it down.,
Let the fence dry if the mildew and algae disappear from the fence.,
Scrub the stained areas on the fence if some stains remain after power washing.,
Check the fence and sand any rough areas.

, Remove any other obstructions.

,, You can move closer in for heavily stained spots but don’t keep high pressure on any spot for too long. Move the sprayer in a slow, sweeping pattern.

, If stains remain proceed to the next step.

,


Pour a solution of one part household bleach to two parts water into a bucket. There is no need to stir.
Use a scrub brush to clean the remaining stains with the solution. Be careful not to get bleach solution on your plants.
Repeat the power washing on the stained areas you scrubbed.

,
Place the new post close to where you removed the old one and as close to the fence as possible.

,
Drive the new post into the ground until the triangular blade at the bottom is below ground.,
Re-attach the fence to the post.

",How to Replace a Broken Fence Post2,",,


Push the post or post piece back and forth, rocking it vigorously to loosen the pole.
Pull straight up on the post to lift it from the ground. This method works well for those with a strong grip and with a few poles.
Rent or buy a post puller if the ground is very hard or there are many posts to pull. You may have to straighten bent posts for it to work. A post puller works using a jack-like device to lift the post out of the ground. Some can be powered by hand and others by a power take off drive shaft on a tractor. If you are pulling hundreds of posts you’ll want to rent a powered post puller.

,,,


Use a post driver, which is a hollow tube with a weighted end that fits over a metal fence post. It has handles on both sides. You lift the driver and let it fall on the post to drive in the post. They are inexpensive and you can find them at farm stores or hardware stores.
Use a sledgehammer if you don’t have a post driver to drive the post in.

Measure each board to cut them if trimming is required.,

Mark the angles for dog-earring your boards if this is desired, being careful to make them uniform.,

Stack your new used lumber vertically to allow air to circulate around them and to help decrease warping.,

Keep your work area clean, picking up scraps of wood with remaining fasteners, or make a scrap pile where there is no danger of anyone stepping on them.
",How to Reuse Privacy Fence Boards," Storms knock fences down, or neighbors might be renovating theirs with new material. Be ready to stop and ask if they are willing to donate their waste lumber, or even pay you to tear down the fence and haul it away.
, Insect damage, rot, and weathering are conditions that might render the lumber useless. Determine the type of lumber, rot resistant material like cedar and redwood may weather and grow fungus and mold, but generally, they stay sound for many years, even exposed to weather extremes.
, Be careful of nails, screws, splinters, and other hazards. Wearing gloves and a sleeved shirt, as well as sturdy work boots is suggested., A six foot board might be too damaged or deteriorated to use for a fence, but even a few feet of sound lumber can be used for other projects. If you notice that one end or the other of a majority of your boards is in poor condition, stack them with the bad end the same direction to make work dealing with this easier., Keep a bucket handy to toss these objects into to make cleanup easier when you are finished., Some attached lichens or fungus might be acceptable, but these will continue to grow and spread if you reuse the material, so keep them to a minimum., Depending on the amount of material you have been fortunate enough to gather, every useful piece might be needed to complete your project., Many fence boards will be rotted or deteriorated at the bottom, especially if debris has been stacked against them or if they were in contact with the ground., If both ends are damaged, square up one end before measuring your final cut., Cut your boards with a circular saw., If you have a flat, dry storage area, you might prefer to stack your boards flat. Store your harvest until you have gathered enough material for your planned project.,"

Lastly, make sure they have access to all prescription information and medications at all times, this will maintain a timetable for them and will avoid any health precautions.

",How to Move With Senior Citizens," Be open to all questions and be patient with all members. Create a list of small tasks that you want all members to start with, so the senior citizen feels like they are involved and are not singled-out. Taping a calendar to your refrigerator marking the days until the move date is also a great idea so that both children and the elderly can plan ahead.;
, Seniors understand that their eyesight and physical abilities are not as they used to be, so it is always important that you are supportive and compassionate towards your loved one, knowing they are trying their best to assist you. When helping them pack, try to provide positive support and assistance to encourage them. However, it’s best to assist only when they ask you to because you may make them feel inadequate if you try to step in to do something they are capable of doing.

, Like your children or your pets, you should always be patient with the elderly. They might pack or clean slowly, but they are doing it which is very helpful. Try to schedule a pack day weeks in advance so they can pack their belongings without any stress or rush and so they would know where to find their things when it’s time to unpack.

, Our rooms are full of memories and stories that we all treasure. This is no different for the elderly. A good idea when they are beginning to pack their room is to take a picture of the room so they can rearrange all of their possessions the same way in their new room. Provide them with a layout to the new house so they can become adjusted to the idea of moving and try to visualize where everything will be. If you are moving locally, you may also want to show them the new house and show them the neighbourhood so they can see where all grocery stores, parks, and community centres are.

, You can also let them choose a room on the first level as their personal room so they can completely avoid going up the stairs.

, Once your belongings have been delivered to your new home, you should help the elderly unpack first so they are preoccupied with setting up their new room. Make sure that they have eaten at the end of the day because during stressful times, some people may forget to do so.

, You may need to explain how to operate thermostats and alarms to the elderly if they stay at home often.

Dig out the roots of larger plants with decent quantity of soil surrounding them. Add a moderate amount of water to help hold soil together.
Wrap the base of the plant with a plastic bag and secure it around the stem.
Protect the shrubs from the top by enclosing them with newspaper or plastic. Poke holes to allow for breathing. Arrange the plants in a box, insulated with shredded paper, bubble wrap or packing peanuts.

, If you will be carrying the plants yourself, try to maintain a stable temperature the whole time, and avoid a bumpy ride. During winter, proper insulation is the key. Seek shade and airy spaces during the summer.


Many packers and movers do not transport plants. Many other movers and packers do not cover the liability of damage or loss.

, Whenever possible, you have to place similar items in one box only, avoid mixing it all up. If you are to place heavy items like books, CD, and other media items, in a single box, be sure that the box you will use can hold the weight and can still be lifted. You may make use of pillows, comforters, towels, and blankets as top-of-the-box filler. This can help in preventing your stuff from being damaged when other boxes are placed on top of such box.

, Labeling every box you pack is very important. This will prevent you from opening all the boxes whenever you need to get something from your storage unit. You can actually use colors to label each box; however, experts still recommend writing the box with bold black markers specifying the contents of such box.

, Basically, you have to place those that you won’t use immediately on the inner portion of the unit. On the other hand, you must position those things you need sooner close to the opening of the unit. This will help you in getting your stuff easily and conveniently. Be sure to choose a storage unit that will suit your storage needs and budget. Choose one that can accommodate all your things – do not hire one that is too small or too big.

Make sure you can legally use an in-ground fire pit in your home.,
Take a good look around your yard or patio when positioning your fire pit.,
Consider how you want your guests to interact.,
Gather your materials for a fire.,
Make sure that you use dry wood.,
Place your materials in your fire pit.,
Light the fire.,
Maintain your fire.,
Put out your fire.",How to Use a Fire Pit1," Check with building officials and local codes to ensure that you won't break any laws.


Every city is different and yours may have certain codes which only allow a certain type of fire pit.
Get in contact with the planning offices in your area to see if any restrictions apply.;
, Your pit should be far away from any flammable structure.


With an in-ground fire pit you need to make sure it’s built in a clear area. It should be a safe distance away from your home, deck, overhangs, trees, etc.
You should also keep your fire pit away from heat sensitive plants, dry grass, bales of hay, open firewood, and other materials that could ignite.
If you don’t already have your in-ground fire pit built, check wind patterns in the area before you build. You want to position your pit so that it doesn’t blow smoke into your home.

, You may want to position your fire pit in an out-of-the-way place for late night intimate gatherings. Or, you may want it more centrally located to encourage conversation and interaction between your guests.


Wherever you decide to place it, make sure that you pick a safe location. If you haven’t built the in-ground fire pit, make sure you pick a place that will stay clear of any plant life for years.
It’s best to pick an open flat area for your guests as well. If you are on a slope it might be more uncomfortable to sit around the pit. If you are in a more enclosed area, smoke from the pit might be an issue.

, The easiest way to get a fire going in your in-ground fire pit is to sort your wood, kindling, and tinder. To help you build the best fire, sort your materials by size. Place all your large logs together, followed by your smaller logs, kindling, and tinder.
If you plan to cook any food over your fire, don’t use any starter logs or gels. These items contain chemicals which get into the smoke and can get on your food.

, If there’s any moisture in the wood, especially the larger logs, it will be harder to start your fire.


You can easily find tinder in your own yard from dry grass and leaves that you've raked up. Otherwise, newspaper works well.
It’s also a great idea to have water on hand for putting your fire out.

, Because you can’t reach under any sort of grate in your in-ground fire pit you need to build an upside down fire. An upside down fire means placing your larger logs in first and stacking smaller logs, tinder, and kindling on top. Place your large logs in the bottom of your pit, and spread the logs out to cover the base. Then, place your smaller logs on top in a criss-cross pattern to allow for airflow.
Add your tinder. Create a small pile or ball with your tinder. You can even tie it up with some string if you need. If your tinder is too spread out it won’t create enough heat at once to ignite the rest of your materials.
Place smaller twigs and other kindling on top of the tinder bundle in a tepee-like fashion. These small branches will quickly catch fire and help to ignite your larger logs. The tepee shape of your kindling will create a small pocket of heat from your tinder and ensure that your kindling gets an even burn.
Never use pressure treated wood. It emits toxic fumes. You can tell if the wood is pressure treated by its green tint. , Be sure not to overload the fire pit with wood. You don't want the flames to get too high. When lighting your fire, the safest way is to you use a long match or lighter. Light your tinder and watch the fire grow.


You may want to light your tinder in a few places to help the fire get going.
If you are using any newspaper, you can also shove balls of it between your larger logs and light the newspaper.
Softwoods such as pines and firs are easier to light and are good for getting your fire started.
As your fire begins to burn it will create coals and embers. When the flames begin to die down, add larger logs to keep your fire burning.

, After the initial ten or twenty minutes, most of your kindling will have burned up along with your tinder. These bits of material will start to form natural coals and embers which still provide plenty of heat.


Use a poker or large stick to move your coals and embers together.
Add some oxygen by blowing on the coals to add more heat.
You can now start to place larger logs on top of these coals to keep your fire going.
Hardwoods like oak, ash, cherry, maple, and poplar are great for adding to a hot fire. These woods last longer than softwoods but are harder to light. , Once you’re done enjoying your fire pit, properly put out the fire.


If possible, allow the fire to burn down completely to ash.
Pour water over the fire and make sure you drown all the embers. Keep pouring until you don’t hear any more hissing. If you don’t have water, cover the embers and ashes with dirt and sand which is preferably damp or wet.
Stir the ashes and embers. A shovel works well here.
Once everything in the pit is wet and cold, you can use the shovel to scrape the materials out of the pit.
In most areas you can dispose of your ash in your regular garbage. Check with your local municipality for any specific laws or codes in your area. "

Every city is different and yours may have certain codes which only allow a certain type of fire pit.
Get in contact with the planning offices in your area to see if any restrictions apply.

, Your deck or porch may not be the best place for a fire bowl. Drifting embers can ignite surrounding wood, cause heat damage, and ventilation issues.


The best place to put a fire bowl or portable fire pit is on a flat, stable, non-combustible natural surface. Bricks, gravel, granite, paving stones and concrete are great options.
Put the fire bowl a safe distance away from your home, deck, overhangs, trees, etc.
Don’t put your fire bowl near heat sensitive plants, dry grass, bales of hay, open firewood, and other materials that could ignite.
Clear the area around the bowl of any sticks, twigs, leaves, or other flammable substances. Keep a bucket of water nearby.

, The easiest way to get a fire going in your portable fire pit or fire bowl is to sort your wood, kindling, and tinder.


To help you build the best fire, sort your materials by size. Place all of your large logs together, followed by your smaller logs, kindling, and tinder.
If you plan to cook any food over your fire, don’t use any starter logs or gels. These items contain chemicals which get into the smoke and can get on your food.
Make sure that you use dry wood. If there’s any moisture in the wood, especially the larger logs, it will be harder to start your fire.
You can easily find tinder in your own yard from dry grass and leaves that you rake up. Otherwise, newspaper works well.
It’s also a great idea to have water or a bucket of damp sand on hand for putting your fire out.

, Everyone likes to build a fire a certain way. With a fire bowl or portable fire pit, the teepee method or upside down fire method tend to work best depending on how deep the bowl is.


To make a teepee, start by placing your tinder in the bottom of your bowl. Keep your tinder in a ball and lay your kindling around it. Stack the larger sticks around your tinder in the shape of a teepee. You can then place your larger logs around your kindling. Keep a little open area so you can easily reach in and light your tinder. For an upside down fire, place the largest logs in the bottom of your pit, and spread the logs out to cover the base. Stack your smaller logs in a criss-cross pattern over your largest logs to allow for airflow. Place a small pile of tinder on top and then stack your kindling around the tinder in a teepee fashion.
Never use pressure treated wood.
Avoid using sappy wood like pine and cedar as these woods tend to pop more and create more floating embers.

, Be sure not to overload the fire pit with wood, don’t stack it much higher than the rim of your fire bowl. When lighting your fire, the safest way is to use a long match or lighter. Light your tinder and watch the fire grow.


You may want to light your tinder in a couple places to help the fire get going.
Shove some newspaper between your logs to create more heat and build up the flames.
Softwoods such as pines and firs are easier to light and are good for getting your fire started.
As your fire begins to burn it will create coals and embers. When the flames begin to die down, add larger logs to keep your fire burning.
If your fire bowl has a grate cover, place this over your fire once it's going. This will help prevent embers from flying out.

, After the initial ten or twenty minutes, most of your kindling will have burned up along with your tinder. These bits of material will start to form natural coals and embers which still provide plenty of heat.


Use a poker or large stick to move your coals and embers together.
Add some oxygen by blowing on the coals to add more heat.
You can now start to place larger logs on top of these coals to keep your fire going.

Check with your local municipality to make sure you can legally use a Chimenea.,
Place your chimenea in a safe place where you won’t have to move it.,
Gather your materials for a fire.,
Place your materials in your fire pit.,
Light the fire.,
Maintain your fire.,
Put out your fire.,
Keep your chimenea in good shape.",How to Use a Fire Pit3," Before purchasing check local codes to ensure that you can use a chimenea and will have room to properly place it.


Your area may have restrictions on the type of fire pit you are allowed to have.
Get in contact the planning offices in your area to see if any restrictions apply.

, Chimeneas are heavy and moving one isn’t always easy. However, you may have more options closer to your home than other types of fire pits due to the chimenea’s chimney and smaller mouth. Find a flat, stable, non-combustible natural surface. Bricks, gravel, granite, paving stones and concrete are great options.
Don’t place your chimenea under any trees or other overhangs. The longer smokestack produces a lot of heat which is directed upward. This could cause objects above it to catch fire.
It’s a good idea to place sand or lava rock in the bottom of your bowl. Fill it to about two inches below the opening. This helps to keep the base of chimenea from overheating while burning a fire.

, The easiest way to get a fire going in your chimenea is to sort your wood, kindling, and tinder.


To help you build the best fire, sort your materials by size. You don't need many large logs for a chimenea. If you have a new one, your first several fires should be much smaller. Your chimenea needs to get broken in. If you build too big of a fire, the heat could crack the clay.
If you plan to cook any food over your fire, don’t use any starter logs or gels. These items contain chemicals which get into the smoke and can get on your food.
Make sure that you use dry wood. If there’s any moisture in the wood, it will be harder to start your fire.
You can easily find tinder in your own yard from dry grass and leaves that you rake up. Otherwise, newspaper works well.
Keep a bucket of dirt or sand nearby in case you need to put your fire out quickly.
Consider placing a few bricks in the bed of your chimenea as well, to act as a bed for your wood. You can stack the logs on top of the bricks.

, Your chimenea is similar to a fireplace inside a home. So you can stack your materials with the larger pieces on the bottom. Or you can use the teepee method. If your chimenea is relatively new, it’s a good idea to start with small fires the first couple of times. This will season your chimenea and not cause it to overheat or break.
To make a teepee fire, place your tinder in the bottom of your bowl. Keep your tinder in a ball and lay your kindling around it. Stack the sticks around your tinder in the shape of a teepee. You can then place your larger logs around your kindling. Keep a little open area so you can easily reach in and light your tinder. If you're breaking in your chimenea, don’t add larger logs, just use kindling and smaller sticks. For a criss-cross, or log cabin stacking method, stack a few logs over your bricks. Add your tinder, then stack your kindling over in a criss-cross. You don’t need a lot of wood as the chimenea is meant for smaller fires.
Never use pressure treated wood. It emits toxic fumes. You can tell if the wood is pressure treated by its green tint.

, Don’t fill your chimenea with too much wood. Your fire should be small enough so it does not ascend into the smokestack. When lighting your fire, the safest way is to use a long match or lighter.


You may want to light your tinder in a couple places to help the fire get going.
If you are using any newspaper, you can also shove balls of it under your larger logs. Light the newspaper with your tinder.
Pine wood is a good option in a chimenea as it smells nice, wards off mosquitos, and burns well without getting too hot.
Hardwoods like oak, ash, cherry, maple, will burn best in your chimenea as these don’t produce as many sparks and last longer than softwoods.
If you do plan to use wood that emits more sparks, use a spark arrestor. This metal piece of equipment goes inside your smokestack and will extinguish sparks.

, As your wood begins to burn down it will create coals. You can use these coals to keep start new logs, or for cooking. Be careful not to add too much new wood, causing your fire to get too high.


Use a poker or large stick to move your coals and embers together.
Add some oxygen by blowing on the coals to add more heat.

, Once you’re done enjoying your fire pit, properly put out the fire.


Never use water to put a fire out in your chimenea, especially if you have a clay one. The shock from the temperature change can break the clay.
Let the fire go out naturally. If you’ve been properly monitoring your fire, you won’t have put too much wood in your chimenea. If you have a lid for your smokestack, place it over to restrict air flow. You can also dump sand on your embers to help extinguish the fire.

, A chimenea needs a bit more attention than other types of fire pits due to the materials it's made of and design.


Invest in a waterproof cover to keep it dry.
Chiminea sealer will help to keep the clay from cracking.
When you shovel out your ashes, rinse any rocks you have in the bottom. Let the rocks dry completely.

Concentrate on lifting before you do any turning or moving.",How to Protect Your Back While Moving1," Take a look at what needs to be moved and if necessary, ask others to help you.

, Do not assume you can lift or move something heavy on your own.

, This will give you an idea of how to manage the lifting.

, This will tuck your pelvis and keep your back balanced.

,


Stand close to whatever you are lifting.
Keep your feet about shoulder width apart.

, Squatting will keep your back properly aligned and use larger muscles in your legs to support your body and the weight of the object you are carrying.

, Slowly straighten your knees and back while you stand up.

, Lifting and moving an object in unison will prevent injury and keep one of you from dropping your end.


Assign one person the responsibility of saying ""lift"" so there is no confusion.

, Do not twist while you lift. This is dangerous for your back.

Vacuum the limestone.,
Use a dry mop or broom.,
Wet the area with a damp rag.,
Use a commercial poultice.",How to Remove Limestone Stains1," Your vacuum can be utilized to care for your limestone, especially if you can turn off the spinning brush. If you can’t turn off the brush, you can still do a quick vacuum of the dust and dirt of the affected area. The vacuum removes and dislodges dirt and dust in between cracks of the limestone.If you have a limestone table or other surface that isn’t flooring, use a handheld vacuum if available. Some vacuums come equipped with an attachment hose. This will also work for an elevated surface like a kitchen counter.;
, After removing or dislodging some of the grime off the floors, mop the area. Do not wet your mop, but instead use it dry to sweep the area of unwanted dust or dirt. You can also use a broom for this.


There are several “dust mops” available that would work efficiently for the limestone.

, It’s important to remove any dirt particles before using liquids because they can scratch the surface. Fill a bucket of warm water and add a couple tablespoons (14 mL) of mild soap. You can use common hand soap or use a smaller proportion of dish soap. Dampen a rag by submerging it into the mixture and remove as much water as you can. Gently wipe down the area with the rag.Take your time and don’t hesitate to spend extra time going over the stain with the rag. Soak the rag as many times as you need to.

, A poultice is a mixture of ground chalk (whiting) and hydrogen peroxide. Some versions will use a different chemical from hydrogen peroxide. Follow the instructions provided with the product but as a general guide:


Wet the poultice with distilled water.
Apply the poultice to the stain or stained area.
Leave it in place for 48 hours. During this time it will dry. The drying process enables it to absorb into the limestone.
Rinse it off. The stain should have disappeared."

Use a cart or a hand truck to push heavy objects whenever possible.,
Be sure to push heavy objects instead of pulling.,
Keep your knees and torso moving in the same direction.,
Stand up straight and lean into the object as you push it.,
Minimize the bending that you do.",How to Protect Your Back While Moving2,";
, Pushing will use stomach muscles and limit the strain on your back.

, Do not twist or turn while you are pushing an object.

, This will put your weight behind it and create some momentum.

, Just as when you are lifting heavy objects, bending at the waist in order to push will put too much strain on your spine.


Squat to get lower if you must bend down while pushing.

Wear a back brace, especially if you have struggled with back problems in the past.",How to Protect Your Back While Moving3," Stick with athletic shoes or sneakers. Avoid flip flops and anything with a heel.

,


Sit down whenever you can, with your feet flat on the ground. When you are standing for a long period of time, put one foot up on a stool or raised surface to alleviate pressure on the back.

,


Buy a lumbar support belt or a full back brace from your chiropractor or other retailers. Try a few on to make sure you get one that fits properly and offers the necessary support.

Clean spills immediately.,
Do a regular cleaning.,
Use doormats and runners.,
Use coasters and pads.",How to Remove Limestone Stains2," Rub off stains immediately either with a damp cloth and gentle soap or brush off (if it's soot, dirt, etc.). Some stains can be removed using a bristle brush, especially when they're new. The sooner the item is attended to, the better. If not, proceed with deeper cleaning techniques., Every two weeks, you should dry mop your limestone floors. If you have limestone countertops, you should also clean them with a dust absorbent fabric every other week. There are plenty of cleaning supplies that specialize in efficient, dry cleaning.


You could use a dust mop on a table or countertop as long as the mop is clean.

, For areas around the house that get heavy foot traffic, use rugs, mats, or runners. Consider spots near doorways or hallways leading to a door. Most stains occur from dirt and mud tracked onto the floor.You should also have outdoor mats to wipe your feet off before entering your house.

, For the limestone table and countertop users, use coasters! Limestone is susceptible to ring stains and watermarks. Prevent any damage by having plenty of coasters available for you or your guests.


Place hot cooking supplies on protective mats. Similar to the condensation cups, the heat produced off hot plates can stain and damage your surfaces too.

Mow and fertilize the lawn.",How to Replace an Old Lawn," Smothering your lawn will block light and prevent photosynthesis, killing the grass and weeds. The smothering method is not as dependent upon the weather as solarization or herbicides.Mow the grass closely. Cover it with layers of cardboard or newspaper (use black ink; colored ink could contain metals).
Wet the covering and top it off with grass clippings (4 inches / 10 cm or more), compost, 6-inch (15cm) wood chips, or another organic mulch.
Black plastic also works. It will block the sun and prevent photosynthesis.
Avoid heavy mulching in shady areas,which prevents the soil from warming up, causing too much moisture in the root zone.The layers of your old lawn will break down, making compost. The soil is now ready for planting.;
, Solarization uses the sun’s heat to kill the old grass by cooking it. Weeds, seeds and pathogens are also removed.You’ll need to cover the entire lawn with clear plasticKeep the lawn covered for about 7 weeks.
Cloudy days slow things down. The hottest days with direct sunlight are optimal for solarization.
Remove the plastic when the grass has died.
The dead grass can also be removed, or you can leave it as compost.
Clear plastic is preferable to opaque because more sunlight can get to the grass surface.
Thick plastic will last longer because it’s sturdier and resists tears.

, Herbicides will kill weeds, roots and grass. Read the full label before you begin and be sure to follow all safety instructions, including the use of personal protective gear. Mix the herbicide in accordance with the directions on the product, then apply it over the entire lawn, taking care to avoid nearby garden plants.Select a herbicide that will degrade quickly. This will minimize how long it stays in the environment. Herbicides containing glyphosate are a wise choice.
Add just a few drops of dishwashing liquid soap or another surfactant to help the herbicide stick to vegetation.
Apply the herbicide on a sunny day (60 degrees or above) so that the herbicide will dry quickly. Choose a day with little to no wind to avoid drifting.
Reapply the herbicide if the turf has not completely died. Wait about four weeks before reapplying.
Wait one week after the final application. Till the dead turf into your soil.

, Sod removal works best for grass that doesn't have long roots. Grasses that are perennial, Bermuda grass and perennial rye, for instance, have roots that go down several feet. It’s hard to get all of it by cutting away the sod.Kill the vegetation using one of the methods above first to make sod removal easier.


Rent a sod cutter if you don’t have one. They're about $70.00 per day.
Alternately, you can use a flat shovel rather than a sod cutter. It’s less expensive, but it’s a lot more labor.
Cut the sod into strips.After cutting the sod, roll up the strips and dispose of them.
Alternately, you can leave the sod in place by inverting it and using it for compost. Cover the inverted sod in 6 to 10 layers of newspaper. The decomposed sod improves the soil and prevents grass from regrowing. Do not leave the sod in place if it contains undesirable weeds or invasive grasses.
You can also use the inverted sod to make high places on your lawn or to fill in low places.

, Use a soil test to determine the best way to treat your soil. Cooperative Extension Services or soil testing laboratories can analyze your soil. You can find them through a local state university. A commercial testing kit can also be used to test your soil.

Take multiple samples from different locations around the lawn and at different depths of the soil, near the surface and 8 to 10 inches (20–25cm) or more in depth. Label each one clearly.

, Do this once the old lawn has been removed by your selected process. This is a nice opportunity to fix existing grade problems:The ground should slope away from your house in all directions. It should drop about 2 ½ inches every 10 feet (3 m).
Use a landscaping rake if the grading adjustments are minor.
Water the area and fill in puddled areas with soil from the high spots on your lawn.
The finished grade should be at the level of surrounding areas like a patio or sidewalk.
If you’re adding amendments to the soil than adjust the grading depth to about 2 inches (5 cm) lower than the fixed surfaces (such as a patio) bordering your new lawn.

, Now that you’re starting from scratch, take advantage of your access to the soil of your lawn by preparing it for “hosting” grass seeds.Add organic matter, lime, sulfur or fertilizer to serve as amendments for the site of your new lawn.Don’t cultivate the soil it too finely. You’ll want to avoid the soil crusting into a hard surface which prevents seeds from emerging. Aim for soil that isn’t dense and will allow seeds to grow., Lawns started from seed are best planted in the early fall or in the spring after frost season.Sow the seed evenly from a spreader, walking at a slow, steady pace and allowing a 6 inch to 1 foot (0.30 m) overlap of seeds.Work the seed gently into the ground afterward using an inverted plastic rake, and apply a thin topdressing of soil to ensure good soil contact and moisture retention.


Select the seed that works best for your lawn environment. Your seed-seller can make a recommendation.
Use a drop-spreader to distribute the seeds. The drop-spreader has a dropper with adjustable holes. Most lawn products will suggest what size hole you should use. The drop spreader is good for most lawns under 4,000 square feet.For lawns over 4,000 feet (1,000 m), use a broadcast spreader. They're faster and allow for a wider distribution of seeds.In tight corners or confined spaces, sprinkle seed by hand for best placement.

, Your local lawn and garden supplier will help you to choose the fertilizer appropriate for your lawn. Cover the seeds with fertilizer using the back of your rake, then apply a thin layer of organic mulch if you expect hot, dry weather., Don't wash away the seeds. Keep the seeded area moist until the grass sprouts (about 3 weeks). Water for brief periods of time, but often. When the weather is warm, try for four or more times a day., Mow for the first time after the grass has grown a third taller than its optimum height. Use sharp, straight, undamaged mower blades and go slowly to avoid damaging the new roots.


Mow in different directions each time for more even cut and growth.

, Avoid walking on the lawn or weeding it for the first 4-6 weeks.If weeds are still a problem in 6 weeks, remove them then. Spot spraying herbicide is more effective than hand pulling, but avoid multiple uses of the same herbicide. If applied too often, most broadleaf control products will kill the grass seedlings as well.

, You'll need to confirm that the base of your lawn site will be a good fit for the sod you'll order. For about US$15.00 your local extension will send it to a lab for analysis., You can fix existing problems by grading, as you prepare for sod to arrive:Avoid too much slope for your new lawn. The maximum slope is about twelve inches for every four feet. If your slope is greater than that you might need to build a retaining wall.
Use a hose to water the site for your new lawn. Note areas where puddles have formed.
Use a rake to fill in the low areas on your lawn with soil from the high spots.
Be sure the finished grade is level with the areas surrounding your lawn site.
If the soil test report suggests you need soil amendments, allow an additional 2 inches (5 cm) of depth to accommodate them.

, This will generally be a mix of two to three turf grasses, ordered from a sod farm or a garden center. Let the supplier know your lawn's sun conditions before placing the order.Measure the square-footage of your lawn carefully so that you can order the right amount of sod. It’s best to go over a bit to cover cutting around curves . . . about 5% over should do the trick., Two people could cover about a thousand square feet of sod in a day. If your yard is bigger, consider getting a little help from your friends to install the sod as quickly as possible. Lay the sod as follows:Lay your first strip in the longest straight section of your yard. Keep off the sod during installation. Pat down the sod so that it’s flat against the soil beneath it.
Lay the next row of sod. Cut the sod in half first and lay it in a staggered design (as bricks are laid). Roll out each roll in the same direction. If rolled in different directions, your lawn will look uneven (at least at first), and the seams may be harder to lay with adjacent strips.
Make sure the sections of sod are snug against each other, without overlapping. Continue this process for your whole lawn, cutting sections and staggering them as you lay them down.
You can cut holes in the sod for ground sprinklers if you plan on using them.
Use a knife to trim the sections of sod that abut paved areas.

, Fill a lawn roller half full with water and walk over your lawn in various directions. This will press down the sod so its root base is firmly in contact with the soil, encouraging them to grow together., Water just to the point of puddling, then stop. Depending on the weather, you may need to repeat this more than once a day to prevent the seeds from drying out. Avoid overwatering, which can prevent good soil contact and encourage fungal diseases if left damp overnight.


Keep foot traffic on the sod to a minimum in the early stages.

, When the grass reaches about 3 inches (8 cm) cut it down to 2 inches. The grass is still fragile, so use a regular lawnmower rather than heavier equipment.Grass in the heat of summer will fare better if allowed to grow taller and cut on the mower's highest setting. The taller growth helps retain moisture at ground level.
After three to four weeks growth, add fertilizer to the lawn. This will replace nutrients lost to watering and wet weather."

Lay fertilizer down.",How to Reseed a Lawn with Weeds1," The most effective time to reseed a weedy lawn is early fall when warm days and cool nights provide a good environment for grass seed germination.


If you cannot reseed your lawn in the fall, you can also reseed it in the spring. Summer and winter months are not ideal for reseeding.;
, You can have your soil tested by a local Extension Office or garden center about one month before reseeding. Ask them to determine the pH of the soil and nutrient levels. This will reveal any problems with the soil that may have contributed to the weed problem.If you do not want to go to a garden center, you can also determine the pH yourself. To learn how to do this, read ].

, Good soil preparation is an important step in the reseeding process. Remove the weeds first using a post-emergent weed killer. In general, reseeding can be done about six weeks after applying a weed killer, but this varies, depending on which herbicide is used.


Select an herbicide that will kill the weeds growing in the lawn and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations carefully.

, Mow the remaining grass to a height of ¾ inch, using a catcher on the mower to catch the grass clippings.Cutting the grass this short will help for the seeds to take root and grow.

, A dethatching machine or power rake can be rented from an equipment rental company, which is the easier way to go, or it can be done by hand with a dethatching rake.

, If the pH of your lawn was off and led to weed growth, you will likely have to add some soil amendments to your lawn to keep the weeds from coming back.


Soil amendments will make your lawn either more acidic or more alkaline, depending on where you live and what weeds you are dealing with.

, Use a broadcast spreader to apply starter fertilizer over the lawn. This fertilizer will help your new seeds to grow strong and healthy. You should spread the fertilizer at the rate of 20 pounds per 1,000 square feet.The fertilizer should have one of the following ratios:


10-5-5.
10-6-4.

Go over your seeds with a lawn roller.",How to Reseed a Lawn with Weeds2," Be sure to select a grass species that will naturally thrive in the environment present in your yard. Select a shade-tolerant species for a shady yard or a sun-loving species for a sunny yard.


If the lawn will be subjected a lot of traffic, select a species that can handle being tread on.

, Spread the grass seed using a drop or broadcast spreader, setting the seeding rate according to the grass species being planted. Spread the seed in even swaths in one direction, and then again in the other direction to insure even seeding.

, You should try to rake the soil so that the seeds are covered with roughly1/8-inches of soil. If you do not have a rake, you can also spread mulch over the soil.


If you choose to lay mulch down, you can use a peat spreader. Try to cover the seeds in roughly ¼-inch of mulch or less.

, Locate an open space for gardening. For a narrow space, up against the house is ideal. If you have a wider space, you can plant in multiple locations around the yard. If necessary, take measurements or section off the space you will use for the garden.Test the soil in the space you choose for gardening to see what kind of plants would thrive there.

, If you have a fence, it is also an option to plant climbing plants, like cucumbers, ivy, Morning Glory, golden hops, and St. Vincent Lilac. To prepare and plant climbing plants, you need to attach wire supports on the fence. Then, you should dig a hole about eighteen inches away from the plant. The hole should be twice as wide as the plant pot and slightly deeper. Next, place bamboo canes in the holes in a fan shape. After that, remove the plant from its pot, place it in the hole, and cover it with soil. Finally, tie the stems to the wire with twine.Digging a hole too close to the fence is not advised because the soil is usually dry in that area.
The bamboos will serve as support for the plants until they reach the wires.
A long, narrow garden is great in any small side yard because it leaves space for walking.

, You may not need mulch if the soil in your garden is good for planting. But mulch can help regulate soil temperature and moisture, suppress weeds, and it looks nice aesthetically. Mulch can be picked up at a nursery or at many home improvement stores.You can also pick up weed fabric to put below the mulch.

, Depending on the amount of space you have, you may want to limit the amount of flowers you plant. Choose at least two varieties of plants and/or flowers. Consider flowers that are colorful and aesthetically pleasing. It is good to purchase flowers that will bloom at different times of the year so that there is always a touch of color in your yard. You can start with seeds, or choose flowers that just need to be planted into the ground. For instantly sprucing up a space, purchase some seedlings potted plants/flowers from a local nursery.


Some perennial flower options are catmint, coneflower, coreopsis, and gaura., Choosing to grow vegetables can make your garden useful, not just aesthetically pleasing. Think of vegetables that most or everyone in your household would enjoy. You should also consider the amount of space you have and the time you are willing to put into the tending to the vegetables. If you’re a beginner, some vegetables that are easy to grow are snap peas, carrots, and radishes. Cilantro, parsley, and thyme are a few herbs that are easy to grow.Consider how much time you will be able to invest before planting vegetables.

, To add extra appeal to your garden, hang a few flower boxes. They are typically placed outside of windows. Flower boxes can be purchased at your local nursery or home improvement store. For a sunny window, bright flowers like Dusty Miller and Verbena are ideal. Plants with colorful leaves, like Dark Star and Dappled Apple, are best for shady windows. Succulents are great to plant if you won’t have much time to tend to the boxes. To plant the flowers, put potting mix and fertilizer into the box and place the flowers into the soil.Think of flowers that would complement the flowers in your garden.

, Use long planks of wood to section off the garden. This can be useful to keep kids from stepping on the garden. Surrounding the garden with wood can also be done purely for looks. All you need to do is purchase planks of wood, set them up around the garden, and attach them with a hammer and nails."

Keep the seeds moist.,
Reduce how often you water the seeds once they begin to germinate.,
Mow the grass once it reaches the maintenance height of that specific type of grass.,
Fertilize the new grass.",How to Reseed a Lawn with Weeds3," Water the newly seeded lawn just enough to moisten the soil. The seeds must be kept moist at all times in order for them to germinate (grow into grass blades). Check the soil often and water the seeds lightly as soon as the soil begins to become dry.


Watering the grass once each morning is usually enough, but your seeds may need to be watered more often if you live in a hot or windy climate.

, The seeds should germinate in about three weeks. After the seeds germinate, reduce the watering frequency but increase the amount of water given.


The amount of water you give your germinating seeds will depend on the type of grass you are trying to grow. Read the instructions that come with the seeds.

, Again, each type of grass will have its own specific instructions. Keep the grass mowed at the correct height and water it regularly to encourage a thick, healthy lawn and discourage weed growth.

, Fertilize the new grass six to eight weeks after it germinates. You do not water to fertilize the grass before this because the fertilizer could choke or damage the seeds. When you do fertilize the grass, use:


One pound of nitrogen fertilizer per 1,000 square feet.

Only water your lawn as much as necessary.,
Avoid spreading it.,
Fertilize your lawn.,
Keep your lawn mowed at a healthy height.,
Give things time.,
Mulch leaves into your lawn in autumn.,
De-thatch your lawn.,
Top-dress your yard to improve the soil quality.,
Apply a fungicide to your lawn.,
Try an organic fungicide.",How to Treat Lawn Fungus," The average yard only needs about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water once a week to stay healthy. Most fungi, including brown patch and pythium blight, thrive in moist conditions. Do not keep your lawn too dry, however, since dry soil will lead to weak grass subject to diseases like rust and mildew.









Water early in the morning. Your lawn can absorb all the water it needs and dry by the afternoon.;
, Dollar spot and several other fungal diseases spread within minimal effort. Avoid walking over the fungus and clean your yard tools after they touch the infected area.








, Grass that does not receive enough nitrogen and potassium can become weak, which makes it easier to catch a fungal disease and harder to fight off. Fertilizer does for sick lawns what vitamin C does for humans during a cold. A good dose of slow-release fertilizer can give your grass what it needs to begin its recovery from various fungi, such as red thread and rust.









Note that too many feedings can also weaken your lawn, however. It is best to apply fertilizer as instructed on the label.
Try using a low-nitrogen, slow-release fertilizer to prevent fungal diseases like gray snow mold. Even though grass deprived of nitrogen is susceptible to fungi, it is also easy to overdose your grass with nitrogen and weaken it that way.

, Raise your lawn mower blade to the highest setting and never trim away more than 1/3 of the grass height at a time. Your grass needs to stay thick and lush. Short grass is young grass, and young grass is tender and weak against fungi. Taller, older grass is stronger and stands a better chance of fighting back against disease.









Make sure you keep the blade sharp and clean. Dull blades do a sloppy job of cutting and may make the grass weaker. Dirty blades could spread lawn disease.
Mow your lawn a little shorter than usual before snow comes. Stubble spells death for your lawn during any season, but notably long grass during the winter may breed gray snow mold.

, Many fungal diseases go away on their own with proper lawn maintenance. Gray snow mold usually goes away once temperatures reach above 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), especially if the temperatures climb quickly. Likewise, red thread usually disappears by summer, when the weather heats up and dries out. Even though these diseases are unsightly, they do not always mean immediate death for your lawn.








, A thick coating of leaves could invite gray snow mold and other winter-bred fungi. Instead of allowing the leaves to pile up, remove them completely or use your lawnmower to mulch them into the grass.








, Thick build-ups of thatch—a layer of dead grass, leaves, roots, and stems—smother the soil, preventing it from breathing. Soil that lacks proper air circulation is more likely to get a fungal disease, so de-thatching is often used for preventative treatment. De-thatching can also stop the spread of some fungi, like necrotic ring spot, melting out, leaf smut, and summer patch, after it infects your lawn.








, Top-dressing is a layer of nutritional, well-draining growing medium. It often consists of materials like sharp sand to improve drainage, a crumbly soil like loam or topsoil, peat, or compost to provide extra nutrition. Spread the top-dressing over your lawn and rake it into the soil. The top-dressing will improve the soil's ability to drain, thereby fighting fungi.








, Usually, you need to apply a fungal control product once every other week, three times or more. Some fungi respond best to certain chemical treatments, however, while others do not respond to any at all. Before purchasing and applying a fungicide, you should determine what fungus your lawn has and which chemical can take care of it best.








Benomyl is potent against a range of fungi, including snow mold, brown patch, and dollar spot.
Triadimefon works well against anthracnose and rust.
Chlorothalonil does best against brown patch and red thread.
Fairy ring has no cure once it establishes itself in your lawn, and fungicides are only effective against necrotic ring spot if accompanied by a de-thatching process.

, If you prefer to stay away from chemical fungicides, many natural treatments can be used instead, especially while the fungus is still small. Neem oil, compost tea, and baking soda solutions are some of the most common.

Install a fence.,
Build a patio or deck.,
Put out a table and chairs.,
Set up flower pots.,
Buy a grill.",How to Use a Small Side Yard2," If you don’t already have a fence, consider installing one to make your space more private. If a fence isn’t possible, you can also plant hedges to create privacy. If you are renting or sharing a space, consult with your landlord or roommates before making any changes.A fence can be costly. Factor in the cost of supplies and labor if you don’t know how to build a fence on your own.

, You don’t have to cover the entire yard with a deck, but a small part of the yard is nice to off section for a patio. Lay down stones or build a wooden deck. It can be as small as just four feet in length if you don’t have a lot of space. Consider the shape of your yard when planning the patio. A long, narrow deck would be ideal for a long, narrow yard. , Look for a table and chair set to place on the deck. For a smaller area, look for a small table and two chairs to set on either side of the table. For a wider area, look for a square table with four chairs. You can have your meals, read, or enjoy a glass of wine at the table on nice days and evenings. The table and chairs directly on the ground, but for more stability, it is better to place them on a wooden deck or stones. You can purchase a wooden or pop up gazebo to place over the table for coverage during light rain or bright sun. Gazebos can be purchased for home improvement stores.
For an easy option, you can buy stones to lay down.

, Add some color to your yard by setting up flowers around it. You can buy some larger pots, small pots to put on tables, and if you have a place to them from, you can buy hanging pots. Look for perennial flowers, like coneflower, that will stay lovely and colorful all year long. Instead of flowers, you can also choose plants or herbs for the pots. Heuchera and ferns are plants that go well in containers. For herbs, lemon thyme and ‘Alaska’ nasturtium is well-suited for pots. Buy potting soil and fertilizer, then plant the flowers into the pots.

, Purchase a small grill for the patio area. A tabletop grill can be found to save space. Use the grill to entertain guests or cookout with a friend or your partner. Grills can be purchased at places like Walmart, many home improvement stores, and online."

Put out a table and chairs.,
Hang up a chalkboard.,
Install a sandbox.,
Set out a kiddie pool.,
Put out a box for toys.",How to Use a Small Side Yard3," Look for a kid-sized table and chair set. Set it up in a corner of your yard. The tables can be made new, purchased from a garage sale, or even built if you are particularly handy. Kids can sit at these tables to color, eat, or play with their toys on nice days.If you have extra room, look for an adult-sized table and chairs to put next to the table for kids.

, A chalkboard can be a great activity for kids that won’t take up a lot of space. A chalkboard can be attached to fence with a hammer and nails, or set up on a stand. The size of the chalkboard you use depends on the amount of space you have. Look for a chalkboard that is big enough for at least two children to draw on. A chalkboard can be purchased from a crafts store, or even a school supply shop.Set out a bucket of chalks and erasers next to the chalkboard. Bring it in during the night or when it rains.

, A sandbox can be a fun activity for children during the warmer months of the year. For a small yard, look for a small sandbox that can easily fit into a corner. If you can’t find a sandbox, one can be made out of a plastic or wooden box that isn’t very high on the sides. Purchase sand to fill the sandbox, and put in a few toys to play with, like buckets and shovels.Look for a cover to put over the sandbox for rainy weather.

, A kiddie pool can be placed in another corner, or next to the sandbox. If there is not enough room, you can opt to choose a kiddie pool over the sandbox. Kiddie pools can be purchased at most toy stores and supermarkets with a toy section. Look for one of the smallest pools you can find. It shouldn’t take up too much space.You can set out a sprinkler instead of a kiddie pool if you have limited space in your yard.
Fill it with water from the garden hose whenever your kids want to use it.

, A yard can get messy with children playing in it. Put out a box with a lid for their toys. Any type of box will do, though a plastic or wooden box is ideal because it can withstand weather. Ask your kids to put their outside toys into it when they are done playing."

Assess whether your lawn is due for aeration.,
Choose an aerator.,
Run the aerator over your lawn.

",How to Topdress a Lawn1," You should aerate your lawn every 2 to 3 years. This process removes small plugs of soil from the ground and allows new nutrients, soils, air and water to get to the roots of the existing plants. If your lawn is large, you may want to break it up into smaller segments and do a different one each year.;
, Rent an aerator if you don’t have one. You can find manual models, as well as models that you can pull behind a riding lawn mower. If you have a small lawn, you can even consider aerators that strap onto your shoes. You just walk around your lawn and poke holes in it with the soles of the aerators.

Assess what type of soil you have.,
Mix the topdressing in your wheelbarrow or some other large container.,
Use homemade compost only if you know that it has no weed seed in it.,
Make sure the sand is lime free.",How to Topdress a Lawn2," The type of soil you have determines how to topdress a lawn, because you want to balance out your soil. For example, a heavy clay soil should have plenty of sand added to the topdress material to provide additional drainage.

, A basic mix is 3 parts sand with 3 parts loam and 1 part peat. Adjust this to allow for your soil type. Work the mixture until it is as lump free as possible.

, Otherwise you may just be planting more weeds in your yard.

, Don’t use sea sand for topdressing.

Fill in low spots.,
Sow new grass seed in bare spots in your lawn after you topdress.",How to Topdress a Lawn3," Don’t worry if it’s not even at this point. Apply approximately 3 to 4 pounds (1.5 to 2 kilograms) of topdressing per square yard/meter. A good rule of thumb is to not have topdressing more than 1-inch thick in any spot.

, There should be no visible remaining top dress when you finish this step.

, Remember to leave the tips of the grass exposed to the air. If you put down too much topdress, remove it.

, The extra nutrients and fresh soil can help it germinate and take root quickly.

Check the pH one month later.",How to Spread Lime," To check for soil pH, and other soil properties, you need to use either a liquid test kit, which is comprised of tubes, an eyedropper, and testing solution, or a probe which you stick down into the soil. Probes and liquid tests kits seem to give about the same quality of reading, but probes can give out where liquid tests won’t. You can buy a basic probe or test kit fairly cheaply (around $10) at home improvement or garden stores., Before you purchase lime and start spreading it, you always want to make sure your soil needs it. This test will tell you what the pH of your soil is and whether or not it needs lime. A pH of between 6 and 7 is typically where your lawn will grow best. Lime corrects soil acidity by raising the pH, so if your soil tests below 6, it probably means you need to spread lime.Follow the specific testing guidelines on the product that you purchase.

, The basic home test will give you an idea if your soil is too acidic and needs lime, but it will not tell you exactly how much lime you need to raise the pH to the best spot. So it is also recommended to get a professional test done to find out how much lime your soil needs to correct the problem.Finding a soil testing lab near you may be a little difficult, but many labs allow you to send your sample in through the mail and they will send a report back. Both the University of Tennessee Extension and the University of Massachusetts take samples by mail, so a good option may be to contact a university near you and find out if they do soil testing. This process can take a week or so to complete.

, Once you have the professional test results on how acidic your soil is, this will guide you on how much lime to buy. As a general rule, regardless of soil acidity, 50 pounds of lime should cover about 1000 square feet (23 kg, 93 square meters) of land. Consider the size of the area you need to cover and buy with this rule in mind.Lime comes mainly in pellets or powder, and is categorized as calcitic or dolomitic. Dolomitic is typically best for lawn care because it is rich both in Calcium and Magnesium, prime nutrients for a healthy yard.

, If you already have a spreader, great. However, if this is your first time treating your yard, you will need to buy one. A spreader is a wheeled basin that distributes the lime as you push the spreader forward. There are two basic kinds: drop spreaders and rotary (broadcast) spreaders. Drop spreaders drop the mineral/chemical straight down through holes in the bottom of the basin and rotary spreaders use a mechanism to flip it in a broader circle. Drop spreaders tend to be more precise while rotary spreaders tend to be faster and cover more area.The choice of which kind is essentially up to you, but you may ask a few people you know, or an employee at the store, to see if they have a suggestion. If you have a large yard, the rotary spreader is probably the better choice since it covers more area. If you have a small yard and want a more precise spread, the drop spreader is probably best for you.

, It is recommended to use gloves anytime you handle lime because it can burn the skin a little. It is not mandatory to wear safety goggles, but it is also a good precaution to take just in case. If you are spreading the lime on a day that is windy at all, a basic breathing mask is also recommended. While lime has not been found to be toxic to people or animals, it can irritate the skin so best to keep your skin, eyes, and mouth covered. Never spread lime by hand, even with gloves on. It is less effective than a spreader, anyway, but is also not a safe practice.Keep your kids away from the yard when you are spreading the lime, and off of the yard for a couple days while the lime sets. While lime has not been found to cause illness or death, it can often irritate the skin, so best to be cautious.
Lime has also not been found to be toxic to animals, but it is best to keep pets off of the yard for a couple days, as well.

, This is not a mandatory step, as you may not have the time or option for this, but it is recommended. By tilling your yard before spreading the lime, you make it easier for the lime to really get down into the soil. While it is perfectly fine to simply lay the lime out on the surface of the yard, it will have more contact with the soil if you till the ground first.This is best achieved by a motor-powered rototiller, but you could also use a hand tiller or shovel to turn over the soil throughout the yard.

, Set the spreader on concrete when you fill it, and pour the lime into the basin of the spreader. Check if there is a specific fill line, and if not, leave about an inch from the top empty. Read the instructions on both the lime and the spreader, and set the spread rate appropriately. If there is a half-rate setting, use this because you will be making two passes at the yard., The shape of your yard will determine the exact pattern you lay the lime in, but the main idea is to make sure you cover the entire yard. A good place to start is to walk the entire perimeter of the area you want to cover. This outline strip will give you a buffer for making turns at the end of a strip., For the first pass of the yard, walk straight lines back and forth from one end of the yard to the other end. To maintain straight lines, try to keep the wheels of the spreader in the wheel marks you made on each previous pass. If your yard is irregularly shaped, you may struggle to keep the lines “straight,” but do your best to keep each line following the pattern of the line you made just before it. Always start pushing the spreader before you squeeze the lever that opens the bottom.


If you start to run low on lime in the basin, don’t shake it. Simply leave the spreader where you are and go get more lime to refill it.
Be sure to use the half-rate setting, since you will make double coverage of the yard. If there is not specifically a half rate, it’s best to go with something lower than half.

, Now you will walk lines that run perpendicular to the first set of lines you made, crossing that set. This technique will help give you even coverage across the whole yard, covering any bare spots you might have left the first time.You don’t want to overdo it with lime, so only make two passes over the lawn.
If you have followed the instructions on the lime and on the spreader, you should have the right amount. People tend to say that there isn’t a good way to correct if you put too much in one spot, so you just have to let the lime set over time and it will balance out.

, Lime is a slow acting mineral, so it will take months to work its way into your soil no matter what. But to speed the process initially, lightly watering the whole yard is a good way to help the lime start soaking down into the soil. Any particles that are stuck to the blades of grass will be washed down into the soil. You don’t want to flood the yard by any means. Just give it enough of a watering to dampen the top of the soil., Raising the pH of your lawn is not an exact and immediate process. You may need to apply lime more than once if your soil is very acidic and the pH needs to be raised more. After one month, run another pH test to see whether or not the soil could use more lime.


Keep in mind that it does take about six months for the soil to really change pH, so your second test may not show up too differently. Balancing your yard’s pH completely could take 2 years.

Care for lawns in winter.",How to Take Care of Your Lawn," Cool, humid, low-wind conditions distribute water evenly and reduce loss to evaporation. Ideal conditions usually occur between 10pm and midnight, or between 8am and 9am.Some local water departments forbid night watering to prevent waste from sprinklers left on all night.;
, Your watering schedule should be based on grass species, lawn health, heat, and soil conditions. Cool season grasses (bluegrass, ryegrass, fescues) generally need 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.8cm) per week, rising to 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) in hot, dry weather.Drought-resistant warm season grasses (buffalo grass, blue grama) can last for weeks without watering, even in the summer.Once you have a good guess for how much water your lawn needs each week, read the next step to find out how to divide it among watering sessions.


A local university extension website can teach you how much watering your grass species needs in local weather conditions.
To track the amount of water you're using, leave cans or other open containers on your lawn.
Shaded grass usually needs less water, but this may not be true if it's competing with tree and shrub roots.

, This approach encourages root growth, which increases resistance to drought and disease. Each watering session should moisten the soil down to the depth of the lowest existing roots, which tend to be at least six inches (15cm) for a healthy lawn.The drainage rate varies greatly based on soil. Check the depth of moisture 30–60 minutes after watering, or follow this rough guide:Sandy soil drains fast, and may only need 0.5 in. (1.25cm) of water to reach a 6 inch (15cm) depth. The lawn has less time to absorb this water, so water more frequently to make up for it.
Loamy soil takes roughly 0.75 inch (1.9cm) of water to reach a 6 inch (15cm) depth.
Dense clay soil drains slowly, and may need 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.8cm) water to reach 6 inch (15cm) depth.

, Don't wait until your lawn is brown before you give it more water. Check for wilting, a change in color (becoming more grey, purple, or blue), and for footprints that stay visible for an hour or more.Letting your lawn reach this state actually increases long term health, but water shortly afterward, before the grass turns brown.You can also dig into the soil to see how dry it is. Never water before the top two inches (5cm) of soil have dried out.If the lawn dries in a few spots, just water those areas extra.

, Cool seasons grasses typically go dormant in hot weather, turning brown but ready to revive when cool weather returns. It is possible to prevent this with heavy watering, but once it goes dormant, do not try to revive it until hot weather passes. The grass spends a lot of energy on revival, leaving it vulnerable and weak if it revives and goes dormant more than once a year.While the grass is dormant in hot water, give it 0.25–0.5 inches (6–12mm) water per week., Your grass does not need nearly as much water while it is not actively growing, typically late fall to early spring. If weather is dry, you may still need to water once every 4–6 weeks.Do not water while the ground is frozen.
Areas of shallow soil and exposed slopes are more likely to dry. Check south and west facing slopes especially (north and east facing in the southern hemisphere).

, Tall grass makes for a much healthier lawn. Never cut your lawn below two inches (5cm), and keep it at 2.5–3.5 inches (6.4–8.9cm) if you can stand it.Older lawn care guides may recommend different heights for different seasons. Most modern experts agree that grass should be left tall year-round., Cutting away more than ⅓ of the grass height seriously damages your grass. If you miss a mowing session and the grass is far too tall, remove ⅓ of the grass, then wait a few days before cutting it down to the desired height.You may need to cut fast-growing species every three or four days during ideal spring conditions.


For example, if the goal height is 2 inches (5cm), don't let the grass grow taller than 3 in. (7.5cm) before mowing. If the goal is 3 inches (7.6cm), don't let it get above 4.5 in (11.4cm).

, Avoid mowing during the hottest part of the day, when grass is vulnerable.Also avoid mowing while the grass is wet. Wet clippings clump on the lawn instead of getting evenly distributed, some mowers are less efficient, and the slippery grass can be dangerous for the mower operator., Grass clippings decompose quickly and provide nutrients for the lawn. You may use them elsewhere in your garden instead, but grass treated with herbicides and pesticides should not be used on flowers or vegetables.Grass clippings do not contribute to thatch, as is commonly believed.

, Dull mower blades shred the grass blades, leaving them ragged and vulnerable to further damage. An annual sharpening is usually fine for a home lawn, but sharpening several times a season is best if the mower is heavily used.

, Once your lawn stops growing, remove an extra 0.5–1 inch (1.25–2.5 cm) on the final mow. This helps prevent matted grass and snow mold over the winter., Choose a product with about 30–50% slow release fertilizer.If you can't find a mix, go with a slow-release fertilizer for your home lawn. This has a less dramatic effect, but has less risk of burning your lawn or causing excessive growth.Slow release fertilizers are also called timed release or insoluble fertilizers. They include urea foam, IBDU, and WIN.
Fast release fertilizers include urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate.

, Nitrogen is the most important nutrient you can add to your lawn. The first of the three numbers on the fertilizer tell you the percentage of nitrogen it contains. This should be the highest number, with the ideal ratio around 3:1:2 or 4:1:2.For example, a 9-3-6 fertilizer has a ratio of 3:1:2.

, Fertilizer made from animal or plant products decompose into proteins and carbohydrates that feed earthworms and microbes on your lawn. Keeping these populations healthy ensures well-aerated soil and fast decomposition of grass clippings.Organic fertilizers are also less likely to damage your lawn than synthetic products., All lawns need at least one fertilization a year to prevent water runoff and improve health.Past that, it's up to your how much effort you want to put in. Here are three approaches, from the easiest to the most effective:


Fertilize once a year, applying 1 lb nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (0.5 kg / 100 m2). Late fall is ideal, but never during frost, snowy or soaked ground, or a heat wave following a frost.Fertilize every 8–10 weeks from spring to fall, using 0.5–1 lb nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (0.25–0.5 kg / 100 m2) each time.Skip one of these if you leave grass clippings on your lawn after each mow.
Look at a local university agriculture extension website for a guide that matches your grass species and climate.

, The easy approach is to adjust your fertilizer spreader, which should come with instructions. Use the setting listed for 1lb nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (0.5 kg / 100 m2). For a more accurate measure, use this calculation instead:


Find the nitrogen percentage on your fertilizer packaging and convert to decimals. (For example, a 24-8-16 fertilizer is 24% nitrogen → 0.24.)
Multiply this by the number of pounds of fertilizer per bag to get the pounds of nitrogen per bag. (0.24 nitrogen x 20 lb bag = 4.8 lb nitrogen per bag)
Divide your lawn size by (1,000 x your answer). (2,880 sq ft lawn ÷ 4,800 = 0.6 bags will fertilize your lawn).
Pour that amount of fertilizer in your spreader and set it to a light setting. Walk around your lawn evenly until it runs out.

, The main goals are applying fertilizer evenly to avoid uneven color, and preventing spread outside the lawn. Accidentally fertilizing flowerbeds and vegetable beds may damage the plants, and letting fertilizer run off to storm drains and water sources causes environmental damage. Here's are guides for the two main types of spreader:Drop spreaders are more precise, spreading less fertilizer outside the lawn. Minimize ""striping"" by setting to half strength and crossing the lawn in two paths, at 90º angles.
Broadcast (rotary) spreaders are more efficient for large lawns, but must be kept at least 10 ft (3m) from water sources and lawn edges. To apply evenly, space applications so 30% of the spreader range overlaps.

, A lawn aerator, available from tool rental companies, removes plugs of soil from your lawn to improve aeration and drainage. For a home lawn, one aeration each fall is usually enough. Aerate when the ground is soft enough to penetrate, but a little on the dry side to prevent compaction.Ideally, the machine should remove plugs about 2–3 inches (5–7.5cm) long, 0.5–0.75 in (1.25–1.9cm) in diameter. Pass over the lawn once or twice, or until there are eight or nine plugs per square foot (88-99 per m2).Leave the plugs on the lawn to decompose. If they're taking too long, break them up by dragging metal objects over the grass, or collect them to compost., Thatch is the spongy mat of roots and stems that build up on the lawn surface. Once it reaches 0.5 in (1.25 cm) thick, it will grow rapidly and prevent drainage and aeration. There are several ways to remove existing thatch:The best way to remove thatch is additional core aeration, described above.
Rent a dethatching machine to remove thatch less than 0.5 in (1.25 cm) thick. Do this only in early fall or late spring, when weather is cool and there are several weeks of growth left.
Run a power rake over the lawn, frequently and shallowly. Deep power raking can cause damage.

, If thatch grows rapidly, try these fixes right after removing the existing thatch:Topdress the lawn with a ⅛ in (3mm) sprinkle of soil, using the same soil as the lawn.

Conduct a soil test and adjust pH until it is between 6.0 and 7.0, or as recommended for your grass species. Add calcium carbonate lime to raise lawn pH, or sulfur to lower it.Reduce use of pesticides, which may be killing earthworms that break down thatch.

, If water floods your lawn or runs off into surrounding areas, give the lawn half as much water as you currently use per session. Let the water drain for one hour, then give the lawn the rest of the water.This is usually a problem for dense clay soil and slopes.


Commercial wetting agents added to the water will reduce runoff, but won't fix a serious problem.
If your lawn is seriously compacted or has a thick layer of thatch, aerate the yard as described above.

, Dew will not harm your grass, but ""guttation"" will. This is the formation of sugary water droplets along the blade edge, which attract disease and pests. To get rid of these, drag a hose or whipping pole over the surface, or hose them off with a brief spray., If your grass does poorly in shade make these adjustments to shaded areas:Water less frequently but very deeply.
Fertilize ⅓ or ½ as much as the sunny areas.
Mow to 3 inches (7.5 cm) or higher.
Reduce foot traffic.

, Minimize lawn use during frosts, when the lawn is vulnerable. If you need to break up ice, use as little salt as possible. Calcium chloride products are safer than sodium chloride or salt-laden snow.Never use fertilizers to break up ice, as they will run off along with snowmelt and pollute water sources.
Stick to light use in early spring until the grass dries out and revives. If there are bare spots, seed them early before weeds take hold.

Choose durable plants that can tolerate foot traffic.,
Go with plants suitable for your light exposure and climate.,
Mix up your selections for healthier, more beautiful landscaping.,
Avoid invasive and aggressive plants.,
Remove all grass from the planting area.,
Loosen up the existing soil.,
Till peat moss into the soil.,
Spread low-nitrogen fertilizer over the planting area.,
Create a three-foot wide planting strip using bark mulch.,
Space each plant at recommended intervals.,
Continue planting in three-foot strips to fill the planting area.,
Care for your groundcovers.",How to Replace Your Lawn with Groundcovers," Before replacing your lawn with groundcovers, make sure your new plants can handle some foot traffic. If the space needs to be durable enough for rougher activities, like your children or pets playing, a hardscaped area might be your best bet.Pacific beach strawberry, for instance, is a hardy perennial groundcover native across nearly the entire North American Pacific coast. It’ll tolerate being walked on, but isn’t great for recreational activities.If you need spots for heavy foot traffic or outdoor playing, consider using permeable hardscapes, such as decomposed granite, mulch, or gravel.;
, Observe your yard over the course of the day, and note which areas receive the most sun and which remain shaded. Choose plants that are marked best for full sun, partial sun, or shade for the appropriate areas.For example, Moss phlox loves sunlight and, as a bonus, produces flowers that attract butterflies. For shaded areas, consider a vine or ivy native to your location, like Virginia creeper, which is native from Quebec and Ontario to Central America.Your local home improvement store or nursery will carry groundcovers with various light preferences that thrive in your climate. If you have any questions, ask them about the best perennial choices for your sunlight exposure and hardiness zone.

, Choosing various species will help you fill areas that receive various levels of sunlight. You can also add interest by mixing low growing plants with taller shrubs and bushes. In addition to improving aesthetics, planting various species of groundcover will help reduce the risks of pests, diseases, and weeds., Consult your local nursery or home improvement store’s garden section about plants that are considered invasive in your area. You can also search online to see where a particular species is native and where it’s invasive.For example, Creeping Jenny and English Ivy are both considered invasive in locations across the eastern United States. They might grow quickly and provide quick coverage, but they’ll push out your other groundcover choices and change your native soil’s chemistry.

, When you’ve chosen your groundcovers, prepare your planting area by first getting rid of anything growing in your existing lawn. Use a grub hoe to strip away any grass or weeds. Shovel the plant matter into lawn bags and discard., Use a roto-tiller to work through and loosen the soil. Dig through your yard in strips and loosen the topsoil about six inches deep.A power roto-tiller is your best option. If you don’t have one, the most affordable choice would be to rent one from your nearby home improvement store.

, After you’ve loosened the top six inches of soil, improve its quality by mixing in a layer of peat moss. Use a shovel to spread one to two inches of peat moss across the planting area. Then use the roto-tiller to blend it with the existing soil., Spread a thin layer of fertilizer by hand onto your planting area. Sprinkling a thin, consistent dusting will do just fine; you don’t have to pack on a thick layer. Most groundcovers will grow best in low-nitrogen conditions, but you should double check your selected plants’ labels to be sure., Use a rake to spread out mulch of your choice in a three-foot wide strip across your yard. Go for a depth between one and two inches. If your planting area has any incline, it’s best to work from the top of the incline first and proceed downhill.Mulch will help the soil retain moisture and discourage weed growth.

, Use a trowel to dig a hole just large enough to accommodate a seedling. Your selected plants’ labels will recommend a distance to keep between each plant. A typical distance will be between six and ten inches, but you can modify your interval based on your budget and expectations.If you want to keep cost low, purchase fewer plants and increase the distance between seedlings. For instant coverage, a 15 by 20 foot space (4.6 by 6 meters) requires about 300 plants planted only a few inches apart. If you can wait a year or two, you can use a fraction of that number, plant seedlings ten to twelve inches apart, and wait for them to develop coverage., Once you’ve finished planting across the first strip, start the next one using the same sequence. Shovel mulch around where the first strip left off and use a rake to spread it in an even three-foot strip an inch or two in depth. Plant your seedlings in this strip, then continue repeating the process until you’ve completed your planting area., General care for your plants should be minimal, but will depend on the species you choose. For example, the seedlings' information sticks or labels will let you know how often they'll need to be watered. Typically, your new plants will need a thorough watering two or three times a week for the first several weeks, or until they start to develop coverage and establish themselves.Choosing plants native to your location will decrease the need for watering. Since they're adapted for your location's climate, rainfall will be enough to sustain them once they've established their roots.

Determine if you really need to replace your timer.,
Write down the existing program on the old controller.,
Unplug the transformer from the wall (flat square plug similar to a cell phone charger) or turn off the power to the controller at the breaker.,
Disconnect the field wires from the controller and label each one with a piece of tape.,
Here is a guide to how to label the wires:


The two most important wires to pay attention to are the COMMON and (if your system is run by a pump without a pressure tank) the PUMP START WIRE.,
Replace your timer with the same model and brand as you already have on your system.,
Frequently, all the field wires will be a different color.,
Unscrew the old controller from the wall and mount the new one.,
Re-connect the power wires and turn on the breaker or plug in the transformer.,
Note that our system controller should be properly functioning and ready for programming.",How to Replace a Lawn Sprinkler Timer," If the timer has no power it might be circuit board failure (go ahead and replace the timer) or it might simply be a transformer failure (just replace the transformer). However, it might be a blown fuse due to a short in a field wire or solenoid, and your timer might be fine for a few more years.;
, Include in your notes what days to water, what time to start watering, and how long for each station (zone). You can change the program later if you would like.

, Do not go any further until you are absolutely certain that there is no electrical power to the controller. If unsure, check the power input wires with a voltmeter, or call a licensed electrician. Electrical power can seriously injure or kill you. Once you are certain you have disconnected the power, go to step #3. The wires that control the sprinkler valves are inside the controller. Now you must remove the face of the timer to manage the valve wires.

, As you remove each one, label each piece of tape

,
The common terminal in the controller is usually marked by the letter “C”.
The pump start terminal will be labeled either “PS” (for pump start) or “MV” (for Master Valve). NOTE: if you have a mechanical controller that you change zones by toggling the ON/OFF switch, you will have only two wires going out of the timer


, Even if you do not run your system with a pump, you may still have a master valve; therefore, label it.

, This makes things easier. Simply write down which color wire relates to which terminal, (example: white is common. Red is Zone 1. Green is Zone 2, etc.).

, Take care to mount it in a position that will accommodate the existing wire. If the existing wires are too short to reach the connections for the new controller, you can extend the wires and place the splices in a junction box. NOTE: If you are using a junction box outside your house, use a waterproof junction box.

, Next, connect your zone field wires and test that every zone comes on. If you have a rain sensor (you should get one if you don’t have one on your sprinkler system already), the connection for the common and PS/MV will be different. The rain sensor will have two wires. It acts as a switch between the common and the PS/MV wires and the valve/field wires.


If you do not have PS/MV wire: Connect one of the two rain sensor wires to the common wire. Connect the other rain sensor wire to the common terminal. If your controller came with pre-installed rain sensor terminals, use those instead.
If you do have a PS/MV wire: Instead of connecting the rain sensor between the common wire and the common terminal, connect it between the PS/MV wire and the PS/MV terminal instead. This will prevent either the pump or the master valve from coming on after it rains. This is especially important in regards to pumps operated by a pump start. You do not want a pump running against as “dead head”. This means that a running pump needs to be able to discharge water or damage to the pump can occur.


, Referring to your program notes you wrote down from Step #1 (information from the old controller), program your new controller."

Lay sod after watering the ground.,
Fertilize the sod no later than 2 weeks after installing it.,
Check for any signs of disease, such as fungus, within 3 days of sod installation.,
Follow a watering schedule for your sod based on the time of year it is installed.,
Mow the sod.",How to Take Care of Sod,";
,

Avoid using a chemical fertilizer as this could result in burnt sod. An organic fertilizer, such as Milorganite or Ironite, is recommended.






Spread the fertilizer by hand and rake into the sod, or use a seed spreader to apply the fertilizer.






Continue to use fertilizer once per month.







,

Cease watering the sod for 1 day and apply a fungicide to the sod at the first signs of disease.






Choose a granular or spray fungicide sold at any gardening center. Granules can be spread by hand or seed spreader. In severe cases of fungicide, a lawn care company with commercial products might need to be utilized.







,


Water twice a day for the first 3 days, then once a day for the next week to 10 days if sod is installed in hot weather (over 80 degrees F or 26 degrees C). After that, water every other day for a week, then every third day for the next week.
Change the watering schedule to twice a day for the first 2 days, then once a day for 4 days if sod is installed in cooler weather (under 80 degrees F or 26 degrees C). After the first week, water every other day in Week Two, every third day in Week Three, and once every 4 days in Week Four.
Adjust amount of water applied during the above cycles. In the beginning, apply 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of water. As application times decrease, soak the sod with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water during each watering period.
Check that the water is saturating the ground beneath the sod.

, Mow for the first time two weeks after installation and if sod is about 4 inches (10.2 cm) or higher.

Do not cut more than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) during each mowing.






Keep the grass at about 2 inches (5.1 cm) high.

Decide when it is time to put your mower and other gasoline powered lawn tools away for the winter.,
Thoroughly clean the tool.,
Allow the fuel level in the gas tank to run as low as possible so any remaining fuel can be burned up by allowing the engine to idle briefly.,
Run the engine until it dies from lack of fuel.,
Remove the air filter/filter assembly, as required to access the carburetor throat/intake.,
Remove the spark plug and position the plug wire as far from the intake as possible.,
Check the tires, mower deck, belts, pulleys, and other attachments to make sure they are in good condition.,
Cover the engine with a plastic sheet or an old table cloth.",How to Winterize Lawn Care Equipment," Preparing them for winter storage is a waste of time, if the following week, a warm spell has the grass growing again, but usually a lawn will go dormant after the first significant frost.;
, For a mower, this means cleaning underneath the mower deck, as well as around the engine compartment and any accessories (leaf bagger, drive gears, etc).  Don't spray water on engine parts that can corrode and cause problems later, or around the carburetor or air intake, doing so is just asking for trouble.

, Some recommend leaving the tank completely full to prevent condensation from forming in the tank, but storing any gasoline engine powered device in a shed or garage with a full fuel tank is not a safe practice.

, This will leave only a small residue of unburnt fuel in the intake and carburetor, which will be dealt with later.

,  If any dust or debris has collected around the filter assembly, close the carburetor throat and use compressed air to blow it clean before proceeding.

, While an assistant pulls the crank rope (or operates the starter, if equipped) spray fogging oil into the carb throat so that it coats the cylinder wall, bore, piston, and intake manifold. Four or five quick shots of fogging oil and several pulls of the rope should do the trick. Replace the air filter with a new one, if needed, otherwise, reassemble it to keep trash and bugs out of your engine.

, Unhook the battery (if equipped) and place it on a trickle charger long enough to make sure it is fully charged. It is generally a good idea to store a lead acid battery where moderate temperatures are maintained, if possible, but do not store where the terminals can be accidentally shorted out, it can be knocked over, or directly on a concrete floor.

, Secure it loosely to prevent dust and debris from covering it, and park it in a garage or shed for the winter months.

Choose an appropriate storage space.,
Clean the piano.,
Cover the piano.,
Protect the piano.,
Check the piano regularly if in long-term storage.",How to Store a Piano," If the piano is going from a heated environment into a cool or cold one, or vice versa, give it a chance to acclimatize. Any sudden cooling or sudden heating will harm the piano.;
, The piano must be kept dry and generally cool. Avoid placing it anywhere that is damp, moist, or humid. If you do, the piano will begin to deteriorate rapidly.

, Wipe it down the remove the dust and give it a good polish.

, Another enemy of the piano is dust getting into its inner workings. When stored, the piano should be fully covered.

, Prior to adding a cover, wrap the piano in blankets to protect it from knocks and bangs in storage and when being shifted. The blankets can be tied into place with string or yarn., If you see signs of damage, you can get them treated upon checking rather than leaving it to completely fall into disrepair.

Understand how a manual (stick) lawn edger works.,
Learn how to operate a manual lawn edger.,
Understand how a motorized lawn edger works.",How to Use a Lawn Edger1," A stick lawn edger is usually a wooden or metal pole (like a rake handle) with a semi-circular (or square) blade at the end. It looks a little like a straight hoe or a very small shovel.


This is a manual tool and it’s best to apply pressure using your foot, so make sure you are wearing solid-sole shoes or boots when using the tool.
It’s best to do this when the ground is fairly moist as it will be easier to cut through than dry earth. Avoid edging your beds in winter when the ground is likely to be frozen hard and difficult to work.;
, To use a stick lawn edger, mark out where you want to make the new edge of the lawn. Stick the edger in the ground to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).


Put your foot on it, holding the stick firmly. Push down with your foot to cut through the soil. You can rock gently to cut through the turf. Push the handle forward and back slightly to loosen the cut edge away from the rest of the turf.
It’s helpful to pry the cut area open slightly so you can see where you've worked. Now move the tool blade a few inches to the side and cut the next piece away. Continue until you have edged the entire bed.

, It’s best to check manufacturer’s instructions for your particular model. In most cases your power tool will have two settings: one to trim the grass and one to trench edge or cut the turf.


In some cases you can set the depth to cut. Make sure you get the settings right before you begin.
You’ll need to mark out the area to cut in a way that is visible when using the bulky machine.

Write ""Return to Sender"" on the exterior of the envelope.,
Place a sticky note on your mailbox.,
Cross out the barcode.,
Approach your mail carrier directly.",How to Stop Mail for Previous Residents1," Then place the mail in an outgoing mailbox. This notifies the post office and the original sender that the recipient no longer lives at that address. Hopefully, the original sender will update the records, and you will stop receiving the mail.You can also write ""No Longer at This Address"" or ""Moved"" on the exterior of the previous resident's mail.
Individuals sending mail and small companies are more likely to respond to this. Large companies rely on the National Change of Address database for address updates.;
, State ""does not live at this address"" on either the door or the mailbox itself. This serves as a constant reminder to the postal carrier to look through your incoming mail, and possibly sift out the previous resident's mail.


Leave a more precise note if the first one you placed inside your mailbox does not seem to be effective.
You can write ""No Other Tenants Besides "" on a sticky note in your mailbox or on your door. The mail carrier might see the previous resident's name on mail and know not to place that mail in your box. A visual reminder can be a strong one.

, Sometimes writing ""Return to Sender"" does not get the job done because of the automated system the postal service uses. The United States Postal Service prints a barcode on every piece of mail that corresponds to the address it is being delivered to. USPS uses these barcodes to sort the mail. Even if you have written a note on the envelope, the barcode will still allow the mail to come to your address. Mark through the barcode at the bottom of the envelope and write ""Return to Sender"" on the mail.Marking out the barcode will cause the system to register the mail as ""undeliverable.""
Mail carriers receive mail in bundles for each individual address. The previous resident's mail could be in between pieces of mail that are actually for you.

, Speak to your personal postal carrier or the local post office about the problem and ask that they please stop previous resident's mail that arrives in your mailbox. Give your mail carrier some of the mail you have written ""Return to Sender"" on. This may be more effective then simply writing a note on the piece of mail.Speaking with your mail carrier in person may encourage them to look into the matter and check and see if a change of address has been filed.
When you go to the post office, ask to speak to the station manager and tell them your problem.

Mark out the location of the new bed.,
Make a second cut, approximately one inch inside the first.,
Remove the strip of turf and dig up the rest of the bed.",How to Use a Lawn Edger2," To create a new planting bed, you first need to decide where to put it.


Make sure you aren't going to be digging where there are power or water lines or where there needs to be manhole access to sewer pipes.
It’s best not to site a plant bed in a marshy area where puddles form and don’t easily drain away after rain. If you have this poor drainage issue, you’ll just need to improve the soil or raise the bed before putting a bed there.

, Mark out where you want your bed to go using string and pegs (this is best for square or oblong beds), chalk, or a spray can of paint.


Use your lawn edger to define the edges of the bed and make it easy to start digging it up. Start on the outside of the area you have marked.
Following the instructions provided in the section above for using your edging tool, use your lawn edger to define the edges of the new bed.

, Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed’s edge, return to the start of your turf cut. Now you want to make another cut about one inch inside the area of the new bed.


Make the second cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to make a thin strip of turf for easy removal.

, Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees.


If you've made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long one inch wide strip of turf easily.
Now take a spade and remove the remaining turf from inside the new bed area. You’ll need to dig over and improve the soil ahead of planting.

Redefine the edges of you flowerbeds only when necessary.,
Cut a fresh edge approximately one inch from the original one.,
Remove the cut strip of turf.",How to Use a Lawn Edger3," Over time your lawn borders may get a little messy. This is likely when you live in an area with chalky or sandy soil or if you've had a lot of traffic on your lawn that has damaged the edges.


When this happens, you can redefine the edges of your lawn using an edging tool. However, you shouldn't be tempted to do this too often because your beds will grow a little each time you redefine the edges.
If your edges are often messy, consider using an edging material to keep them as they are.

, Use one of the edging tools as described above to cut a fresh edge about one inch back from the old edge. If your lawn edge has been damaged a lot, you may need to make this slightly wider.


Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed one inch from its old location, go back to the start and cut on the bed side of the strip.
Cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to sever a thin strip of turf for easy removal.

, Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees. If you've made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long strip of turf easily to define the new, neater edges.


If you are mulching your beds, rake out the mulch to fill the slightly wider area of bed you have now created.

Do not open the mail.,
Do not throw the mail away.,
Do not fill out a change of address.",How to Stop Mail for Previous Residents2," It is a federal offense, in the US, to open and read mail that is not addressed to you. If you accidentally open the mail, tape the envelope and write ""return to sender"" or ""wrong address"" on the envelope and place it back in the mailbox. If you throw the mail away after you open it, you are obstructing the delivery of that person's mail.You can serve up to 5 years in prison or pay a hefty fine for opening someone else's mail in some countries.
Opening someone else's mail is considered theft., Throwing away someone else's mail is another form of mail theft because you are keeping the other person from getting the mail and guaranteeing that the person will never receive it.In addition to being a Federal crime, throwing away the mail is counterproductive and will not solve your problem.


If you always throw the mail away, the sender may never find out that the person no longer lives at that address.
Keep in mind that the person may have filed a change of address and there has been a mistake. The person likely still wants their mail. Be courteous and help the person out.

, It may be tempting to redirect the mail of the previous resident. Even if you know where the previous resident now lives, do not file a change of address form with the postal service. You must be the previous resident, executor, guardian, authorized officer, or agent to file a change of address.Filing the form on behalf of the resident is a Federal crime. You could be fined or go to prison.
If you file the change of address for the other person, a Customer Notification Letter will be sent to their new address.This could get you in a lot of trouble.

It should take about 3 months for the changes to take place.This may not stop you from receiving junk mail addressed to them completely, but it should cut down on the amount.
You will need to enter the deceased person's name, their address, your name, email address, and relationship to the deceased person., Then place the mail back in your mailbox. This will notify the post office and the original sender that the person is deceased. Also, notify the mail carrier that this previous resident is deceased.


If this does not work, make a visit to the post office to speak with the station manager.
Take the deceased person's mail to the post office with you. The post office may be able to forward the mail to a new address or to the deceased person's estate.

, If the mail you are receiving is not quite junk mail such as magazines, charities, or subscription services, contact the company directly and let them know the person is deceased.This is more time consuming but will get the job done. You can still write ""deceased, return to sender"" on these items as well if you do not want to contact the company directly.


Registering the person through the Direct Marketing Association will not stop magazine and subscription services from sending mail. Only companies that use marketing and mailing lists will receive the notification.Opening and reading a deceased person's mail is still a crime.

Get a spiral notebook, a roll of masking tape, a pen, a Sharpie, and some sheets of labels.,
Make a list of all the rooms in your new home: dining room, kitchen, master bedroom, etc.,
Using masking tape, make tabs for your spiral notebook that match the categories you just created.,
Take a sheet of labels for each of your rooms, and write on the labels K-1, K-2, K-3, etc.,
Pack your first box.,
Now, on the page of your notebook for that room (for example, your K section for kitchen), write the box number and detailed information about the contents.,
Seal the box and slap a pre-made label or two on it.,
When you get to your new home, make signs to put on every door so the people unloading know where everything goes without you telling them.",How to Stay Organized when Moving," Remember lots of big boxes and high-quality packing tape to seal them with.;
, Now decide on a one-letter abbreviation for each room. Kitchen is K, dining room is D, etc. Be careful not to call two rooms by the same letter -- if you have a dining room and a den, you will need to call one D and one something else, like S for study. Don't forget the basement, attic and garage if applicable.

, Make sure each section has 3-4 pages in it. Tear off a piece of masking tape and stick it on either side of the first page of a section, then use the pen to write the one-letter abbreviation on it.

, If you want to be really organised, pack the most important things in the boxes marked K-1 and K-2. For best results, make two identical labels for each box, so that at least two sides will be labeled.

, It will help if you don't pack all that clutter that you really don't need. Don't pack it, just throw it away. Think of packing as a chance to have a clear out.

, For example: ""K-1 -- Round serving tray, fragile glass butter dish, coffee mugs, spatulas and muffin pan."" Don't write things like ""kitchen stuff"" or ""pans"" unless all of your kitchen stuff or pans are in that box. You want detail, so that when you are searching for your special asparagus pot, you don't have to open a dozen boxes labelled ""pots"" just to find it.

, Voila!

, For example, if ""L"" stands for ""Living room"" then print a large sheet of paper with the words ""L -- Living Room"" and tape it to the door frame of that bedroom. Then you do not have to stand there directing people and the movers do not have to guess which room is which. You can also use index cards taped to the floor with words like ""sofa"" or ""piano"" to indicate where certain furniture goes.

2–4 chinch bugs per can: low-level infestation. Improve lawn health and test again later. Treat immediately if your lawn is in poor health.
0–1 chinch bug per can: no treatment necessary. If your lawn is in poor health, there is probably another cause.
Alternatively, you might also take a close look at the lawn with a magnifying glass.;
, This can be effective if you catch the chinch bug infestation early, before they've spread throughout your lawn:Rake the lawn vigorously for 2 ft (60 cm) on all sides of the damaged area, toward the center.
Vacuum the damaged area and surroundings.
Water thoroughly.

, Insecticidal soaps are considered safe and appropriate for organic farming. A homemade soap treatment is actually more likely to damage your garden, but pure castille soap or mild Ivory or Dawn products (not extra-strength, grease-cutting, or anti-bacterial) are usually safe in a solution of 2½ tbsp dishwashing liquid per 1 gallon water (40 mL per 4 L).Mix in a clean sprayer, then shake or stir vigorously to combine. If using an insecticidal soap, dilute it following label instructions instead.


This method also works best if you catch the infestation early and use it to target small areas of lawn.
If you have hard water in your area, the soap may fail to mix in, leaving a scum on the surface after the water settles. If this happens, make a new mix using distilled or bottled water instead.Using a commercial insecticidal soap for chinch bugs is not legal in Canada, although this may just be an oversight. Homemade soap treatments are allowed.Any soap can cause damage to aquatic life. Do not apply it where the water could run off into a storm drain.

, Drench the damaged area of your lawn using a spray bottle or hose attachment. For best results, do this on a cool, still morning or evening. In windy or hot weather (especially above 90ºF / 32ºC), there is a much higher chance of damaging your plants.Try to avoid getting the soap in contact with nearby plants. Some trees and flowers are particularly vulnerable to soap damage, especially during times of drought.If you're concerned about potential damage, test a corner of your lawn first and check on it after 24 hours.

, The chinch bugs will run for cover and get caught in the nap of the flannel. Return after ten or fifteen minutes to vacuum the pests off the sheet, or drown them by putting the sheet in a bucket of water., Monitor your lawn to check for more chinch bugs or expanding damage. If necessary, repeat the soap treatment once a week, or once every three or four days for severe infestations. The soap breaks down quickly, so your lawn should be back to normal soon.You may want to check your soil pH after treatment is finished, since soap is alkaline.

, These predators are not available for purchase, but they often arrive during an infestation to feed on chinch bugs. Providing a variety of flowering plants encourages them by giving them places to hide and feed.These predators look very similar to chinch bugs. They tend to be smaller and faster, with larger eyes.If you're still seeing a lot of chinch bugs but your lawn seems healthy, you might be misidentifying this predator species.

, Ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps all feed on chinch bugs or their eggs. While they do not target chinch bugs as effectively as big-eyed bugs, they are all widely available for purchase.Beneficial nematodes (roundworms) may also help. These are proven to control grubs, though there aren’t yet studies on their effectiveness for chinch bugs. You can buy beneficial nematodes at many home and garden stores.

, A neem oil product can control chinch bugs with little effect on plants and beneficial insects. Spray on the oil during cool, humid evenings, since it can break down or burn plants in direct sunlight.Some essential oils such as rosemary, lemongrass, cinnamon, or citrus oils can also help, but have not been studied as thoroughly.Dilute about 20 drops of oil in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, then spray onto your lawn., This can kill beneficial insects and earthworms and can take weeks or months to solve the problem, so use it only as a last resort. Wear safety goggles and a dust mask to avoid irritation, and try not to create too much dust. Wash your hands after applying.Use garden-grade or food-grade DE only. Swimming pool grade DE is a more significant respiratory hazard. Non-heated DE containing less than one percent crystalline silica is the safest option.Try applying DE with a bulb applicator. This will reduce the risk of getting the dust in your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Apply DE to wet grass, as well, either after it rains or you’ve watered the lawn. This ensures that the small particles stick to the grass.

, Dry, sunny lawns are the chinch bugs' ideal home, and drought stress will make it harder for your turf to resist them.The ideal watering schedule depends on your climate and grass species, but start with 1 inch (2.5 cm) a week divided among one to three sessions.A healthy lawn receiving enough moisture should bounce back after you step on it.


Too much water can backfire and make the problem worse, especially with hair chinch bug infestations (found mostly in the northern US and Canada).If you think your lawn is too wet, delay watering until the grass edges just begin to curl.Moist conditions also encourage naturally occurring Beauveria fungus, a parasite that kills chinch bugs., Chinch bugs are not partial to shaded areas. Put up a shade cloth, or plant trees and bushes to reduce the amount of direct sunlight your lawn gets each day. If your lawn is a light-loving variety, consider shading just the most vulnerable areas: the green grass at the border of expanding yellow patches.


St. Augustine grass, the southern chinch bug's favorite food, has excellent shade tolerance. It should thrive under a 30% shade cloth., In general, grass is at its healthiest when allowed to grow to a height of 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm). This is especially true during a chinch bug infestation, since tall grass will keep the ground dark and moist — two qualities this pest dislikes. If your lawn is in particularly bad shape, you could skip mowing entirely until it recovers.To reduce stress on your grass, use a sharp lawn mower blade and remove no more than ⅓ of the grass blade each mowing., Thatch is the spongy, brown layer of organic material that forms between grass blades and soil. Chinch bugs live in thatch and hibernate in it during cold winters.Aerate your yard once or twice a year to keep thatch levels to ½"" (1.25 cm) thick or less. If the thatch is more than an inch thick (2.5 cm), cut through it with a vertical mower or dethatching rake.This is especially important in fall, to reduce areas where chinch bugs can overwinter., Chinch bugs and other sap-drinking insects thrive on plants with high levels of nitrogen.Switch to an organic slow-release fertilizer, or a fertilizer with only 5 or 10% nitrogen (N).You can probably add significantly less fertilizer than the label recommends without causing harm. Try this, and increase the amount again if the grass turns light green.

, In cold climates, chinch bugs overwinter underneath leaf litter or debris.Some of them will likely survive under the thatch even on a clear lawn, but raking up leaves is an easy way to make it harder for them.

, If the bugs are grey-brown or blackish-brown and tiny (about ⅛"" or 4 mm long), you probably have ""false chinch bugs."" These only swarm turf in the summer, after the weeds they prefer to feed on have died.To keep their numbers down, keep your lawn and surrounding areas clear of weeds in spring, especially London rocket, other mustard plants, Russian thistle, and sagebrush.False chinch bugs are most common west of the Mississippi in dry regions, but can be found throughout the United States, southern Canada, Mexico, and the West Indies., The ideal soil pH for most turf is between 6.5 and 7.0. Test your soil with a pH kit from a garden store, and get it within this range by adding lime (to raise pH) or sulfur (to lower it).Keeping pH within this range will keep your lawn healthy and able to absorb nutrients, helping it survive pest damage.


For best results, send a soil sample to a soil testing laboratory to find out the exact nutrients your soil is missing.

This may also include internet, phone, and cable. Write down each service, the name of your provider, and the telephone number. This will help ensure that you cover all of your bases, and that no utility gets mistakenly left out., When you call each company, they are going to need some information from you. In most instances, this will include some kind of account number, as well as your home address. In some cases, you may also need to provide a password, or other personal information (such as a social security number) to verify your identity. Gather this information before you call., Some companies (often internet providers, for example) require you to sign a contract at the time of installation. Before you call to cancel, it is a good idea to figure out where you stand with your contract. If you will be violating your contract, you may be charged a steep fee. If this is the case for you, look into transferring your service to your new home.

, Particularly with media services (like phone, internet, and cable) it is relatively easy to transfer your service to your new home (as long as your provider offers service in that area). If you will be in the same city or even state, your electric, water, or trash company may stay the same as well. Before you cancel your service, determine whether or not any of your accounts will qualify for a transfer. (You can do this by calling each company and inquiring). Often, they can simply use your existing deposit and personal information, making the process of moving much more smooth., You don’t want to pay for utilities that you aren’t going to use. At the same time, you don’t want to be stuck at home with no water or electricity. In other words, think carefully about the exact date you’d like your utility services to cease. You will likely need about 2-3 weeks between when you call to cancel, and the exact day you’d like your services to end, so begin thinking about this as early as possible., Moving down the list you created, contact each company one at a time, and inform them of your move. Once again, be sure to have any relevant account information or personal information ready when you call. You will want to call 2-3 weeks prior to your move., In some instances, you will need to return some equipment in order to close your account. If you have any equipment belonging to the company (such as an internet router), ask them what you should do with the equipment. If they say you must return it in person, be sure to drop it off before you move. When you do so, ask for a receipt, so there will be no dispute when it is time to receive your deposit.

, In some cases, the company may simply tell you to leave certain equipment behind. (This is sometimes the case with cable boxes, for example.) If this is the case for you, be certain to leave the equipment when you move. Consider putting it in a safe place where you know it will not be packed by mistake.

, When you call to cancel your service, you should ask the company to come out and do a final reading of your meters. (This is especially true for water and gas). This reading will provide you with final numbers before you move, so that you can be sure your last bill is accurate.You may consider taking a photo of your meters with your cell phone, this way you have some proof of your final readings in the case of a dispute.

, When you call to cancel your service, you will be asked to provide a forwarding address. This is important to do if you will be receiving a deposit, or if they will still need to send your final bill., In order for your account to be fully closed, your account balance will need to be at zero. Inquire about any outstanding balances or fees and pay these at the time of cancellation. If you will still be receiving a final bill later, be sure to pay this bill in full when you receive it., Many utility companies require the payment of a deposit at the time of activation. If you have not violated your contract, if you have returned all equipment, and if you do not have an outstanding balance, you should qualify for reimbursement of this deposit. Speak to you provider about this and be sure that they send you a check.

, Something nice that you can do for the people who will be moving into your home after you leave is to compile a list of the utility companies you used and their telephone numbers. Of course, this is not required, but it is a nice gesture and it’s easy to do., You may need to follow up with some of these companies in the future, so you will want to compile some information, important phone numbers, and possibly even your final bill. Put all of this information in a safe place that you will be able to access after the move., When you receive your final bill, check to make sure everything is accurate. Ensure that your service was terminated on the date you requested, and compare the readings on your bill with the final reading numbers you received (or photographed). If there are any inconsistencies, contact your utility company right away."

Create a plan.,
Communicate your expectations.,
Give your parents an opportunity to share their expectations.,
Discuss the house rules.,
Be flexible with your musts.,
Make a plan beyond the time spent back at your parent's place.,
Use the time wisely.",How to Survive Moving Back in with Your Parents," Before you rent the moving truck, you need to have a plan—meaning, you have to look ahead and visualize what you want it to look like during your time there. Do you want Mommy waking you up with scrambled eggs and bacon or would you prefer to wake to your alarm clock and blend a quick smoothie? If you are returning with your child, how involved do you want your parents to be in raising her? Do they have a say in his discipline? How long do you plan to stay? When will you know that it's time to leave? Asking yourself some real questions like these will help you to purposefully return to their home and prepare you to give your parents a clear picture of what to expect.;
, Now, that you have a clear image of what it looks like, you need to have a sit down with your parents. Share the highlights of your vision with them.


For example: ""I see myself staying here no more than two years."" ""I'll handle Sarah's discipline so if she's acting up, just let me know."" And so forth.

, Maybe they don't want you to have guests over after a certain time, or anticipate you'll pay room and board after your first few months. Getting these things out in the open can eliminate the inevitable tension that comes from false expectations. 

, It is also very important to discuss the house rules. It sounds weird, but it's very likely that the last time you lived in their house, you still had to follow your parents' rules. Without actually discussing it, they may naturally gravitate toward being ""in charge."" Maybe you still had a curfew or were expected to call when coming in late. To avoid any misunderstandings, it is essential to express to your parents that although you are their ""child,"" you are an adult, and that you are used to making your own rules. Together, you can decide what a respectful adult relationship looks like in their home.

, By the time you reach adulthood, you've will have somewhat of a grasp on what you like, what you don't, and what are necessities for you. Now that you're no longer the ""king"" or ""queen of your castle,"" some adjustments will likely need to be made. Maybe you enjoy silent meditation on Saturday mornings, but your mom's book club meets at her house once a month. On those days, maybe you can take a walk or plan to sit by the lake. It is also likely that your tastes differ from your parents. Rather than come into their home making changes to suit your needs, maybe you can choose to decorate your room to match your tastes and leave it at that.

, Start saving for moving on from the day you move in. Having your own place again is probably a helpful goal to keep you motivated and happy as you ""survive"" the moving back in period. Since a lack of finance is the most likely reason why you've moved back home, get budgeting advice as well, and try to stick to very strict spending rules so that you can save that rental or home deposit up for your future.

, Moving back home is an awesome opportunity to regroup and start over. See the blessing in it, not just the need to ""survive."" It's an opportunity to get to know your parents again, as an adult. It's an opportunity to use this ""safe haven"" to fix the problems that drove you there in the first place. It is also a safe place from which you can try new things in the hope of reorienting your choices in a more successful direction. If you see the blessings in the time spent back at home, you'll find it far easier to survive this transition in your life.

This is the perfect opportunity to take stock of your possessions. Have a garage sale, return the mower, give that extra dinner set to charity. Don't move your trash! It will be cumbersome and cost more to move. You will also find that there will be lots of things that can go straight to recycling or the garbage bin. Be strong!

During your dig, you will discover things that you forgot existed. You'll also find things you can't live without. Separate items into three piles:
“Throw Away Definitely”
“Can't Survive Without""

, Computers make this job neat - so print out your inventory, and place in your ""Moving Folder/Clipboard"".

, Remember - your mind will still be coping with all the everyday things like cooking, washing, cleaning, kids and you can't remember EVERYTHING, so write it down, no matter how small the job seems. As you complete them - tick them off, write notes, numbers and follow-ups. Now - place this in your ""Moving Folder/Clipboard"".

, Keep this list for future reference and moves, it will be longer than you realise. The ""Notification of New Address List"" - For clarity divide it into 'Business' and 'Personal'.

, Watch the budget for a month if possible, and don't go spending! If you buy more stuff, you're only going to have to move it again. So - put some extra aside and be prepared for unexpected costs. If you plan well they will be minimal.

Determine whether you'll need a cool-season grass or a warm-season grass.,
Take a soil test to determine the lime and fertilizer recommendations for your new lawn.,
Check the area that you intend to seed for signs of persistent, invasive weeds.",How to Seed a Lawn1," Where you live should affect which type of seed you plant in your lawn. In the United States, cool-season grass flourishes in the north, while warm-season grass flourishes in the south. A swath of between the northern and southern United States is named the ""transition zone,"" where mixes or cool- and warm-season grasses generally flourish.Cool-season grasses, which include Bentgrass, Bluegrass, Fine Fescue, Tall Fescue and Ryegrass, should be seeded mid-August through mid-October, depending on local conditions. They thrive in temperatures above 60 °F (16 °C) and lay dormant when temperatures fall in the winter.
Warm-season grasses, which include Bahia, Bermuda, Carpetgrass, Centipede, St. Augustine and Zoysia, should be seeded March through September, depending on local conditions. They thrive in temperatures above 80 °F (27 °C) and need less water, helping to make them more drought resistant.;
, A soil test will measure the amount of helpful elements in your soil (phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, etc.), as well as the pH of the soil.Your local county extension office should be able to give you instructions for administering the test.

, If any hard-to-control weeds have taken over the area, you may need to treat the soil with a non-selective herbicide to kill off the invasive weeds.


Wait a few weeks to allow the herbicide to work before continuing with soil preparation if it was necessary to use one.

On your garage sale signs, be sure to include the date(s) and time(s) of your sale, along with the kinds of items being sold.
You might want to make several signs, each with a big arrow to direct those who are interested.;
, Classified ads are especially useful for getting rid of heavy, high cost items, like tools and exercise equipment. By connecting directly with an interested buyer, you can often make back a significant amount of the item's original cost.Many local newspapers have affordable classified ads, but digital classifieds, like Craigslist or eBay Classifieds, will likely reach more people., Make sure your friends and family know that you're moving. You may have something that they want or need that you were planning on throwing away or donating.


If you notice your friends or family waffling over whether or not they'll buy something, you may want to sweeten the deal by offering a discount.

Medicine – If any one in the household has a condition that requires them to take medicine on a regular basis, always take some with you and have a spare just in case.",How to Start Your Move2," Remember some basics:


Books and Linen are heavy - pack in smaller - manageable boxes.
Use towels, cushions etc... to pack around items in heavier boxes, as well as in the bottom of each box, you'll get some cushioning, and all your linen will be packed!
LABEL BOXES CLEARLY if they are FRAGILE.
Remember how long your 'stuff' will be packed, a week? a month? longer? Bear this in mind and pack accordingly.
Have a plastic crate with lid, this is your ""last to pack - first to unpack crate"". What goes in this varies. A couple of coffee cups, a few spoons, knives, forks. A can opener, kettle, coffee, sugar etc... Remember how exhausted you will be - but the first night in your new home will at least have a few essentials at hand!

, Each person should know what their job is and what their job isn't.
, Use Marks-a-Lot or thick Sharpies so they can easily be seen from a distance.

Label boxes according to:
Weight - not in pounds, but ""heavy"",""light"",""or mid-weight""
Room - ""Bathroom"", ""Kitchen"", etc.
Fragility - ""Fragile - Glass"", ""Fragile - Electronics"", etc.
Contents - ""Billy's Toys"", ""Mom's Clothes"", etc.



, Make sure to place heavy items/boxes on the bottom and place lighter items/boxes on top.

,
Food and snacks – The last thing you want to worry about when you start unpacking is getting food for everybody. Your kit will need to include essentials, like baby formula.
First aid kit – You may be tired and the level of alertness will decrease towards the end of the move, so it’s a good idea to have some basic band aides and alcohol wipes available in case of minor cuts or bruises.
Plastic cups, dinnerware and paper towels.
Trash bags or old grocery bags – Remove the garbage right away so it does not accumulate and get in the way.

Till or dig the soil to a depth of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm).,
Mix in an organic matter such as peat if the soil is heavy.,
Allow the soil to settle and then rake it to make it level.

,
Use a rotary or drop-style spreader to get the most uniform coverage when seeding.,
Rake the area lightly to cover the seeds with soil.

,
Roll the area carefully to ensure good seed-to-soil contact and to firm the surface to protect the seed.

,
Mulch the entire area lightly.,
Water the area or roll it again to help the mulch stay in place and prevent it from blowing away.

,
Keep the surface of the soil moist for 15 to 20 days to allow the seedlings to germinate and get established.,
Water the lawn less frequently after the grass is established.",How to Seed a Lawn2," With a rake, remove any clumps of compacted dirt or roots completely.

, Good quality topsoil can also be mixed into the soil as long as it is not more than 20 percent clay.


Compost or other fertilizer can also be mixed into the soil at this point to provide essential nutrients for your lawn.

,, Pass over the lawn with the spreader several times, going in the same direction, to apply half of the grass seed. Make a second pass over the area, going at right angles to the first pass, to apply the remainder of the seed.


If not using a drop-style spreader and using your hand instead, toss the seeds from roughly two or three feet to ensure more even coverage. Shoot to cover one square foot with about 1/3 of an ounce (30 grams per square meter).

,,, Cover the surface with a layer of weed-free straw or hay, or high-quality compost. Apply the mulch lightly enough that some of the soil surface is visible through the mulch.

,, This may require light watering two to four times each day.

, Begin mowing the grass when it reaches 2 1⁄2 to 3 inches (6.4 to 7.6 cm). After the first mow, keep a routine watering schedule of 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week.

Mow the lawn lower than usual.,
Rake the existing lawn to further thin it out.,
Aerate the soil with a broad fork (preferable) or other aerating device.,
Spread compost, and then fertilizer, over the entire lawn.,
Pass over the lawn with a spreader several times to apply the seed.

,
Rake in the seed, making sure to cover all spots equally.

,
Mulch the entire area lightly using weed-free straw or hay.,
Water the area regularly in the beginning.",How to Seed a Lawn3," Go over your lawn with your trusty lawnmower, on a lower-than-usual setting. This will thin out the existing lawn and help your new seed blend in better.

, Go over the entire lawn with a rake, making sure to thin out dried-out or dead grass.

, Plunge the tines of the broad fork into the soil, pull back slightly, and then take your broad fork out of the soil.


When doing this, be careful not to disturb the structure of the soil. When aerating, you don't want to overturn the soil, just loosen it up a bit. Overturning the soil will uproot the grass and may cause the proliferation of weeds.

, Spread just enough to cover anywhere from 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of grass.

,,, Apply the mulch lightly enough that some of the soil surface is visible through the mulch.

, Once the seedlings begin to grow, water less frequently, hitting 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week.

Avoid paying for moving materials.,
Turn off unused utilities strategically.,
Throw away old and unused possessions.,
Utilize media mail for books.,
Get a deal when using movers.,
Pre-pack as much as possible when hiring movers.",How to Save Money when Moving2," Usually, you know that you're moving well in advance, so you should have plenty of time to find free boxes for your move. Ask at your local liquor store if you might have some of their used boxes. These are often sturdy and ideal for moving. Additionally, you can use soft objects, like towels and blankets, to cushion fragile items and save money on bubble wrap or packing peanuts.


Boxes, like those used for printer paper, are often thrown out at workplaces. These are a durable, free option that can save you a great deal in your move.
In many cases you should be able to find suitable boxes thrown out in bulk behind large- to mid-sized stores., You might need Internet in your old home up to the day you move out, but you might be able to save money by turning off the gas, electricity, or water early. Whatever you do, don't forget to cancel these services when you move.


Moving can be very hectic, resulting in you forgetting to cancel some monthly services. Make a complete list of all of your monthly utility payments to prevent yourself from forgetting any., Any old or unused possessions that you couldn't sell might need to be thrown away. Even if some of these items hold nostalgic value, they'll only add on to your moving expenses.The more possessions you move, the greater their weight. This can add fuel cost to your trip.
Old and unused possessions will also take up space and may cause require more trips than you'd have to make otherwise, which can drive up your gas expenses., Media mail isn't the quickest way of transporting your print media, but it is one of the most affordable. Boxes containing your print media will be extremely heavy, which often translates to a higher shipping fee.


With media mail, you can generally expect a 20 lb (9 kg) box of books to ship for under $12, before tax., In some cases, like during the busy season in spring and summer, it may be impossible to get a deal with movers. However, by moving in the off-season during fall and winter, you can save up to 30% on the movers' fee.


Before you jump at an offer, get at least three quotes from moving companies. This way you'll know the average cost better and can choose the cheapest of the three., Movers are most frequently paid by the hour. The more pre-packing you do, the quicker the movers will be able to relocate your stuff into a moving vehicle and the more money you will save.


Remember to clear obstacles from movers' paths beforehand so they can move quickly and efficiently."

Track the expenses related to the sale of your home.,
Keep a record of all moving expenses.,
Hire an accountant.,
Donate items to charity.",How to Save Money when Moving3," These can often be written off as moving expenses on your taxes. This includes things like the cost of classified ads, supply costs for advertising a garage sale, and even your realtor fee.


It's likely that you have had many receipts for expenses associated with your home's sale. Keep these in a separate folder to prevent losing them., When moving for work, you can in most cases write these expenses off as well. Moving expenses, however, are slightly different from sales expenses. Some common examples of moving expenses include things like:


Transportation and fuel
Lodging
Meals (while moving), This may seem counter intuitive, but many of the tax rules surrounding moving deductions are complex. Working with an account will ensure you apply for all deductions available to you, which could end up saving you big time.


If you can't afford an accountant, the IRS provides diagrams and explanations at the IRS homepage to help determine your possible moving deductions., Some possessions might just not sell, even though they're in decent condition. Consider donating like-new and lightly used possessions. When you do, be sure to request a donation receipt.


Donation receipts can be submitted with your taxes to get you a deduction and save you money."

Create and post fliers.",How to Start a Lawn Mowing Business," If you don't already own lawn-care equipment, you need to decide what you'll need for your business. What services do you plan to offer? Will you only need a lawnmower, or do you also plan to cut weeds, trim hedges and remove leaves?;
, How much money do you have to start your business? The equipment you purchase will need to fall within that budget.


If you find you don't have enough capital to purchase it, you can also lease equipment with fewer start-up funds, although that will cost more in the long run. Leasing equipment does have it's perks, however, since you generally get the most modern equipment that requires minimal maintenance, and the costs can be tax deductible. You might decide to lease in the short term while you raise capital to purchase at a later date.

, With about $500, you can purchase a basic push mower, a trimmer and a leaf blower. If you plan to provide additional lawn services but lack the extra capital, you can always start off with basic tools and expand once you gain capital.


If you don't have enough money to start with new equipment, you can even purchase a used lawn mower to use as you start earning money to reinvest into your business. Check online and local classified ads and yard sales.

, Visit your local city government or chamber of commerce offices to learn about applicable laws and needed licenses. Every city and state has different requirements.

, Does your state or city require you insure your business? You can purchase insurance for just about any type of business risk, as well as liability coverage. The cost will be based on the breadth and amount of coverage. Keep your budget in mind when choosing insurance, and speak with a trusted, local insurance agent.


If possible, insure yourself, your equipment and your customers. Collision, liability, and damage insurance will protect your vehicles and equipment. Business liability insurance will cover damages that may occur to your customers' properties during your gardening services.

, It's a good idea to speak with a business adviser, attorney or accountant to set up your tax structure and accounting processes. Don't forget to register your business with the IRS.

, Use office software and a printer to handle orders, correspondence and other business tasks. You can also set up accounting processes with basic office software programs, which will help you when it comes time to file taxes.

, When setting prices for your services, research what other businesses charge for similar services in similar communities. Remember that a working-class neighborhood will not be able to pay the same as customers in a more affluent neighborhood.

, You're not in business to work for free, so it's important to know the cost of doing business when determining your rates. Take into account money needed to pay for insurance, equipment and advertising, then determine how many yards you can mow each month. How much will you need to charge each potential customer to pay your costs and still make a profit?

, If you don't have an established clientele, you might offer lower, more competitive prices as you obtain your first few customers. Once you build a referral network and portfolio of references, you can price you services at more profitable rates.

, Not only will trimming edges make the lawn look more professionally mowed, it also will establish a perimeter so when you start mowing you can better see where you need to go.


Be sure to cut the grass around flower beds, trees, and any areas the mower is unable to reach at approximately the same height as you set the mower. Be careful not to damage the bark at the base of the trees, don't cut the grass too low, and definitely don't chop anyone's prized petunias.

, Be sure and mow from one edge all the way to the other before turning around. Creating zig-zags or missing spots of grass will look unprofessional.

, Different types of grass require different heights of cut for a professional appearance. Identify the type of grass before you set your mower height.

, Remember to alternate the mowing direction each time. If you don't alternate the direction you can cause excessive wear or even damage the lawn.

, What media outlets will you use to market your business? Set an advertising budget and try to stretch those dollars in the most efficient means possible. Oftentimes, your market will determine your method of advertising.


Common methods of advertising a local lawn-mowing business include Facebook pages, classified ads, mailers, phone calls, door-to-door sales, referrals from existing customers and appearances at local or community events.

, Print your company’s name on your vehicle, equipment and work clothes. Order pens, paper and calendars with your company name and make them readily visible and available to the public. Purchase business cards and pass them out wherever you go.

, Make sure to include your business name and contact information, the services your provide and your rates. Post the fliers on public bulletin boards and any other public place allowed in your city.

Understand why white clover grows to remove it properly.,
Avoid mowing your lawn to stop the spread of clover.,
Remove the entire clover plant from the ground to prevent regrowth.,
Apply a nitrogen rich fertilizer.,
Ferret out new clover as soon as new plants form.,
Cover areas of removed clover with topsoil.",How to Remove White Clover from a Lawn," To understand how to remove clover, you must understand why it is there in the first place. Clover is a natural grass that at one time covered most of the open prairie North America.


Being an edible plant, the clover was encouraged to grow in open fields to provide food for livestock.
It flourished in these areas, and subsequently spread as a weed to local lawns where it isn't as welcome.
White clover is very bad at surviving in lush lawns, and performs badly in nutrient rich soil. If there is an existing plant that is flourishing, clover will very rarely edge that plant from it’s area.
Clover prefers to fill in areas previously left bald by poorly maintained lawns and drought.
The plant reproduces by small seeds that need to land on soil before sprouting, so heavy ground cover will prevent white clover from germinating.;
, Prior to pulling your clover, do not mow your lawn.


Mowing will disperse seeds and spread the plant across your lawn.

, In order to ensure that the clover does not grow back, remove the whole plant from the ground, including its root structure.


Applying weedkiller will only work if you intend to kill all the plants in the area.
The only weed killer effective against clover is roundup, which will kill everything in the area once it is applied, including the plants that you want in your garden.

, Once all the clovers are pulled from the area, apply a nitrogen rich fertilizer to your lawn.


This will slow the growth of clover and speed the growth of your lawn.
Repeat this application process according to the fertilizer’s instructions.

, You need to remove new plants before the seeds are produced, to prevent new growth from coming back.


If you notice any clover sprouting up, make sure to remove them quickly before they spread seeds and multiply.
Because clover also spreads by creeping, you need to be diligent with removing new plants.
Backing off for a month or two will let the plant spread across your yard again.

, Replace areas badly affected by clover with new topsoil and sod to speed the removal process.


Clover can't grown well in areas where there is good coverage.
If clover is in your garden beds, remove the plant and apply a thick layer of mulch or weed guard. This will prevent new seeds from falling on the soil and propagating.

Do not step or kneel on the sod as you're installing it. Pat the sod down as you go so that it lays flat on top of the soil. Smooth out any wrinkles and loose areas so that there are no gaps between the sod and the soil. Repeat the process until the first row of sod has been laid.

, Lay rolls of sod closely next to each other so that the edges are snug but do not overlap.

",How to Roll Sod4," Avoid walking on the lawn for a week, if possible, to give the sod and soil time to settle.

, Water every other day during the second week, then twice during the third week. Make sure your lawn has 1 inch (2.54 cm) of water per week thereafter, or more during especially hot, dry periods.

, It's best to use a walk-behind mower the first time you cut the grass since the roots are still being established. Bag and remove all grass clippings.

Identify spots caused by animal urine.,
Tug firmly on the dead grass.,
Apply a lawn repair treatment.",How to Repair Spots from Pet Urine in Lawn Grass1," Dead spots in your lawn caused by animal urine will be round, and generally all in a single area of your yard. The individual spots may range in diameter from a few inches to over a foot. Dogs especially tend to habitually urinate in a single area.Animal urine is not the only agent that can cause lawn damage and dead, brown spots of grass. Various lawn diseases and insect problems can cause similar looking spots, but will need to be treated by lawn professionals.;
, Make sure to put on a pair of gardening gloves before touching the grass. In order to determine if the dead grass spot(s) are caused by an animal’s urine, you’ll need to grasp the dead grass firmly. Then give it a sharp tug; if the roots of the grass hold, it’s probably caused by urine. If you can easily pull the roots from the soil, you’re more likely dealing with a grub problem.If you suspect that you have a grub infestation in your lawn or that your lawn has a disease, contact a landscaping company or a lawn-care business for assistance.

, These products are typically applied by spraying the treatment liquid to the affected area of grass. A good lawn-repair treatment will introduce healthy enzymes and nutrients to the urine-damaged soil. This will allow the grass roots to heal, and will encourage the damaged grass to re-grow.You should be able to find a lawn-repair product, specifically designed to repair grass damaged by pet urine, at your local pet store. You may also be able to find this product at a local supermarket, or at larger home improvement stores, such as Lowe’s or Home Depot.

Keep your lawn healthy.,
Aerate well.,
Water deeply once a week.,
Check for signs of white grub infestation.,
Use milky spore.,
Use nematodes.,
Use the ""spikes of death"".,
Try a mixture of diatomaceous earth mixed with soap powder at a rate of 6 to 9 kg per 100 m2.,
Help the lawn resist the cold.,
Use commercially produced chemical formulas.",How to Remove White Grubs from Lawns," This is the best deterrent against white grubs. This means fertilizing it regularly, mulching the lawn, not mowing it too short and preferring drought tolerant species when you live in dry conditions.;
, Beetles are much more fond of compacted soil for laying their eggs; disturbed soil is less likely to attract them.

, Water to a depth of 2.5 cm / 1 inch soaking. This ensures the health and strength of your lawn.

, As the grubs eat the grass roots, the grass turns brown and wilts. The grass area will become soft and spongy and it will be easy to lift back the turf, which you should do to see the presence of the grubs.Other animals such as birds and skunks will probably be attracted to your lawn and will damage the turf lifting it to get at the grubs. It is important to try to determine the species of the grubs, as different treatments provide differing levels of effectiveness dependent on the grub type.

, This is a natural solution in granular form. Spread the granules around the lawn. The spores in the granules attack the larvae and kill them. The residual effect lasts for many years.Note, however, that this disease only affects Japanese beetle grubs and is not considered effective on other types of grubs., These can be used on certain grub species. Follow the instructions on the label when applying. Insect parasitic nematodes need careful handling and fast use as they are living beings. Some are more effective than others; do your research before purchasing., This methods is one of my favorites because it is so simple to do and good for the environment. All you need to do is to use lawn aerator shoes (that really don't work for aerating your lawn) and walk across your lawn four or five times. Aerator shoes have small spikes that are 2 inches long and about half of an inch apart. Since most of your grubs tend to live 1/2 inch to 2.5 inches below the surface of your soil and eat the roots out on your grass, walking across your lawn is a good way to control the population. These spikes are safe to use around pets and the best part is you don't have to use any pesticides to get rid of the grubs.

, Alternately, use a tablespoonful of pyrethrum dissolved in 4 L of water. Spread either one of these mixtures across the infected area of the lawn.

, Apply a potassium rich fertilizer such as seaweed over the lawn during autumn/fall. This will help to keep the lawn strong and healthy for the warmer seasons.

, Ask at your local garden center for advice on what is available. This is not recommended though, as use of chemicals has wide-ranging impacts on the healthy life in the lawn, its surrounds and on your children, family, and pets.

Remove as much of the dead grass as possible.,
Sprinkle extra fine grind limestone over the area you’ve scraped.,
Water the area lightly.,
Cover with topsoil and grass seed.,
Top with peat moss.",How to Repair Spots from Pet Urine in Lawn Grass2," You can do this by using a trowel, hoe, or small shovel to scrape the dead grass. Work on your hands and knees, and get as close to the roots as possible. While you don’t need to tear up the soil itself, try to scrape away as much of the dead blades and stems of grass as possible.You can dispose of the dead grass by burning it or throwing it in the trash.

, You can do this using the small shovel or trowel from the previous step. Coat the scraped area with a fine layer of the ground limestone.To avoid inhaling the fine limestone dust, you should wear a standard dust mask while working with the stone powder. You can purchase this at any hardware store.


You may be able to purchase extra fine grind limestone at your local hardware store also. If not, check at larger home improvement stores, such as Lowe’s or Home Depot. Finally, see if there is a landscaping company in your area, as they may be willing to sell ground limestone.

, Use a hose or sprinkler to gently water the area with the limestone, and also dampen the surrounding grass. Getting the limestone and soil wet will help the limestone reduce and neutralize the acid that the soil has absorbed from the animal’s urine. Let the limestone set for a week.Don’t create runoff from your watering. If the water overflows and the limestone begins to run to a different part of the lawn, its effect will diminish.

, Once you’ve waited a week, you can generously cover the area with a fresh layer of topsoil. Then, sprinkle the area with a few handfuls of grass seed. Don’t worry about over-seeding; you can be liberal with your use of the seeds. Use your hand to pat down the grass seed into the soil, so that they can begin to grow.After you’ve patted down the grass seeds, you can use your hose or sprinkler to soak the soil with water. Be careful not to over-water, though, in which case the seeds will flow away.
Topsoil and grass seed should both be available for purchase at your local hardware store, or at a plant nursery.

, If you’ve generously seeded the area formerly damaged by pet urine, but the grass is growing slowly, you can top the area with peat moss. This light moss will hold moisture in, and so encourage the grass seeds to sprout without drying out.You can find peat moss at a local plant nursery, or through a landscaping supply store.


If the majority of the initial grass seeds have not sprouted or died, you may need to re-seed before you put down the layer of peat moss.

Water a patch of lawn after a dog urinates on it.,
Apply baking soda to neutralize the acid.,
Teach your dog to pee in a specific area.",How to Repair Spots from Pet Urine in Lawn Grass3," If your dog—or a neighbor’s dog—has urinated on a patch of your lawn, you can reduce the damage by watering the area. Use a hose or a large watering can and pour a generous amount of water over the spot where the dog urinated. As long as you have a mature lawn, you don’t need to worry about over-watering the patch of grass.This will help by diluting the concentrated acid in the dog’s urine, and washing the urine off of the grass.

, To use this method, dissolve 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a gallon of water (you can do this in a large watering can or pitcher). Then, pour the baking soda mixture over the spot where the pet has urinated. The baking soda will neutralize the ammonia and nitrogen present in dogs’ urine, and prevent the soil from turning brown.As an added benefit, baking soda is harmless to dogs. So, if your dog walks through the baking soda-soaked grass and licks their feet, they won’t be harmed.

, If you don’t want brown dog-urine spots across your lawn, you can train your dog to only urinate in one concentrated area. You can teach your dog to pee in a single location by sticking a “pee post” in the ground. “Pee posts” are treated with pheromones and designed to attract your dog’s attention so that they urinate on the post.You can purchase a “pee post” at your local pet-supply store.
If part of your lawn is covered with stones or mulch, have your dog urinate there, since those materials won’t be harmed by the acidity.

Water the sod you wish to remove.,
Use a shovel, spade, or an edger to cut strips into the sod.,
Cut your sod in a checkerboard pattern for large scale removal.,
Pry up sod squares with a spade or pitchfork.,
Break up soil clumps with your hand or a gardening tool.",How to Remove Sod1," By adding moisture to the sod, you'll make it clumpier and easier to work with your shovel or spade. Do this by watering your unwanted sod a few days before you start removal.


If you over water, the soil may become muddy. Muddy soil is very difficult to work with a shovel. Only water your sod until the soil is moist.
Test your soil so see how much moisture is in it by sticking your shovel into the sod you wish to remove and wiggling it back and forth to make a small, narrow hole. Then gauge soil dryness with a touch test.;
, If you plan on reusing your sod somewhere else around your home or garden, prioritize using an edger. These kinds of machines will give you straight, clean cuts. Your strips of sod should be roughly 1-foot-wide (30 cm) apiece.


Sod is almost like carpet. The roots of the grass weave together to form a thin layer of greenery on the top of the soil. When cut into strips, you can roll up sod for easier handling.
Strips that are larger than one foot wide may be too cumbersome for you to handle without help, even if rolled up carpet style.
Sod is very heavy. Even if you've cut your sod into manageable segments, you may need someone's help to move it.
You only need to break through the top layer of sod with a shovel, spade, or edger to prepare your sod for removal. You don't need to dig especially deep., You can use your shovel, spade, or edger to cut additional 1-foot-wide (30 cm) parallel strips that run perpendicular to your previous cuts. After this sod is cut, it can be pulled free of the ground and disposed of.


The smaller squares of sod will be easier to handle and can be stacked in a truck, trailer, or wheelbarrow, one on top of another., The roots of the sod will still be gripping the soil beneath it. This will offer slight resistance, but you should be able to pull the sod free by pulling on it with your hand or prying it up with your shovel, spade, or pitchfork.


If you want to keep your sod in one continuous piece, use a spade or pitchfork to cut through the taproots so there is minimal resistance to your removal., In some cases, soil will cling to the roots of your sod in clumps. You can usually knock these free easily with your hand, but more stubborn soil might be removed more efficiently with a shovel or other suitable tool.


Clumps of soil might not seem like a big deal at first, but if you plan on rolling or stacking your sod, soil clumps could make your sod uneven and more difficult to transport."

Stake off the area where you wish to remove your sod.,
Wear proper safety equipment when operating your tiller.,
Till your sod.,
Refrain from over tilling.",How to Remove Sod2," Most modern tillers are motorized. A small motor powers metal blades to break up and aerate soil. This can make it easy to till more sod than you intended. Some stakes marking the boundaries for your sod removal project will prevent this from happening.


For especially long distances, or if you only have a few stakes, you could stake the corners of your project area and run string between them to outline your sod removal., The blades of your tiller can sometimes kick up dangerous debris, rocks, and plant matter. For this reason, you should wear proper protective gear, like gloves, goggles, long pants, and boots while using a mechanical tiller.


If you live in a dry region, you may kick up a great deal of dust over the course of your tilling. You may want to wear a dust mask to prevent breathing in dust., The blades of your tiller will turn over the grass while breaking up its roots and mixing it in with the soil. This can be especially good if you're turning your sod area into a garden. Mixing in organic matter, like grass or leaves, can enrich the soil with nutrients.


Follow the use and care instructions for your tiller for best results. These kinds of machines can be dangerous if used incorrectly.
Keep loose clothing and body parts, like your hands and feet, away from the blades of your tiller when it is running.
Hold your tiller firmly while it's running. The force of your blades trying to break up soil can cause your tiller to buck erratically. Losing hold of your tiller could result in damage or injury., Tilling too frequently can be harmful to the micro-organisms that live in the soil beneath your sod. If you are making a garden where you once had sod, over tilling could negatively impact the soil health of your plot.Generally, your sod will only need a single day of thorough tilling before it is ready to be used for your purposes.

Cover undesirable sod.,
Weigh down your sun blocker.,
Remove your sod, if necessary.",How to Remove Sod3," Use an opaque material that completely blocks out light, like cardboard or a tarp, to cover the area where you want to remove your sod. Depending on your climate, it may take several months before the grass dies.


If you live in a humid environment, paper products like cardboard might decay or disintegrate. If the weather report calls for rain, you may want to use a plastic tarp, instead.
Avoid using sun blockers that have had colored ink on them. This kind of ink can be harmful to the balance of your soil and surrounding plant life., Wind, animals, or other natural forces might cause your sun blocker to move out of place. To prevent this from happening, you should use heavy objects, like large stones or bricks, to hold your sun blocker in place.


Put your weights around the perimeter of your sun blocker. Even small amounts of sunlight filtering in from the edges can prolong the amount of time it takes for your sod to die of light deprivation., If you've waited long enough, your sod may be mostly decayed and require little extra effort on your part to remove. If you need the sod removed in a more timely fashion, first wait until the sod is dead. Then remove it with a shovel.


You can check whether or not the sod has died by looking under your sun blocker periodically. When the sod has turned completely brown or yellow and has no green remaining, it is dead.
Sod that is dead will not grip the soil as strongly as sod that is still living. Killing the sod first with light deprivation will make it easier to remove with a shovel or garden tools."
"
Choose a suitable herbicide to kill your sod.,
Apply your herbicide according to its directions.,
Use further herbicide applications as necessary.",How to Remove Sod4," There are specially formulated herbicides that target grass. You can find these at most home and garden stores or in the gardening section of most general retailers. Some herbicides may come in liquid form to be applied with a sprayer, while others may need to be first dissolved in water then applied to your undesirable sod.There are many different kinds of grass, and some of these may be resistant to certain grass herbicides.
If your sod is not killed by the herbicide, talk with a representative at your local home and garden store to find which herbicide will work best for you., Herbicides are basically a kind of poison, so you should be very careful when using it. Follow the directions exactly as described, and make sure it's administered safely and in the proper quantity. Using too much herbicide could be harmful to surrounding plants.


Some herbicides can be dangerous to get in your eyes. For this reason, you may want to wear googles while applying your herbicide and avoid applying it on windy days.
Avoid applying herbicide if there is rain in the forecast. Rain can wash herbicides into the water or surrounding ecosystem and cause damage., Some kinds of sod will be more resistant than others. It may take several applications of herbicide before you achieve the results you desire, or if you have aggressively growing sod, you may have to apply your herbicide annually."

Ensure that the lawn is well fertilized.,
Mulch the lawn after removal of crabgrass.,
Consider using corn gluten meal.",How to Remove Crabgrass from Lawns," Aim to do this prior to the seeds appearing; once the seeds appear, it will spread rapidly. It is a good idea to get into the habit of walking around after the weekly watering to check for crabgrass and pull it out while the soil is still moist. Dispose of the weed in the bin or burn it rather than composting. This will avoid spread of any seeds.;
, This requires a deft hand, however, because if you water any of the grass you want to keep, it will also die.

, Water deeply and not too frequently. A lawn without adequate watering is weaker and the drier environment lets crabgrass take over. Water once a week and allow the lawn to soak up 2.5 cm / 1 inch of water. The best time to water is early morning.

, Higher lawns let in less sunlight, removing the optimal growing conditions for an annual grass such as crabgrass.Never cut more than a third of a grass plant at a time.

, Fertilize regularly. The best way is to use a slow-release, granular fertilizer. Alternately, consider using a top dressing of organic material such as compost, kelp, bone, or blood meal.

, This is especially important to fill any gaps left from pulling out the crabgrass. Leave grass clippings on the lawn post mowing. This returns nutrients to the soil, saves you picking them up and you can reduce the use of fertilizer by 30 percent. Mulching helps ensure that crabgrass roots cannot take hold again., This will interfere with the development of the root system of crabgrass. It should be sown during the early months of spring and the lawn should be allowed to dry out between weekly waterings for this to work successfully (crabgrass is shallow rooted and needs water to keep its hold).

Troubleshoot common issues.",How to Relay a Lawn," You want to make sure you lay down your new lawn on a hospitable surface. Walk across your lawn and pull up any weeds you see. If you notice any rocks, stones, or other obstructions, remove them as well.It's a good idea to wear thick gardening gloves during this process to protect your hands.;
, If your lawn has any uneven places where the soil levels are low or dip down, you will need to apply new topsoil. You can purchase topsoil online or at a local greenhouse.To apply new topsoil, start at the furthest part of the lawn. Cut open a bag and place it in a wheelbarrow. Run the wheelbarrow over your lawn, gradually releasing topsoil on the barer areas.Topsoil generally comes in large bags. Do not stack bags on top of one another, as this can cause topsoil to spill out too fast.

, After applying new topsoil, your lawn will likely be a little uneven. To fix this issue, start by simply walking across your lawn in varying directions until the soil begins to even out. After the soil is relatively even, take a rake and run it through all portions of your lawn to get the soil on a nice, even level. As with walking, rake the soil several times and in varying directions to allow it to level out., You can purchase fertilizer at a local greenhouse or online. Go for a general purpose fertilizer, which should be safe for most soil types. Usually, you apply 70 grams of fertilizer per square foot (2 ounces per square yard).The 70 grams/2 ounces is a general estimate. While it may be true for many all purpose fertilizers, rates can sometimes vary. Do not apply your fertilizer without checking the bag first for precise measurements.

, If you do not know how big your lawn is, use a measuring tape to measure it so you know it's dimensions. When purchasing turf, purchase enough turf to cover your lawn.


You may want to purchase a little extra turf, just in case any pieces get damaged.

, When buying turf, choose a buyer who can deliver straight to your door. Quality turf should come from raised seed and be drought-tolerant.Turf comes in different varieties, so pick a turf type that works for you. If you just use your lawn for day-to-day activities, go for domestic turf. However, if you show your lawn as part of landscaping competitions, go for fine turf.
Find a buyer with a good reputation by reading reviews online. If you know anyone who does a lot of gardening or lawn work, you can ask them for a recommendation.

, Find a straight edge in your lawn, such as near the edge of your house, to lay down your first piece of turf. Place the first piece of turf in the corner where you're starting and very slowly unroll it., After laying down your first piece, you want to create a line running across your lawn. To do so, lay down one piece of turf at a time until you reach the edge of your lawn. Make sure to lay each new piece close to the piece behind it so there are no gaps in your line. Continue laying down turf in this fashion until you reach the edge of your lawn or property line., Lay down the second line in the same fashion you laid down your first. Your second line should be right next to your first line. The pieces of turf in the second line should be pushed right up against the turf in the first line. You do not want any bare gaps of soil in your lawn., Keep laying down additional lines of turf until your lawn is covered. Keep gaps between sections of turf small to prevent bare patches in your lawn.Not all your lines will include the same amount of turf, especially if your lawn is not an even square shape. Expect to have to use more or less turf on different portions of your lawn.
Do not water the turf after laying it down. Avoid tampering with new turf for the first three weeks it's in place.

, After your lawn is fully covered in grass, trim the turf pieces in the corners into half-moon shapes. Then, scoop up a few handfuls of soil. Place handfuls of soil underneath all the turf pieces on the edge of your lawn. This prevents the turf from drying out., For the first three weeks, avoid walking on your lawn. Only step on the turf if it's absolutely necessary. It's important to give your turf two to three weeks for the roots to set into the lawn., During the summer months, water your lawn every five to 10 days. During other months, water the lawn every 14 days if the weather becomes dry., Do not mow your turf right away. Wait until the blades are 2 inches (5 centimeters) high to start mowing. When you do mow the lawn, set the blades on your mower high., After laying down your new lawn, you may run into common problems. Certain areas may not be thriving or you may notice pests infecting your lawn. If you notice any issues, take steps to address them promptly.If any areas of your lawn are not growing, do a soil test. You can purchase a soil test at a local greenhouse. If your lawn's soil levels are too basic or acidic, you may have to add an appropriate plant-based compound to treat the issue.
If you notice pests, choose a safe pesticide to apply to your lawn. Preventative pesticides are usually applied in the spring, while curative ones are applied in the fall. If you're worried about chemicals, there are many organic options on the market.
If the grass in shady areas is not thriving, trim the surrounding trees and bushes. This will provide your grass with access to the sun.

Test to see if compaction is the problem.,
Use a rake to clean the bald spots.,
Dig over the soil in the bare patch to loosen it.,
Apply the lime on the cleaned up areas.,
Cover the area with thin amount of grass seed.,
Sprinkle a layer of topsoil or add a layer of straw over the grass seed, barely covering it so you still see some of the seeds.,

Turn on the sprinklers or water the area thoroughly.,
Take some runners from a healthy part of the lawn.,
Fence off the repaired patch.,
Consider other options.",How to Repair a Bare Patch of Lawn," Stamp your foot hard onto the soil of the patch. If it feels hard on contact, you have a problem with compaction. This means that you will need to consider what is causing the compaction so that it does not reoccur after mending the bare patch.;
, Remove the dried up grasses. Clean up all the spots where the grass is already dried.

, This is best done with a garden fork.

, You can use as much lime as you want. The lime will help bring the acid level down so the grass can grow. Lime is safe to use as it will not burn the grass.

, Don’t use too much grass seed. Make sure that you are using the right type of grass seed for the region you are in.


If you’ve spread a little too much of the seed, just even it out by mixing with the soil.

, Covering the seeds with a little amount of soil or a layer of straw will help hold moisture and warmth and also protect the seeds from being eaten by birds.

, Water daily and keep people and animal from getting into the area while the grass germinates and starts to grow., Plant these into the dug-up soil of the bare patch. Keep well watered once you've shifted the runners into place.

, People and any heavy animals such as horses need to be kept off the repaired patch. Leave the roping off for a while to give the patch time to recover. Continue to keep it well watered but don't fertilise it.

, Here are some thoughts on what else will allow for recovery:


If the problem is high traffic, it is likely that the bare patch will return whatever you do. This means that you will need to consider ways to reroute foot traffic or use objects such as stepping stones to concentrate the foot traffic to one spot only and to discourage stepping on the lawn itself.
If shade is the problem, select a shade-happy variety of lawn unless the shade is constant and always cold, in which case, you might consider paving the area instead, as no lawn likes constant shade.
If it is poultry, create an area of the garden just for them, to keep them from tearing up the lawn to get at grubs and make dust baths. And if Fido keeps lying on the same spot, rubbing in the dirt, it's time to shift Fido to his own spot in the yard too.
If it is lawn grubs, treat the problem and have them removed. There are non-chemical possibilities; ask at an informed garden centre about the options.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, and allow them to air dry completely before inserting the cushion back inside. If the fabric is not removable, you'll have to try another method., Make sure the upholstery or cushions have been thoroughly spot-cleaned with dish soap or laundry detergent and warm water using a soft brush, but avoid using harsh chemicals. Scrub the fabric in every area, and let the soap sink in to the cushion. You can also try tossing your cushions into a power washer if possible., It's best to rinse the cushions with a hose to dilute the chemicals. If you can't use a hose, soak a towel in water and use the damp towel to rinse the fabric., After washing, make sure that the upholstery dries completely. Wet or damp upholstery may interfere and reduce the effectiveness of protection. Furthermore, if the upholstery does not dry completely, there is a good chance that it will develop mildew.

, When the upholstery is dry, spray a fabric protector all over the entire surface to protect from discoloration. You can find fabric protectors at most stores that sell cleaning supplies. Be sure to check the can or bottle to make sure that the fabric protector will not damage or discolor your furniture.Reapply the fabric protector at the start of every season to minimize upholstery damage.

, If you must leave the furniture outside, make sure the wind doesn't blow your cushions away. An easy way to keep your cushions in place is to strap them to the furniture with Velcro., Make sure your cushions are dry before placing them into plastic storage bags, to ensure no mildew builds up over time. Store your cushions in a cool, dry place such as the basement, away from humid areas., Take off any upholstery or cushions before washing the wood with soapy water. Make sure that your furniture is in good condition before you go through the effort of protecting it, or else you may find that your efforts were wasted in light of internal rot and decay., Take your scrub brush and soak it in a water and dishwasher detergent solution. Scrub the wood going in the direction of the grain. Let the wood dry thoroughly, and sand and rough spots going in the direction of the wood., Apply a furniture protector using a paint brush to every area of the frame. Protection against the elements is important if you want to prolong the life of your furniture., Paint is the best way to protect wooden furniture from the elements because the pigments in paint offer a good degree of protection against the sun's UV radiation. Some forms of paint can even protect against heat and water. However, paint on outdoor furniture tends to chip and peel when used regularly, so you will need to reapply the paint once or twice every year.Another method is to sand it, then apply an oil or stain to protect the wood.

, This will prolong the aesthetic beauty of your furniture, especially if you have a lot of wooden furniture. Water repellents help prevent water from soaking into your furniture, and they also quicken the evaporation of moisture from within the wood. This reduces the chance that your furniture will warp, weaken, or rot.


Keep in mind that stain and water repellents typically need to be reapplied every 2 to 3 years for maximum protection.
When choosing a repellent, avoid repellents with high oil percentages. High amounts of oil will promote the sticking of particles to your furniture, which can detract from their appearance.

, Wood and metal furniture should be scrubbed and wiped down with a sponge using a cleaning solution that is designed specifically for your furniture's material. Remove any tough stains with a toothbrush., Metal is prone to rust stains which should be carefully removed with a wire brush. You can also use the wire wheel attachment that comes with your power drill. Scrape the rust away making sure not to scratch off any design that comes with the furniture., Hose off the metal or wipe in down with a water-soaked towel ensuring no soap or rust is leftover. Let the metal dry completely before applying your protective coating.

, Purchase a container of outdoor furniture protector, which is applied directly to the furniture's frame, and apply it with a paintbrush. This will minimize the impact of heat and UV radiation. When applying, be sure to be in a well-ventilated area, and wear rubber gloves and a mask.

, You'll want to avoid having furniture bumping into another piece of furniture or any other obstacles that might be in the way in order to avoid chipping the metal. Lift the furniture off the ground when you transfer it. You will probably need more than one person for this job. Make sure that there's nothing surrounding your outdoor sofas, chairs and tables that won't fall or bump into them., Clean your wicker furniture by scrubbing it with a sponge or rag that's been dipped in soap and water. Rinse the wicker with a hose., When damp, wicker is easier to bend and move. If your wicker has any pieces sticking out, you can put them back into place while you're cleaning.

, You can protect your wicker furniture by using a paint brush to apply wax, varnish, lacquer or shellac. After your furniture is dry, apply a thin layer of paste wax on your wicker furniture to make it shine., Before you invest in a furniture cover, you'll need to have its correct dimensions. Measure the height, width and length of your outdoor sofas, chairs and tables to ensure that you purchase the correct size., Covering your tables, chairs, benches and other outdoor furniture with a protective furniture cover can protect your furniture from water damage and UV radiation. Make sure you choose a vented furniture cover so that moisture doesn't build up and create mildew., Stack your chairs and tables, one on top of the other, if their structure allows it. This method will save you space, and you can cloak the whole lot of them under one furniture cover., If possible, store your outdoor furniture in a shed or a garage when not in use, especially during the winter months. Keeping your furniture in a dry location will reduce the amount of exposure to sun, weather, and temperature. There's no better way to protect the metal, wood, fabric and other materials from damage.Place your furniture on top of wooden boards so the bottom doesn't get dirty.
You can also make use of your outdoor furniture by using it as indoor furniture during winter.

Deal with it.",How to Prevent Algae in Rain Barrels," This is the easiest method. Regular use and/or draining of the barrel will snuff out any possible algae growth. So, use your barrel regularly. If you're going to be gone for an extended period, then drain the barrel!
, The EPA gives guidance on how to use bleach to disinfect drinking water.The EPA states, ""Add 1⁄8 teaspoon (or 8 drops) of regular, unscented, liquid household bleach for each gallon of water, stir it well and let it stand for 30 minutes before you use it. Store disinfected water in clean containers with covers."" Bleach will keep the algae at bay., Keeping the sun out of the barrel will stifle the algae growth.Use paints recommended for plastics or metals, depending on the type of barrel or cistern you have.If you are using a wood barrel, the algae is not likely to be an issue, but you can use an oil coating on the outside such as linseed or tung oil., Simple enough. The shadier the location of your barrel the less algae growth that will occur. Consider growing plants on top of or near the rain barrel to provide additional shade., There's nothing wrong with a little algae in the barrel. If it can grow, then at least you know the water doesn't kill plant life. That's typically important for a rain barrel's contents. So, you can always just deal with it and clean it at the end of the season."
